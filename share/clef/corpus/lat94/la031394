A MECCA FOR MEXICO; BECOMING MEXICAN AMERICAN: ETHNICITY, CULTURE AND IDENTITY 
IN CHICANO LOS ANGELES, 1900-1945, BY GEORGE SANCHEZ (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: 
$35; 367 PP.)

University, is author of Drink Cultura-Chicanismo (Joshua Odell Editions,

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the spring of 1911, my father walked down a dusty street in Ciudad Juarez, 
Mexico, to get his first photograph taken. Soon, he found himself dodging 
bullets: Pancho Villa and his revolutionaries were commandeering the town. My 
father safely reached the photo studio, but he never forgave Pancho Villa. 
After he had witnessed Villa carry out one too many executions, he left town to 
hide in arroyos from both bandits and real coyotes. For a time, he tried his 
hand at goat herding; then, he headed north to California. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, in San Jose de los Guajes, Jalisco, my father-in-law, Bernardino 
Preciado, packed a team of mules with crops for the Guadalajara market. Born in 
1898, Don Bernardino had witnessed the Mexican Revolution, countless executions 
and rivers running red with the blood of men and horses. Don Bernardino was 
assaulted several times by federales or revolucionarios who took his profits 
and produce. The last time, he was nearly lynched for hiding his money and then 
lying about it. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing his bride to a stampeding horse, he decided to leave. With his 
friend Jesus Villasenor and others, he boarded a train in Guadalajara to El 
Paso for the proverbial journey to Los Angeles, forever the mecca of Mexican 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles Bernardino met Rebeca Jimenez. Originally from Guadalajara, 
Rebeca had been orphaned and sent to Los Angeles to live with maiden aunts. I 
have heard her recall vividly how she labored as a young women in the sweat 
factories of L.A.'s garment district. In 1931, Bernardino and Rebeca were 
married at the mission church in front of La Placita. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Preciados are not mentioned in George J. Sanchez's monumental 
history, their lives span the years of trial and triumph that he chronicles so 
magisterially. While retrofitted with research notes to meet the demands of 
academia (Sanchez is an associate professor of history at UCLA), "Becoming 
Mexican American" also is inviting reading. Its human, compassionate voice both 
confirms and contradicts established history. 
</P>
<P>
 Synthesizing facts and anecdotes garnered from Mexican, American and Latino 
sources, Sanchez erects a unique bridge between Euro-American and Mexican 
historical perspectives. While Carey McWilliams' "North of Mexico" and Rudolfo 
Acuna's "Occupied America" will remain classics for their correct historical 
revisionism, Sanchez's book distinguishes itself by focusing on one city, with 
the community of Belvedere (just east of Boyle Heights) as its center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez begins with the Mexican presence in Los Angeles before the Yankees 
took over in 1847. Unlike other American immigrants, most Mexicanos see 
themselves as returning to a land where their ancestors once lived. Their blood 
lines and cultural ties never were severed. Mexico, in short, never left Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, when Don Bernardino arrived in downtown L.A.'s Old Plaza, Pacific 
Electric's train tracks covered over 1,000 miles from San Fernando to Riverside 
and Newport Beach. Jobs were plentiful in the sun-kissed orchards, where he 
found a job on his second day in town. In three months he landed a better job 
at a tile factory. Bernardino takes pride in having built some of the tile that 
now adorns the Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez jars our memory with long-forgotten facts and figures. Between 1890 
and 1930, L.A.'s population exploded from 50,000 to 1.2 million. Latinos living 
around the downtown Los Angeles Plaza -- which lacked developed water and sewer 
systems -- were hardest hit by the population surge. In 1924, an outbreak of 
Bubonic Plague in the Plaza forced the city to reform those systems. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1920s, the U.S. government began a program designed to assimilate 
the immigrant. By 1909, professor Ellwood P. Cubberly of Stanford University 
had already called for a "break up of these groups . . . to implant in their 
children . . . the Anglo-Saxon conception of righteousness, law and order. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Well-meaning but naive women visited Mexican American homes, teaching people 
to eat bread instead of tortillas: "Bad diets," they argued, "led to stealing 
lunches and laziness." 
</P>
<P>
 The early 1930s were an ambivalent time for both Mexicans and Mexican 
Americans. Sixty-three years before Governor Pete Wilson suggested that illegal 
immigrants have contributed to our state's economic malaise, Herbert Hoover 
denounced Mexicans as the main cause for the Depression. Discrimination was 
legislated through the Alien Labor Act of 1931. Sanchez profiles many, 
including a former Army sergeant, who recall being denied work because of their 
skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 Most poignant is Sanchez's chapter on the "Repatriation" program. Sanctioned 
and supported by both Mexico and the United States, more than half a million 
Mexicans and U.S.-born Mexican Americans were either voluntarily or forcefully 
deported to Mexico with false promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez describes how the only Mexican-American student at Occidental College, 
dressed in a mariachi outfit, sang "Las Golondrinas," a painful farewell song, 
to serenade the departing Latino community. It is a reminder of how Latinos 
have stood up for their documented and undocumented cousins when Mexico and the 
U.S. looked the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, "repatriated" Mexicanos and Latinos found no housing or jobs for 
their U.S.-honed skills. The young were disliked in Mexico. Many tried to 
return to their American homes, but without documents their crossings became 
covert. San Jose State professor emeritus Jorge Acevedo, a Latino Baptist 
minister, helped smuggle many Mexicanos and Latinos back into the United 
States. He believes it was this generation that learned communal survival 
skills and gave birth to the Pachucos, the first Latinos to rebel and establish 
their own self-identity. 
</P>
<P>
 My father-in-law, Don Bernardino, was spared repatriation due to his stable 
job, blond hair and blue eyes. By the early '30s, he and Rebeca had saved 
enough to purchase a farm in Chino and a few dairy cows. In Chino he helped 
build a Church to Our Lady of Guadalupe and despite religious differences, 
Ignacio Lopez, Bert Corona and his sister Aurora Corona Mirkin also helped. 
They were all friends with Ernesto Galarza, another great Mexican-American 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez uncovers one of the true unsung heroes in Mexican-American history. 
Luisa Moreno, a Guatemalan immigrant, was a union organizer of heroic 
dimensions throughout the Southwest. During the McCarthy era, however, she was 
deported back to Guatemala, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Hoover, President Franklin Roosevelt was a hero to Mexican Americans. 
His democratic reforms strengthened the Mexican American community. It was the 
community as much as the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee in 1942 that absolved 
a group of Mexican Americans from a murder charge. Among them was a young 
Mexican Hollywood actor named Anthony Quinn. A new Mexican American generation 
had begun to claim its rightful place in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 70 years after his 1924 arrival, 95-year-old Don Bernardino and his 
wife Rebeca celebrate 63 years of marriage and three children. After growing to 
possess 600 cows, their dairy farm was eventually sold. Their oldest son, 
Rafael, served in the Korean War and then as a Chino city councilman and 
businessman. Rosa, their youngest, is a psychology professor at Mt. San Antonio 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia became one of the most respected Chicano administrators in higher 
education, serving on various national boards. Now at Stanford University, she 
is married to this writer. All of us are children of a former peasant muleteer, 
a goat herder and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Becoming Mexican American" vividly confirms the messages of old Mexican 
corridos (popular songs) scratched on 78 r.p.m. records and Latino poems and 
novels about leaving home, missing grandparents, embracing revolutions and 
love. A consummate scholar and masterful storyteller, Sanchez rediscovers the 
missing threads and restores the vibrant colors in the fabric of Los Angeles 
history.

DEADLY FIX; LETHAL PASSAGE: HOW THE TRAVELS OF A SINGLE HANDGUN EXPOSE THE 
ROOTS OF AMERICA'S GUN CRISIS, BY ERIK LARSON (CROWN: $20; 288 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Vachss, Andrew Vachss is a lawyer who writes extensively on crime and 
violence. His latest novel, Down in the Zero, will be published this fall by 
Knopf. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Lethal Passage," Erik Larson aims the journalist's most potent weapon -- 
an assembly of unadorned facts compelling rational conclusions -- at those 
America citizens who remain "unaligned" in the endlessly raging debate about 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Bull's-eye! 
</P>
<P>
 Using the device of tracing a single handgun from conception to manufacture to 
distribution to retail sale, Larson clearly illustrates the frightening ease 
with which weaponry of mass-murder capability can be acquired. Nicholas Elliot 
hardly qualified as a criminal mastermind. Sixteen years old, with a "mental 
age of 12 or 13" and suffering from both dyslexia and a "schizoid personality 
disorder," Nicholas came to school one day with a Cobray M-11/9, a cheap 
semiautomatic pistol capable of firing 32 rounds on a single clip. He was 
seeking a larger boy who had tormented and bullied him for some time. On his 
way to his intended target, one teacher was killed and another severely 
wounded. Had the pistol not malfunctioned, the potential body count is too 
terrifying to calculate -- Nicholas was carrying six full clips plus hundreds 
of additional rounds in ammo boxes, including some he had modified to create 
"dumdum" and "hollow point" effects. 
</P>
<P>
 For too many Americans, homicide is a problem solver. The sociopath for whom 
humans arouse no more empathy than the characters in a video game has two main 
consumer demands: firepower and the look -- that all-important air of menace. 
Accuracy is of no consequence to the urban punk killing machine -- his shooting 
style is "spray and pray." 
</P>
<P>
 American teen-agers know this -- and arm themselves accordingly -- to such an 
extent that many schools would sooner dispense with textbooks than metal 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The message -- that guns "fix" things -- pervades our culture. From stalkers 
to schizophrenics, from the paranoid to the pursued, from the frightened to the 
fascinated, guns dominate consciousness and dictate behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson takes us past the absurd myths (one can "count the shots" during a 
firefight), past the numbing statistics (every year handguns alone account for 
22,000 deaths), past the rhetoric and into the face of the reality -- the 
American public is armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism at its highest form is "investigative art." "Lethal Passage" 
qualifies. Neither "gun nut" nor "anti-gun," the author uses a highly 
accessible style to illuminate the path that led us to the current situation. 
Guns may be a religious experience for some, but for those who manufacture 
them, they are a product -- a product to be marketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The domestic gun industry, despite its privileged status as the least 
regulated of consumer-product industries, sold so many guns in America it 
saturated the market and now must scramble for ways to open new markets." 
</P>
<P>
 And the marketers have been so successful that even the language of guns is 
loaded. One detective summed up Nicholas Elliot's mobile arsenal by saying the 
teen-ager was "ready for war." Hardly an accurate description -- in wars, 
people shoot back. But "combat" is a much more acceptable raison d'etre for 
handguns than "slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Expecting profiteers to self-regulate is absurd. The author, after pointing 
out that we have "child-safe" requirements for bottles of vitamins but not for 
guns tells us: "Buying a gun should be the most difficult consumer ritual in 
America, instead of one of the easiest." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the blame is ascribed to "historians" whose purple prose made heroes 
of career criminals and assorted psychopaths. "Strip away the legends 
enshrouding the famous outlaws and what you find are pathological killers," the 
author writes. I must have missed something -- is that supposed to have 
changed? 
</P>
<P>
 But the real culprit is not criminals lusting after weapons, it is a 
combination of National Rifle Assn. (NRA) "fundamentalists" who hold the right 
to own guns so sacred that it must never be subservient to mere species 
survival . . . and a cowardly Congress, which gives lip service to crime 
prevention but will not even protect its own law enforcement officers from the 
deluge of guns available for the asking. 
</P>
<P>
 The word fundamentalist is well-chosen. NRA extremists view the "right to bear 
arms" with the same ferocity the Anti-Choice zealots view in utero "life." As 
Larson points out, the mainstream NRA member is not opposed to handgun 
registration -- in fact, the majority favors such laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the NRA leadership moves further away from a centrist position, 
continuing to alienate law enforcement as well as virtually everyone concerned 
with the safety of our citizens, how does it maintain its political clout? The 
answer is both simple and depressing -- politicians don't conduct plebiscites, 
they simply react to "leadership." And that leadership's hostility to 
regulation in any form implies a promise to deliver a massive voting bloc on a 
moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more media-savvy than their opponents, the pro-gun lobby operates on all 
levels, from "screen credits" for specific weapons used in movies to production 
of NRA "educational" films. One such film featured a Congressman proclaiming: 
"If I were to select a jackbooted group of fascists who are perhaps as large a 
danger to American society as I could pick today, I would pick ATF (Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the agency which enforces laws relating to 
firearms)." 
</P>
<P>
 Larson responds, "Gun aficionados may liken the (ATF) to the Gestapo, but in 
its relationship to America's gun dealers, it behaves more like an indulgent 
parent." After repeated attacks by the NRA, the ATF has become "gun-shy," and 
is reluctant to assume the sort of proactive stance that could prevent crime 
(as opposed to merely documenting it). 
</P>
<P>
 How easy is it to obtain handguns in the United States? To become a "dealer," 
entitling you to buy and sell guns, you need a Federal Firearms License. "In 
1990, 34,336 red-blooded Americans applied for an FFL. ATF denied license to 
only 75." 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise. After all, the ATF requires prospective gun purchasers to answer 
all of eight questions about their background and mental health -- public 
protection being predicated on the concept that felons will tell the truth and 
lunatics will self-diagnose. 
</P>
<P>
 The author shows us not only the marketing of guns, but the "after-market" as 
well. That shadow-land includes, for example, so-called "cop-killer" bullets 
specifically designed to penetrate the "bullet-proof" vests worn by law 
enforcement. The accompanying "advertising" claims citizens need such 
ammunition because some criminals are now wearing those same vests. Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 And out on the border where the First Amendment meets the Second, there are 
how-to books on assassination, bomb manufacturing and the construction of 
silencers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Amendment of "right to bear arms" fame, is, of course, biblical -- 
that is, it may be quoted for virtually any purpose. The author takes a 
journalist's view: "All the noise and dust generated by the debate over the 
true meaning of the Second Amendment obscures a fundamental question: Who 
cares?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chain saws don't cut down trees -- but they make it so much easier. It takes a 
different mindset to kill up close -- ask any maximum-security convict. And 
when was the last time that horrifying symbol of the '90s -- the armed 
"disgruntled employee" -- committed mass murder with a knife? 
</P>
<P>
 The simple purchase of a gun without specialized training makes as much sense 
as taking a few karate lessons and pronouncing yourself a master of 
self-defense. No rational person could argue against a proficiency test for gun 
ownership. Nor against the registration, by unduplicatable serial number, of 
every handgun purchased. But for the NRA, any regulation is a step toward 
abolition. 
</P>
<P>
 That perception may, in fact, be closer to the truth than anyone realizes. An 
editorial in Australia's largest newspaper, the Sydney Herald, illustrates not 
only that the world is watching closely, but that even the slightest step 
forward will be seen as laudable progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "With difficulty, the so-called Brady Bill has become law in the United 
States. . . . The new law does nothing about the 200 million guns already in 
circulation . . . and will be easily circumvented. But it is a symbolic first 
step that, if followed up by more serious measures, will represent as 
significant a social reform as any that President Clinton is likely to bring 
about." (From the Sydney Morning Herald, as quoted in World Press Review, 
February, 1994) 
</P>
<P>
 Because the NRA's power is not in its numbers but in the perception that such 
numbers are a single-minded voting constituency, any crack in the armor is 
likely to reveal the truth. To some extent, this perception is even shared by 
the author, who, as the book's centerpiece, proposes the "Life and Liberty 
Preservation Act," an omnibus law focusing on control of distribution, purchase 
and design of handguns, but concludes the act "doesn't have a chance in hell of 
being passed" because "(e)ven those of us who favor strong regulation lack the 
conviction of those who oppose such laws." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lethal Passage" charges that a passive minority has allowed a dedicated 
minority to determine gun control policy in America. If that charge is valid -- 
and all the evidence indicates that it is -- our choices are both very limited 
and very clear: We can actively demand fundamental changes in gun control laws 
. . . or we can passively continue to count the bodies.

FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER; PLATTE RIVER, BY RICK BASS (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN/SEYMOUR 
LAWRENCE: $19.95; 145 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Tilghman, Christopher Tilghman, author of In a Father's Place, a 
collection of stories, is working on a novel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who admire Rick Bass' resplendent 1989 story collection, "The Watch," 
as well as his several intervening nonfiction books on what the publishers call 
"the outdoors," have been looking forward to his new book of fiction with 
unusual interest. Some may be gunning for him, a writer who makes his 
reputation all too easily with a single book, but most of us are simply eager. 
We want to see where Bass' jumpy, oddly lyrical voice -- a voice entirely his 
own -- takes him a year or two down the road; we want to see if he's getting 
deeper to the truths of his slightly fractured sense of reality, whatever those 
truths may be. We want to see if he's still putting it all on the line, risking 
all, every time he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Platte River," a collection of three long stories, has now arrived, and it's 
a fine book; it is a strong, visual, American book, enlivened by an unstudied 
masculine sensibility that this male reader, for one, finds distinctly 
refreshing. The title story is stunning; in my view, it's the best single piece 
Bass has written to date, more plainly and empathetically told than most of his 
work, a very moving story about an old football player named Harley (how's that 
for maleness?). 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the larger questions about Bass' career and the direction of his 
thinking remain unanswered in this book. Huge themes -- the wilderness, 
purification and redemption, the use of sacrament -- are planted all through 
these stories, but at this point Rick Bass still seems to be sowing more than 
he is reaping. His argument with the world can feel a little incoherent. He's 
got plenty of time, and he's given us a thoroughly enjoyable evening of 
reading, but under the smooth flow of his marvelous prose, "Platte River" 
sometimes loses its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the large themes are put in play by the opening story, "Mahatma Joe." 
Mahatma Joe Krag is a churlish old evangelist, who came to a remote valley in 
Montana years ago looking for converts. Though he failed totally in his primary 
mission, he has remained in this little Eden largely to take the fun out of 
life for everyone else. Bass is wonderful about the valley, "a park, green and 
forever," and about the vivid assortment of types and pilgrims that it 
attracts. Mahatma Joe, one of those types, is nevertheless determined to wreck 
it: "He wanted the town to have rules, ever more rules"; he writes venomous 
letters and drafts ordinances, imagining the valley as "a new place to get it 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 With his lyrical sense of place and his fierce protectiveness of the wild, 
Bass is on home ground here. The conflict, with all its comedies and magical 
turns, is nicely conceived. But I have to say that as the story evolves, I 
don't know who or what is winning the battle. Joe's final dizzy project, 
carried out in moonlight, is to plant vegetable gardens on some of the valley's 
creek banks. "What was once a meadow was now a cultivated garden, ordered and 
perfect," the narrator tells us, but is this more rule making, or has Joe's 
mission been finally subverted by the rich soil of the valley? 
</P>
<P>
 What the story lacks is the focused passion of Bass' splendidly raw essay on 
many of the same themes, "The Ninemile Wolves." There's also a large serving of 
theological images here -- baptism, Calvary -- but no examination of what they 
mean for either the faithful or the faithless. Instead, "Mahatma Joe" ends, for 
me, in confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Vastly more successful are the other two stories, "Field Events" and "Platte 
River." The former opens with a black-bearded giant of a man emerging 
primevally from a frigid river, while two hulking and athletic brothers spy 
from behind the protection of a boulder. The giant, named A.C. (the initials 
could stand for a lot of things, but I like Allis Chalmers) happens to be 
swimming naked, miles upstream to his house, with the painter of a canoe in his 
teeth. The brothers, high school track and field stars, decide, wonderfully, 
that A.C. is the discus thrower of their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Field Events" turns into a lovely fable about vigor and youth. "So young! So 
young!" exclaims the narrator about these boys, the brothers and A.C., and 
about the sister, Lory, whom A.C. falls in love with. Through one year A.C. 
trains at the discus, and he throws farther and farther, as if finally, to give 
it one last toss around the circumference of the earth. "That's over 
126,720,000 feet," one of the brothers exclaims. "How far'd you throw today, 
A.C.?" 
</P>
<P>
 From the water came A.C., and to the water he returns. "In the spring . . . 
after the snows melted and the rivers began to warm . . . he began to swim 
again, but with Lory this year." Water -- cold spring run-off water -- has 
mystical qualities for Bass, and here he is quite certain of himself. It's a 
motif from "Mahatma Joe," and from "Platte River," being lost and drowned, a 
sinner, then swimming for the air; being purified by the shock of icy water; 
finding answers in the secrets below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus in "Platte River," the former pro football player, Harley, living in 
isolation on the Canadian border with a woman who is about to leave him, finds 
himself doing a two-day lecture gig at a small rural art college. It's a scam 
cooked up by the running back Harley used to block for in college, who now 
teaches English. Bass gives us the dispirited faculty at this college in the 
woods, the sad marriages, the suicidal colleague, the rusted-out Toyota's they 
all drive, and by the end of the predictable evening, the men end up in perhaps 
the only place on earth that they trust: casting for steelhead salmon on the 
banks of the Platte River. Maybe it's silly, but that's what they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps none of these men can be saved: Harley, or the suicidal English prof, 
or the former running back with his failing marriage. Perhaps manhood, as a 
positive value, cannot be saved, in this century anyway. But I liked the men in 
this story and the dogged efforts they were making, and if I had my choice, I'd 
choose fishing with them over a lot of fussier alternatives. I feel the same 
way about this book. I'm not satisfied by it, totally, but I liked it, I felt 
comfortable with it, and I'd choose Rick Bass over just about any other writer 
at work today.

RICHARD EDER: FAITH IN A METAPHOR; KNOWLEDGE OF ANGELS, BY JILL PATON WALSH

<P>
 Except that he comes from an imaginary realm, Palinor's waterlogged arrival on 
the imaginary Mediterranean island of Grandinsula could be one of the 
Englishman Gulliver's travels to a contrary reality. Palinor is a prince in a 
land ruled by the dawning Enlightenment -- a tolerant, civic, scientific 
society that works to the principles of empirical reason. Grandinsula is a 
medieval Catholic state ruled by a conscientious and benevolent cardinal-prince 
and working to the principles of Scholastic theology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowledge of Angels" is several different kinds of novel that come together 
astonishingly well. It is a philosophical argument in a line that stretches 
from Swift to C. S. Lewis' "The Screwtape Letters." Its disputation about the 
respective claims of scientific and religious thought, conducted three ways 
among Palinor, Cardinal Severo and Beneditx, a sweetly unworldly Thomist 
theologian, is agile and diverting. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument takes place not in a vacuum, but among three cultivated figures 
who come to respect and love one another, and thereby confront a tragedy. On 
the outcome hinges the question of whether Severo will be obliged to hand over 
Palinor to the Inquisition for burning as a heretic. It is a Plato's Symposium 
in which real food -- savory and fragrant -- is served, and where there will be 
a real bill to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jill Paton Walsh, an English writer known mainly for children's books, has 
placed her discourse and drama in a special framework. It is as if she had set 
the text down on parchment and illuminated it. As a medieval courtly or 
biblical manuscript displayed trees, rabbits, hilltop villages, swooping 
angels, knightly processions and peasants reaping or making love, "Knowledge of 
Angels" -- by means of writing alone -- is a series of brilliant illuminations. 
They do not outshine the text so much as place it in a more spacious human 
context. As we argue and expound and narrate, the seasons pass, harvests come 
and go, and two pairs of legs protrude entwined from under a hawthorn bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh makes several different uses of angels -- in this intricately but 
elegantly constructed book each character and emblem reappears in shifting 
guises -- but she starts off with an aerial view of Grandinsula. It is an 
angel's view, and also a reader's. The two have in common their ability to see 
everything in an eternal present, and simultaneously. Hamlet moves through time 
and dies, but to the reader he is always moving and always dying. 
</P>
<P>
 The island, somewhat resembling a 15th-Century Majorca, has mountains, plains, 
villages on each hilltop, a church in each village, little ports and a capital 
city. Everything is compressed and foreshortened -- again, as in an 
illumination -- so that an inch or two is a long journey. When Beneditx is 
summoned from his monastery to the nearby capital, the monks come out to say 
farewell as though he were off to China. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's different stories move and turn simultaneously, united by the 
reader's angelic vantage point. On the mountain, shepherds and ice harvesters 
-- they stamp down the snow, pack it in straw and sell it in the city -- 
capture a feral girl who has been raised by wolves. In the capital, Severo, 
austere and industrious, disposes of mountains of paperwork. By the seashore, 
fishermen rescue Palinor who has fallen from his ship passing at night, miles 
offshore. Up in the Galilea monastery, Beneditx, whose learning attracts 
scholars from all over Europe, is working on his book about the knowledge of 
angels. He holds to the old Scholastic view that, by the unnumbered billions, 
they make everything happen. In relay, they speed a javelin's flight and give 
it a delicate curve; each snowflake has an angel disposing its fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories converge. A shepherd comes to Severo to ask permission for the 
wolf-girl, who will only eat raw meat and is starving, to be baptized. A local 
prefect throws Palinor into a dungeon when, offered the choice of declaring 
himself Christian, pagan, Saracen or agnostic, he insists that he is an 
atheist. Lordly in manner and assured in intellect -- his princely rank at home 
comes not from lineage but from his skill as an engineer -- he insists on being 
heard by the cardinal-prince. Severo is charmed and fascinated, and searches 
for a way to spare him. 
</P>
<P>
 Summoning Beneditx, his old friend, the two devise a double plan. Palinor 
comes from a country where atheism is as acceptable as faith. If he has never 
believed in God, therefore, he can be tolerated just as agnostics and Jews are 
tolerated because of "invincible ignorance." Beneditx objects that knowledge of 
God may be innate though there is no firm doctrine on the matter. The 
wolf-child will be used to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Severo orders her to be taken to a convent, taught to speak and then 
questioned as to whether she has ever thought of God. The nuns are cautioned 
never to mention God to her. It is a scientific control -- one of the book's 
many inquisitive ironies, since it is Palinor's scientific culture that 
Beneditx objects to and that Severo finds troublesome though alluring. The more 
wholehearted and clear-minded abbess, like some present-day ethicist objecting 
to gene transplants, finds the experiment unkind. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beneditx and Palinor retreat to a pleasant hillside palace where 
the former goes through his array of learned arguments to persuade the latter 
that God has got to exist. Before long, curious and tired of the niggling 
detail of governance, Severo joins them. The three have a splendid time, 
eating, drinking, talking and bathing in the fountain that Palinor builds in 
his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a wonderfully companionable sequence but soon Beneditx begins to droop. 
His beautifully elaborated 13th-Century arguments -- Walsh suggests their 
ornamented aesthetic appeal -- are of no use against Palinor's 17th-Century 
reasoning. (The book is conveniently set halfway between, in an imaginary 15th 
Century, with Severo as a transitional figure.) The cardinal-prince reflects 
that he has pitted a golden mind against tempered steel; before long, Beneditx 
is in despair. Severo urges him to hold on through faith -- for this man of 
action, a failure to prove God's existence is no more troubling than a failure 
to prove that the sun will rise tomorrow -- but Beneditx's faith is built on 
argument and it has crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneditx's crisis will be followed by Palinor's. With the arrival of a deathly 
agent of the Inquisition and the collapse of the wolf-girl experiment, Severo 
finds himself torn between delivering up Palinor and desperately maneuvering to 
save him. The book advances to a brilliant and relentless conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be relentless, that is, if it did not consist of its illuminations as 
well as its argument. The island and its people are vividly and beautifully 
portrayed. The wolf-girl, who remains mysterious to the end, and the nuns who 
care for her are drawn with fine nuance and an imperceptibly gathering power. 
The stranger, cardinal and theologian are three eras of history -- the early 
Enlightenment, the Renaissance and the Middle Ages -- meeting to test their 
ideas, their hearts, the different sense of sky, skyline and the world's 
panorama that greets their eyes each morning, and the even more different sense 
of what it means to act as a human being. All on an island that Walsh's 
illuminated and illuminating book has set down in the weight of reality and the 
lightness of possibility.

COVER STORY: HOLLYWOOD MEMOIRS; QUINN TEAMS WITH HEPBURN FOR A MOVIE THAT 
CONNECTS A HEYDAY WITH TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pensive look flashes across Anthony Quinn's craggy face. His hearty "Zorba 
the Greek" voice suddenly softens. His expressive brown eyes drift away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess actors romanticize certain actresses," Quinn says softly. "I have 
always looked for a Katie Hepburn in my life. I guess I have always 
romanticized Katie. I envied her relationship with Spencer (Tracy). I envie d 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, a robust 78, is eating a chicken sandwich at the "members only" 
restaurant at the posh St. James Club on Sunset Boulevard where pictures of 
such legendary stars as Tyrone Power, Loretta Young, Marlene Dietrich and Clark 
Gable adorn the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems quite appropriate that Quinn, whose own legendary film career has 
spanned nearly 60 years and more than 275 films, would be sitting at the corner 
table, right in front of a glamour shot of a young Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see her every day," Quinn says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 After all these years, Quinn finally does have Katie Hepburn in his life. 
Well, at least on the small screen. The two star together in the new movie 
"This Can't Be Love," which airs Sunday on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 In the romantic comedy written by Duane Poole, Quinn plays Michael Reyman, a 
handsome movie actor whose career has slipped to low-budget films and 
commercials. Hepburn's Marion Bennett is a legendary actress who was briefly 
married to Reyman in the 1940s. When Reyman decides to write a book about his 
life and his relationship with Bennett, the two are reunited when he must get 
her permission to publish his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently," Quinn says with a chuckle, "he was so passionate that when he 
married Katharine Hepburn, he had to make love to her five or six times a day. 
After one week, she said, 'If this is marriage, I don't want it.' I expressed 
my love violently to her. I sincerely loved her. That to me was love: 'You are 
mine. I want you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn was director Anthony Harvey's first choice to play Reyman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great guy," enthuses Harvey, who guided Hepburn to her third Oscar in 
1968's "The Lion in Winter." "The thing that is always marvelous is that when 
Kate has a great big macho actor to work with, like Tracy, Peter O'Toole and 
John Wayne, it seems to spark off extraordinary stuff in her." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Harvey previously didn't know Quinn, "I admired his work enormously and 
luckily he was available. He was just great with her and made a great fuss of 
her and was charming and funny and made her laugh, which was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, who rarely does TV, was thrilled to be offered the part. "There's a lot 
of truth in it," he says. "I find very few pictures offered that make a 
statement. The background story -- it's the story of Katie Hepburn and myself. 
She started acting (in movies) in 1933 and I started in 1936. We ran the gamut 
together. We saw the movies come and we changed our styles of acting and 
changed according to the times. She kept her presence and her style." 
</P>
<P>
 And her sense of humor. Hepburn, Quinn reports, "has a great desire to have 
fun. There's one scene where I call for her at her house. The maid says she 
should be ready in a minute, and suddenly we see her come to the top of the 
stairs to make an entrance. Tony Harvey said, 'Just stand there.' She is 
eightysomething years old and may have a problem sometimes, but she did this 
delightful little dance. He thought it didn't fit in but, she wanted to have 
fun. It was wonderful to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, who was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, to a half-Irish father and 
Mexican-Indian mother, has known Hepburn for nearly 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a great admirer of hers," Quinn says. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time Katie happened to see me in a picture and we ran into each other, 
or she came backstage at the plays I've done, she has said, 'Let's work 
together.' I would say, 'Find a story. I want to work with you.' Then finally I 
did a play called 'Tchin-Tchin' with Margaret Leighton, who was one of the 
greatest actresses I have ever worked with. Katie said, 'Let's make that as a 
movie.' I was thrilled, but then she got something and I went to Europe. 
Finally, when this script arrived, it reminded me of all of those periods I 
have been through in acting -- stage-wise and picture-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn, who received best supporting actor Oscars for 1952's "Viva Zapata!" and 
1956's "Lust for Life," shakes his head. "I was one of those snobs who said, 'I 
will never do television.' I was silly. Television at least is trying to say 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 With "This Can't Be Love," Quinn is paying homage to an old friend, actor John 
Barrymore, who died in 1942 after a long battle with alcoholism. "When I did my 
research as to whom I am going to play (in the movie), I decided to play 
Barrymore because Jack and I were great, great friends." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Quinn says, he kept Barrymore alive the last two months of his life 
by "giving him my blood. I used to go to see him in the hospital every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The two met in 1936, when Barrymore's star was on the descent. Quinn's career 
was just beginning. "The first play I ever did was 'Clean Beds,' in which I 
played Jack Barrymore. I was 19 years old. He came backstage (one night) and 
said, 'Young man, where is your father?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn's voice softens. "I knew Jack when he became an alcoholic and his career 
was going to hell. He had become a terribly disillusioned man. I used to hang 
around with him and (writer) Gene Fowler and W.C. Fields. We used to hang 
around John Dekker's home on Bundy Drive. He was a painter. Jack would sit 
there and tell jokes and drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes Errol Flynn would come in. One of the men who was tremendously 
affected by him was Errol. In the later days when he did 'The Sun Also Rises,' 
he was playing Jack. He affected so many people. It was the end of the era. I 
saw that end of the era and that's the period where I took Jack Barrymore's 
life for my character. I just adored him." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn also adored movie legend James Cagney, whom he frequently mentions 
during the two-hour interview. The two met while making the great 1940 fight 
film "City for Conquest." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days in motion pictures, all of us who had dark skin or brown 
skin or olive skin played the heavies -- the bandits, the Arabs, the Chinese," 
Quinn says. "It wasn't until after World War II that the olive-skinned races 
were made leading men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a couple of pictures with Jimmy Cagney and he said to me, 'What the 
hell are you? You are not Mexican. You are not Irish.' I said, 'I don't know, 
Jimmy. I am just myself. Mexicans don't believe I am Mexican. Irish don't 
believe I am Irish. I might as well be whatever I am.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I just grew up isolated and I didn't feel like I really belonged. He said, 
'You have to come and join the Irish club.' All the Irish actors belonged to 
it. I said, 'I would feel embarrassed. One of them is bound to say, 'You're 
Mexican!' I would be furious.' So I wouldn't go. But, my God, he was a a 
darling man. A wonderful man." 
</P>
<P>
 "This Can't Be Love" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

A LIVING DEATH; THE FUTURE LASTS FOREVER: A MEMOIR, BY LOUIS ALTHUSSER . 
TRANSLATED BY RICHARD VEASEY . INTRODUCTION BY DOUGLAS JOHNSON; EDITORS' 
FOREWORD BY OLIVIER CORPET AND YANN MOULIER BOUTANG (THE NEW PRESS: $25; 365 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kaplan, Alice Kaplan's most recent book is French Lessons: A Memoir 
(University of Chicago). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 16, 1980, Louis Althusser, the leading philosophical and political 
theorist of French Marxism, strangled his wife, Helene Rytman, in their suite 
at the Ecole Normale Superieure, an elite institute for the training of the 
French professoriate where he had lived, first as a student, then as a 
professor, for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many received the news of his crime as a symbol of the demise of European 
communism. Those who knew Althusser understood that whatever fit of madness 
induced him to strangle Helene was not brought on by the world of politics. The 
elegant theorist, the man who redefined the concept of "ideology" as "our 
imaginary relationship to real conditions of existence" and who fought against 
a purely economistic interpretation of the works of Marx, had shuttled back and 
forth between the Ecole Normale and the psychiatric Hospital Sainte Anne at 
regular intervals for many, many years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the murder of his wife, Louis Althusser was declared unfit to 
stand trial by reason of insanity -- in French, this is called a non-lieu. This 
verdict preceded and preempted a trial. The non-lieu saved Althusser from the 
nightmare of a trial, and possible condemnation, but its consequences were 
enormous. As a person deemed unfit to plead, he lost his right to a trial -- 
that is the right to testify and be held responsible for his actions; he lost 
his right to enter into contract (his affairs would be handled by a legal 
guardian) and hence by extension -- at least symbolically -- his signature, his 
authorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Althusser, calling himself a "missing person," claims to be writing his memoir 
from this "non-place." He writes not as some latter-day Chateaubriand, from 
beyond the grave: He writes buried alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the murder, Althusser was committed to psychiatric internment for a 
period of three years, after which he retired quietly to an apartment far from 
the Ecole Normale. There he wrote the second of the two memoirs published in 
this volume, which were donated after his death in 1990 to the IMEC, the 
Institute for the Memory of Contemporary Publishing in Paris. (The IMEC houses 
archives of a number of French writers, including Celine, Genet and Paulhan). 
Olivier Corpet, the director of the IMEC, prepared the Althusser manuscripts 
for posthumous publication along with Yann Moulier Boutang, Althusser's 
biographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Their editors' forward, like the introduction to a very good mystery tale, 
frames what follows with a statement of the basic facts and with provocative 
questions for the reader: "How is it that such a story can move into the realm 
of madness, yet its author remain so aware? How does one come to terms with the 
author of a book of this kind?" 
</P>
<P>
 Althusser's story, they argue, is both the work of a madman and of a 
philosopher, both a work of imagination and a document about contemporary 
French intellectual history. Part one, "The Future Lasts a Long Time," was 
written in 1985. It is structured as a flashback, beginning with the scene of 
crime -- the night of the strangulation -- and moving backward to Althusser's 
relationship with his mother, his upbringing, his relationship with Helene, his 
intellectual formation and the escalating mental illness that would lead to the 
murder. Part two, "The Facts," written before the murder in 1976, is 
straightforward and condensed, reiterating the themes of part one in a lighter 
mode. 
</P>
<P>
 The lucidity of a man condemned by his madness to a living death is perhaps 
what gives this book its chilling edge. Althusser's sense, since childhood, of 
his own nonexistence is at its core. He was named after his mother's great 
love, Althusser; when Louis died at Verdun in World War I, Althusser's mother 
would marry Louis' brother, Charles, and name their son for the dead love. 
Althusser is a brilliant close reader of his given name: 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, Louis was a name I literally detested. It was too short . . 
. and ended in the sharp "ee" sound which offended me. . . . Doubtless it also 
said yes (oui) a little too readily on my behalf, and I rebelled against this 
'yes,' which corresponded to my mother's desire rather than to mine. Above all, 
it contained the sound of the third person pronoun ('lui') which deprived me of 
any personality of my own, summoning as it did an anonymous other. It referred 
to my uncle, the man who stood behind me: 'Liu' (him) was Louis. It was him my 
mother loved, not me. . . . My mother's love, directed through me to someone 
who was dead, made it impossible for me to exist in my own right." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Johnson, a former student of Althusser's, argues in an introduction 
designed for readers outside France that one should not take Althusser too 
seriously when he insists that he was something of a fraud as a thinker. This 
is just the kind of joke, Johnson surmises, that brilliant Ecole Normale 
students like to make about never having to study. He's doubtless right on 
target about students at the Ecole, but not about Althusser. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensation of fraudulence was deeply bound up with Althusser's 
self-definition, his depression, his imagination. The passages where he 
explores his own success, and his concomitant feelings of being a fake (his 
ability to charm, to reduce things to a formula), are among the most critical 
moments in the book. He writes, "In fact my philosophical knowledge of texts 
was rather limited. . . . I felt (what an illusion!) that I was capable of 
working out, if not the specific ideas at least the general drift or direction 
of an author or a book I had not read, on the basis of a simple turn of phrase. 
I obviously had certain intuitive powers as well as a definite ability for 
seeing connections, or a capacity for establishing theoretical oppositions, 
which enabled me to reconstruct what I took to be an author's idea on the basis 
of the authors to whom he was opposed." 
</P>
<P>
 This confession does not lessen our sense of Althusser's contribution to the 
history of philosophy -- his theories, by now, have taken on a life of their 
own, separate from his life -- but it heightens our sense of his self-loathing. 
Each successful writing project would be followed by anguish, and a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 What Althusser proves in "The Future Lasts Forever" is that in addition to his 
talents for theoretical work, he had a real genius for story-telling. The 
feeling of having "gotten away with murder" all his life is what makes the 
literal murder of his wife make such terrifying good sense. His writing ranks 
with Gide's for narcissistic self-condemnation and with James M. Cain's for 
sheer creepiness and a sense of evil. The clarity of his French formulations 
are inevitably somewhat muted in English, but Richard Veasey's British 
translation works. I liked the choice of "The Future Lasts Forever" as the 
title for the two-part volume, instead of the original French, which would have 
translated literally as "The Future Lasts a Long Time Followed by the Facts: 
Autobiographies." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a future lasting forever captures perfectly our sense that 
Althusser was condemned by his murder to a living death. As a reader I had the 
uncanny feeling of inhabiting Althusser's thoughts; repulsed and fascinated by 
him, as he was by himself, I was terrified and compelled to read on. Who, I 
kept asking myself, was Helene, the woman portrayed on Page 1, already dead, 
the tip of her tongue showing between her teeth and lips? 
</P>
<P>
 I learned that after the first time Althusser made love to her (he was a 
virgin at age 30; she was 38) he vowed never to do it again and needed to be 
hospitalized for anguish; that she was purged from the French Communist Party 
on suspicion of betraying the Resistance and that Althusser didn't believe the 
charges but voted to purge her in a moment of cowardice; that he tortured her 
by seducing other women in her presence; that his friends resenting her; that, 
with the pressure of taking care of him, she became every bit the witch they 
imagined. We may need to wait for the translation of Yann Moulier Boutang's 
biography to learn more about Helene Rytman's own story. The way Althusser 
himself tells it, the real incentive for murder was all hers.

THE MIGHTY QUINN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Quinn's movie career spans almost six decades, and most of his work is 
available on video. Below are a few of his best films: 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneer (Paramount): Back in 1938, Quinn had a small part as a pirate in 
his father-in-law's (Cecil B. DeMille) epic about the adventures of famed 
French pirate Jean Lafitte (Fredric March). In 1958, Quinn stepped behind the 
camera for the first and only time to direct the serviceable remake starring 
Yul Brynner as Lafitte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guns of Navarone (RCA/Columbia): Exhilarating 1961 adaptation of Alistair 
McLean's novel about Allied commandos during World War II and their 
near-impossible mission to destroy German guns. Quinn plays the tough Greek 
patriot Col. Stavros at odds with commando unit leader Gregory Peck. Great 
Dimitri Tiomkin score. The smashing special effects won an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 La Strada (Home Vision): Federico Fellini's masterwork. The Oscar-winning 1954 
drama tells the simple but powerful story of a brutish strongman (Quinn, in one 
of his best performances) touring the country with his assistant, a dimwitted 
young woman (Giulietta Masina). Richard Basehart also stars as a gentle clown. 
Haunting Nino Rota score. (Bravo cable channel is airing "La Strada" Thursday 
at 6 p.m. and again that evening at midnight.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence of Arabia (RCA/Columbia): Make sure to get the restored, letterboxed 
version of David Lean's 1962 Oscar-winning film about the mysterious British 
adventurer T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole). Quinn plays Arab chieftain Auda Abu 
Tayi. 
</P>
<P>
 Lust for Life (MGM/UA): Quinn received a best supporting actor Oscar, his 
second, for his effusive portrayal of painter Paul Gaughin. Vincente Minnelli 
directed the lush, literate 1956 adaptation of Irving Stone's historical novel 
about the troubled life of painter Vincent Van Gogh (Kirk Douglas). 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Lonely (CBS/Fox): Quinn gives a charming performance in this 1991 
comedy as a widower who has set his sights on his next-door-neighbor, the 
fiery-tempered Irish mother (Maureen O'Hara) of a lonely police officer (John 
Candy). 
</P>
<P>
 The Ox-Bow Incident (CBS/Fox): This 1943 socially conscious Western, directed 
by William Wellman, packs a wallop. Adapted by Dudley Nichols from Walter Van 
Tilburg Clark's novel about mob rule, the film features wonderful performances 
from Quinn, Henry Fonda and Dana Andrews. Quinn plays Juan Martines, an 
unemployed farmer who is unjustly accused of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Plainsman (MCA Home Video): Blink and you'll miss Quinn in Cecil B. 
DeMille's 1936 epic about Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur) and Wild Bill Hickok 
(Gary Cooper). Quinn plays a Cheyenne warrior who delivers a war chant. Quinn 
later married DeMille's daughter, Katharine. 
</P>
<P>
 Viva Zapata! (CBS/Fox): Quinn won his first best supporting actor Oscar for 
his larger-than-life turn as Eufemino Zapata, the brother of Emilio Zapata 
(Marlon Brando), the famed Mexican peasant who rose to the presidency of his 
country. Elia Kazan directed; John Steinbeck wrote the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorba the Greek (CBS/Fox): Quinn received a richly deserved best actor Oscar 
nomination for his indelible performance as a zesty, earthy Greek peasant in 
this appealing 1964 comedy-drama. Alan Bates also stars as a staid Englishman 
taught the ways of the world by Zorba. Lila Kedrova received a best supporting 
Oscar as Zorba's mistress. Twenty years later, Quinn and Kedrova toured the 
country in the revival of the musical version, "Zorba." SUSAN KING

 SIX WALKS IN THE FICTIONAL WOODS by Umberto Eco. (Harvard University Press: 
$18.95; 148 pp.) These are the six Norton lectures given by Eco in 1993, and 
reading them is indeed like wandering in the woods (as Eco quotes Borges -- a 
garden of forking paths). They might in fact be called, more prosaically, "How 
to Be a Good Reader," for Eco, in his incredibly manipulative way, has you 
eating out of his hand by the end of them. You want to be a good reader, a 
"model reader," a "second-level," not a mere "first-level" reader. We don't 
want to wander off on our own in a text, now do we? We might get lost, now 
mightent we? In the lecture, "The Possible Woods," Eco tells the story of a 
careful reader who did not properly "suspend disbelief," and wrote to Eco (who 
has a computer program that tells him where the stars were on any given night 
he wants to write about) to tell him that on a particular night in one of Eco's 
novels, on a particular street, the newspapers point out there was a rather 
large fire that did not figure in Casaubon's walk down the rue Reaumur. 
First-level! First-level boor! Detail monger! No, Eco smiles kindly on this 
wayward son. He is doing what we all do when we read fiction -- we depend on 
the narrative to "give form to that shapeless and immense universe," "we give 
sense to the immensity of things that happened, are happening, or will happen 
in the actual world.By reading narrative, we escape the anxiety that attacks us 
when we try to say something true about the world." In the actual world, says 
Eco, we wonder "whether there is a message, and if so, whether this message 
makes sense. With fictional universes, we know without a doubt that they do 
have a message and that an authorial entity stands behind them as creator, as 
well as within them as a set of reading instructions." There is another school 
of writing and reading, I believe, that says the best authors, parents, 
teachers, gods and minor deities are the ones that actually stay in the wings, 
that give their readers, children, apostles and worshipers an exhilarating 
sense of freedom; an endless variety of interpretations and meanings.

BIRD TRICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN GREEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "The Birds II" director Rick Rosenthal filmed flocks of birds flying over 
oil-slicked Gull Island, he only had a fraction of the birds used by Alfred 
Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably have a minimum of 500 birds and 100 flying birds.Hitchcock had 
over a 1,000," Rosenthal says. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How do you make 100 flying birds look like 1,000 flying birds? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Optical effects. Pigeons trained by Gary Gero were used in flight 
scenes to make the flocks appear larger. (In 1962, Gero was hired in the last 
weeks of "The Birds" production.) 
</P>
<P>
 "On camera, you can't tell pigeons from other kinds of birds," says Gero, 
whose arms were covered with peck marks. "It looks like birds flying all over." 
</P>
<P>
 To get the pigeons to fly, Gero laid out food in the designated flight paths. 
Ravens were rewarded for flying with pieces of meat. "When the birds are 
chasing after people, the trainer is there giving them a piece of meat," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 All the birds except the pigeons were hand-raised from birth. The pigeons were 
trained as juveniles. Gero swears that ravens are as smart or smarter than dogs 
and can be easier to train. 
</P>
<P>
 Animatronics also play a big role in "Birds II." 
</P>
<P>
 Three puppets, built so that the wings and necks move and beaks open and 
close, were used in close-ups of humans being attacked -- in order to avoid 
injury. (So the menacing sea gull you'll see with a wing span of three feet is 
really a puppet). In the most complicated fight scene, between a hawk and a 
dog, stuffed puppetry was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal enhanced the suspense of attacks by shooting from the birds' point 
of view as they swoop down on their victims. Steven Spielberg used a similar 
technique in "Jaws." ANN GREEN

 MAGIC EYE: A New Way of Looking at the World, 3D Illusions by N.E. Thing 
Enterprises. (Andrews & McMeel: $12.95.) It's on the bestseller list, between 
"Embraced by the Light" and "Men Are From Mars."Clearly, our sights are trained 
elsewhere these days. "Magic Eye" is a series of 30 computer-generated images 
composed of "Salitsky Dots," a "patent-pending, image-rendering system" that 
allows 3D images to arise from random fields of color. But they don't just 
arise. You have to perfect your gift for "deep vision." You have to stare at 
the random fields of color, either crossing your eyes, diverging your eyes or 
simply staring vacantly into space, through the image until the real picture 
comes clear. This did not happen for me, after two weeks, many headaches and a 
vague, disappointed feeling that a new generation with deep vision was racing 
past me on all sides. But don't let that stop you. "Magic Eye" is now in its 
tenth printing since late October, with over 775,000 copies sold in the United 
States alone. Just because I can't find a single secondary image in the book 
doesn't mean you won't be able to. And the random fields of color are very 
pretty, anyway. SUSAN REYNOLDS

RETRO; A FLOCK OF TERROR, PART II

 A large raven swoops down and lands on Tippi Hedren's shoulder one day during 
the filming of Showtime's "The Birds II: Land's End." She is apprehensive -- 
but not really frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is the same actress who had survived the attack of an attic 
full of birds 30 years ago in Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller "The Birds." 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have gotten to know the bird," says Hedren later. "They have big 
beaks that are sharp. But all the raven did was peck my head and try to get the 
hair clip out of my hair. That was cute. He was a silly bird." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedren developed an affection for ravens in her role as Melanie, the 
mysterious blonde whose arrival in a coastal town coincided with all the fowl 
commotion in Hitchcock's "The Birds." She grew so fond of Buddy, a pet raven, 
that she put a sign, "Buddy and Tippi," on her dressing room door. "He was so 
sweet that they didn't use him in the movie," she says. "He would play with 
things on my dressing table." 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Birds" sequel, Hedren plays an entirely different character as Helen, 
the storekeeper on fictitious Gull Island on the East Coast. The original 
movie, based on the story by Daphne du Maurier, was set in Northern 
California's Bodega Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birds II," directed by Rick Rosenthal ("Bad Boys," "American Dreamer") stars 
Brad Johnson, James Naughton, Jan Rubes and Chelsea Field. The story centers 
around a family who has come to Gull Island with their daughters while 
recovering from the death of their only son. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedren describes her storekeeper as "very together and knowledgeable about 
everything on the island. She is ecologically concerned about what is going on 
in our world." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she was disappointed that she didn't get a bigger role. "I wish that 
it was more than a cameo. I think they made a mistake by not doing that," says 
Hedren during the interview in a hotel suite. She now operates and lives on an 
exotic animal preserve called the Roar Foundation near Los Angeles. "But (the 
sequel) has helped me to feed my lions and tigers." 
</P>
<P>
 Birds, as in the 1963 original, are the real stars in the sequel. This time, 
however, Hedren didn't have to shoot a horrifying scene, e.g., the one where 
she was attacked by live sea gulls and ravens in the attic. When that scene in 
the original was over, she had nightmares filled with flapping wings. 
</P>
<P>
 In both productions, the horror of bird attacks is used to create suspense. In 
"Birds II," one of the scariest scenes is an attack on a young girl while she 
is looking for her dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thought of birds attacking is extremely scary," says Hedren, the 
mother of actress Melanie Griffith. "Birds are things we look at every day and 
expect to be parts of our lives. The thought of having them turn on us is 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the original, the sequel explains the motives for the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this movie, they are making an ecological statement," Hedren says. "This 
time, we are trying to show that man screwed up the planet so desperately the 
birds are retaliating." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Birds II: Land's End" premieres Saturday at 9 p.m. on Showtime. 
Hitchcock's "The Birds" w ill follow, after which a 15-minute behind-the-scenes 
special, "Inside the Birds," hosted by Tippi Hedren, will air.

 KINGFISHERS CATCH FIRE by Rumer Godden. (Milkweed: $12.95; 282 pp.) "Why is it 
that everything I do, but everything , becomes startling," asks Sophie 
Barrington, the vague and headstrong protagonist in Rumer Godden's novel of 
postwar colonial India. After her marriage dissolves, her husband dies and 
Sophie herself almost dies in a mission hospital, she gets it into her head to 
move to a remote village in Kashmir, to "live like the peasants." Her baby Moo 
and her 8-year-old daughter Teresa are unwillingly, and somewhat heartlessly, 
dragged along. She rents a house, and insinuates herself into the intricate 
equation of village life, with its feuds and shifting alliances. Sophie is one 
of those complicated characters who digs herself and those around her into 
deeper and deeper trouble, until the ever-omniscient reader is fairly screaming 
at the open book: "You stupid woman, how could you be so blind!" But Sophie is 
just living proof of the dirty depths of colonialism, so that even her 
romanticism is a narcissistic insult to the people among whom she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1907 in England, Rumer Godden was whisked away to India when she was 6 
months old. She was shipped back to England for her schooling at age 12, but 
returned to India when she was 20. She married and had two children, and after 
her husband died, like Sophie, moved to a remote village in Kashmir, where she 
wrote and ran an herb farm. Godden has written over 60 books for adults and 
children in her lifetime, many of them fueled, as this one is, by her deep love 
for India. "The lakes are fringed with willows, where the kingfishers live, the 
foothills are reflected in the water in green and pink and blue and white from 
the orchards and ricefields and mulberry gardens and fields of flax." 
Merchant/Ivory need only supply the film.

 IN THE SHADOW OF THE FLAME: Three Journeys by Margaret Croyden. (Continuum: 
$17.95; 169 pp.) Driven by a "serious distaste for life," a midlife nagging 
emptiness from the past, Croyden (author, English professor, and experimental 
theater critic in New York), without any formal plan, embarks on three very 
different journeys that each add their shovel of dirt to the hole in her 
life.The first is an "outing," reminiscent of a story told in "My Dinner With 
Andre," in the Polish woods with a group of actors, led by the theater director 
Jerzy Grotowski, an experiment he calls "paratheatre." Croyden is told nothing 
about where they are going, is allowed to bring nothing, and watches bitterly 
as the other, mostly younger, members of the group perform a series of dances 
and rituals that fold them into each other and back into nature. She is afraid 
and separate, a condition she attributes to her Jewishness: "Afraid, afraid of 
new things, afraid of the earth, of the grain, of the wet, of being what I am." 
The effect, once back in New York, seems to be that she is a little bit lighter 
and more awake. The second journey is a visit with Baba Muktananda, which 
awakens some nasty memories of Croyden's father, mostly sexual; and the third 
journey is to Tel Aviv, again to ponder the question of her Jewishness, and 
finally, to find dignity and a sense of heritage in it. Croyden spends very 
little time on the "lessons" learned, which is a relief, because the journeys 
are artfully described and speak for themselves.

 I've been a senior-citizen non-group member of two HMOs over the past eight 
years and can verify that Dr. Jane M. Orient's criticisms, and more that I 
could supply, are valid ("Clinton's Mis-Managed Care," Feb. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 The "managed care" I have encountered seems more like a slow form of genocide. 
My wife and I, with no influence or power, have endured poor medical care 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Our prescription allowances have shrunk, and the screws have been tightened so 
that expensive medical tests that might run costs up for the HMO are 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish other seniors in bad health would band together and fight the 
money-hungry HMOs. Orient is telling the truth, and it's a warning to all. 
</P>
<P>
 JAMES M. MECHLING

<P>
 When is someone going to stand up and call the Clinton health-care proposal 
what it really is: a blatantly expensive vote-buying entitlement scheme. No way 
can this country afford to insure 38 million people without going bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Flawed as it is, we have the best health-care system in the world. Clinton's 
system would put a layer of bureaucracy between patients and doctors and add 
$120 billion a year that we can't afford to the national debt.

 A few years ago, I had a bypass operation and saw the multiple-visit racket in 
action. Each morning the surgeon showed up, gave me a cursory examination, told 
me I was doing fine and left. An hour later, my cardiologist appeared and went 
through the same routine. Later that afternoon, a stranger entered my room, 
identified himself as an associate of the surgeon and repeated the song and 
dance of the other two. Finally, another stranger, an associate of the 
cardiologist, performed an identical encore. 
</P>
<P>
 These visits continued for the eight days I was in the hospital. The 
strangers' visits added more than $2,100 to my bill. If this goes on with all 
Medicare bypass patients, the Treasury of the United States is being looted to 
the tune of millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orient has to understand the value of bureaucrats: They're trying to keep the 
medical foxes from running off with the whole chicken coop. 
</P>
<P>
 MORRIS STEIN 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 So life for doctors ain't what it used to be. I've got news for Orient: Life 
ain't what it used to be for a lot of us, including aerospace engineers, 
teachers and realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians like Orient fought HMOs for years. Now their villain is not only 
managed care but anyone suggesting that the system needs fixing. If Orient and 
her cohorts are so concerned for their clientele, I suggest that they begin by 
posting schedules of their fees on the office wall so that patients can do 
comparative shopping. If they really want to keep the government out of health 
care, they might try applying the free enterprise system to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 WINSTON BARKLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Temecula 
</P>
<P>
 As a full-time practicing internist, I sympathized with much in Orient's 
article. I have learned to abhor governmental bureaucracy. I believe there must 
be more responsibility on the part of the patient as well as the doctor and the 
hospital. I find trusting, personalized care to be the most desirable and most 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Orient, I take very seriously the dictum in the Hippocratic Oath to do no 
harm. But unlike her, I find that the high cost of health care and the 
inefficient and profit-driven ways in which it is so often dispensed are 
clearly causing great harm to countless people. What I see people most wanting 
and needing is a way (or ways) in which their hard-earned dollars are spent to 
most benefit themselves, and that is precisely what some forms of managed care 
may be in the best position to bring about. 
</P>
<P>
 DR. HYMIE MILSTEIN 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 Asking Orient to evaluate the Clinton plan is like asking Rush Limbaugh to 
evaluate Clinton's first year in office. The anti-government blindfolds both 
wear make it impossible for them to identify facts, to analyze fairly and, in 
some cases, to tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone who has read the Clinton plan, it is apparent that no 
government-controlled, health-care cartel is called for. The plan calls for 
less paperwork, less government interference and less waste of doctors' time 
than exist at present. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT MARGULIES 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 Orient's clients seem to have at least some money to enjoy the health-care 
"freedoms" she advocates. But how about one of my patients, an elderly and 
recently naturalized citizen from the Philippines. Besides having heart 
disease, he has been recently found to have thyroid cancer. He has no money to 
spend on his health care. I can barely persuade him to buy aspirin for his 
heart disease because he needs every penny for food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 But since he is able to seek medical attention under a managed-care system, 
his cancer surgery and hospitalization are covered, as is his preventive health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 If my patient moved to Tucson, Ariz., could Orient guarantee that he'd get the 
same care from a private-practice doctor that he got through his HMO in Long 
Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 DR. OSMUNDO R. SAGUIL 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Orient's claim that physicians aren't in it for the money is ludicrous. OK, 
let's pay part of the costs of medical school with tax dollars so that 
physicians can no longer claim they need big bucks to pay back their student 
loans. Then cap all physicians' wages at no more than 50% above the average 
wage in their local areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If we cut physicians' wages to those of other human-service providers, we'd 
attract a far better class of doctors, and the greedy power-trippers practicing 
medicine today and screaming about the Clinton plan would have to take up 
another line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 SARAH MAGEE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I and most of my colleagues in mental health provide services on a sliding-fee 
scale, as we were advised to do in graduate training. I would rather see 10 
clients at reduced fees, if I believe I can help them, than see one patient at 
full fee who would work much better with another therapist but whom I must see 
because I am the provider for their area. 
</P>
<P>
 Provider alliances that restrict choice, and managed care that restricts 
treatment, are obstructions to health care.

 I have practiced in Great Britain, the United States and Canada. Whatever the 
faults (and there are many) of national, universal coverage, I never had the 
slightest longing to go back to a system that forced me to worry whether a 
patient could afford a necessary X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in New York and Brooklyn that for the first and last time I saw 
hellholes bearing the proud name of hospital side by side with some of the best 
institutions in the world. Perhaps instead of alleging horrors, one should ask 
an average Canadian (or a Britisher, a German or a Frenchman) if he'd want to 
exchange his health care for the American version.

 THIRTEEN UNCOLLECTED STORIES BY JOHN CHEEVER edited by Franklin H. Dennis. 
(Academy Chicago Publishers: $19.95; 227 pp.) This is not the 
martinis-on-the-veranda, yacht-club-and-family-gatherings Cheever of the 
collected stories.This is the Cheever who, in real life, was paralyzed by his 
fear of bridges, the Cheever who would dutifully put on a suit and hat each 
morning and travel down in the elevator of his New York apartment building to 
the storage bin in the basement that he used as his "office." The stage for 
these stories is the Depression, middle-America, joblessness and risking all 50 
of the dollars in your pocket at the racetrack. But his characters are bathed 
in that same unearthly, sourceless light as the poor slobs on the verandas. The 
things we depend on, like family, institutions, banks and governments, usually 
betray Cheever's characters, regardless of whatever shields they erect -- 
money, marriage, society -- against this fate. So these stories, written in the 
1930s and 1940s when Cheever was in his 20s and 30s, have many of the same 
qualities as the later stories. It's just that the heroes are aging salesmen 
and aging dancers, waitresses and strippers. Stylistically, however, Cheever 
was still in master Hemingway's thrall, which may have distracted him from his 
true lusciousness in more ways than one. (This is the famously litigated 
collection from which the Cheever family eventually managed to have a number of 
stories held out.)

 HOPPER by Mark Strand. (Ecco: $21; 53 pp.) This is the fourth in Ecco's 
wonderful Writers on Art series, in which writers who have pondered, been 
inspired by or just admired certain artists get to write about them. It's 
almost always an uncanny, complicated, separated-at-birth sort of pairing, too, 
a little diabolical, but always short and sweet and to the point. It makes 
things a little more interesting if you know the work of both the painter and 
the writer; but it is not necessary, since what you are given really are new 
ways to look at the paintings and new questions to ask about what the artist 
wanted to say. Strand asks questions about direction and movement in the 
paintings -- do the shapes confine the viewers or free them; and desire -- do 
we want to be there looking or do we want to get away, or as in Nighthawks, 
does it seem as though we just happened by; spirit -- conveyed mostly by the 
quality of the light -- which Strand says "has an otherworldly power," 
"Hopper's shapes carry the sensation of light," it is "atemporal" and 
"peculiar"; and finally time: "Hopper's paintings are not vacancies in a rich 
ongoingness. They are all that can be gleaned from a vacancy that is shaded not 
so much by the events of a life lived as by the time before life and the time 
after," or, put another way, "There is a lot of waiting going on."Gradually, 
the real brotherhood between the two artists becomes clear. Strand's poetry has 
a very similar distance to it; reading it, you seem to grow farther from, 
rather than closer to, the things you are reading about. And the direction you 
are moving in is toward the same "beyondness" that permeates the light in 
Hopper's paintings. The difference might be that one would rather go to the 
beyondness of Strand's poetry than to whatever sad world lurks behind the 
curtain of Hopper's paintings. For one thing, there are more trees.

 A NECESSARY END by Nick Taylor. (Doubleday: $15; 194 pp.) What Nick Taylor 
preserves, in this simple story about the end of his parents' lives, is the 
certainty that almost everyone will live through this story in one form or 
another -- there is none of the precious specialness of other family 
histories.Taylor's parents do not die of unusual diseases, his family is not 
particularly "dysfunctional," his parents are not particularly rich or poor. 
Taylor does not have to give authoritative emphasis to the horrible fact that 
old people in this country most often spend the last years of their lives 
without the dignity and security they've earned. His very factual tone may seem 
cold-blooded, but is, in fact, respectful. He is not telling the story of his 
relationship with his father or his mother (although they cannot help but come 
through, if only in the tangle of emotions and responsibilities), nor is he 
making policy suggestions for health care in this country (although several 
come to mind reading this book). He is telling the story of how his parents 
died and what he did, mostly logistically, to try to make it easier for them. 
"They died," he writes in the end, "knowing that I loved them. I always knew 
that they loved me. We had cared for each other as best we could, while caring 
for ourselves. There is really nothing more to know that matters."

SPREADING THE SCI-FI WEALTH

 TV programmers in their wisdom have blown it again. A sci-fi fan on Sunday 
nights at 8 p.m. must choose between "seaQuest DSV" (NBC); "Lois & Clark: The 
New Adventures of Superman" (ABC); "TekWars" (KTLA) and "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation" (KCOP).By virtue of making a selection to watch one show over 
another, the sci-fi fan is put in the frustrating position of ultimately being 
responsible for the demise of his/her favorite genre on the other channels. 
Spread the wealth, programmers.

deliver their lines as if they had graduated from the Graduate School of 
Mumbling. Turner can, indeed, sound otherwise, as evidenced by her clear lines 
on her car commercial. Other shows, such as "L.A. Law" and "Picket Fences," 
don't have this problem. Is it misguided direction?

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; LESSONS IN ANTARCTICA, FROM THE 
ADVENTUROUS SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sir David Attenborough says he once considered himself "a chap who feels that 
the tropical rain forest is where I would enjoy myself." But years of making 
documentaries in the warmer climates of the world made him realize that "the 
time has come to cover other places." 
</P>
<P>
 He chose the other end of the spectrum, Antarctica. Surrounded by 90% of the 
world's ice, temperatures can drop there as low as 90 degrees below 
zero-Farenheit. This week, Attenborough hosts Antarctica: Life in the Freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Attenborough says: "When people ask me why I chose to go there, I say to them, 
'Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Antarctica, Attenborough says, is "the last great unfilmed land. The plains of 
East Africa are very exciting, but we've seen a lot of them. Hardly anyone has 
seen undersea where penguins zoom around at 20 to 30 miles per hour, watch them 
hunted and captured by leopard seals." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the show's other unusual sights include four-ton bull elephant seals 
fighting for control over a 100-female harem and miles of male empire penguins 
caring for their young. 
</P>
<P>
 Documenting all sides of the continent -- which had never been done before -- 
was a massive project, 2 1/2 years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step was research. "You go to extraordinary lengths," he says. "It 
must be well planned and organized. There are so many things you need, 
including excellent communication devices, cameras, self-contained kits for 
each person with food, radios and medical packs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some research had to be done on location. "This couldn't have been done 
without detailed consultation with the British, American, New Zealand, 
Australian and Argentinian scientists," the filmmaker says. "You need to have 
their cooperation, because you need to stay on their bases." The international 
research scientists make up most of Antarctica's 800-person population. 
</P>
<P>
 Six crews, using both film and video, worked in different areas of the 
continent, where almost everything is covered with ice all-year round. 
</P>
<P>
 Extraordinary underwater footage highlights the program, which is part of TBS' 
"National Geographic Explorer" series. Divers, wearing special suits, were 
actually treated to warmer temperatures when they dipped into the icy seas. "If 
the waters were as cold as on land," Attenborough says, "well, of course, they 
would be frozen." 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't even touch your naked finger to the camera without it sticking 
and damaging it," Attenborough points out. "Even putting your eye to the 
eyepiece was a difficult problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The temperatures proved treacherous for man as well as machine. Land and sea 
crews took great care with their equipment. Specially prepared cameras were 
used because conventional cameras contain oil and lubricants that freeze in 
subzero temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did they have to carry cameras everywhere, they were responsible for 
its repair," he says, citing an example of a crew member who borrowed parts 
from his computer to repair a broken camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antarctica" aired in England as six half-hour segments. But Attenborough says 
that TBS' decision to air the documentary as one three-hour show works well. 
"There is a narrative logic. Each of the original segments are chronologically 
documented from the beginning of spring, the warming of the continent right 
through the year, through winter, to the beginning of the next spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his initial reservations about braving the cold, Attenborough has no 
regrets. He hopes that his American audience "will find it as fascinating a 
place as I have. I hope they will watch the show and say, 'It's fascinating,' 
because if you miss the grandeur of nature, you are missing the most rewarding 
experience of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Antarctica: Life in the Freezer" airs Monday at 5:05 p.m. and repeats at 8:05 
p.m. and Saturday at 7:05 p.m. on TBS. For ages 6 and up.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

 Kenneth Branagh's giddy, whirling dervish of a movie, Dead Again (NBC Sunday 
at 9 p.m.), serves as a stylish and witty sonnet to the ghosts of Hollywood 
past. This 1991 release is a past-lives thriller in which metaphysical 
questions about karma and fate play as important a role as motive and murder. 
Branagh, who co-stars with his wife Emma Thompson, has the ability to create a 
film to match the ones in his memory and at the same time infuse it with a 
distinctly modern sensibility and sense of fun. In the full-color present, 
Thompson suffers from amnesia but drags herself to the mansion where, in 1949, 
an English concert pianist (also Thompson) met her violent death. 
</P>
<P>
 An Innocent Man (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a cautionary thriller about an 
unjustly imprisoned airline mechanic, has a chance to be a canny blend of gutsy 
melodrama and "J'Accuse" against the prison system. But, by the end, it has 
gone as slick and corrupt as the crafty old con (F. Murray Abraham) who advises 
Tom Selleck's framed Jimmie Rainwood on jail survival. On a fundamental moral 
level, this 1989 picture is guilty as hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Ford Coppola's 1986 Peggy Sue Got Married (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is 
one of the director's best, an irresistible nostalgic fantasy in which 
small-town girl Kathleen Turner, on the eve of her 25th high school reunion, is 
propelled back in time a quarter of a century but her contemporary awareness 
remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Dead Silence (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.), a 1991 TV movie, is a taut, 
all-too-human tale about the lengths to which best friends will go to save 
their skins. Renee Estevez, Lisanne Falk and Carrie Mitchum star as three 
co-eds jolted by a desert highway accident. 
</P>
<P>
 John Malkovich has his moments in Making Mr. Right (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.). In 
a dual-role challenge, he plays a very square scientist who replicates himself 
as an android, capable of being modeled into the ideal man for the contemporary 
woman. However, this 1987 Susan Seidelman satire is more a miss than a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Coogan's Bluff (KTLA Saturday at 6 p.m.) stars Clint Eastwood in a 
full-throttled action-adventure in which an Arizona lawman chases a fugitive 
through the wilds of Manhattan. This 1968 film was a chance but fortuitous 
teaming of Eastwood and director Don Siegel, who would direct the star four 
more times and influence Eastwood's second career as a director himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eiger Sanction (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a splendid 1975 high 
adventure, done with much wit and style. It finds Eastwood -- who also directed 
-- scaling a virtually perpendicular mountain in the Swiss Alps as part of an 
international team of climbers. One of the climbers happens to be a spy for the 
"other side" who has stolen a formula for germ warfare, and Eastwood's the 
professional assassin out to get him.

 Jesus of Montreal (Bravo Monday at 9:30 a.m.) unfolds as an intense young 
actor (Lothaire Bluteau) becomes caught up in his role as Jesus. The fun of 
Denys Arcand's lethal satire of contemporary popular culture doesn't disturb 
this 1989 French-Canadian film's essential core of spiritual reflection. 
</P>

 La Strada (Bravo Thursday at 6 p.m., Friday at midnight), the 1954 Fellini

MEDICINE AND RACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sisters in Arms" (Three on the Town, by Wanda Coleman, Feb. 6) puts a racial 
edge on a universal medical problem. Doctors, especially surgeons, are not 
sensitive enough to women. 
</P>
<P>
 I found a lump. My general practitioner, a surgeon and a mammogram all said it 
was nothing. Six weeks later, I went back to the surgeon ready to fight. "I 
want you to either biopsy this lump or aspirate it, and do it now," I said. 
When he aspirated the lump, I saw a cloud pass across the eyes of the nurse, 
and the doctor scheduled a biopsy. It was no surprise when he called a few days 
later to apologize. Two kinds of cancer were at work in my breast. Luckily, 
surgery removed it before my lymph nodes became involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, this isn't a black woman's problem. I am white. To cry out "racial 
bias" on a point that involves all women does none of us any service.

 In publishing a cartoon depicting two young boys having lunch at an elementary

(Villard: $19.95; 232 pp.) And here they are, in all their glory: Stupid 
Attachment, Stupid Courtship, Stupid Devotion, Stupid Passion, Stupid 
Cohabitation, Stupid Expectations, Stupid Conception, Stupid Subjugation, 
Stupid Helplessness, and Stupid Forgiving.Remove the word stupid and you have 
some pretty nice things: passion, courtship, devotion, forgiving, but Dr. 
Schlessinger drives a hard bargain: "If you want a higher self-esteem, there's 
only one, admittedly old-fashioned way to get it: Earn it!" She smiles sweetly 
on the cover, but Dr. Schlessinger has a black belt in karate, a Ph.D., and a 
"license to practice therapy" (is that like a license for a gun?). As radio 
talk show host on Los Angeles' KFI-AM, Schlessinger noticed that women were 
blaming too much on other people and doing too little "to get out of their 
no-win relationships, personal or professional." "They act stupid," she says. A 
brief Epilogue, "The Birth of the Smarts," explains that Schlessinger is hoping 
to make us mad, to "jump-start our courage." The first step on the path to 
recovery, it seems, is the realization that you are truly, truly stupid.

THREE ON THE TOWN: FIT BUT NOT FANATIC; PUMP IRON? RUN A MARATHON? OVER HER 
DEAD (BUT NOT NECESSARILY FORGOTTEN) BODY

 Next week, the Oscars will elbow onto the world's television screens with 
images of spangled movie stars buffed and be-muscled from hours spent 
bench-pressing the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, it was the Los Angeles Marathon, with thousands of thundering 
mesomorphs flexing their beef-jerky limbs along the Thomas Brothers' 
thoroughfares. The race began and ended at the Coliseum, whose chief ornament 
is two bronze sculptures, one female, one male, with superb musculature and no 
heads. Does the obvious elude you? 
</P>
<P>
 These festivals of lats and pecs, these bookend hosannas for calves bulging 
like oak boles and collarbones protruding like ox yokes, make a depressing and 
exasperating fortnight for anyone who finds exercise to be an exercise in 
boredom. It's tedious, dull, as well-intentioned as the Heimlich maneuver and 
about as attractive, either watching it or doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodybuilding is what people do in prison, where they have too much time on 
their hands. If that passes as California heresy, sue me; indulge in the second 
most obsessively popular local pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Cohen pumps iron, shooting all to pieces my idea of the pale, 
neurasthenic poet. Pat Robertson pumps iron -- there's muscular Christianity 
for you. I believe that had God meant for me to pump iron, he'd have sent me 
here from Krypton instead of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 I calculate my exercise as part of my chores, not my leisure. I'm not among 
the acolytes who pay people to clean their houses or mow their lawns so that 
they have the time to go to a gym and pay someone else to help them work up a 
sweat. I take walks. And I have a time share in an exercise machine that is not 
so expensive that I feel guilty when I neglect it, nor so noisy that I can't 
hear "Nightline" when I get around to using it. 
</P>
<P>
 A marathon? If I'm going to struggle to go 26 miles, I'd rather end up on 
Catalina Island, sipping pinot grigio, not sucking away at a glucose supplement 
under the Coliseum's decapitated bronzes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitness is perfectly laudable. It's the mania that's so repellent -- the 
impossible goals, the fancy equipment, the performing in front of picture 
windows, the one-upmanship, the braggadocio. You'd think it was sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Slack time makes the exercise rites more annoying. Forty-five minutes, even an 
hour a day sounds acceptable, but with all the undressing, showering, 
re-dressing and hair-drying, one session of aerobics turns into something like 
the last two minutes of an NBA game: It goes on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stars, I hear, put in three or four hours a day on equipment that could 
power up the entire Rust Belt. That's time I'd rather spend reading, but then, 
they don't have to make a living knowing the demographics of primary-election 
voters, and I don't have to make a living wearing Sharon Stone's skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need shortcuts for things we like to do. We need them for what we 
hate to do. What else are dishwashers and player pianos and faked orgasms 
except ways to avoid whose-turn-is-it-to-wash-and-dry fights and piano lessons 
and prolonged bad sex? Who hasn't considered the alleged Bill Clinton dodge -- 
splashing yourself with water to look sweaty from a jog you never took? Whose 
eye hasn't slewed skeptically but longingly toward those recent ads that ask 
archly, "Can you do 900 sit-ups in an hour?" and hold out the hope of such 
results through electronic stimulus, delivered by means of wicked-looking wired 
paddles? 
</P>
<P>
 This may be one occasion when the man from the government is here to help: If 
Clinton is half the man I think he is -- or twice the man, depending on the 
jog-to-French-fry ratio -- he should skip the deficit, skip welfare reform. 
Just get that experimental thigh-shrinking cream through the FDA and onto the 
market, and it's another four years of free jet rides for you, big guy.

 THE SUMMER HOUSE by Alice Thomas Ellis (Penguin: $9.95; 339 pp.) . Ellis' 
quirky novel takes the form of three internal monologues by women involved in 
an imminent, unpromising marriage. Margaret is about to marry Syl, the 
neighbor's son, which doesn't seem to make anyone very happy. Margaret, who 
wants to become a nun, anticipates the event "the way a ship anticipates a 
shipwreck." Syl's mother, the neighborhood termagant, likes her son better than 
any other male, but that isn't saying very much. Lili, the aging, egotistical 
vamp who went to school with Margaret's brusque mother, also disapproves of the 
match. This unlikely trio comes together in an entertaining, offbeat tale of 
passion, motherhood and small-town scandal.

 COLORADO DESERT WILDFLOWERS by Jon Mark Stewart (Jon Mark Stewart Photography, 
73-430 Indian Creek Way, Palm Desert, Calif. 92260: $12.95, plus $4 tax and 
shipping; illustrated, paperback original). The Colorado Desert encompasses 
much of southeastern California, parts of Arizona, the Baja peninsula and 
sections of northern Mexico. Its ordinarily bleak landscape produces a lovely 
array of wildflowers, most of which appear after the annual rainy season. The 
striking photographs in this handsome guide are arranged by the color of the 
flowers, rather than their botanical classifications, a sensible arrangement 
that makes it easy for hikers and amateur scientists to use.

 PARADISE TRANSFORMED: Los Angeles During the Second World War by Arthur C. 
Verge (Kendall/Hunt Publishing: $23.95; 177 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original) and PICTURE HISTORY OF WORLD WAR II AMERICAN AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION by 
Joshua Stoff (Dover: $13.95; 179 pp.). Prior to 1941, American aircraft were 
"virtually handmade," a situation that changed radically with Pearl Harbor: 
During the course of the war, Americans produced over 300,000 military aircraft 
-- a staggering feat. Joshua Stoff uses an extraordinary collection of 
photographs to trace all phases of production, from design to christening 
ceremonies. A significant number of aircraft were manufactured in the newly 
erected factories in Los Angeles -- one of the many changes Arthur Verge 
documents in his informal history of the city. World War II transformed L.A.: 
The population increased rapidly and its ethnic makeup shifted, as thousands of 
African-Americans left the South for defense jobs and better living conditions. 
The first freeway was completed in 1940, and smog, a portmanteau word made up 
of smoke and fog, was coined around the same time. Contemporary Los Angeles is 
largely a product of the war years. Although not a great prose stylist, Verge 
offers a readily approachable introduction to a key period in local history.

 ON DISTANT GROUND by Robert Olen Butler (Henry Holt: $11; 245 pp.) . Pulitzer 
Prize-winning novelist Robert Butler continues his exploration of the aftermath 
of the Vietnam War in a compelling, understated story. In 1975, intelligence 
officer David Fleming faces a court martial for helping a Viet Cong officer to 
escape. As he strives to understand his actions, this repressed man rediscovers 
his own past, including why his brief romance with an aristocratic Vietnamese 
woman ended abruptly. News footage of the attempt to airlift orphans of mixed 
parentage out of Vietnam before the fall of Saigon leads Fleming to expand his 
definition of duty and make a desperate attempt to redeem himself.

 SEAT BELTS REQUIRED? by Henry Tatnall (Dorrance Publishing: $9.95; 118 pp., 
paperback original). Driving regulations differ surprisingly in the 50 states 
and the District of Columbia: Speed limits range from 65 to 25 m.p.h., and the 
amount of alcohol in the blood stream that constitutes D.U.I. varies from .05% 
to .15% (.02% for those under 18 in Vermont). In Alaska, big-game animals 
killed or wounded in vehicular collisions become the property of the state; 
backing up on a Interstate Highway is illegal in Minnesota, as is playing a 
sound system loud enough to be heard 50 feet away in Oregon. Tatnall's modest 
guide offers anyone planning a cross-country drive an easy way to avoid 
tickets.

 TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES by June Jordan (Vintage: $12; 234 pp.). A noted African 
American journalist and poet, Jordan lashes out at what she perceives as the 
evils of world in these fiery essays.She derides Ronald Reagan as "a Lady 
Clairol Cowboy" who defied the International Court of Justice to persecute the 
people of Nicaragua, defends Anita Hill and dismisses Clarence Thomas as 
beneath contempt. She praises Martin Luther King Jr., rejecting 
well-intentioned efforts to deify him, and enthusiastically endorses Jesse 
Jackson's presidential campaign. Although Jordan occasionally gets carried away 
by her own rhetoric, her passionate stance offers a welcome counter to the 
current tendencies to temporize and govern by poll results.

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; FIGHTER FLIGHT

 Assignment: Fightertown. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission: Improbable. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm surrounded by all these guys who, like me, are wearing flight suits! I'm 
getting briefed on becoming a combat pilot-person. What am I doing? I'm far 
past draft age, and my boyfriend had to drag me to see "Top Gun." This is 
unreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as they say here: "The Flight Is Simulated, the Experience Is Real." 
</P>
<P>
 Fightertown is a 2-year-old indoor complex in Lake Forest that draws up to 80 
aviation buffs a day. Co-owned by Dave Kinney, whose Kinney Aero makes flight 
simulators, and John Araki, an aerospace engineer, it puts would-be aces into 
simulators that use the latest in computer animation for half an hour of 
virtual flying. And two of the eight simulators -- the F-117 Stealth fighter 
and F-14 Tomcat -- use hydraulics to further replicate a real flight with 
jolts, jostles and drops. (Like every step up the high-tech defense ladder, 
full-motion simulators cost more: The two-person Tomcat costs $49.95, while the 
single-seater Stealth is 34.95; the others range from $14.95 to $29.95.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you want to do, we have the graphics to do," says instructor Brice 
Williams. "You can fly at sunset, dawn or in foggy weather. You can fly in 
formation with friends, fight each other or destroy nuclear bases. The idea is 
entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 And how. As a controller gives me instructions, I get in an F-16. My hands on 
the throttle and eyes on a computer-animated panorama, I increase airspeed to 
300 knots. The jets roar, and I begin to climb. The image changes with every 
touch of the controls; the illusion of reality is incredible. Here's the World 
War III fighter-chick, flying over land and sea, downing enemy planes with 
missile salvos! 
</P>
<P>
 Just call me the Red Baroness! 
</P>
<P>
 Then, from the tower: "302, increase altitude. You're heading for a mountain!" 
Ayyyyy . . . CRASH! Maybe you should just call me Snoopy. Judy Raphael

PALM LATITUDES: BODY POLITIC; BILLBOARD BROUHAHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Salerno 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The billboard high above San Diego's busy Sports Arena Boulevard shows a trio 
of plaintive, ethnically diverse women staring straight into the camera. 
Alongside is the exhortation: "Quit using our cans to sell yours." 
</P>
<P>
 The catchy mantra, now visible in 20 locations across the county, was 
conceived by a coalition of West Coast public-interest groups dubbing itself 
Consumers to Stop Sexist Alcohol Advertising. CSSAA -- run as three independent 
programs in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego -- is fed up with the 
portrayal of women in alcohol ads generally and beer commercials in particular. 
"We need to get away from this idea that if you drink, you'll have these 
gorgeous females at your disposal, that the woman goes along with the booze," 
says Betty White of San Diego's Center for Women's Studies and Services. 
</P>
<P>
 White maintains that men 18 to 25 are the greatest consumers of beer and the 
most frequent perpetrators of sex crimes, distinctions she feels are not 
entirely coincidental. Mix the usual advertising imagery with the natural 
restiveness of young men, add the alcohol, and you've brewed a precarious 
cocktail indeed, White argues: "That's why we're calling our ad campaign 
'Dangerous Promises.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the San Diego group didn't want to be too heavy-handed lest its efforts 
meet the same fate as those of the sister programs in San Francisco and Los 
Angeles, whose plans fizzled when Gannett, the major outdoor-advertising firm, 
blanched at their suggested billboard copy. The Los Angeles group favored the 
same line used in San Diego but ran into trouble when it insisted on prefacing 
its ads with the salutation, "Hey, Bud," a swipe at the brewery that CSSAA 
considers to be the worst offender. San Francisco, meanwhile, threw subtlety 
completely to the wind with its "Bloodweiser . . . King of Tears." 
</P>
<P>
 None of which impresses Francine Katz, director of consumer awareness for 
Anheuser Busch. "Beer doesn't cause domestic violence," declares Katz. "As a 
woman, I'm offended and dismayed that they would trivialize the issue of 
domestic violence by taking the responsibility for the abuse away from the 
abuser and putting it on the product." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz sees nothing objectionable about Budweiser advertising, saying Bud was 
targeted "simply because we're the biggest." Furthermore, she says, "If they're 
going to be honest, they know that alcohol doesn't cause abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Leiber, a volunteer with the San Francisco program, says her group is now 
considering the softer San Diego version, but refuses to apologize for the 
original sledgehammer slogan. The goal, she says, "is to get the attention of 
the alcohol producers and ask them to adopt advertising standards regarding 
alcohol and violence in the same way they address other issues like drinking 
and driving." Steve Salerno

PALM LATITUDES: SCHOOL DAYS; MULTIMEDIA MEMORIES 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Janet Kinosian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've had movies for something like a hundred years and TV for 40 or so, and 
the images and ideas they've generated have seeped into and shaped our 
subconscious more than anything since maybe religion. But even in the 
cable/satellite/video store era, we still have to rely on our brains for 
remembrances of shows past. That makes it tough to re-examine formative media 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's help: Both the UCLA Film and Television Archive and USC's 
Cinema-Television Library and Archives of Performing Arts preserve the films, 
TV and radio shows that are, notes UCLA archive director Robert Rosen, "our 
culture's collective memory." 
</P>
<P>
 One step in probing that memory might be a visit to UCLA and its 200,000-title 
film and TV library. It also has 27 million feet of Hearst newsreels. Here, you 
can view tapes of everything from "Top Cat" to rare Three Stooges shorts, from 
a band of nervous Beatles on Ed Sullivan to the liberation of Auschwitz. Seeing 
those one after the other ought to stimulate -- and confuse -- anyone's cortex. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, there's less film and TV footage than at UCLA but lots more 
memorabilia. Sadly, though, all of it is reserved for scholars. They're the 
only ones who can see Clark Gable's Oscar for "It Happened One Night." And the 
mammoth chalked backgrounds used in the "Wizard of Oz." And the Warner Bros. 
archives, which the studio donated to USC. And the personal papers of Robert 
Wise, King Vidor and Edward G. Robinson, among others, as well as more than 
18,000 books and periodicals on film and television, more than 10,000 scripts, 
8,500-plus pressbooks and countless other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips down collective memory lane are filled with twists and turns. That's to 
be expected, though, in a culture molded by "Casablanca" and "Deep Throat" and 
that's produced a "Schindler's List" and a "Beavis and Butt-head." But then, no 
one said introspection was easy. Janet Kinosian

 "Nobody leaves here without their medication." That's not a threat; that's a 
promise from several local pharmacies that cater to AIDS patients. These 
unconventional drugstores provide more than AZT and DDI: They offer compassion, 
information, even credit -- they will carry costs for patients until insurance 
companies pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 Vee Mell opened Vee's Pharmacy in West Hollywood in 1988 after watching the 
disease strike clients she served while working at a nearby drugstore. Ninety 
percent of her business is now HIV-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has to do it," says Mell, who sits on boards of several local AIDS 
organizations. "My husband screams at me because we lose so much money" -- 
about $100,000 a year from unpaid Medi-Cal claims, she says. AIDS-related 
losses amount to about 10% of her business, she says. Medi-Cal and other 
insurers typically will not pay for a drug prescribed for non-approved uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The larger expenditure is emotional -- I lose 40% of my client base each 
year," she says. "I really miss those guys." Mell opened a Vee's in Beverly 
Hills last year and recently built a sterile IV room for her West Hollywood 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pasadena's Care Rite pharmacy, Jim Avedikian stocks injectable drugs that 
are not usually carried by major drug stores, operates a videotape library, 
does free computerized research for clients and distributes a newsletter that 
discusses new treatments and clinical trials and dispels or confirms rumors 
about breakthroughs. About 75% of his business here and at a sister store in 
Long Beach that he operates with partner Paul Stephan is HIV-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim was the first person who gave me some hope, and he hooked me into a wide 
network of support," says Nancy Busacca, 45, who tested positive last year 
after contracting HIV from heterosexual sex. "I walked into the pharmacy 
devastated, looking like death warmed over. Jim took one look at my face and 
said, 'Would you like to talk?' " R. Daniel Foster

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: FANTASTIC! IT'LL BE BIGGER 
THAN 'BORIS & NATASHA' AND 'BRENDA STARR' -- COMBINED! 
</P>

 It would take a superhero, it seems, to get Roger Corman's version of the 
Fantastic Four comic legends to the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when studios are scarfing up movie rights to comic-book characters 
like Spiderman and the X-Men, Corman's $2-million "The Fantastic Four" simply 
became a pawn in allowing German producer Bernd Eichinger and his Neue 
Constantine Films to hold on to film rights to the Marvel Comics' characters in 
hopes of making a $40-million-plus picture with bigger stars and a flashier 
director. Corman and Eichinger executive produced the smaller one. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it's not unusual for movies -- particularly small-budget ones -- to 
get shelved in Hollywood, what is unique is the hoopla surrounding this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the cast and crew pull money out of their own pockets to help 
bankroll this project, the actors and director Oley Sassone did the unheard of: 
They took it upon themselves to begin their own press campaign nationwide last 
summer, trumpeting the picture to thousands of comic fans through radio shows 
and comic trade press, signing autographs at comic bookstores and conventions 
around the country.  
</P>
<P>
 Charity galas were tied in with the planned premieres in Minneapolis and 
Nashville, benefiting facilities for critically ill children. Trailers began 
appearing in theaters; the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington -- home of the 
Mall of America premiere -- even declared the Jan. 19 world premiere date 
Fantastic Four Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not to be. Eichinger paid $1 million to Corman and took the movie 
back in early January. It is now effectively shelved.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bernd had a deal with Marvel Comics and he was always planning to do a 
$40-million picture," Corman says. "But he couldn't complete the financing 
before his option ran out. He had to be in fiscal production on Jan. 1 or he 
would lose the rights. He said, 'How would you like to go into partnership with 
me and make a smaller-budget version?' We went into production two days before 
he would lose his option. I was glad for the money, but I'm disappointed that I 
won't get to release it."  
</P>
<P>
 While Corman says Eichinger told him that 20th Century Fox wanted the project 
with "Home Alone" director Chris Columbus attached, backing up an earlier 
report in the trade press, Fox and Columbus' agent say that neither are 
interested. Eichinger has no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is uncommon to film a movie just to hang on to the rights and then 
shelve it, it is not that unusual to begin production and then pull the plug to 
satisfy contractual obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing this was a big disappointment," says Kendra Verbeten, director of the 
Children's Miracle Network in St. Paul, beneficiary of one gala. "It wasn't 
only the fund-raising aspect that we've lost, but a chance to have a 
mini-premiere with the actors, which would have been a thrill for these kids. 
When we heard that the film was canceled, my first question was, 'Hasn't it 
already been made?' If they were going to throw $2 million at a movie that will 
never be seen, I wish they would have thrown it our way."  
</P>
<P>
 Says the film's star, Alex Hyde-White, who plays Mr. Fantastic: "It afforded 
me a chance, as an actor, to find an audience. The problem was we went out on a 
limb, but the limb was sawed clean through behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the picture never sees the light of day," he adds, "it's too bad. But at 
least I've got a nice Fantastic Four memorabilia collection."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: 'REF' REVENGE; MAYBE GENE 
CAN NAME HIS PET SNAKE LAGRAVENESE SISKEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Siskel isn't an extraordinarily common name. So when movie critic Gene Siskel 
went to see "The Ref" at a sneak preview in Chicago last weekend and heard one 
of the minor, seedier characters repeatedly referred to by that name, it struck 
him a little funny, like it must be some kind of in-joke allusion to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he know how right he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard LaGravenese, the co-writer and co-producer of "The Ref," named the 
character -- a military school instructor who gets blackmailed over some 
incriminating dirty pictures -- after Siskel specifically as revenge for 
comments the critic made about an earlier script of his. Any physical 
similarities between Siskel and actor J.K. Simmons, who plays the balding 
blackmailee, are also anything but coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
 What was Siskel's sin, the one that won him this screen immortality? Two years 
ago, on the annual "Siskel & Ebert" Oscar preview telecast, he picked 
LaGravenese's screenplay nomination for "The Fisher King" as the least 
deserving of all the nods in the major categories. "I thought it was 
overwrought," Siskel recalls now. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the movie last weekend, he wasn't prepared for the reverse homage. 
"It was a very strange feeling, sitting in a theater and hearing your name 
called out on the big screen. It's not like it could have been (referring to) 
anyone else. I had no idea why my name was chosen." 
</P>
<P>
 LaGravenese relayed through a Disney publicist that he had decided not to 
publicly comment about his use of Siskel's name, other than to confirm the 
story behind why he picked it. 
</P>
<P>
 When The Times informed Siskel of the reason for the "Ref" reference, he 
seemed bewildered that LaGravenese would go to the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a strange form of revenge . . . I don't know that it's the most 
effective form of protest. He may have sabotaged those scenes in which it's 
used, dramatically, by causing you to suspend disbelief by bringing the 
'reality' of my name into the mix. I think people may be waiting for a Roger 
Ebert joke after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not having yet written his review of "The Ref," Siskel wouldn't say what he 
thought of it, but did allow himself a casting complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only disappointment was that Jack Nicholson didn't play my character," 
Siskel says. "I wonder if he passed."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: TRUE, NO LIE; BOWL CELLIST 
DROPS HIS BOW, TAKES BOW WITH SCHWARZENEGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One Friday evening last July, Emily Schweber, casting associate for James 
Cameron's upcoming action-adventure "True Lies," attended a Hollywood Bowl 
concert, where she spotted a bulky, bearded cellist. In true star-is-born 
fashion, Schweber knew instantly: The cellist was ideal to play Akbar, one of a 
gang of Mideastern terrorists who take on Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Monday, Schweber tracked down the would-be terrorist's identity. 
And that's how Armen Ksajikian, the bowl orchestra's assistant principal 
cellist, found himself cast in a major film, without so much as a SAG card to 
his credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had such a unique, interesting look," Schweber recalls. "We had to find a 
heavily bearded man, and he had to be large, because part of the stunts in the 
movie have to do with his size." 
</P>
<P>
 While the 36-year-old cellist had never acted, he is no stranger to show biz, 
having recorded scores for as many as 600 films and played on recordings by the 
likes of Sinatra and Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're recording and that red light goes on, you have to concentrate," 
Ksajikian says. "It was an interesting feeling to be in front of the camera." 
</P>
<P>
 He did have to learn a few tricks, however. "When I put him on videotape, I 
was worried because he was too nice," Schweber says. "But our weapons trainer 
got hold of him and taught him not only how to handle the weapons but the 
attitude he needed -- behind the eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ksajikian is awaiting the film's summer release before deciding whether he 
will pursue acting. But he does have one other goal: "I do imitations of people 
playing cello," he says. "I want to get on David Letterman and do Stupid Cello 
Tricks."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: LOLLY PALOOKA; ERNIE 
HUDSON PUTS GHOSTBUSTING BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For someone whose name remains virtually unknown to the moviegoing public, 
Ernie Hudson is one of the busiest actors around. Starting with the current 
"Sugar Hill," as Wesley Snipes' nemesis, Hudson will be in five films over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has garnered decent reviews in supporting roles in hits like 
"Ghostbusters" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," Hudson, 48, hasn't enjoyed 
as much name recognition as his best-known films. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I feel relaxed," says Hudson, "is when I'm working." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson should be plenty relaxed. After finishing "Sugar Hill," he will play 
either a policeman or a security guard in four more films due out over the next 
several months: "The Crow," "The Prison Colony," "Airheads" and "The Cowboy 
Way" -- twice starting work on a film the day after finishing another. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden this policeman thing came up," Hudson says. "I tried really 
hard to get into the 'nice guy' category. I assumed that being the nice guy 
would lead to leading man. I got into being best friends and nice guys, which I 
enjoy, but I also enjoy a good villain." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't make them more villainous than "Sugar Hill's" chilling Lolly, an 
ex-boxer turned drug dealer who challenges Snipes' Roemello Skuggs for control 
of Harlem's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 So convincingly brutal is Hudson in "Sugar Hill" that his soft-spoken manner 
in person comes as something of a shock. Dressed in black boots, jeans and a 
blue shirt, Hudson talks about his hard-earned time off at his home in the San 
Bernardino mountains to "reconnect with the kids." Hudson and his wife, Linda, 
who married in 1985, have two young children, Andrew and Ross. Hudson also has 
two grown children from his first marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been a steady build," Hudson says of his career. "You go out and 
you do your best work and maybe someone will tune in. Any of these films have 
that potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson, it seems, has built a career on potential. Born in Benton Harbor, 
Mich., he served as the resident playwright for Concept East, an African 
American theater company in Detroit, and won a scholarship to the Yale School 
of Drama at 28. There he shifted his focus to acting, scoring his first major 
movie role as ghostbuster Winston Zeddemore in 1984. He hoped the movie's 
phenomenal success would help get him more good parts. It didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you do a film like 'Ghostbusters,' and because it's going to be 
such a big movie, (you think) you're gonna get this out of it," Hudson says. 
"But it doesn't necessarily work that way." 
</P>
<P>
 He reprised that role in "Ghostbusters II," and then decided on the role as 
the disabled handyman in "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," for which he did a 
lot of research talking with mentally handicapped people. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hudson plays a cop or guard in four of his five upcoming films, the 
movies themselves have little in common. "The Crow" -- the Miramax film 
probably best known for the accident that killed actor Brandon Lee -- is a 
supernatural thriller; "The Prison Colony" is a futuristic action movie from 
Savoy starring Ray Liotta; "Airheads" is a light comedy from 20th Century Fox 
starring Adam Sandler, and "The Cowboy Way" is an action comedy from Universal 
co-starring Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Sugar Hill," his first movie with a mostly black cast, Hudson's Lolly 
makes it difficult for gangster brothers in Harlem to escape their past. In 
preparation for his role, Hudson walked through Harlem with an ex-drug dealer 
to learn more about criminal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fascinated by the character," Hudson says. "Here is a guy who has a 
gym, who's a former fighter -- he was a contender -- and he's here in the 
community, supposedly helping build up young guys, and he's selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a place you can't go, and I've always been very clear on 
that. There are things you cannot do -- the tragedy of the character I play in 
'Sugar Hill' is that he violated that -- and when you do you can never be the 
same person again. You've stepped over the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson enjoyed "Sugar Hill," and especially liked working with Snipes, whose 
work and career he admires.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when there was one black actor and everybody else had to 
sort of wait in line until something happened to him so they could possibly be 
the next in line," says Hudson, who is encouraged by the mainstream success of 
Snipes and Denzel Washington. "Now there's a number of guys." And Hudson is 
ready to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's an audience who's very much aware of me and my work, and I'd 
like to have a chance to carry a film."

STYLE: LEADERS OF THE PACK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRENDSETTERS: PORTRAITS FROM 
THE CREATIVE EDGE; BOY MEETS CAR: TOM MATANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY YOUNG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up in 1950s Tokyo, Tsutomo Matano marveled at his grandparents' Parker 
pens, GE refrigerator and other golly-gee-whiz gadgets from America. But the 
tail-fin Cadillacs left the biggest impression, sparking a lifelong love affair 
with the automobile. Decades later, he's car-crazy still, designing cars and 
running perhaps the most successful automotive design studio in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 46 and known as "Tom," Matano is executive vice president of design at 
Mazda's research and development facility in Irvine, where he and his staff of 
28 have originated roughly half of Mazda's lineup -- an impressive record 
considering that they compete against two in-house design teams in Japan. Aside 
from conceiving the Miata, RX-7, MX-6 coupe, MPV minivan, Navajo sport/utility 
vehicle and B-Series trucks, they also contributed to the Millenia, the luxury 
sedan that goes on sale next month, complete with ergonomically correct radio 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The jaunty little Miata, though, will probably always top Matano's resume. In 
1983, he set out to re-create the sports car he never had the chance to own and 
wound up with what Robert Cumberford, automotive design editor for Automobile 
magazine, calls "an enormous success." Of the ragtop's well-modulated, 
best-selling curves, Matano says: "The surface has emotional romance and 
sportiness people can relate to. It's simply fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The road to Mazda began when Matano earned a degree in analysis engineering. 
"All those time-and-motion studies were too cold and scientific," he recalls, 
so he came to L.A. in 1970 to study at Art Center College of Design. After 
stops at Oldsmobile in Detroit, General Motors in Australia and BMW in Germany, 
he headed back to California car heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Matano has remained passionate about his work, allowing 
masterpieces of the past to serve as his muses for the future. "While we were 
doing the RX-7, we had a Ferrari 275GTB in here," he says. "I wanted my 
designers to not feel intimidated by a classic muscle car." 
</P>
<P>
 Good design is influenced by what came before, he explains, yet it means 
giving soul to a new machine: "As long as the users are human, the shape should 
be organic, natural. It should be in touch with the human element." EMILY YOUNG

 When it comes to contemporary furnishings in Southern California, one store 
showcases them best: Civilization, a 17,000-square-foot warehouse on Venice 
Boulevard in Los Angeles, where owner and president Richard Green handpicks 
styles that strike a chord. Take the cozy sofas slipcovered in as many as 15 
vintage fabrics at once. "People come back for six months, looking for just the 
right combination of colors and patterns," Green says. "They make an emotional 
connection with a piece -- one that expresses their own desires." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, 34 and a native New Yorker, knows whereof he speaks: He comes from a 
family of furniture merchants. His father was managing partner of the 
Contemporary Lifestyles furniture stores. His two older brothers run Designers 
Furniture Mart in Glendale and Buena Park and West Coast Interiors in La Habra. 
He and his brothers teamed up in 1986 to open Cityscapes in Pasadena, where 
nearly all the furniture comes from the East Coast, Canada, Spain or Italy. Now 
this latest venture, begun in 1990, focuses on moderately priced items that are 
handcrafted closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety percent of our furnishings are made by California artists and 
artisans," says Green, who buys from about 40 artists, either natives or 
European emigres who have brought Old World skills with them. One Russian 
craftsman creates mosaic tables. A French ironmonger makes wrought-iron tables 
and lamps. Two South African women paint screens and furniture. "It used to be 
that buying European had a certain snob appeal, but today California artists 
are doing amazing stuff," he says. "We have great woodworkers, carvers, 
painters and mosaicists to select from." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it features an array of looks -- from recycled to country -- 
Civilization is an important resource for set designers and prop stylists. 
Twenty percent of its business comes from rentals to feature films, TV shows, 
music videos, even soaps such as "General Hospital" and commercials for 
Coca-Cola and Budweiser. In turn, the exposure generates calls from around the 
world. Someone in Japan wanted all the furniture in the beach house in 
"Sleeping with the Enemy"; an Ohio woman wanted everything in the pool room on 
MTV's "The Real World." 
</P>
<P>
 Green encourages retail patrons to purchase things right off the floor because 
one-of-a-kind pieces are never around very long. "We're in a constant state of 
fluidity," he says. "We're constantly changing and moving on." BARBARA

 Kimberly King is bracing herself. As a personal shopper for some of 
Hollywood's rich and famous, her biggest challenge is just a week away: 
Oscar-night disasters. There's always at least one call the day before the 
awards show. Or that morning. A nominee or presenter is apoplectic because the 
dress she ordered elsewhere didn't arrive. Or it did, but in the wrong color or 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 King can take a wardrobe crisis like this and turn it into a fashion triumph. 
Working at Neiman Marcus, she has one of Beverly Hills' largest stores at her 
disposal and knows instantly what she can rush over in a van. She has come to 
the rescue countless times, browsing the racks for women (and men) with no time 
(or desire) to do it themselves. "One of my customers hasn't been to a store in 
10 years," she says. "For a third of the women, shopping is seen as work. Many 
are too busy, so we do everything over the phone. Sometimes a woman just needs 
a second opinion."

 At 32, King is one of the youngest of 10 personal shoppers at the store (and 
the other dozen or so around town). Her job requires speed, accuracy and a 
sixth sense that tells her what other players are going to do; not 
surprisingly, she also plays semi-pro tennis. "She knows in a second whether a 
piece will work for me," says model Vendela. "She really gets to know her 
clients and matches their style and personality with their clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 A few wardrobe tips, however, she shares with everyone: A piece of 
Kieselstein-Cord jewelry earns you immediate respect. An Armani pantsuit is a 
can't-miss choice for most events. And quality fabric separates insiders from 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Goldberg, wife of producer Leonard Goldberg and a Revlon consultant 
active in community affairs, relies on King to save time. "You want to look 
great, but you don't want to be consumed by your clothes," Goldberg says. 
"There are so many things in life to worry about, and clothing shouldn't be one 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
 King is tight-lipped about other names on her client list, but with her annual 
sales reaching seven digits, she's obviously catering to actresses, studio 
executives and the real Industry elite. "Don't underestimate the power of the 
Hollywood wife," she says. "When she's dressed well, people say 'Oh, he's doing 
well.' They close the deals." MAUREEN SAJBEL

STYLE: LEADERS OF THE PACK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRENDSETTERS: PORTRAITS FROM 
THE CREATIVE EDGE; A CUT ABOVE: CRISTOPHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After the haircut heard 'round the world last May, Cristophe became a 
household name. But fame proved to be a blessing and a curse: Though the 
Beverly Hills hairdresser was booked solid for weeks following the trim he gave 
President Clinton at LAX, he also lost the First Couple as clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristophe predicts that he'll see the Clintons again someday, but there's no 
rush. "I'm trying to avoid major international crises," says the gentle and 
good-natured 36-year-old Belgian native. Besides, he adds, "hair is not an 
important part of their agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Being synonymous with pricey hairstyles put a distressing crimp in business 
for the $50-a-cut hairdressers at Cristophe's salon, but his own list of 
regulars was unaffected. Half of Hollywood, it seems, sits in his chair, 
including Morgan Fairchild, Bruce Springsteen, Kelly Le Brock, Rosanna 
Arquette, Dustin Hoffman and Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Cristophe's appeal is his presence. He's tall (towering over his wife, 
Danielle Schatteman, who co-owns the salon), ruggedly handsome and wears his 
blond hair long. Plus, he understands that no one wants to be at the mercy of a 
hairdresser's ego or fashion's dictates. Instead, he listens to his clients. "I 
take into consideration the full persona," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that a Cristophe cut is safe. He's known for his striking 
hair makeovers, which have included taking Hillary Clinton out of her headband 
and giving her a blunt-cut bob. According to Allure magazine, his hair 
aesthetic is "as classic, easygoing and perfectly structured as an Armani 
suit." 
</P>
<P>
 On a first salon visit ($250 for women, $150 for men), he'll find out how you 
feel about your hair, then he'll take his time cutting, which is why he's 
always running late. "If you come to me," he says, "it's not for what the guy 
on the corner does." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Cristophe plans new salons in Beverly Hills, St.-Bart's, Florida 
and Georgia. So far, neither Chelsea nor her parents have been to his new D.C. 
outpost, but it gets plenty of other bigwigs. "The best part is, I don't have a 
clue who they are," he says. "A man came in and said he was a secretary of 
something. I said, 'How do you do? I'm Cristophe,' and I cut his hair. He could 
be running the country for all I know." MAUREEN SAJBEL

STYLE: LEADERS OF THE PACK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRENDSETTERS: PORTRAITS FROM 
THE CREATIVE EDGE; BUILDING FOR TOMORROW: DUKE OAKLEY

 Change is afoot at UCLA, and a new era of construction has begun. Westwood 
Boulevard above Le Conte Avenue has been transformed into a medical avenue 
flanked by new offices, laboratories and clinics. The main undergraduate 
library is housed in an award-winning tent-like structure while Powell Library 
is renovated. New dormitories crown the northern hills, a massive business 
school is under way and a high-tech power plant nears completion. Still to come 
are more labs and a remodel of the student union. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is enough going on that you can see a new urban coherence rising up 
here," says UCLA Campus Architect Charles Warner (Duke) Oakley, the man 
overseeing this $800-million transformation. He ensures that the structures not 
only appear on time and on budget, but also that they "engage passersby and 
have a scale that reflects human experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, Oakley says, is learning from the past: "Modern architecture, 
especially when combined with the constraints of state funding, gave us large, 
institutional buildings with long corridors inside and no relationship to what 
went on outside. For this round of building, we have chosen architects (such as 
Robert Venturi, Antoine Predock and Barton Myers) who have proved that they are 
responsive to the context in which they build." 
</P>
<P>
 When Oakley was hired in 1985 to bring order to the haphazard building process 
on the 420-acre campus, "people liked the grounds a lot more than the 
buildings." Since then, Oakley has added structures enjoyed for their 
amenities, such as the garden atop the new MacDonald Research Lab. He is also 
using seismic upgrading to enhance existing facilities, such as Royce Hall, 
whose towers were damaged in the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley, 49, has a special perspective on the campus because he has been a 
paraplegic since he broke his neck in a diving accident at Dartmouth. "I used 
to say that I look at buildings more carefully because I move more slowly in a 
wheelchair, but now that I have a power chair, I actually go a lot faster than 
most people," he says. "Let's just say that times have caught up with me: I 
always worried about access, about how things looked from down here, and now 
more people care about these things." AARON BETSKY

STYLE: LEADERS OF THE PACK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRENDSETTERS: PORTRAITS FROM 
THE CREATIVE EDGE; RED-HOT AND COOL: MOSSIMO GIANULLI 
</P>

<P>
 When Mossimo Giannulli makes personal appearances, autograph-seekers line up 
around the block. If you haven't heard of him, you're probably not jeek or 
josh. You're probably haggar.  
</P>
<P>
 Mossimo is a clothing designer who aspires to be Southern California's hip 
Ralph Lauren, putting his stamp on everything from leather jackets and boots to 
sheets and soap dishes. "Why not?" muses the USC dropout, who has already 
parlayed his three-panel volleyball shorts (the must-have beach item of 1987) 
into a sportswear, swimwear, bodywear, accessories, shoes, eyewear and retail 
empire reportedly worth $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Kathy Ireland posed in his "3-D" bikini on the cover of Sports 
Illustrated. Next month, Otis College of Art and Design will honor him. "He 
makes clothes my students wear," says Rosemary Brantley, chair of the fashion 
department. "To them, he's got rock-star status." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old designer, who recently launched Mossimo Supply at South Coast 
Plaza, likes that image. "When you hear the name Mossimo," he says, "you think 
of this old, fat Italian guy who doesn't get it. Instead, here's this young, 
thin Italian guy who doesn't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but he does. He may be self-effacing, but he's smart. He knows that youth 
is the key to his unconventional company and that his customers know the 
nuances of cool. "Moss is laid-back and cutting-edge at the same time," says 
Jack Briggs, owner of Newport Beach's 15th Street Surf Shop. "I once saw this 
turquoise car of his that was so cherried-out you couldn't tell what it was 
originally. It's the same thing he does with clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mossimo, a native Californian, connects with his twentysomething fans by 
hanging out and riding motorcycles with his rowdy young staffers. A year ago, 
15 of them took part in a group head-shaving, and now they're doing a group 
grow-out. On the flip side, Mossimo's the doting father of a 2-year-old boy, 
Gianni, and a neat freak who has his Irvine office repainted every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A contradiction? No. In Mossimo-speak, he aspires to be jeek , which stands 
for GQ, and josh , which refers to architect Josh Schweitzer. Both are terms of 
high praise, while haggar refers to old guys' pants. Uncool? You figure it out.

STYLE: LEADERS OF THE PACK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRENDSETTERS: PORTRAITS FROM 
THE CREATIVE EDGE; MAKING WAVES: WET DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Inside every grown-up is a kid who remembers running through the sprinklers. 
Which is why waterworks by the Universal City company WET Design are so 
enticing. If most urban fountains are sedate -- bubbling quietly, offering 
unobtrusive comfort -- those of WET (which stands for Water Entertainment 
Technologies) are shape-shifting and unpredictable. In cities around the world, 
WET has invited people to sprint through geysers, grab at airborne H2O and 
otherwise behave like children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, where WET has more than half a dozen installations, 
tales of these antics are almost legendary. At the Los Angeles Music Center, 
scene of a fountain that rises and falls according to a computer program, 
tuxedoed concert-goers dash through during quiet moments only to get soaked as 
the shooters blast again. On hot days at Universal CityWalk, youngsters caper 
amid jets that erupt without warning from the plaza floor. Equally tempting is 
the Watercourt in Downtown's California Plaza (shown here). There, giant 
shooters and undulating water curtains surround stages. When the stages are 
empty, the water is the show as plumes dance back and forth and a huge wave 
crashes below. 
</P>
<P>
 As unruly as WET's water sometimes gets, its most distinctive feature is a 
crystal-clear, tube-like stream known as laminar flow. More than a decade ago, 
working for Disney Productions, WET co-founders Mark Fuller (second from left) 
and Alan Robinson used laminar flow to design water wonders for Epcot Center. 
The LeapFrog fountain they invented there was the genesis of WET Design, which, 
since its birth in 1983, has grown into a multimillion-dollar firm with an 
office in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Nelson, director of planning and development for MCA Development Co., 
which created CityWalk, calls WET's designs "a kind of techno-art. They look so 
graceful, so effortless, yet underneath, they're all complicated mathematical 
equations. That's magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the credit for the magic, though, according to JoAnn Matyas (right), 
senior designer at WET, must go to water itself, which, she says, "has a life, 
an essence of its own. Yes, we lay it out in nice graphic patterns, but after a 
point, it takes over." SUSAN HEEGER

STYLE: LEADERS OF THE PACK; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRENDSETTERS: PORTRAITS FROM 
THE CREATIVE EDGE; IN GOOD HANDS: SUZI WEISS-FISCHMANN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles is manic about manicures. A quick survey of the hands around you 
will reveal fingernails that have been artfully sculpted in acrylic, wrapped 
with silk, tipped with plastic, mended and extended, varnished, jeweled, 
French-tipped and even (believe it or not) left natural. And the woman who has 
shaped the way we do nails is Suzi Weiss-Fischmann, vice president and creative 
director of OPI Products. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingernails were certainly not foremost in Hungarian-born Weiss-Fischmann's 
mind when she and her brother-in-law, George Schaeffer, started a dental-supply 
business in North Hollywood in the early '80s. "All these nail salons were 
popping up, doing acrylic nails, which use a similar material to that used in 
making dentures," she says. So with a slight chemical revision, three products 
-- a nail primer and a liquid and a powder blended to create an artificial nail 
-- were packaged "and we went up and down Ventura Boulevard trying to sell 
them," she recalls. Unsure how the sideline business would fare, they hung on 
to their logo -- OPI stands for Odontorium Products Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1982. Since then, OPI has gone international, producing 
professional and consumer cosmetics, including elegantly packaged Nail Lacquers 
and, new this spring, matching Lip Colours. Weiss-Fischmann watches the fashion 
runways to create her twice-yearly "collections" of colors (such as "Pompeii 
Purple" and "Whole Lotta Seoul"). 
</P>
<P>
 As important as product is education. OPI employs 150 educators across the 
country, former nail technicians who teach proper manicure techniques and 
in-salon retailing. The emphasis is on professionalism because Weiss-Fischmann 
disapproves of nail shops with lax sanitation and service. "You can't hide a 
bad nail job," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are nails so dear to the hearts of Californians? "It started with the 
glamour of the movie industry in the '30s," Weiss-Fischmann says, "and here, 
our hands are constantly exposed." She credits the abundant natural light and 
our local love of sports with two major nail trends: natural, sheer pink and 
peach nail lacquers; and the resilient, active-length nail she calls a 
"squoval" -- squared-off with rounded edges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nail industry is the fastest-growing part of the beauty business. It's an 
incredible phenomenon," she says. And what is OPI's contribution? "There's no 
more Madge the Manicurist -- we've legitimized the nail industry." LESA

RIVIERA REVERIE; HOT JAZZ, COOL PRICES, WARM SETTING: ALL THIS AND FINE FRENCH 
PROVENCAL FARE, TOO

 We settle into wicker armchairs at a quiet table at the back of Lunaria, a 
Provencal restaurant in Century City, and admire the spirited watercolors of 
Provence that cover the walls -- all painted, we are told, by Andre 
Montpellier, grandfather of Lunaria's owner, Bernard Jacoupy. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiter approaches. "The soup tonight," he begins, "is broccoli." We strain 
forward, revving up our memories to absorb a barrage of specials. But we're 
reprieved. That's it: one special. Catching my eye, the waiter rushes in to 
assure me that the soup has no cream. Do I look like someone who's afraid of 
cream? I decide to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 I've got nothing against the vegetable, but you'd have to be crazy to go for 
the broccoli soup, however good, when you could start with ragout of fat snails 
in chive juice with a light pastry filled with mushrooms and pigs' trotters. Or 
the incredibly delicious ravioli filled with lamb that's been braised for seven 
hours, sauced with a beautiful red wine reduction and tossed with button 
mushrooms, pearl onions and smoky lardons. A salad of air-dried beef and warm 
red potato draped with raclette cheese has a direct earthy appeal. Admittedly, 
the Roma tomato tart doesn't sound promising, but the deep-flavored tomatoes 
set atop fragrant sweet basil tastes of full-blown summer, despite the driving 
rain outside. The cold grilled eggplant and tomato roulade with a sweet red 
pepper sauce is just as focused in flavor. The grilled Portobello mushrooms, 
however, definitely need a lift, and the dressing on the steak tartare is 
overbearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Pierre Bosc, the Frenchman who won a following at Fennel, has quietly 
taken Lunaria's kitchen in hand. This is one chef who knows how to coax deep, 
intense flavors from his ingredients. He also knows how to make a sauce. For 
several years, Lunaria has been known for Mediterranean food; Bosc has expanded 
this specialty, offering sophisticated French cooking at moderate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how he does it, but his Saint-Tropez fish soup tastes very much 
like the soupe de poissons served up and down the French Riviera. It's thick. 
It's brown. It's ugly-looking stuff made from all the little bony fish savored 
more for their flavor than their looks, cooked together, bones and all, and 
then strained out. It comes with croutons made from slices of skinny baguette. 
Dab some of the rouille (this one a tame version of the normally fiery 
mayonnaise) on a few croutons and float them in the soup. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bosc makes a bouillabaisse, he uses this same soupe de poissons as the 
base and poaches filet of red mullet (a Mediterranean fish), scallops, shrimp 
and mussels in it.  
</P>
<P>
 He's also a chef who takes the time and care to make good stocks. Each "pearl" 
of the round pasta that stands in for the rice in his seafood paella is coated 
with a flavorful fish fumet to make an elegant, light variation on the Spanish 
dish, this one studded with squid, scallops, shrimp and mussels and potatoes. 
And a rich stock upholds the complex flavor of his wild-mushroom-and-asparagus 
risotto. 
</P>
<P>
 He does wonderful things with braised and stewed dishes. The veal daube is a 
seductive simmer of chunks of veal with thick meaty lardons and tiny onions 
served with rustic garlic mashed potatoes. And I loved the Provencal artichoke 
"stew" served with the simply roasted rack of lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 The minute the waiter set the plate down, I knew Bosc's duck confit was right. 
It smelled just like the confit a friend from Southwest France serves whenever 
I visit. The duck's crackling-crisp skin and moist, seasoned flesh was paired 
with soft ribbons of cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass up the more expensive beef tenderloin for the French butcher cut. It's 
not as butter-tender and should be ordered rare or at most medium rare, but 
it's a very tasty cut of beef smothered in caramelized shallots and sauced with 
a red wine and vinegar reduction.  
</P>
<P>
 We're halfway through our entrees when the wall behind us literally begins to 
move. Suddenly our quiet table at the back is now stage front, and a jazz trio 
and singer launch into an extended tune at full volume. (What we didn't know is 
that Lunaria is also a full-fledged jazz club.) We struggle on to finish our 
conversation, feeling a bit guilty we're not devoting our full attention to the 
music but annoyed that we weren't given a choice of tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts? We take the easy way out and order the dessert platter for four. 
Does it include the clafoutis ? The creme bru lee ? Yes, we're assured. When it 
comes to the table, we've got enough sweets for twice as many people. Raspberry 
clafoutis and a matching scoop of sorbet, an apple tart with a sticky caramel 
sauce, a fancy banana tart and more are all quite good. Just as we are about to 
question its absence, the waiter sets down the textbook-perfect creme bru lee.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people go to Lunaria for the food, some for the music, but you don't 
really have to choose one or the other. For theatergoers, the restaurant has a 
three-course dinner for $17.95 from 6 to 7 nightly. (The Shubert Theatre is 
just two blocks away; the AMC movie theater complex in the Century City 
Shopping Center is across the street.) Considering who's cooking, this offers 
what the French call tre s bon qualite-prix -- great quality for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunaria Restaurant and Jazz Club, 10351 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 
282-8870. Open Tuesday through Friday for lunch, Tuesday through Saturday for 
dinner. Full bar. Valet parking. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, 
food only, $44 to $77.

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Berger 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he sat there perusing the 100-plus-wine list at Lunaria recently, my friend 
winced and said, "I thought you praised the wine list." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did," I said, "but that was 3 1/2 years ago."Much has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, when Bernard Jacoupy opened Lunaria in 1990, he acquired some 
wines from a failed Orange County restaurant and offered a lot of older wines 
at fair prices. All those wines are gone now, and though there is a wider 
selection than existed at the outset, prices have risen, so only the 
cognoscenti will have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stick primarily to Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon will have a 
hard time finding a good value. Prices are twice retail in most cases, and even 
more than that over what you'd pay in a discount shop. 
</P>
<P>
 (Case in point: 1989 Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon sells in most shops for $18, 
and at a few discounters for $13.89; here it's $36.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, you have to know something about unusual wines to get anything of 
value. Among white wines, I'd pick 1992 Ferrari-Carano Fume Blanc, $17.50, or 
1991 Navarro Gewurztraminer, $22; among reds, a good buy is 1990 Franciscan 
Merlot, $22.50. Dan Berger

 Try to imagine those dueling Norma Desmonds, Patti LuPone and Glenn Close, on 
the same stage together. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the creators of "Forbidden Broadway 1994" imagined. Stand-ins for 
LuPone and Close will be on display in a "Sunset Boulevard" sketch, one of 25 
in the L.A. edition of the famous satirical revue, opening April 17 at the 
Tiffany Theatre on (where else?) Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York edition of the show, which ran almost continuously from 1982 
until January, added a "Sunset Boulevard" parody last fall, depicting the 
struggle between LuPone and producer/composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. Close was 
not a character in that one. So a new sketch was written for L.A., where Close 
has been starring in "Sunset" since December. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the five "Forbidden" cast members, who are coming straight from the 
New York production, have actually seen "Sunset Boulevard," but "I'm sure we'll 
be able to get good seats," said co-producer John Freedson. "We have the same 
press agent" as "Sunset Boulevard" itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. run also has a local executive producer, Barry Brown, moonlighting 
from his day job as producer of Long Beach Civic Light Opera. Brown co-produced 
several of the hits "Forbidden Broadway" has parodied, such as "La Cage aux 
Folles" and the recent revivals of "Gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Sunset" gags will be the only brand-new material in the L.A. edition. But 
most of the other sketches will be new to L.A. The revue had a successful run 
at the Comedy Store in 1983, but hasn't returned except for a one-night stand 
in Malibu three years ago, Freedson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a different edition of "Forbidden Broadway" will make a few 
Southland stops, appearing at Santa Barbara's Lobero Theatre on Friday, the 
Norris Theatre in Rolling Hills Estates on March 24-25, Citrus College's Haugh 
Performing Arts Center in Glendora on March 26 and Pepperdine's Smothers 
Theatre in Malibu on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The touring version features older material than the one that will play the 
Tiffany and "is geared to an audience that isn't that theater-savvy," Freedson 
said. Nine sketches are in both versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedson arrived in L.A. last week to hear the news of the Supreme Court's 
ruling in favor of 2 Live Crew's right to parody "Oh, Pretty Woman." As parody 
is the whole point of "Forbidden Broadway," he was happy at the prospect of 
greater freedom from those who are parodied. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the show's targets laugh along with the joke -- Freedson said that 
Stephen Sondheim has urged the show's creators to "make it mean," and the 
oft-parodied Carol Channing will host an AIDS benefit preview of "Forbidden" on 
April 12. But others have complained -- the creators of "The Will Rogers 
Follies" vigorously protested the company's parody of that show's 
"Will-a-Mania" song. In the "Forbidden Broadway" version, it was initially 
called "Swill-a-Mania."

ON THE RECORD: SVENDSEN, TOSTI, UCCELLINI: A TRIO OF RARE DELIGHTS

 It's a minor miracle that the recording companies are still capable of pulling 
off repertory surprises. No, not another definitive reinterpretation on 
absolutely authentic instruments of the ur-ur version of some familiar work, 
but a recording of worthwhile music that has escaped the notice of the A&R 
people altogether or of once-familiar material fallen into neglect for no 
perceptible reason beyond changes in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Deutsche Grammophon made somewhat of a splash with its hyping, via 
dazzlingly accomplished performances from Musica Antiqua Koln, of an obscure 
German Baroque composer named Johann David Heinichen. Part of the critical 
community hailed him as the "new" Handel, or Bach or Vivaldi. To these ears, 
his stuff sounded like Vivaldi rejects, which might be interpreted as a double 
insult. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more substance and originality, if far less flash, in the works of 
Marco Uccellini (1610-1680), an Italian composer whose name and music were 
unknown to this listener prior to the recent release of "La Bergamasca" 
(Harmonia Mundi 907066), a collection of brief, harmonically pungent dances in 
superbly vital performances by the Arcadian Academy, who are members of San 
Francisco's Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, directed from the keyboard by 
Philharmonia's music director, Nicholas McGegan. 
</P>
<P>
 Uccellini, an employee of the cathedral of Modena and the Farnese court in 
Parma, scored these dance-inspired pieces for one or two violins (here, 
Elizabeth Blumenstock and Katherine Kyme), with the continuo assigned by 
McGegan variously to cello (David Bowles), archlute or guitar (David Tayler) 
and harpsichord or organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Uccellini shows himself to have been a master of variation form and an 
inventive melodist in these 18 brief dances, which are about equally divided 
between the lively (the title tune is an irresistible toe-tapper) and the 
gravely elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 A much later Italian-born composer, Francesco Paolo Tosti, wrote some of 
Victorian England's greatest hits in addition to serving as singing teacher to 
the British royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 His ties with England notwithstanding -- he became a British subject in 1906 
and was knighted two years later -- Tosti's music was quintessentially Italian, 
represented by such evergreens as "La Serenata," "A vucchella," "Ideale," 
"L'ultima canzone," "Mattinata" and "Non t'amo piu." 
</P>
<P>
 These exquisitely refined, intimate songs, long abused by operatic golden 
throats backed by lush symphony orchestras, are restored to their pristine 
grace via the sweet and true tenorino and sensitive word-pointing of 
Peruvian-born Ernesto Palacio (Arkadia 125.1). 
</P>
<P>
 The songs, originally piano-accompanied, are presented here in evocative, 
period-style arrangements employing varying combinations of piano, violin, 
flute, guitar, harp and cello. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Norwegian composer Johan Svendsen is remembered at all it is for his 
erstwhile salon favorite, the lovely Violin Romance in G. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing even faintly "important" about Svendsen's music, but it does 
possess, like that of his older countryman, Edvard Grieg, a certain yearning, 
undemonstrative sweetness that we have come to regard as typically 
Scandinavian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romance is executed with winning simplicity by Kenneth Sillito and his 
colleagues of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields Chamber Ensemble. But on 
the same CD (Chandos 9258), Svendsen shows himself capable of filling out a 
more substantial form with his appealingly sentimental lyricism: a String Octet 
in A, otherwise unavailable on recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 The rare and faultlessly presented program from the Academy players also 
includes the folksily tuneful String Quintet in G of the 23-year-old Carl 
Nielsen. It offers no hint of the harmonic originality or rhythmic complexity 
of the later, symphonic Nielsen, but there are flashes of the quirky 
composer-to-come in the handsomely crafted opening movement's darting forays 
into distant, usually minor, keys.

 MARIA IVOGUN: SONGS AND ARIAS. Various orchestras and conductors, Michael 
Raucheisen, piano. Nimbus NI 7832. Chiefly remembered now as the mentor of Erna 
Berger and the teacher of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the Hungarian-born soprano was 
one of the most important singers prior to WWI and into the early '30s -- 
though she sang very little in North America.As shown in "Lo! Here the gentle 
lark," the Handel excerpt and the Strauss waltzes, she had remarkable fluency 
and accuracy above the staff -- way above. But she could also be a marvelously 
expressive singer, as proved in the "Traviata" solo (sung in German) and the 
second half of the "Lucia" Mad Scene. Her voice was not all top-heavy, either. 
The middle and lower ranges are shown to be rich and full in Nicolai's "Nun 
eilt herbei" and a gutsy "Fledermaus" Csardas, as well as a heartfelt "Die 
Post" of Schubert. Her embellishments may seem overdone by today's tastes, but 
she was in every way a remarkable singer. WALTER PRICE

 VIVE LES AMATEURS DU PIANO. Theo Lieven and Hannes Keller, piano, Jana Werner, 
soprano, Gunter Thomasberger and Attila Szekely, cello, Eric Kushner, horn.Vive 
les amateurs records 1. This recording is of interest mainly for the 
extramusical accomplishments of the German-born pianists, who have found fame 
and fortune through their mathematical and entrepreneurial talents. 
Nevertheless, despite the flawed and often lackluster performances here -- that 
even the collaboration of three members of the Vienna Symphony, for Schumann's 
Andante and Variations cannot salvage -- there is an apparent joy in the 
process with which many amateurs may identify. Heller does offer a slightly 
unsteady but delicate and reasonably convincing Scarlatti sonata. "Es ist so 
leicht," from the musical "Nostalgie," by Alexis Weissenberg, who encouraged 
the making of this recording, stands out for its simplicity, conveyed by 
Werner's clear, reedy and innocent-sounding soprano. SUSAN BLISS

 VERDI: "Falstaff." Jose van Dam, Luciana Serra, Paolo Coni, Elizabeth 
Norberg-Schultz, Luca Canonici, Mariana Lipovsek, others; Berlin Radio Choir 
and Berlin Philharmonic, Sir Georg Solti, conductor.London 440 650-2. Solti's 
approach to late Verdi is much as it has been in the past: slashing orchestral 
attacks worthy of "Salome" or "Walkure," and X-ray precision in place of 
lyrical expansion. Only in Fenton's and Nanneta's arias in the last act is any 
kind of repose or relaxation allowed, much less encouraged. The orchestra, 
which would probably stand on its head musically if asked, gives Solti 
everything he wants. The cast is uneven, but it does have a worthy center in 
the sensitive and surprisingly touching Falstaff of Van Dam. Serra is a rather 
acidic Alice, Coni a workaday, sometimes hard-pressed Ford, whose "E sogno?" is 
conducted and sung as a baritone turn comparable to "Di quella pira." Lipovsek 
lacks the plummy contralto of a proper Quickly, but Norberg and Canonici 
contribute lovely soft-edged tones as the youngsters. The sound, taken from 
live performances in the Philharmonie in March, 1993, is superb. WALTER PRICE

 TCHAIKOVSKY: "Pikovaya Dama." Maria Guleghina, Gegam Grigorian, Vladimir 
Chernov, Irina Arkhipova, Olga Borodina, others; forces of Kirov Opera, Valery 
Gergiev, conductor.Philips 438 141-2. The former Soviet Union may be in 
shambles, but, judging from this release, St. Petersburg's Kirov is not. 
Music-director Gergiev leads one of the more sensuous, almost erotically 
propulsive accounts of Tchaikovsky's great score in years. Moreover, he has a 
mostly youthful cast (unhindered by former Soviet geriatric musical politics) 
that can do justice to all the crucial roles. Grigorian as Herman has to work 
hardest, but he manages both to sing with lovely tone and make his tenorial 
dramatic points without screaming. Guleghina's soprano is occasionally marred 
by a characteristic Slavic squal at the top, but the voice is otherwise healthy 
and she conveys Lisa's almost hysterical love with conviction. Chernov, as 
Yeletsky, delivers the strongest performance in the opera with sumptuous tone 
and imaginative color variety. Borodina's lustrous mezzo portends well as 
Pauline. The veteran, Arkhipova -- 67 years old at the time of the recording 
(1992) -- sounds almost too young in the title role. Splendid Philips sound 
with real presence. WALTER PRICE

 LILY PONS IN RECITAL. Various orchestras, Maurice Abravanel, Pietro Cimara and 
Andre Kostelanetz, conductors. Sony MPK 45694. Pons' light, Gallic coloratura 
soprano was a mainstay in the opera house and on the concert stage for more 
than 30 years.The sound was small, silvery and without vibrato. The top, give 
or take some occasional pitch problems, was impressively secure; the bottom 
almost nonexistent. Among these Columbia recordings from the middle and late 
'40s, Pons is at her best in the French works, especially a truly bravura Bell 
Song and some equally adept Meyerbeer ("Ombre legere") and Thomas ("Je suis 
Titania"). She is able to mold and sustain a lyric Verdian line in "Tutte le 
feste" from "Rigoletto," but her decorations in "Son vergin vezzosa" betray an 
almost innocent ignorance of Bellini style. These days, after the often 
introspective pyrotechnics of the larger-voiced Callas, Sutherland, Anderson 
and Studer, Pons' work seems endearingly old-fashioned, even quaint. WALTER

 BEL CANTO ARIAS. Kathleen Battle, soprano; London Philharmonic, Bruno 
Campanella, conductor. Deutsche Grammophon 435 866-2. Battle's impressive, 
light soprano has seldom sounded in such good estate -- melting legato, 
effortless high notes, exquisite piano tones, trills, staccatos, exemplary 
diction -- most of the resources in her vocal arsenal are pulled out for 
inspection.However, the joy she expresses in such an aria as "Partir, o ciel!" 
from Rossini's "Viaggio a Reims," over having a favorite hat returned to her, 
is not to the ear much different from that produced upon hearing that her lover 
is triumphant in war in the "Ah! D'amor in tal momento" section of "Giusto Dio" 
from "Tancredi," or that another lover in Amina's "Ah! Non giunge" from 
Bellini's "Sonnambula" has returned to her, begging forgiveness. The sound is 
beautiful, but one really wants more. Battle makes a good stab at a bit of 
comic bitchiness in Norina's "Pasquale" aria; that's about the only variation 
from her norm. An intriguing but vague program note thanks Renata Scotto for 
"assistance" in the recording. It's a safe bet there was no dramatic coaching 
involved from that fiery lady. WALTER PRICE

 "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" 
</P>
<P>
 Arista  
</P>
<P>
 * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 On McLachlan's third album, her singing is formal and studied, like the 
performance of an actress portraying a New Age troubadour in a stage musical. 
When intensity is called for, producer Pierre Marchand just generates another 
vocal track and layers it on, instead of requiring McLachlan to reach for 
something and disturb the regularity of her lulling murmur. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchand sustains a portentous throb as he weaves the electronic-folk-ethnic 
environment that's become the standard setting for introspective 
singer-songwriters in the '90s. It's an aural womb where feelings are signified 
rather than summoned and conveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 McLachlan's occasionally evocative words often involve the ways that love 
tangles things up, tracing a struggle to achieve a breakthrough of a spirit 
stifled by denial, obsession and need. They're not really powerful or 
especially demanding, and while the production fits them out with banners of 
urgency, her delivery is oblivious to any tensions or nuances. 
</P>
<P>
 This preoccupation with seductive surfaces makes McLachlan a good bet in the 
mellow-music marketplace, but at a time when women's perspective is being 
expressed so provocatively by such artists as Liz Phair and PJ Harvey, this 
seems especially timid and tepid. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 R. Kelly's "12 Play," No. 3 on The Times' Southern California chart, is surely 
one of the steamiest albums ever to make the Top 10. Gangsta rap albums are 
more into violence and dissing women than this kind of flagrantly sexy chatter. 
His racy single "Bump 'n' Grind" -- No. 5 on the regional chart and No. 1 
nationally -- is driving album sales. But if you think R. Kelly's rise signals 
a downturn in the moral fiber of record buyers, remember that relentlessly 
wholesome Celine Dion tops the pop singles chart ("The Power of Love") and is 
second on the album chart with "The Colour of My Love." TOP 10 ALBUMS

 They don't make records like this anymore -- acoustic folk music in the truest 
sense, current yet not time-bound, earnest yet playful, somber yet bold, 
ambitious yet compact. Tracy Chapman and the Indigo Girls have made the most 
notable attempts in recent years, but they bogged down somewhere along the 
line.You might have to go back to the late Tim Buckley's earliest, most focused 
late-'60s albums to find a comparison for this Inland Empire newcomer's debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's voice, in fact, seems like an airy echo of Buckley's otherworldly 
singing, as well as an echo of his own elastic, acoustic slide guitar licks. At 
his best he uses the softness of his voice as a weapon with cutting attacks on 
cultural divisiveness ("Don't Take That Attitude to Your Grave," "How Many 
Miles Must We March") and personal hurt ("Walk Away"). His youth makes him 
forgivable for sometimes overreaching, especially on the strained, obvious 
Martin Luther King/Rodney King analogies of "Like a King," but that same 
innocence helps him put over some sly social twists on the bouncy "Mama's Got a 
Girlfriend Now." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the appeal of his folk-blues melodies is immediate, the depth of 
his emotions rewarding and the promise of his talent noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 "All Men Are Brothers: A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield" 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.  
</P>
<P>
 * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 These days, just about every songwriter who's produced a body of hits big 
enough to fill a CD has been the subject of a tribute album.But only truly 
great artists can claim two such collections, as Mayfield, perhaps the most 
articulate of '70s soul's many eloquent exponents, now can. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the Shanachie label released an album of his songs performed by 
other artists; now comes this similar project, with bigger names. The proceeds 
from both go to defray Mayfield's medical expenses, which have piled up since 
he was paralyzed in 1990 when a stage lighting rig fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
 This collection boasts Mayfield's first recording since the accident, a 
stirring remake of his "Let's Do It Again," which was a hit for the Staple 
Singers. The most successful cuts are Lenny Kravitz's "Billy Jack," a suave, 
understated slice of cool '70s soul, and Eric Clapton's supple, sexy "You Must 
Believe Me," originally recorded by Mayfield's '60s group the Impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Less inspiring are nondescript, rote contributions from the likes of Whitney 
Houston, Elton John and Stevie Wonder, though Bruce Springsteen and Steve 
Winwood acquit themselves well on two sturdy Impressions numbers. Ultimately, 
"All Men Are Brothers" is most remarkable for what's missing: No one tackles 
either of the songs most associated with Mayfield -- "Superfly" and "Freddie's 
Dead." 
</P>

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 * * 1/2 Various artists, "Reality Bites" soundtrack, RCA. Strange how 
bookending this collection with the Knack's "My Sharona" and Big Mountain's 
reggae remake of Peter Frampton's "Baby I Love Your Way" makes everything in 
between -- including strong selections from Juliana Hatfield, Dinosaur Jr. and 
even U2 (the elegant "All I Want Is You") -- seem like guilty-pleasure pop 
fluff.It offers few insights to the movie's Gen X themes, but it sure beats 
your average hour of radio programming. New albums are rated on a scale of one 
star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

POP EYE: BLUE SUEDE SHOES FOR BONO AND THE BOSS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From Frank to Elvis? 
</P>
<P>
 That might be Bono's next salute to a personal hero. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is confirming, but the word is that U2's singer -- fresh from his 
passionate tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes on the recent Grammy show -- is set to 
participate in a Graceland-sponsored Presley tribute scheduled for Oct. 8 at 
the 14,000-seat Pyramid arena in Memphis. The affair will be telecast worldwide 
and later released on home video and CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers would not confirm who is being asked to perform, but Pop Eye has 
learned that Bruce Springsteen is also among artists who have been approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Springsteen and Bono would both be naturals for the show. Seeing Elvis on "The 
Ed Sullivan Show" in the '50s made Springsteen want to be in rock 'n' roll, and 
Bono assumed an Elvis-like persona, gold lame suit and all, during the group's 
1992-93 tour. He also contributed a version of "Can't Help Falling in Love" to 
the "Honeymoon in Vegas" soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first Elvis tribute event officially sanctioned by the Elvis 
Presley estate. Priscilla Presley, the executor of the estate, has long refused 
to endorse proposals for such shows.  
</P>
<P>
 "Until now, Priscilla has not been comfortable with the concept of a tribute," 
says Bob Geddes, partner of L.A.-based Avalon Attractions, which is producing 
the show in conjunction with the Presley estate and the Creative Artists 
Agency. "But now she believes the timing is right." 
</P>
<P>
 A key to the decision to do the show, says Presley estate spokesman David 
Beckwith, is that it will in part benefit the T.J. Martell Foundation, a music 
industry organization for cancer and AIDS research, and the Memphis-based St. 
Jude Children's Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 Geddes and Avalon partner Brian Murphy are putting together a diverse lineup 
that will draw upon performers from many musical genres. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be doing a lot of Elvis material and/or material of their own 
influenced by Elvis," Geddes says. "We're going to script the show so it's not 
the typical tribute event. We want it to be more than just a rotation of 
artists on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the television plans -- including possible pay-per-view broadcast 
-- are expected to be announced next month, with the talent roster to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the expected huge demand for tickets, Graceland will hold what is, 
in effect, a lottery. Just the rumors of a tribute show led to Graceland's 
being flooded with enough ticket requests from Germany alone to fill the 
arena.Steve Hochman

POP FACES: HADDAWAY; SINGER WON'T STAY LONG IN DANCE-MUSIC GENRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Haddaway, conventional is a dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I avoid being conventional -- I hate the thought of it," says the pop-dance 
singer, whose single "What Is Love" was a long-running Top 40 hit at the 
beginning of the year. The follow-up, "Life (Everybody Needs Somebody to 
Love)," is bubbling under the Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddaway, 29, may be the only dance-music star ever who's both a medical 
school dropout and a former prosperous marketing executive. He's also an 
international nomad. He was born Nestor Alexander Haddaway in Trinidad, the son 
of a nurse and a marine biologist. He was raised in Chicago and the Washington, 
D.C., area, has worked in Germany and is currently a resident of Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I really call any place home," Haddaway says. "I can't say that 
will change. Maybe it's because I'm always looking for some kind of 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of excitement drove him from med school in 1984. In the music business, 
he says, there's hardly a dull moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a continuous challenge -- never boring. There's an excitement about 
singing and this business that I can't find anywhere else. I always loved to 
sing, from the time I was very young -- all kinds of music." 
</P>
<P>
 During college and his tenure as a marketing executive, Haddaway moonlighted 
as a singer. In Germany, he joined a band, Elegato, that turned out to be 
fairly successful, leading to some studio work. His big break was hooking up 
with producers Dee Dee Halligan and Junior Turello, who created "What Is Love," 
which Haddaway parlayed into European stardom and a U.S. contract with Arista 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd make a living at this because I didn't think I could sing 
well enough," Haddaway explains. 
</P>
<P>
 But he isn't a bad singer, and his first album, "Haddaway," which has a '70s 
disco sound, is one of the best dance collections of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like just about everybody else in the dance-music genre, though, he's looking 
for a way out: "Being typed as a dance-music artist is a death sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't he already typed? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," Haddaway insists. "I'm making sure that won't happen. Wait until 
my next album. You'll see a different side of me." DENNIS HUNT

POP FACES: MARK CHESNUTT; HE'S FOLLOWING JONES FROM TEXAS TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to find a country singer who doesn't idolize George Jones, the 
preeminent country vocalist of the last three decades. But for Mark Chesnutt, a 
son of Beaumont, Tex., the link runs deeper than with most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always fascinated with George Jones because he was also from Beaumont, 
and I was playing in some of the same old joints he had played in," Chesnutt 
says. "My daddy was a friend of George, and I was always hearing George Jones 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Chesnutt, 27, has emerged in his three albums, including the current "Almost 
Goodbye," as one of country's most reliable hit-makers. His latest success is 
"I Just Wanted You to Know," a recent No. 1 on the singles chart. But it's been 
a long road. After dropping out of high school to pursue music, he worked 
relentlessly in southeast Texas clubs and released a string of independent 
singles before landing a record deal with MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming a lack of image and hunk appeal, he's established himself with a 
down-home style that reflects his early influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when George and Merle (Haggard) and all these guys were starting out, 
country music was a lot different," he says. "It had to be real. It didn't have 
the mass-media attention it does now. So these guys were really singing from 
the heart. They weren't trying to sell a product, they weren't trying to get 
airplay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys you listen to on the radio nowadays, it just sounds like 
they're trying to cash in on something. It sounds like they're reading words 
off a piece of paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Chesnutt has also fulfilled his George Jones fantasies. Jones sang with him on 
his second album's "Talking to Hank," and Chesnutt says proudly that he was the 
first singer summoned when Jones began rounding up partners for a new duet 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of advice does the kid get from the old champ? 
</P>
<P>
 "He tells me, 'Don't (mess) up,' " says Chesnutt, laughing at the irony of the 
once-notorious messer-upper giving such counsel. "When he sees me he says, 
'Well, I ain't heard nothing bad about you so I don't think you're (messing) 
up, are you?' " RICHARD CROMELIN

 AND ONE MORE THING: Los Lobos fans can breathe a sigh of relief: The East L.A. 
band is not breaking up. There have been whispers of late about a rift in the 
band over creative direction, with the more impressionistic sound of the band's 
last album, "Kiko," allegedly rankling the more roots-rock-oriented Cesar 
Rosas. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors of tension grew as members David Hidalgo and Louie Perez worked on 
a side project as the Latin Playboys (an album, with an emphasis on the 
"Kiko"-like experimentation, is due this week), while Rosas produced albums by 
the Paladins and the Blazers, two Southern California roots-rock acts, and 
started writing songs for a possible solo album. 
</P>
<P>
 But the band's management says that there is no division and that Los Lobos is 
happily at work on a children's album of Mexican folk music. The band will do a 
summer concert tour before starting work on a regular album in the fall.

 Made by "Sweetie" and "The Piano's" iconoclastic Jane Campion, this remarkable 
1990 release is an amazing biography of Janet Frame, New Zealand's most 
celebrated novelist and poet whose struggles as an artist are intensified by 
her long ordeal as an incorrectly diagnosed schizophrenic. It stars Kerry Fox 
in a portrayal that is both heroic and profoundly illuminating. Karen Fergusson 
(center) plays Frame as a child (Bravo Friday at 6 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 SMALL FACES: Who better to re-record "Sympathy for the Devil" than Sandra 
Bernhard, one of the few people with lips to match Mick Jagger's? That's one of 
the songs that will be on Bernhard's upcoming all-music album, tentatively 
titled "Excuses for Bad Behavior, Pt. One." Most of the songs are originals, 
but in addition to the Stones number, there's a version of the late disco star 
Sylvester's "Mighty Real." . . . Chris Hillman has officially broken up the 
Desert Rose Band, saying that after 30 years of being on the road (he was also 
a founding member of the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers) he wants to 
take a break to concentrate on songwriting.

 Director Mike Leigh leaves you speechless with this eccentric 1991 film that 
is at once surreal and very real, a film in which nothing happens and 
everything is experienced.Leigh concentrates on a working-class family living 
in a north London suburb: Wendy (Alison Steadman), her husband Andy (Jim 
Broadbent) and their twin teen-age daughters Natalie (Claire Skinner) and 
Nicola (Jane Horrocks, pictured, with Timothy Spall). It's Nicola, all 
wire-rimmed glasses and attitude, given to hostile manifestoes on the order of 
"all men are potential rapists," who drives her family crazy. After the 
laughter comes anger, sadness and pain (Bravo Saturday at 7:30 p.m.). Kenneth 
Turan

 This 1993 film is every boy's life, every child's nightmare. Told with 
unblinking truthfulness and remarkable sensitivity by writer Robert Getchell, 
its true story of one particular and painful coming of age manages to touch us 
all.The ensemble work of Ellen Barkin, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro is 
expressive without overdoing it and almost hypnotic in its honesty. Although 
the 18-year-old DiCaprio got lots of justifiable attention for his finely 
nuanced work as a teen-ager trapped in an inner and outer storm, it is De 
Niro's shattering performance as stepfather Dwight Hansen, the warped 
disciplinarian, that is the film's core (Cinemax Saturday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth 
Turan

 Psychological thrillers are only as effective as their villains, and this 1993 
film serves up one hell of a suspenseful specimen.Barney Cousins is his name, 
and as played by Jeff Bridges, he is an only too believable maniac, oozing a 
kind of bumbling menace that is totally chilling. Bridges' Barney is a college 
chemistry professor in the Pacific Northwest, a loving father and faithful 
husband, a man you could pass on the street without feeling in mortal danger. 
Directed by George Sluizer, who also directed the original 1988 Dutch version. 
With Nancy Travis and Kiefer Sutherland (both pictured) as co-stars (HBO 
Saturday at 9 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; SAMARIA GRAHAM: IS SHE WHAT 'BLOSSOM' NEEDS TO STAY 
FRESH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 A good many up-and-coming actresses would jump like a winning game-show 
contestant after landing a role on a hit TV series. Not this actress. Not 
Samaria Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Midseason, Graham joined the cast of the NBC hit series "Blossom." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really excited about it," she says. "It's just another job. I mean, 
I'm happy, but I'm not thrilled or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The former substitute teacher won the role of Tony's (Michael Stoyanov) wife, 
Shelly, over many other contenders. It's a part that the show's producers hope 
will enhance the story line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blossom" executive producer Judith Allison says, "We had quite a search. We 
needed the character to not be the traditional sitcom girlfriend or wife. After 
nearly five years and 90 episodes, stories were hard to come by, and with Tony, 
we thought it would be appropriate for him to marry and marry interracially. We 
needed to expand our horizons, and we did. We found Samaria." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's introduction to the series came in an episode where Tony, devastated 
over a breakup with his longtime girlfriend, takes off for Las Vegas. There, 
the longtime recovering alcoholic goes on a bender. He wakes up with a hangover 
and a new wife. On their drive back to Los Angeles, Shelly and Tony fall in 
love, and decide to stay married. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Allison and her husband, creator/co-producer Don Reo, have to determine 
where to take the show from here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to figure out if she should get pregnant," Allison says. "Since 
she's so independent, we don't know if she would want to be. The marriage is so 
new yet." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from New York's Music and Art High School and the University 
of New York at Fredonia, Graham taught in the New York public school system. 
While teaching, she continued to audition for musical-theater roles. She 
starred in both "Tough" and "Really Rosie." 
</P>
<P>
 She got her start on TV in the afterschool special "Girlfriend," which was 
nominated for an NAACP Image Award. An appearance in the 1993 Forest 
Whitaker-directed cable movie "Strapped" led to the "Blossom" audition. And 
she'll make her feature film debut in Penny Marshall's "Renaissance Man," 
starring Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of what she does, says the actress, is "just work and I'll just keep 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 One part she wouldn't mind tackling is that of a killer. "Everyone I play is 
nice and innocent," she says between laughs, "I want to play a psycho woman, a 
crazy lady who no one would suspect would kill someone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she's on hiatus and in the market to audition "for more juicy 
work." Being an actress is, after all, just another job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blossom" airs a special "clip" show Monday at 9 p.m. , then moves into its 
new time s lot, Saturdays at 8 p.m. on NBC.

ON VIEW; THE PARENT CLASH; ABC'S 'THUNDER ALLEY' MINES LAUGHS OUT OF A 
GENERATION GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A gruff but lovable grandpa, his daughter and her three sometimes-sassy kids 
all live under one roof in the new sitcom "Thunder Alley," but star Ed Asner 
insists the show won't get too cute. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lou Grant might say, "I hate cute." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to be the first one to throw up if it gets that way," says Asner. 
</P>
<P>
 As retired stock car racer Gil Jones, he spars with his divorced daughter 
Bobbi (Diane Venora) when she moves in with her three tykes (Kelly Vint, 
Lindsay Felton and Haley Joel Osment). 
</P>
<P>
 It might sound like family sitcom formula, but the show's creators (the team 
behind the mega-hit "Home Improvement") insist they are breaking the mold by 
pitting baby boom parenting vs. its 1990s counterpart. With kids, Gil lays down 
the law, no questions asked, while Bobbi shows compassion and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids and parenting seem to be a central obsession of the '90s," says Matt 
Williams, the fortysomething executive producer of the show along with David 
McFadzean and Carmen Finestra. "There are worlds of differences in how we 
raised our kids and how our parents raised us. This seems like rich territory 
that I don't think gets explored in a sitcom." 
</P>
<P>
 To start off, they didn't want a grandfather who dotters in a rocking chair 
and sounds like a crank. 
</P>
<P>
 So they looked to aging Indianapolis stock car racers Al Unser and Johnny 
Rutherford. Williams and the other producers visited them last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all said that stock car racers were the most egotistical guys on Earth," 
Williams says. "Johnny Rutherford said, 'We honestly believe we can do 
anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Gil will enjoy the occasional thrill, and he will still interact 
with racers as the owner of Thunder Alley Garage, a repair shop for sports 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be a vital, honest and sexy character," Williams says. "We love the 
idea of this guy as a sex symbol." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to finding their Gil, however, the list was short. It had to be a 
guy who was comfortable with kids. James Garner, who sped around in a Firebird 
on "The Rockford Files," was offered the part but turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was upfront: He didn't know if he wanted to do a series with a bunch of 
kids in front of a live audience," Williams says. 
</P>
<P>
 Asner also was on their short list. With "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Lou 
Grant" under his belt, he had no regrets taking the part. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny because of the way I drive," Asner says. "According to most 
people, if I became a stock car racer, I'd be dead. But that's show biz." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have trouble slipping into the role. Asner describes Gil Jones as a 
"touch of (Jackie) Gleason, a touch of Lou Grant, with wit and sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a more down-home boy (than Lou Grant)," he says. "But Lou Grant always 
talked to the jocks and was seen with them. Gil Jones is the ex-jock ... Lou 
Grant risked death for the Army in Europe, Gil Jones did it for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Asner likes the show's wit. Among Gil's words of wisdom to his 
daughter: "Parenting is not fun. Betting your will against theirs. And 
remember, they're waiting for you to die, and you're waiting for them to move 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's dialogue the 64-year-old actor hopes will come to match the quality of 
his previous shows. He won three Emmys for playing Lou Grant on CBS' "Mary 
Tyler Moore" in the 1970s. He won two more Emmys after he continued the role on 
the same network in the hourlong drama "Lou Grant," from 1977 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says he lost roles in the early 1980s. Asner believes network 
executives axed "Lou Grant" because of his politically charged tenure as 
president of the Screen Actors Guild and his opposition to U.S. policy in El 
Salvador. He believes that producers became skittish about hiring him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There certainly was not an organized blacklist on me," he says. "It was just 
gut reaction and cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
 His worked picked up in recent years, with a starring role for a season on 
"The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" and a recurring role on "Hearts Afire." But he 
still bristles when people think he was a rabble-rouser. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I hate more than people coming up to me now and saying, 'Hey 
Ed, staying out of trouble?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Producers and actors on "Thunder Alley" don't care about his politics. On the 
set, Asner is the old pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed knows it in his sleep," says Jim Beaver, who plays Leland, Gil's eccentric 
chief mechanic, who carries a pet rat on his shoulder. "He's an angel, an 
absolute professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Venora, whose credits are primarily in stage and film, looked to Asner for 
help to adjust to the fast pace of a sitcom. "Thunder Alley" is Venora's first 
major role after she cut her workload for several years to raise her daughter, 
now 14. Although a single parent herself, Venora says she's not 100% like her 
character on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see parents (like Bobbi) at shopping malls, where their child will 
say, 'I don't want to leave' and they will say, 'Well, let's talk about it.' I 
would just pick up the child and go." 
</P>
<P>
 On the show, the battle of the generations most times will be a draw, Venora 
says. Just not without some chuckles. And, with the kids there, is it really 
possible not to go warm and cuddly? 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be people out there who say it's too cute already," Asner says. 
"How mean can you be seen in contrast to the kids? But it's ... inching your 
way forward in creating the mold. Practice makes perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thunder Alley" airs Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.

PROFILE; SOUL SEARCHING; TIM ROTH SHRUGS OFF AVERSION TO AMERICAN TV TO LOSE 
HIMSELF IN TNT'S 'HEART OF DARKNESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 All's quiet on the set as British actor Tim Roth, dressed in a 
turn-of-the-century suit, enters a spacious room and, looking confused, makes 
his way silently toward another doorway where two women sit knitting. One of 
the women, dressed in black, has embroidered a white skull. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cut," says director Nicolas Roeg. Roth is walking too quickly, the director 
decides. Roeg walks through the scene himself, slowly, describing the pace and 
sensibility he is looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 years after it was written, Joseph Conrad's enigmatic novella, 
"Heart of Darkness," is finally going to be a movie. Others have attempted it, 
most notably Orson Welles, who reached an advanced stage of pre-production 
before abandoning the project in 1939 under the weight of technical and 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years later, Francis Ford Coppola took the basic outline of Conrad's 
book and set it against the Vietnam War for "Apocalypse Now." But until this 
year, no one has been able to faithfully transform the story to film. 
</P>
<P>
 Like an ever-increasing number of daring works bypassed by the feature film 
industry, however, "Heart of Darkness" is being made for cable TV. It will 
debut Sunday on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, who has won critical accolades for his work in such films as "Reservoir 
Dogs" and "Bodies, Rest & Motion," plays the story's lead character, Marlow. A 
young sea captain in the late 19th Century, Marlow is sent up the River Congo 
by a Belgian trading company to locate their station agent, Kurtz (John 
Malkovich), with whom they've lost contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Roth leapt at the opportunity to work with Roeg ("Don't Look Now," 
"The Man Who Fell to Earth"), he nearly missed his chance. After an unpleasant 
experience working on the ABC movie "Murder in the Heartland," he swore he'd 
never work on American TV again. ("The censorship really (expletive expletive) 
me off," he says, recalling what he saw as continual interference from network 
executives.) 
</P>
<P>
 So when the "Heart of Darkness" producers approached his agent about having 
him appear in the cable TV film, he says, "My agent just turned it down without 
even telling me what was going on." Once he found out about the offer, however, 
he signed on immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't even read the script when I agreed to do the thing," he says, 
sitting in a London cafe, across from the august building where the film's 
opening scenes are being shot. He has ordered a pack of cigarettes and a beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth doesn't want to say much about his interpretation of "Heart of Darkness," 
or his character, Marlow, preferring, instead, to let viewers form their own 
opinions. But he says that the story is "a journey into the big depths of your 
soul and what you see when you get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Roeg, whose fragmented and oblique style of filmmaking seems 
particularly suited for Conrad's obscure tale, proved to be as unusual as Roth 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the strangest position I've ever been in," he says. "From day to day, 
you don't really know what's going on. The more confused I was when we were 
filming, the better Nick liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth even professes to have found some enjoyment working amid the chaos and 
miserable conditions in Belize, where the cast and crew spent more than a month 
filming jungle scenes. "Heart" producers Bob Christiansen and Rick Rosenberg 
wrote a seven-page memo detailing the litany of horrors the film crew faced, 
including storms, disease, freak accidents, violent drug gangs, robberies, 
theft, tropical insects and a wayward monkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was insane," says Roth. "I liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in London to a leftist journalist and a painter, he moved to L.A. several 
years ago for the increased job opportunities. His explosive performance in the 
low-budget crime drama "Reservoir Dogs" brought him attention and big-money 
film offers. But he says he is torn between the things you do for money and the 
things you do for art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep enjoying acting and I'm managing to do that," he says. "And 
now I'm starting to get paid to do it, which is really good. Not being broke 
feels good. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the films I'd really like to do are going to make me broke again. They're 
so obscure and so strange. They appeal to me." 
</P>
<P>
 A "Heart of Darkness" production assistant approaches Roth to tell him he's 
needed on the set. He takes a last swallow of beer, grabs his cigarettes and 
stands up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I sticking you with the bill?" he asks. "Excellent. That's the way I like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart of Darkness" airs Sunday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m. on TNT .

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: ROBERTS' URBAN RUSTIC, TOMMY'S TANGY THAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Twin Palms celebrates the great California outdoors -- not the outdoors of 
nature and pine trees, but of cabanas and palm trees . . . the sunglass-shaded 
good life. Walk into this huge space on a weekend evening and you're apt to 
find yourself in the middle of what seems like a packed poolside party without 
the pool. A band plays in a tented stage designed to look like a bathhouse; two 
open-air bars, one at each end of the heated patio, are jammed. On an outdoor 
rotisserie, chickens slowly rotate; waiters and waitresses hustle through the 
crowd carrying plates of grilled sausages, huge bowls of bouillabaisse. 
</P>
<P>
 The big money behind the place comes from actor Kevin Costner; the big ideas 
behind the food come from former Trumps chef/owner Michael Roberts.  
</P>
<P>
 Bravely, Roberts has decided to put together a menu without any pasta. Instead 
there are cassoulets, roasted beef shanks, and pissaladiere -style pizza 
(inspired by the onion-and-anchovy pies of Nice). Where many restaurants get 
their ideas from the Italian side of the Mediterranean, Roberts looks to 
Provence. This is Urban Rustic cuisine, the kind of food you'd hope to get from 
a talented home cook holding an outdoor bash near Arles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dishes may be unfamiliar to locals: Crisp rounds of bread scoop up 
Roberts' take on Provencal-style brandade -- the kitchen blends mashed potatoes 
into the nicely pungent salt cod puree. Salt cod shows up again on the bar menu 
in crunchy fritters, "acras," served with rouille. There may be no angel hair 
pasta, and no steak either (though the crisp-skinned rotisserie chicken is 
good), but Twin Palms is a restaurant trying to show that casual, moderately 
priced restaurants don't have to be a bore. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twin Palms, 101 W. Green St., Pasadena, (818) 577-2567. Pizza, sandwiches 
and entrees $7-$15.50.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a block or two away from the party at Twin Palms, Tommy Tang, one 
of L.A.'s early Thai food pioneers (and one of the first to make Melrose Avenue 
a hot restaurant street), has opened a second Southland location. It's 
interesting how Tang's food has evolved over the years. When he first opened on 
Melrose, he was doing fairly straightforward Thai cooking (still new to many of 
his customers then) in a neon-lit, modernistic space. His new brick-walled 
restaurant has lots of big art and no neon, but the food seems closer to 
something you might get at, say, Parkway Grill than the usual stuff at Chan 
Dara: less Thai than Thai-inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still some Thai classics -- mee krob, pad Thai and chicken sate, for 
instance. But things like risotto and fettuccine and penne are turned out with 
spicy Asian flavors. Except for the kaffir lime dipping sauce, Tang's crisp 
fried oysters wouldn't be out of place in a French restaurant. More than many 
chefs cooking Pacific Rim cuisine, Tang's advantage is that he knows the 
cuisine he's interpreting from the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tommy Tang's, 24 W. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (818) 792-9700. Pasta and 
entrees $7.50 to $16.25.

 I would like to thank Rick Du Brow for his fair and unbiased cover story on 
David Letterman ("Dave's Six-Month Checkup," Feb. 20). I get so tired of 
reading all of the rags' gossip about the late-night competition, and this was 
a very informative article. 
</P>
<P>
 I would also like to thank Howard Rosenberg for his commentary on what makes 
Dave watchable. I am a great fan of Letterman, and 99% of my friends think I'm 
nuts. But Rosenberg put it perfectly -- Dave's absurd and knows how to make 
absurdity an art form.

 Dustin Hoffman was indeed sensational in "EH?" (at the Circle in the Square), 
but his wasn't a one-man show (Letters, March 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Wilson, Dana Elcar and others constituted a great cast in Henry 
Livings' bizarre play.I can't remember who it was who dragged me through a 
January, 1967, snowstorm down to the Village to see it, but trust me, I'll 
never forget Hoffman's crawling around the boiler room with psychedelic 
mushrooms growing abundantly all over the set. 
</P>
<P>
 (Need I say I made tracks to see "The Graduate" later that year -- and felt 
very smug having discovered this great actor before any of my West Coast 
friends.)

 You are wrong, Academy Award breath. Before "Midnight Cowboy," before even 
"The Graduate," Dustin Hoffman starred in a film shot in Madrid titled 
"Madigan's Millions." Must have been 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 It was produced, and more or less directed, by Sidney Pink. We think it was 
eventually peddled to Westinghouse Films and perhaps saw the light of a 
projector somewhere in the United States for a couple of weeks at least. When 
"Madigan's Millions" (script co-written by the late, great Jim Henaghan) was 
finished, Hoffman left for the States, "The Graduate" and history. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't believe us, ask Dustin. At least he got paid. 
</P>
<P>
 But we were there too.

SOUTH COAST'S REP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jan Herman's article "Getting Their Words' Worth" (Feb. 27) quoted me so as to 
imply that Craig Lucas' play "Prelude to a Kiss" did not sell as a motion 
picture because "South Coast is happy to stay in its little corner." 
</P>
<P>
 To set the record straight, it should be pointed out that other plays such as 
the Taper's productions of "Children of a Lesser God," "The Shadow Box" and 
"Angels in America" did not sell until they were subsequently produced in New 
York, and that has nothing to do with South Coast and quite a lot to do with 
the low regard producers and studio executives hold for the opinions of Los 
Angeles theater critics. 
</P>
<P>
 I hold South Coast Repertory as one of the finest regional theaters in the 
country, and I regret any inference my remarks may have given to the contrary 
because, obviously, South Coast saw merit in "Prelude to a Kiss" before New 
York or Hollywood did.

 Regarding Calendar's lists of dubious Grammys (Feb. 27 and March 1): 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in three days, your pop music writers took issue with Grammy voters' 
1958 choice of Henry Mancini's "Music From 'Peter Gunn' " as album of the year, 
clearly implying that the popular TV soundtrack was somehow inferior to several 
competing albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Their cavalier dismissal of Mancini's album is typical of writers weaned on 
rock. In fact, the "Peter Gunn" score was every bit as influential and 
trend-setting as the other records cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini's use of jazz in dramatic contexts on "Peter Gunn" changed the course 
of film and television scoring for decades to come. Private eyes, cops and 
secret agents still chase, shoot and make love to jazz-related music as a 
direct result of the artistic and popular success of his landmark score. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini exposed tens of millions of viewers and record buyers to this fresh 
sound. And jazz-trained musicians from Pete Rugolo to Dave Grusin, Lalo 
Schifrin to Quincy Jones, began to find work in Hollywood within the next few 
years, making the 1960s a far richer era in movie and TV scoring than almost 
anything we're hearing today.

 I was surprised to read that "Alley Cat" was "by a Dutch musician"; I heard 
years ago that "Bent Fabric" was the nom de plume of the very talented and 
always witty Steve Allen. Live and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVEN K. HURLEY 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Joel Whitburn, in "Top Pop Singles," identifies Bent Fabric as the nom de disc 
of Bent Fabricius-Bjerre. We'll admit an error, though, as Fabric's nationality 
is actually Danish.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Robert Hilburn's poignant feature on past Grammy winner Joe South ("His Rose 
Garden Was Full of Thorns," Feb. 27) was quite touching. It was truly sorrowful 
to read of South's fate; however, factors other than drugs and personal 
problems should be noted. 
</P>
<P>
 First, because of the commercial crossover nature of South's material, he was 
unjustly perceived mainly as an AM artist in the then-burgeoning FM climate. 
Hence, "high-profile touring" was likely out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the extremely poor packaging of his follow-ups to "Introspect" 
disrupted things even further, with his label, Capitol, experiencing its own 
slow period. When South finally unleashed a worthy follow-up, late 1972's grand 
"A Look Inside," virtually no promotion was done on the record despite a 
glowing lead review in Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 South spoke the truth, no matter where the chips would fall, and the world is 
better for his existence. He should never view himself as a "nobody." "Games 
People Play" struck a raw nerve unlike anything that came before it -- or has 
maybe come since.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: WHEN A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER CAN'T ESCAPE BROKEN CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week I met a San Fernando Valley woman who is sending her teen-age 
daughter back to El Salvador in hopes the girl will have a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen is a 34-year-old who supports her disabled husband and four children 
with the $1,300 or so a month she earns cleaning houses six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 She told me her story in precise, carefully chosen words as we sat in the 
lovely Los Feliz home of one of her employers. Carmen's home is a big apartment 
building in an unlovely part of the Valley, one of many such buildings crammed 
together near the turf of two rival street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story is one of bewilderment, frustration and regret, of the woes faced by 
every parent of a rebellious teen-ager, complicated by a convoluted family 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen did not come to California to escape a war, but to liberate herself 
from a family who suffocated her, who shamed her for bearing a child out of 
wedlock at 18, who made her feel as though she had no future. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also terrified of running into the man who fathered her child during 
an act, she says, that was not consensual. She prefers not to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the desire to change everything," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen believed the journey was too dangerous for a 7-month-old, so she left 
baby Maria at home until she could send for her. That would not happen until 
the child was 4, until Carmen's sister threatened to forge adoption papers to 
make Maria her own. By that time, Carmen was married with two more children. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to San Salvador, gathered up the child to whom she was now a 
stranger, took a bus to Mexico and paid a coyote $600 to lead her in a 
hair-raising daylight sprint across the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was," says Carmen, "a desperate act." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you find yourself thinking bad thoughts about illegal immigrants, let me 
just say this story is not about immigration. It is about adolescence and 
rebellion in the age of the spray-paint can, the accessible gun, the crack pipe 
and the drive-by. This is a story about a mother who is trying to keep her 
increasingly troubled teen-ager alive. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, Carmen became a legal resident in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with her daughter began about the same time, when Maria, whose 
name I have changed for this story, started junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have been aware of it," Carmen says, "but I closed my eyes. There 
were little signs. She stopped wearing dresses. She said she liked to climb 
trees. But if a girl is going to be in a gang, she cannot wear a dress if they 
have to do something in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria was caught stealing candy from a teacher and confessed later that her 
"crew" had put her up to it to see if she had "enough guts," Carmen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria skipped school and vandalized her apartment building with graffiti -- 
first in her own closet, then on the outside walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forced her to clean the building with Comet and a sponge," Carmen says. "I 
told her, 'I did not bring you to the United States to do this. I brought you 
to become someone, not to become trash.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Maria told her mother that she did not belong to a gang, but that she was a 
"trainee." She said she did what the gang members told her so that she wouldn't 
get "jumped in." The girl has brought home stories of bloodied students, beat 
up in school hallways, set upon by members of rival crews. Carmen is not sure 
what this means. All she knows is that her daughter seems both attracted to and 
terrified by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Carmen if Maria would consider telling me about her involvement with 
the crew. But when her mother asked, Maria was appalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Mami, you don't know who you are dealing with. They kill if they 
are betrayed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen discovered in Maria's diary that her daughter had been hanging out at 
Hansen Dam with a much older boy. She believed that she had only one 
alternative, one that painfully echoed her decision to leave her home and her 
child so many years ago: Carmen must send Maria back home, to live with another 
sister, in a place without gangs, in a place, she hopes, where fear and 
temptation will not overwhelm her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girl bitterly resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Maria was caught shoplifting a $15 necklace at a Sherman Oaks 
department store. The store sent Carmen a letter in which it demanded payment 
of a $275 fine, allowable under a state law to help stores pass on the cost of 
security to shoplifters or their guardians. 
</P>
<P>
 The night that Maria had called her mother to deliver the bad news about 
getting caught, Carmen could not talk. She put the phone down, rushed to the 
bathroom and threw up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Carmen fell apart. Maria's problems had become too much for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I have done so much trying to help you. I have treated you so 
different from the other ones, because I always thought I owed you something -- 
my time, my love, I don't even know what it was. And everything I have done is 
wrong.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And she looked at me and said, 'OK, I am going. I am not going to fight 
anymore. Do whatever you want. I am going home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When school ends, Carmen says, Maria will be on a plane the next day -- bound 
for home, bound for safety, bound for what her mother only prays will be a 
brighter future.

GALLERY: NIGHT RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's go for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just any ride, but a trail ride, after sunset of course, under a canopy of 
stars and twinkling city lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Nervous? You shouldn't be. We'll bring some water, a guide or two, and we'll 
hold down the pace. We'll even wait for you if you get behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Greenriders" mountain bike club of Whittier live by these night moves. 
"It's an adrenaline rush," says Alfred Moreno, a founding club member. "The 
difficulties and challenges of riding are even more exciting at night." 
</P>
<P>
 The night riders gather at a bicycle shop, wearing helmets, brightly colored 
shirts and other clothing designed to hold in body heat. Each bike has full 
front and back suspension, and more than 20 gears to tame the unforgiving 
trails. Most important is a headlight, powered by a battery and charged for a 
lengthy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenrider organizer Paul Holguin sums it up: "It's the nature and the night 
wildlife that's so relaxing. There's no TV and no commercials."

ON THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUE HISTORY OF JESUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am outraged at the insidious and heretical attack on the Christian religion 
and the central figure of its faith, the person of Jesus Christ. I refer to 
"Cross Examination" (Feb. 24). 
</P>
<P>
 How dare you attack my faith with lies and aspersions? Who are you to hold the 
most sacred pillars of Christianity up to scrutiny?  
</P>
<P>
 The Dead Sea Scrolls and numerous other archeological finds examined by 
believers are found to substantiate their faith. The revisionist historians are 
nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 I herewith cancel my subscription to your scurrilous and sacrilegious rag and 
heap scorn on the contemptuous scoundrels who produce it.

 The L.A. Times is at it again -- Christianity bashing. Mary Rourke's piece 
tells about so-called scholars' unbiblical ideas concerning the nature of 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biblical experts met for nine years casting opinion votes as to 
whether events in the Bible really happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are we to believe -- the authors of the gospels who were eyewitnesses to 
the events and personally knew Jesus, or a bunch of eggheads 2,000 years later 
who haven't a clue?

 The claims of Robert Funk and the Jesus Seminar would make good National 
Enquirer headlines: "Paul 'Outed' at Jesus' Wedding, Magdalen Miffed." 
</P>
<P>
 And electing verses to the canon by dropping beads in a bottle is certainly, 
uh, interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach only confirms my perception of Robert Funk as the Geraldo Rivera 
of biblical studies. 
</P>
<P>
 John Spong's (14 books), Robert Funk's and Martin Borg's published enthusiasms 
are amusing, but they are hardly works of meticulous scholarship. These are 
trade books -- fodder for the same audience that buys Danielle Steel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jesus Seminar ignores both the thoroughness of past work and the current 
direction of academic inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach honors neither modern nor post-modern textual theories. It 
deserves all the apathy we can muster. But it won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys aren't easily embarrassed.

 As the world sinks further and further into a truly frightening darkness of 
mind, body and soul, your proposed "solution" is to re-examine Jesus Christ, to 
debunk him, to explain him away? 
</P>
<P>
 What a disservice to yourselves, to others, to the world you claim to care 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do you think Christianity has lasted nearly 2,000 years? Why do you 
suppose millions and millions of people, despite intense and often violent 
persecution, have been converted? Doesn't that tell you anything? Do you think 
a mere human being could have such incredible influence and power?

 "Cross Examination" raises a question about Jesus that should be asked about 
the entire Bible: 
</P>
<P>
 Are we supposed to believe that a collection of writings by a handful of 
folklorists and religious mystics who lived in the eastern Mediterranean two to 
three thousand years ago contains the answers to the mysteries of the universe? 
 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bible were subjected to the same canons of research -- peer review, 
corroboration, tests of credibility, documentary validation, statistical 
quantification -- that modern historians must conform to, it would be seen for 
what it really is -- 99% mythology.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the faithful will continue to believe what they want. After all, 
the definition of faith is belief in the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble starts when adherents of a faith try to impose their values and 
rules of conduct on others.

 I am responding to Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong's comment about the 
gospels having been written 40 years after Christ's life. He asks: "How many 
words of anybody will be exactly repeated 40 years later?" 
</P>
<P>
 I have thought about the question and concluded that it is quite possible to 
remember someone's words when you consider the person to be God talking to you. 
</P>
<P>
 I teach psychology at a local community college. In the introductory class, we 
spend about a week studying the research on memory. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a phenomenon called flashbulb memory in which people can remember 
amazing details from years before. One example is found by asking people to 
remember where they were and what they were doing when John F. Kennedy was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong emotions can really make events stay in your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about the situation of the Apostles. They were followers of Jesus, 
looking to him for guidance and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Why shouldn't they remember what he said?

 One thing I learned from my doctoral studies at San Francisco Theological 
Seminary (a highly regarded Presbyterian school) was a skepticism about 
"scholarly conclusions." For one thing, equally knowledgeable scholars, 
especially in a field like this, plunk down on opposite sides of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple fact is that scholars, being human, have biases, largely rooted in 
the time and culture in which we all live and from which we cannot completely 
escape.  
</P>
<P>
 Often this bias includes the conviction that miracles don't happen. Few of us, 
even evangelical conservatives, find it easy to accept the gospel accounts of 
Jesus' miracles -- for example, his walking on the water. But against that we 
set the bias that Jesus was not a mere man, but the son of God. 
</P>
<P>
 This he clearly claimed according to the only records we have of what he said, 
the gospels. That some in the Jesus Seminar deny the validity of those accounts 
is a subjective judgment. Admittedly, we evangelicals also start with a bias, 
but it seems to me that our bias has more to support it than their bias.

 We wish a fond farewell to the White Horse Inn on Western in Hollywood, a 
rising star in the L.A. garage rock scene until it was condemned after the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another adieu goes out to venerable rocker dude hangout Hollywood Billiards 
(and the landmark building that housed it at Hollywood Boulevard and Western). 
</P>
<P>
 But rumors of the demise of Raji's at Hollywood Boulevard and Gower are, as 
Mark Twain would say, grossly exaggerated. Operating on and off since quake 
day, this capitol of the L.A. underground rock scene has finished all the 
necessary renovations, says Raji's promoter, Larry Mann, and has been 
"green-tagged and up and running" since Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Also back on the map that day, after weeks of round-the-clock repairs, was 
Santa Monica's upscale billiard mecca, Gotham Hall, a landmark structure built 
in 1890, which suffered heavy internal damage from the quake. A grand reopening 
party is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still Brewing: One dot on the L.A. entertainment landscape left unscathed by 
January's turbulence may instead be crushed by municipal red tape. John Leech, 
owner of the Onyx Echo Coffeehouse in Echo Park, says he will have to close his 
cafe because of a switch by the city. Denied a police permit for entertainment 
because of zoning regulations, Leech says he was originally told that live 
entertainment -- necessary for the cafe to be economically viable -- would be 
allowed.  
</P>
<P>
 Other cafe owners have also complained of municipal hostility to espresso 
emporiums. But at a recent neighborhood rally to "Save the Echo," 
representatives from Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg's office agreed that the 
zoning laws "don't take into consideration the unique nature of coffeehouses" 
and, to keep L.A.'s java joints jumping, Goldberg is considering a proposal to 
create "zones that are amenable to coffeehouses." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Now This Is Relief: You have to hand it to the American Red Cross to want to 
have a party on Academy Award night, when almost every celebrity known to 
humankind is committed to at least one event. But the relief agency is throwing 
a party -- and at the L.A. nightclub Roxbury, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, anyone who has been in Southern California for five minutes knows 
that the Red Cross has been working overtime because of the earthquake and 
fires, to name just two disasters. Since they're strapped for cash, they 
figured they would catch Oscar fever and do a benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-hosting the event are Sunset Entertainment (which is producing Tia 
Carrere's new film "Tears From Heaven") and Movieline magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the guest list are such young hipsters as Charlie Sheen, Michael Madsen, 
Gabrielle Carteris, Justine Bateman, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Carrere.  
</P>
<P>
 For $75 per person, guests can watch the awards on TV monitors, see live 
entertainment (members of the China Club Pro Jam with Jack Mack and the Heart 
Attack and the Tower of Power Horns), chow down on food from local restaurants 
and dance the rest of the night away. 
</P>
<P>
 A $40 ticket adds a post-awards party. And for those behind the Orange 
Curtain, Roxbury South in Santa Ana will also host a party to benefit the 
Orange County chapter of the Red Cross. For information on both, call (213) 
358-1844.

UP ALL NIGHT / MARK EHRMAN: THE SONG IS THE LONE STAR; 'WESTERN BEAT' CLUB 
GIVES FRESH TUNES, NEW SONGWRITERS A CHANCE TO SHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK EHRMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you ever wonder what happened to Tin Pan Alley, that amorphous place where 
all the great songs came from? Well, it looks like a piece of it landed right 
here in the heart of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Beat, a once-a-month quick-picking fun-strumming confab of 
singer/songwriters is where the country-Western, blues, folk and pop 
communities come together to play and hear the great songs of yesterday, as 
well as the ones you may be singing along with tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I moved to L.A. two years ago, I felt there was a need for a songwriting 
community much like the Austin scene and like the Nashville songwriting 
community," says host Billy Block, who brings his American Music Showcase to 
the Highland Grounds coffee house the first Thursday of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 When Block held his first Western Beat night, the members of Spinal Tap showed 
up and played an acoustic set. Since then, Rosie Flores, Karla Bonoff, Andrew 
Gold, Hal Ketchum and many more country, blues, folk and acoustic pop artists 
have played here.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's what not this hootenanny is all about. "What we've taught people," 
Block says, "is that it's the song that's the star." 
</P>
<P>
 On these nights, Highland Grounds' SoHo-style interior is filled to the 
rafters with a mostly denim and Frye-boots crowd, the stairway to the balcony 
pressed into service as bleachers. People here actually listen. So despite the 
fact that the sets are primarily acoustic and the musicians perform from 
nothing so elevated or grand as a stage, there's very little sonic 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Beat functions as an industry get-together as well, and the outside 
patio -- or schmoozatorium, as one regular called it -- is abuzz with music-biz 
gossip and networking, as well as songwriters trading licks or practicing for 
their set. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to develop the song-writing community," Block says. That's 
why he makes the early part of the evening an open-mike segment. "It's for the 
young writers who don't get an opportunity to get heard by the industry or 
really meet other musicians."  
</P>
<P>
 After 8 p.m., the entertainment is strictly professional, but very diverse. 
One recent lineup had Jack Tempchin, author of such '70s mega-hits as

DRAWING UP BLUEPRINTS FOR A MORE LIVABLE L.A.; GROWTH: RESIDENTS ARE ASKED TO 
HELP ACHIEVE GOALS PROPOSED FOR AN UPDATED GENERAL PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Now more than ever, Los Angeles is looking for a future. 
</P>
<P>
 It could look something like this: A metropolis where neglected boulevards are 
teeming with life, where more people move more easily through the urban 
landscape, where the isolation born of freeways and gate-guarded enclaves gives 
way to a sense of community, and where the benefits and burdens of new 
development are spread evenly throughout the city's fractured neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the two-year process of redrawing the city's long-term 
blueprint for growth, that is the Los Angeles that residents from communities 
as diverse as Westwood and South-Central and San Pedro are telling local 
officials they want. 
</P>
<P>
 How to get there is the subject of a series of community meetings taking place 
across Los Angeles. Armed with colorful sketches of different communities, 
urban planners are showing residents what the future could hold for their 
neighborhoods and explaining how to make it happen. Meetings are scheduled 
March 23 in West Los Angeles and March 31 for the Hollywood and Wilshire areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners hope to present the plans to the city Planning Commission in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whether the vision of planners and residents leaps from colorful maps and 
charts into reality depends on the will of politicians and the willingness of 
residents to accept changes that may be unpopular in the short term, those 
involved in the process agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling this as a plan for people's children," said Los Angeles planner 
Ron Maben, who is helping update the city's General Plan, the document that 
guides future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan -- last updated in 1974 -- establishes broad policy. Although 
it does not govern how individual pieces of property should be developed, it 
sets the tone for smaller, more specific community plans that do. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several weeks -- and continuing until next month -- planners 
have taken preliminary ideas on the road to ask residents across the city what 
they think of a plan that seeks to accommodate more people without overloading 
the freeways and the sewers or worsening the quality of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary ideas stem from community meetings held last year, at which 
community members told planners what they did and did not want Los Angeles to 
be. Although each neighborhood had specific ideas about its future, planners 
were struck by the similarities in what residents wanted in Los Angeles as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted more parks, more livable neighborhoods and more affordable 
housing. They did not want more traffic, more smog or more of the other 
headaches that go with urban living. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, they all agreed that something has to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, early data compiled by planners demonstrate that if Los Angeles 
continues to grow as it has -- namely, an auto-dependent suburban sprawl -- the 
results could be disastrous. Sewer systems will be overloaded. Roads will be 
gridlocked. Air quality will worsen. And the need for imported water will 
outpace supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we continue the rules as they are, the net outcome will exacerbate 
existing conditions," said Woodie Tescher, the consultant preparing the plan. 
"If all land is built out at current zoning, average speed on local streets 
would be 4 m.p.h. -- that's on every street." 
</P>
<P>
 So planners devised a preliminary vision for the future that borrows heavily 
from the past. Their preliminary ideas include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Encouraging denser development around mass transit centers and along major 
transportation corridors. That would allow more people to live within walking 
distance of subways or buses, thus reducing the need for automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mixing different types of development, such as putting apartments or 
condominiums on top of retail shops or commercial offices. That way, 
shopkeepers or office workers could live and work in the same area. Even if 
they did drive to work, most of their daily errands -- such as trips to the 
grocery, the cleaners or picking up the kids at day care -- could be done on 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Converting flood control channels and utility rights of way into greenbelts 
that connect regional parks, thus opening up recreational areas in communities 
where vacant land is scarce. If bike paths are built, planners speculate that 
more people might be willing to pedal to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the diversity of the city's neighborhoods, planners are drawing 
preliminary sketches to detail how the broad guidelines might be applied in 
different communities. Venice, for instance, might develop with a different 
"feel" than, say, Pico-Union, but both communities would be subject to the same 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the ideas actually were contained in the city's last General Plan. 
That plan called for major urban hubs such as Downtown, Los Angeles 
International Airport and Warner Center to be connected by a network of transit 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Except the rail lines never got built. And many elements of the plan were 
never followed. Now the plan is out of date. Some of the centers envisioned in 
the plan developed; others did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of that, many in the city are doubtful that a new General Plan will be 
any more useful than the old one. "What's going on here is politics," said one 
man who attended a recent community meeting in Venice. "This is really a waste 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
 But much has changed since 1974. Growth has slowed down. The luster of the 
Golden State has faded. Employers are leaving. The federal government is 
leaning on Southern California to clean up its air and its water and to bring 
its sewer systems up to par. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those factors could combine to force Los Angeles to abide by the plan 
it ultimately adopts. General Plan 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several weeks, planners will meet with Los Angeles residents to 
talk about the future of their communities. Information gathered in the 
meetings will be used to plot long-term growth in the city's General Plan, 
which is the blueprint for future development.

PLUGGING THE LEAK; CAMPUS SPRING WATER SEEN AS UNTAPPED RESOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN CRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time you finish reading this story, 39 gallons of potentially drinkable 
water will have flowed from the campus of University High School into the 
gutters -- but that's just a drop in the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 580,000 gallons dribbled away at the West Los Angeles school; last 
year, 7.3 million gallons were wasted. In the week after the Northridge 
earthquake, when water problems abounded on the Westside, an estimated 140,000 
gallons were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not to mention the 43.8 million gallons lost during the six years 
of drought that ended last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of all of these lost gallons: natural springs on the northern side 
of University High. One spring feeds into a charming man-made waterfall at the 
northwest corner of the soccer field. The other supplies a pair of ponds in the 
agricultural portion of the campus, between Wilshire and Santa Monica 
boulevards, just west of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, all of the water winds up in the storm drains that lead 
to Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all going down the drain today, just as it did every day of the 
(post-earthquake) crisis," said Jon Shaughnessy, executive director of the 
fledgling West Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, which organized in September. 
"We basically have a leak that needs fixing, but no one has spent the time and 
money to make sure this is a usable source of water in a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the West Los Angeles Chamber has formed a disaster preparedness 
committee that will make development of the springs one of its priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, however, is whether businesses will pony up the necessary cash. 
Shaughnessy said preliminary estimates of the cost of installing equipment to 
pump the spring water into a holding tank run about $20,000. Thus far, no one 
has stepped forward with financial commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main project is to get financial support to cap the springs off," 
Shaughnessy said. "A lot has to do with how much of the work we can have done 
pro bono." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when a West Los Angeles community organization applied for federal 
funding under the Urban Forestry and Gardening Grants program to reclaim the 
water from the springs, the cost was estimated at $54,000, not including labor. 
The grant request was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had much information, so we just kind of ball-parked some numbers," 
said Raymond Scott of RS Engineering, the Santa Monica development firm that 
provided this estimate. "No one ever gave us a real plan. Someone just got a 
bug for the idea and gave us a call." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the colorful history of the springs -- the Tongva Indians had a 
village at the site 200 years ago -- it is perhaps surprising that they have 
never been thoroughly studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the only measurement of their flow rate was by a volunteer who timed 
how long it took to fill up a pail and figured that 20,000 gallons bubble forth 
each day. The lack of solid information, however, makes an accurate estimate of 
development costs a near impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could spend about anything on something like this," Scott said. "It's a 
shame to have it go to waste, but there's no verified supply and we don't 
really know if (the water) is reclaimable. Then you'll need a reservoir, a pump 
to get it to the tank. (You'll need to) decide how many gallons you want to 
keep in reserve at all times. Do you want to employ it every day? Can it be 
used for irrigation, or for the flush toilets at the school? There are so many 
variables because nobody's really done anything with it." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power conducted an 
informal feasibility study of the springs but chose not to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've looked at it from a supply perspective, and we didn't think it was 
worth the while," said Peter Kavounas, a DWP hydrologic engineer. "It just 
didn't seem like there was much water to be had, and what there was had enough 
quality problems that it would need treatment to make it potable. It wasn't 
cost-effective, because we have to live up to national health standards. If 
(the West Los Angeles Chamber) doesn't have to meet national health standards, 
it might be more feasible for them than it was for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kavounas, who has not seen the springs, said DWP research suggests that the 
water contains a lot of iron. This is typical of springs that form when 
rainwater in nearby mountains percolates into the ground and resurfaces after 
passing through formations containing iron and other minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it would take (to tap the springs) is to be in a different part of the 
country," he contends. "In Southern California, when it rains it pours. You 
never really have the less-intense rains that go on for days at a time. That 
means the reservoirs it takes to capture such large, sudden rainwater amounts 
have to be very big facilities, and that's very costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Kavounas said the DWP has no claim to the water rights, which would fall to 
the owner of the property -- the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have suggested that the district could use the springs for irrigation and 
thus cut down on filtering expenses and the number of gallons it purchases from 
the DWP. The district's department of architectural engineering reportedly 
studied the matter two years ago, but its deputy director, Robert Donald, did 
not return phone inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Rene, assistant principal at University High, said experience indicates 
that an on-campus water source might help the school save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the district is paying for irrigation, but I know that from 
time to time it has been very expensive," she said. "We've got a large campus, 
and right now we're not able to irrigate every single area on campus. If we 
could use this supply of water, I think it would help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Rene would like to see the water used as an emergency supply for the 
school's 2,000 students and staff members. Shaughnessy of the West Los Angeles 
Chamber had the same thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Jan. 17, when the National Guard asked if they could put a hose up and get 
some water and the answer had to be no, their response was, 'Thanks anyway,' " 
he said. "Right now it's easier to truck it in from Tehachapi than it is to 
pick it up in a plastic bucket, and we don't want that to be the case when the 
next quake hits."

TOPICA; HEALING WOUNDS WITH ART; EXHIBIT: 12 ARTISTS SHED LIGHT ON THEIR BATTLE

<P>
 For Ever. Now She Knew

<P>
 How Little Control She  
</P>
<P>
 Had Over Her Life.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Hollis Sigler, artist, 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Hollis Sigler has not let her battle with breast cancer diminish her 
creativity. To the contrary: After the Chicago artist was first diagnosed with 
the disease about eight years ago, her paintings began to directly address 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She makes these really strong, not just political but emotional statements. 
They are real personal," said Marian Winsryg, an adjunct art professor at Santa 
Monica College and a friend of Sigler's for almost 20 years -- ever since 
Sigler was her student at Moore College of Art in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing Sigler's work, Winsryg began thinking about organizing an art 
show on the subject of breast cancer. The clincher, she says, came when she 
learned that two other artist friends, Susan E. King and Barbara Foster, also 
had the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "One in Eight: Women and Breast Cancer," an exhibit by 12 
artists who have had breast cancer. The show opens Friday at the Santa Monica 
College Art Gallery, with a reception from 6 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The "One in Eight" in the exhibit's title refers to an estimate that one in 
eight American women will get breast cancer in their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to deal with illness," Winsryg said. "Half the reason women die 
of breast cancer is because nobody talks about it. Not that a mammogram or 
breast self-exam is going to save you, but they alert you. And like any 
disease, the earlier it's caught, the better chance you have for a longer 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The art exhibit has been organized in conjunction with two free panel 
discussions on the subject on Friday. Among the speakers are renowned breast 
cancer expert Dr. Susan Love; P.J. Viviansayles, a breast cancer survivor and 
coordinator of the Women of Color Breast Cancer Survivors Support Project; 
Esther Dreifuss-Kattan, author of "Cancer Stories: Creativity and Self Repair", 
and artists Sigler and King. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to just do a show of women who have breast cancer and leave it 
at that," said Winsryg, 53, who has not had the disease. "I didn't want it to 
be just political, but to make it useful. It got real exciting to think about a 
dialogue with different health practitioners talking about their fields of 
expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the work by the ethnically diverse group of artists in the show 
deals directly with breast cancer. Bonnie Frankel presents completely abstract 
paintings. Della Rossa has contributed photographs of young Latino gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 But artists who have confronted the disease head-on in their art have found 
the effort essential and rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was compelled to do this work for myself and for other people, too," said 
Lavialle Campbell, 40, who had a mastectomy six years ago and went through 
chemotherapy. Among her works on view is the assemblage, "Left Breast, No 
Nipple," which displays her old breast prosthesis on a saw blade on black 
velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost friends. I don't know if it was because I had cancer or (specifically) 
breast cancer. One friend, when she found out I had breast cancer, she 
completely cut me off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 King was diagnosed in 1989 as having breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in for a mammogram, and it just started me on this whole medical 
odyssey," said King, 46, who had a partial mastectomy and radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 King's "Treading the Maze: An Artist's Book of Daze," intertwines images and 
text of a European trip and her medical ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The images include a photo of a statue of Hebe, the cup bearer of the Gods who 
was connected to the Tree of Life; a photograph of the rose window at Chartres 
Cathedral in France; a sketch of a similarly patterned array of lasers on a 
radiation room wall, and a doctor's drawing of invasive cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said that in some respects, having breast cancer was a positive 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "As bad as it was, it's one of the best things that happened to me," she said. 
"I've always had a lot of feelings that I didn't deal with. Now, I live the way 
I want to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Della Rossa, who had a mastectomy at 60 and is now 73: "I've survived 
breast cancer and gone on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the show are Vida Hackman, Rosalyn Mesquita, Keiko Nelson, 
Betsy Noorzay, Annabelle Simon Cahn and Ruth Weisberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "One in Eight: Women and Breast Cancer " opens tomorrow with a reception from 
6 to 8 p.m. at Santa Monica College Art Gallery, 1900 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica. 
Panel discussions in the Concert Hall will take place from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m.

BRIEFLY; QUAKE RELIEF: $72,000 IN GRANTS AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

COMMUNITY NEWS: BALDWIN HILLS; THEATER PATRONS MOURN END OF AN ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Les Roberson, the closing last month of the Baldwin Theater -- the only 
black-owned movie house in the inner city -- marks the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid, my friends and I walked down the street and saw movies there all 
the time," said Roberson, a 30-year-old Baldwin Hills resident and sales 
representative for PacTel Corp. "I was waiting for 'Sugar Hill' to come out so 
I could go see it there. And then one day last week, I was out jogging and saw 
it was closed. I was stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are not saying when, or if, the Baldwin will reopen. The theater, 
along with a six-screen multiplex in Hawthorne, was part of Inner City Cinemas, 
a joint venture formed in November, 1992, by the national theater chain 
American Multi Cinema Inc. and Economic Resources Corp., a nonprofit real 
estate agency based in Lynwood. It was envisioned as the start of the nation's 
first black-owned cinema chain. 
</P>
<P>
 But a year and a half after reopening, the three-screen Baldwin quietly closed 
shortly after Inner City Cinemas filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Fortier, president of the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce and an area 
resident since 1959, said that whatever the theater's fiscal problems, the 
community is the real loser. "Now, when we want to go to the movies, we'll be 
forced to go outside the area," he said. "It's really a shame. The Baldwin 
offered first-run movies, had good security, made honest attempts at providing 
good service." 
</P>
<P>
 Many politicians and business people in the Crenshaw community had high hopes 
for Inner City Cinemas, particularly for its plans to develop an eight-screen 
multiplex in the nearby Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. But problems within the 
partnership snowballed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August AMC sued the Economic Resources Corp., charging the black-operated 
agency with mismanagement and misrepresenting its financial state. The suit 
also alleged that ERC owed more than $100,000 in film rentals, and that an ERC 
executive used joint venture funds to pay off nearly $80,000 in internal debts. 
Economic Resources officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, AMC Vice President Gregory Rutkowski, a former Inner City 
Cinemas director, said ICC's financial troubles left American Multi Cinema no 
choice but to dissolve the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "After an extensive review of our options, we feel this (bankruptcy) filing is 
in the best interests of all concerned," he said. "We regret that this is 
necessary, but we go forward with the knowledge that this is the only 
alternative possible at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin, a spacious movie house built in 1949, featured a regular lineup 
of black-themed films. It also frequently held premieres and special 
screenings; last fall it screened "The Nation," an independent film about the 
Nation of Islam, and recently showed the celebrated short film "Sweet Potato 
Ride," shot in and around Crenshaw and Leimert Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a real homey feel. You always saw some people you knew," Roberson 
recalled. "And you never had to fight for parking, unlike the Marina or 
Westwood." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw resident Mark Edwards said the Baldwin couldn't be beat on two 
counts: convenience and consistent offerings of African American films. "For 
those reasons alone, I hope it reopens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson said he and a small group of neighbors are determined to find a buyer 
for the theater. They plan to take up the matter with Councilman Mark-Ridley 
Thomas and other local politicians and business leaders to ensure that the 
shows at the Baldwin go on.ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: PALMS; LANDMARK BUILDING TO BECOME 'MEGACENTER' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The old Globe A-1 building has run a gamut of uses, from a noodle factory to a 
movie production site to its present function as a Rolls-Royce dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometime in the next year or so, the two-story structure at Robertson and 
Venice boulevards will become that most modern of things -- an "interactive 
entertainment and social megacenter." 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles-based Recreation World plans to spend $8 million to turn the 
building into a 103,000-square-foot recreational center that will include video 
game arcades, a computer learning facility, ice and roller skating rinks, a 
miniature golf course, batting cages and a billiards room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking some tried-and-true family entertainment and putting it under 
one roof," said Sheldon Krechman, chairman of the board of Recreation World, 
which designs, builds and manages recreation facilities worldwide. "We really 
need a safe, clean place in the city to recreate." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is awaiting approvals from the city transportation and building 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation center is the first of eight such sports and entertainment 
centers Recreation World intends to open statewide in the next four years. 
According to Krechman, the center will bring 120 full- and part-time jobs to 
the local economy, with the nine-month construction expected to begin as early 
as September. He anticipates weekly crowds of 15,000 to 20,000 visitors. The 
next Recreation World entertainment center will likely be located in Long 
Beach, Krechman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a separate development, Recreation World acquired the 
Hollywood-based Ice Chalets Inc. in a deal worth approximately $4.1 million. 
The acquisition gives Recreation World 14 ice-skating rinks nationwide, 
including the famous Wollman Rink in New York City's Central Park. SCOTT

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; HIGH SCHOOL'S ELITE CHOIR ENERGIZES AUDIENCES IN 
EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA McCOY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Europeans were singing the praises of Crenshaw High School's Elite Choir after 
its recent whirlwind tour of the Continent, where it packed concert halls and 
churches from the banks of the Rhine to the City of Light. 
</P>
<P>
 In its last performance of the two-week tour, beneath the flying buttresses of 
Paris' American Cathedral, the blue-robed choir lifted every voice in a city 
better known for haute couture than down-home harmonizing. From the altar of 
the cavernous cathedral in the city's fashionable 8th District, the kids rocked 
the house, as they had done in Germany and the Netherlands on other stops in 
last month's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 With a mix of high-energy gospel, blues, jazz, African music and Broadway show 
tunes, the performance was part rock concert, part revival. The students sang 
some of their selections in French and German. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had great welcomes every place we went," said Iris Stevenson, music 
director and teacher at Crenshaw High. She said that in Mannheim, Germany, the 
group drew a crowd of more than 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students in Stevenson's choir and band classes has swelled from 
12 to more than 700 in the nine years that she has been at Crenshaw. For this 
tour there were about 45 students, some of whom were joined onstage during the 
concert by family members. 
</P>
<P>
 The students helped raise funds to pay their way, with a personal donation 
from Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, who inspired the Whoopi Goldberg character in "Sister Act II," 
sometimes uses her own money to help pay for trips. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, the group has traveled to Nice and the Caribbean, 
winning the Jamaican jazz festival four years in a row, and has appeared on 
"The Arsenio Hall Show" and HBO's "Chez Whoopi." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochanda Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Crenshaw, was enjoying her first 
visit to Europe. "It has been really exciting," Evans said. "Somebody helped me 
raise the money. It has been wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, more than 800 people packed the cathedral for the free performance 
Feb. 27, with nearly a thousand more spilling onto the sidewalk outside hoping 
to get in. They got their wish after the choir agreed to a second, unscheduled 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the concert-goers were Parisians, with a smattering of 
American expatriates. Women in Chanel suits and pearl chokers sat next to 
university students wearing ripped jeans. But most didn't sit for long. By the 
end of the second performance they were clapping wildly, and some Parisians 
were uncharacteristically standing on the pews in the 19th-Century church. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffroy Mauze, a French student, said he was electrified by the performance. 
"You close your eyes and you are captivated, hypnotized," he said. "I hope that 
more people in Europe will begin to appreciate this music." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson directed the choir from behind the piano, where the composer and 
professional pianist alternately tickled and pounded the ivories while coaxing 
the singers to keep up the furious pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakisha Blackmon, a 17-year-old senior, delivered a knockout blow backed by 
the choir with "Help Somebody," a song that had many in the crowd -- and 
Blackmon -- in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students heaped praise for their success on two things -- God and 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says a choir is like a family," said 17-year-old senior Chad McDonald, a 
baritone who plans to study opera after graduation. "And it is." MELISSA McCOY

DESIGNS ON SURVIVAL; DESPITE A DOWNTURN IN THE INDUSTRY, INTERIOR DESIGNERS ARE 
STREAMLINING AND SPECIALIZING SERVICES TO STAY IN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior designer Ivan Beardsley, called upon to lecture at a colleague's home 
on a cool fall night 18 months ago, looked to his audience and caught a glimpse 
of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of half a dozen or so beginning designers, Beardsley faced nearly 40 
stellar industry professionals who had come to hear his talk on how to survive 
the 1990s. Like a hungry press corps, they besieged Beardsley with so many 
questions that his planned 45-minute lecture became a three-hour session on 
designer woes, ranging from marketing and billing problems to shrinking demand 
and decorating budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was beside myself," recalled Beardsley, a Silver Lake designer with nearly 
two decades' experience and a past president of the American Society of 
Interior Designers. "I was prepared to talk to six to eight people." 
</P>
<P>
 Since that lecture -- his first -- two things have happened: Beardsley's 
advice has become so in-demand that he now addresses interior designers several 
times a year. And Southern California's recession, thought then to have perhaps 
bottomed out, has grown steadily worse, making things yet more perilous for 
interior designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the high-ticket industries to nose-dive in the grim '90s, West Los 
Angeles' residential interior design business has taken a particularly nasty 
crash. Once awash in the capital of a thriving regional economy, Westside 
designers now are in the midst of a shakeout that has left them scrambling for 
customers, discounting prices and developing narrower and narrower specialties 
to woo their remaining customers. 
</P>
<P>
 And those are the lucky ones. The unlucky ones have simply closed shop and 
moved on. "We're having an industry fallout," said Beardsley. "Everyone's 
gearing down on their products, on their prices and on their real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 The upheaval has been as sudden and overwhelming as a brush fire, affecting a 
few designers at first before spreading quickly throughout the industry. 
Indeed, it wasn't that long ago that interior designers on the Westside were 
blithely passing on projects that weren't large enough for their tastes. In the 
age of affluence of a mere five years ago, a $100,000 budget for a single 
residential project wasn't considered unusual at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were buying incredible homes and putting tremendous budgets into 
redecorating," said Bobbie Everts, owner of Designer Previews in Marina del 
Rey, a firm that represents interior designers and architects. "They were 
spending money like they were printing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Everts' customers are willing to part with only a fraction of that. In her 
last three jobs, the biggest interior design budget amounted to $20,000. 
"People have to put bread on the table before they put fabric on their walls," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical and spiritual base for the local design industry -- the area in 
and around the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood -- reflects that 
economic shock. Overall occupancy rates hover between 70% and 75% at the 
16-acre center, regarded as one of the major design centers nationwide and the 
premier such facility in the West. The center, built in 1975, recently had to 
have its mortgage renegotiated after the partnership that runs it, the San 
Francisco-based Catellus Development Corp., fell behind on payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This) is a world-class facility that needs to regenerate momentum about its 
mission," said center president Andrew Wolf, who was hired in January to 
rejuvenate the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The downturn also has triggered wholesale changes in the way designers do 
business. Perhaps the biggest turnaround is how designers offer, and charge 
for, their services. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of purchasing furniture and accessories from showrooms, and then 
billing clients for their time and the merchandise, more designers are charging 
strictly for consulting and letting their clients pick up their own goods. 
Though hiring a design consultant can cost between $75 and $200 an hour, those 
are still much more affordable sums to customers who might have anticipated 
spending tens of thousands of dollars in one designing fell swoop.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're charging for our creativity and design services rather than for 
providing a sofa," said BJ Peterson, a West Los Angeles designer and national 
president of the 33,000-member American Society of Interior Designers. "The 
designer is being paid for being a designer." 
</P>
<P>
 Some interior designers are also narrowing their focus in hopes of capturing a 
particular type of client. One burgeoning specialty in residential interior 
design is environmental design, in which some designers offer allergy-free 
environments or interiors that use only recyclable and nontoxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not into the 'build your castle' aesthetic," said Alison Pollack, a 
West Hills environmental interior designer who recently launched her own firm 
called Earth Friendly. Despite the grim outlook in the rest of the interior 
design industry, Pollack says that so far the response to her business has been 
very encouraging. "You can't put a price on clean air," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, because of a confluence of social and economic factors, the home 
office interiors trade is booming. Fifteen years ago, Douglass Hiatt, a Beverly 
Hills-based interior designer, became one of the country's first designers to 
begin creating such offices. Today, said Hiatt, advances in communications 
technology, combined with the conflicting goals of working longer but 
maintaining a high quality of life, have prompted more people than ever to seek 
out spaces in their homes in which to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every one of our clients now includes for himself a home office," said 
Hiatt, whose services can command upward of $100,000. Still, he said, it can be 
psychologically easier for people to justify an expensive design project that 
can be considered functional, rather than merely decorative. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychology, say designers, also explains why some people who can afford it are 
no longer blowing big budgets on interior furnishings. Though their clients may 
be relatively unaffected by the recession, designers and industry observers say 
many customers continue to be apprehensive about the future -- and concerned 
that conspicuous consumption in lean times would be politically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a weariness I call, 'compassion fatigue,' " said Wolf, the Pacific 
Design Center president. "You're very aware of being ostentatious." 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a boon for retail design and furniture shops, as opposed 
to the "for the trade only" stores that allow only accredited designers to 
purchase goods. Along Venice Boulevard, dozens of home interior design shops in 
the vicinity of the Antique Guild, the former Helms Bakery, are attracting a 
steady stream of weekend shoppers looking for less expensive ways to decorate 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Melendrez, manager of Civilization, a home furnishings and accessories 
store located near the Guild, says that while the shop's customers usually are 
well-heeled, they are drawn by the combination of cutting-edge styles at prices 
that are typically 30% cheaper than list price. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of retail outlets has not been lost on "for the trade only" shops, 
some of which have adapted to the changing times. Though interior designers and 
store proprietors are hesitant to admit it, given the tough economy, more 
stores than ever are likely to waive the "for the trade only" rule and allow 
the public to buy under certain conditions -- if the purchase is large enough, 
for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who want to make a substantial investment, well, someone's going to 
sell to them," Beardsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of reaching out to a larger customer base, and making interior design 
more consumer-friendly, is also prompting changes at the Pacific Design Center, 
which is now in the midst of preparing for Westweek, an annual trade show. The 
three-day event, scheduled to start March 23, is expected to draw 30,000 
people. Acknowledging that the center has suffered from an aloof and 
"off-putting" reputation, Wolf envisions broadening the center's purview to 
encompass all aspects of design -- and attracting more visitors in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the items on his agenda: opening a museum shop, attracting a major 
school of design to the building, showcasing the city's up-and-coming 
designers, and eventually turning the center into a visitor attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing a sentiment heard increasingly in the design community, center 
executives also say they are targeting a new client base: members of the upper 
middle class who may have never used a designer before but who can now afford 
their services -- and may have become more attuned to design in the 
status-conscious '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A center is more than just a trade mart," said Wolf. "I want people to leave 
aware that everything in the planned environment is the 'D' word." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some wonder whether making high design available to upper-middle-, and 
possibly even middle-income consumers, can give the industry a significant 
economic boost. Even when showrooms in the Design Center hold an 
open-to-the-public demo sale of their furniture -- with goods and accessories 
discounted as much as 75% -- such prices still may not prove alluring when the 
item in question is a $12,000 leather sectional or a $1,200 cocktail table. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public that buys retail can't afford this furniture, anyway," said 
Beardsley. "That segment of the market isn't the segment that uses designers. 
They aren't even buying on a markdown basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Everts adds: "The designers are cutting their prices but furniture costs what 
it costs. Ten thousand dollars is still not going to get your home decorated."  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, designers say, even if trade showrooms were to open to the public 
and clients ended up buying all their own furnishings, customers still lack the 
creative vision to put together an interior design scheme. In a practice where 
one fatal design choice could cost thousands of dollars to rectify, many people 
remain intimidated by the decorating process. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at Civilization, store manager Melendrez says not as many customers 
are coming in by themselves anymore. "I see more and more designers bringing 
their clients in," he said. "You never saw that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Such reports, though, will likely bring small comfort to those designers 
struggling to weather the recession. Beardsley said one recent survey he 
conducted of his colleagues found that more than 40% were forced to make 
changes in their business to survive, while another 16% were contemplating 
leaving the business altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a refrain heard often by Everts, who represents nearly 50 interior 
designers and about a dozen architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Everts, who is married, considers herself lucky because she is not her 
family's only bread-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it getting better at all this year and I don't see it getting 
better next year," said Everts, who on the advice of her accountant husband 
moved out of her pricey Marina del Rey office to work at home, just before the 
industry turned southward. "If I had to depend on this to live, I would be 
scared out of my mind." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Wolf, president of the Pacific Design Center, was hired in January to 
rejuvenate the facility. The West Hollywood center, built in 1975, serves as a 
base for the local design industry and is one of the country's premier design 
outlets.

FOR SENIORS; LINDA FELDMAN; LOOSENING THE BUSINESS TIES THAT BIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Williams describes herself as old-fashioned and in the next breath 
says, "In a way I'm not." For the thousands of Los Angeles men who have relied 
on her opinion, it's not an issue: When Barbara Williams makes a tie selection, 
her customers usually follow her advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has run the family tie business, Barbara Williams Cravats, from the 
same Farmers Market location for the past 38 years. This year she took what 
might be the first step toward closing the business: For the first time, she 
hasn't reordered her signature labels. 
</P>
<P>
 If she does close up shop, the move will mark the end of a century-old family 
business. The Williams family was originally from Youngstown, Ohio. There, her 
father owned a tie shop. Then the family moved to Los Angeles -- and operated 
three tie stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father and two older brothers died within a year of each other. They owned 
two shops. I was in my 20s running a (third) shop, which my father backed me in 
at the time. My brother's wives were housewives with children, so I was 
automatically at the helm of all three stores -- paid the bills, bought 
merchandise. I was the (chief financial officer). I was it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, one store, at the Disneyland Hotel, closed. A second, managed by a 
sister-in-law who no longer wanted to continue in business, also closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams expanded her shop to include merchandise other than ties, 
she keeps the family business and values alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have this feeling that I'm watched over. I feel the presence of my father," 
she said. "I had a big laugh the other day when I found a box of wide ties from 
the late '40s. I gave some away to nephews and I put a couple of them out on 
display. They sold for $10 in those days. And I sold them for $30. Well, I just 
couldn't help but think my father was saying, 'Good girl'. . . . That happens a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams never married, she says, because she didn't think it was fair to 
blame the business whenever anything went wrong in her personal life. She also 
took care of her mother. But she is a proud aunt to 34 nieces and nephews in a 
close family that has experienced many tragedies. Her strength comes from her 
faith in the Lord, who, she says, has always come through for her in times of 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does a girl from Youngstown survive in the big city? How does she make 
a living surrounded by giant department stores displaying ties that look more 
like wallpaper than neckwear? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like today's fashion. I like tradition. I go by instinct, not fads," 
she said. "I'm not that square. I have striped dress shirts and ties with 
Marilyn Monroe on them, but my niche is understated dressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams refuses to divulge the names of famous men from all over the world 
who have come to her shop, or the generations of ordinary families who are her 
loyal customers. She believes they come because of what her father taught her: 
Buy quality, never judge a customer by the way he's dressed, and -- the 
cardinal rule -- always be kind. 
</P>
<P>
 As for how she successfully sells ties to men, she says she gives them choices 
and they ask her which one she likes. She picks it and they buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams works seven days a week. Even the Northridge earthquake failed to 
interrupt her work schedule -- Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., 
and Sunday from 10 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently she's been thinking about making a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a time, and I don't know if it's now, but I do feel like I'd like 
to spend more time with family. I have mixed emotions. No one in the family 
wants to take over the business. My sister Sidna introduced me to antiquing. 
Maybe we would open an antique shop in some out-of-the-way place; people always 
find you if you have something special, and it would be a fun excuse to go to 
New England or Europe buying. I'm thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 So Barbara Williams Cravats may close down one of these days. But it's 
doubtful the spirit that drives Barbara Williams will ever lose steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love hard work," she said. "Maybe I'm a fool, but the harder I work the 
happier I am. If I don't earn my salt every day, I'm not happy."

STORMIN' NORMANDY; TODAY, THE WIND-SWEPT BEACHES OF NORTHERN FRANCE ARE 
PEACEFUL, BUT ON JUNES 6, 1944, THEY EXPLODED WITH THE SOUNDS OF WAR. THIS 
SUMMER, THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY, HORDES OF VISITORS WILL REINVADE THEM.

 The early morning hours were cold and gray, with rain pelting down and the 
wind whipping at 30 m.p.h. After an hour, I was soaked and needed some shelter. 
I found it inside a 50-year-old Nazi concrete bunker. From two-foot-wide turret 
slits, where artillery guns once overlooked the beaches 100 feet below, I could 
see no more than a mile into the fog blanketing the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was miserable, and so it was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 On D-day, June 6, 1944, the weather was much like this when 5,000 Allied 
ships, 2,000 aircraft and 160,000 soldiers arrived on this northern coast of 
France. Some soldiers came by glider or parachute. But most of them first 
touched France on five beaches code-named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword, 
and fought their way up the sands to begin the breakthrough inland that, within 
a year, would put the Allies in Berlin and end the Second World War in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife Michele, who is French, and her sister-in-law had already left my 
brother-in-law and me here in the rain, calling us maniacs -- the word is 
similar in French -- as they took shelter in the car. Without a word, my 
brother-in-law, Andre, and I kept moving. Battlefield touring is an acquired 
taste; it's not for everyone. And neither is Cognac. But the D-day beaches are 
worth savoring; what happened on this strip of sand changed the map of Europe, 
and the rest of our century. 
</P>
<P>
 I never wore a soldier's uniform -- one of my cherished mementos, in fact, is 
my student deferment card from the Vietnam era -- but war as history has always 
grabbed me. I've walked the Revolutionary War battle greens of Lexington and 
Bunker Hill, and through the woods at Valley Forge. I've hiked in the forest 
below Richmond, Va., where Grant's army outfought Lee's in our Civil War. I've 
seen eastern France where trench warfare raged for years in World War I. But no 
battlefield was as moving for me as the D-day beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 For those veterans who will visit on the 50th anniversary of D-day this 
summer, the invasion remains one of the seminal moments of their lives. Older 
Americans remember that before D-day Hitler's army had ravaged Europe for five 
years, and many feared Germany might still win the war. Gen. Dwight D. 
Eisenhower called D-day "a great crusade," but privately, the day before D-day, 
Eisenhower wrote a message in case things went wrong: "Our landings . . . have 
failed . . . The troops . . . did all that bravery and devotion to duty could 
do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone." In the 
end, D-day helped bring an end to Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Be advised that if you plan to visit, sharpen your elbows because it will 
probably be overcrowded all season. On June 6, President Clinton, with as many 
as 50,000 other visitors, should attend ceremonies at Omaha Beach. Retired Army 
Col. Bond Johnson of Long Beach has led several D-day tours, but not this year: 
"It will be a 5 o'clock freeway traffic jam." So unless you already have 
reservations, consider going to Normandy by April. Or wait until fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than anniversary time, it isn't hard to maneuver around the Normandy 
coast, even for an American who doesn't speak French. Beyond the battlefields, 
be ready for one of the most beautiful rural areas of France. The sea air keeps 
the small cattle farms and apple orchards a lush green, flowers are everywhere 
and the architecture resembles England's, with slate-gray tile or thatched 
roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 This being apple country, Calvados -- apple brandy -- and cider find their way 
onto the table. There is also cheese -- Camembert and Pont-l'Eveque are 
regional specialties -- and dessert: apple tarts, perhaps flambeed with 
Calvados. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the battlefields, be forewarned: Unlike Concord or Gettysburg, where 
you can see a field of history in one view, it's impossible at the D-day 
beaches. The landing beach sites -- from west to east, Utah, Omaha (invaded by 
Americans), Gold (by the British), Juno (Canadian) and Sword (British) -- 
stretch 60 miles along the rugged coastline. There are package tours, but a 
self-guided visit is easily done with a rental car. Get a Michelin map, do some 
reading -- try John Keegan's "Six Armies in Normandy" and bring photocopies of 
maps in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Before arriving last July, my biggest worry was how to find the exact spots 
where the invasions took place. But the French government makes it easy. Utah, 
Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword, are now the official names of these beaches, and 
are printed in English on road signs. Although the beaches are what D-day is 
best remembered for, the first Allied soldiers to touch French soil, a few 
minutes after midnight, were airborne units who came down a few miles inland on 
the western and eastern flanks of the invasion beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop was at the western edge of the invasion, in the village of Ste. 
Mere-Eglise, near where the first Americans were supposed to land. The actual 
landings of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, however, were as precise as 
a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey game. In the nighttime fog, aircraft veered off in 
all directions. Paratroopers jumped with 100 pounds of equipment; some drowned 
in only a few feet water on farmland flooded by the Nazis; others were dropped 
so close to the ground that their chutes couldn't open.  
</P>
<P>
 About 30 Americans were unfortunate enough to land in the middle of Ste. 
Mere-Eglise. Aerial bombings had torched some buildings, and the fires 
illuminated the paratroopers. Many of them were shot dead in the air, and some 
bodies landed in trees and hung there along the city square for hours. But by 
4:30 a.m., Ste. Mere-Eglise had become the first town in France liberated by 
Americans on D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 One paratrooper that morning was Pvt. John Steele, and more than anyone he 
made St. Mere-Eglise a big tourist stop. As he floated down, Steele was shot in 
the foot, then his parachute got stuck on the church steeple in the city's 
square; unable to free himself, he played dead for several hours, as Germans 
and Americans battled below. Steele survived the war, and in Darryl Zanuck's 
film "The Longest Day," Red Buttons played Steele and helped cement his fame.  
</P>
<P>
 A life-sized paratrooper mannequin now hangs from that same steeple, its 
parachute billowing in the cold wind 60 feet up. Inside the 12th-Century church 
are stained glass windows showing paratroopers and the Virgin Mary.  
</P>
<P>
 Ste. Mere-Eglise is worth a visit, especially to the impressive Airborne 
Troops Museum. It houses a C-47 transport plane that the Army used to drop 
paratroopers, and a glider that landed on D-day morning. The glider is the main 
attraction and visitors can walk through it. It's extremely flimsy and light to 
the touch: all wood, wires, a few metal struts and green fabric covering its 
wings. The longest line here was to see a display of paratrooper K-rations: 
slabs of dried meat, oatmeal and chocolate, plus two morphine syringes, one 
change of underwear, cigarettes, etc. But my eyes stopped suddenly on another 
display case, this one containing dozens of insignia patches of the Allied 
divisions that arrived on D-day and soon after. In front of me was the same 
round khaki, black-on-white armband worn by the U.S. 94th Infantry Division 
that I had memorized from childhood. That was the same patch worn by my uncle, 
Ted. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1944 my uncle turned 20. Nine days after D-day, he arrived in 
Normandy among the first waves of reinforcements, and he would fight under Gen. 
George Patton, who led troops as they swept across northern France and into 
Germany. Uncle Ted was wounded near Metz and, after getting out of a hospital, 
he was among the first to cross the Rhine River; he wound up the war in 
Czechoslovakia, 600 miles from Normandy. My uncle has never been back to 
Europe. His Purple Heart medal sits in a closet, he gets a modest monthly check 
for his war injury, and in my lifetime he has said perhaps 1,000 words to me 
about the war.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From Ste. Mere-Eglise it's about five miles to Utah Beach. Along the roads I 
spotted the bocages , a factor in wars dating back 1,100 years, when the 
Vikings invaded Normandy. Bocages are massive hedgerows, mounds of dirt and 
vines (some 10 feet thick) that fence in cattle and mark boundaries. Fifty 
years ago American tanks needed steel teeth to cut through these mounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was still pouring when we got to Utah Beach. Utah Beach was flat and 
ordinary, the sand no more than 80 yards deep, with sea grass rising off the 
shallow shoreline, and behind that a gently rising plain. Of the five D-day 
landing beaches, Utah produced the fewest casualties, about 250. Part of that 
had to do with the gentle terrain I saw. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few memorials here. A granite monument to the 1st Engineer Special 
Brigade, sits next to a path leading to the beach, where a vintage American 
Sherman tank, repainted recently in Army green to slow rust, sits parked. Utah 
Beach fades quickly because eight miles to the east is the most vivid, intact 
war site on the D-day coast, and it is not on one of the five famous landing 
beaches. It's a promontory called Pointe du Hoc that juts out 100 feet above a 
wedge of beach. In aerial photos taken after D-day, Pointe du Hoc looks like a 
lunar landscape because the Allied bombing was so severe. Pointe du Hoc was 
considered a key target because Allied intelligence thought the Nazis had 
howitzer guns here with enough range to cover Omaha and Utah beaches. The U.S. 
2nd Ranger Battalion arrived on a sliver of beach and faced a 100-foot cliff. 
The Germans fired machine guns and dropped grenades. The Rangers fired 
grappling hooks and began climbing, but it was slippery and hard to get a 
foothold. As naval bombardment hammered the cliff, chunks were torn out, and 
some Rangers could finally dig in and climb. In 30 minutes, the Rangers were on 
top. Later, they discovered the Nazis hadn't yet installed the howitzers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the northern tip of Pointe du Hoc is an intact German bunker, with a round 
front like a massive turtle shell, the concrete turned brown from decades of 
rough weather. The French use the German word blockhaus to describe these 
massive fortifications, which still litter the Normandy coast. Why a German 
word? "Because the Germans put them here," my wife said.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbed wire runs along the path next to the cliff, some sea flowers grow along 
the edge, and over the cliffI could see only a thin strip of beach, which is 
still accessible only by boat. It was easy to imagine the horrors of D-day 
here, of the Rangers coming in from the sea, bombs scarring the earth, and the 
Germans firing back.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, the weather in Normandy was again perfect: gray, windy and 
wet. 
</P>
<P>
 Omaha Beach is four miles long and it was here the Germans came closest to 
repelling the Allies back into the sea.  
</P>
<P>
 The landscape here is more rugged and dramatic than at Utah Beach. Behind the 
beach, bluffs rise to 200 feet, and at both ends of Omaha Beach are 100-foot 
high cliffs. On D-day the Nazi defenses were heavy: The beach and bluffs were 
mined, there were trenches, concrete pillboxes and the most experienced German 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the American 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions waded in, they had been on 
boats for several days; most were seasick. Allied bombing overshot the German 
positions along the shore, leaving most intact. American amphibious tanks were 
launched too far offshore, and in the five-foot waves they sank like stones. 
Americans were hanging on to only a few yards of beach, while offshore Gen. 
Omar Bradley thought of giving up on Omaha and sending reinforcements to Utah 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has blurred which American officer said, "Two kinds of people are staying 
on this beach. The dead and those who are going to die. Now let's get the hell 
out of here." Then the Americans rallied: Soldiers used bazookas to knock out 
Nazi pillboxes, engineers demolished German bunkers, Navy destroyers kept 
firing at defense fortifications, and slowly the Americans moved beyond Omaha 
Beach. By day's end the Americans were only one mile inland, and 2,500 soldiers 
had died. "Every man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero," Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the sand you can see a plateau a half-mile away. Many of those who died 
here now rest there, at the American Military Cemetery and Memorial. Two other 
American military cemeteries in France are larger than this one, but Normandy 
is where presidents come, and where this year a record 2 million visitors are 
expected. The cemetery's 173 acres were deeded to the United States by France 
in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Once past the visitor's center, the cemetery suddenly opens up and your eyes 
move across the green field to rows of white marble crosses and Stars of David 
that stretch for 300 yards. There are 9,386 American soldiers buried here, from 
every state. The site is righteous and solemn, the grounds impeccable. 
Gravestones list each soldier's name, rank, military I.D. number, state he came 
from and date of death. One group of middle-age visitors knelt before a cross; 
I wondered if their father was buried here. On the eastern edge of the grounds 
is a reflecting pool, two American flags and a bronze statue called "The Spirit 
of American Youth."  
</P>
<P>
 Hedges block the view from three sides of the cemetery. But to the north is a 
clear look at Omaha Beach below, with walkways leading to the sand. It was so 
chilling here that my family and I didn't have much to say.  
</P>
<P>
 At the cemetery, I thought of my uncle Ted, and later I called him. He wanted 
to know in detail what the cemetery looked like. When I finished, he said about 
his war, "You don't want to do those things, but if you have to, you can. I did 
get to see Paris." He quickly added: "There's a golf tournament on, it's in 
sudden death. I've got to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the somberness of Omaha Beach, Arromanches was a pleasant change. This 
coastal town is part of Gold Beach, where the British landed. Arromanches has 
narrow streets and colorfully painted storefronts with British flags flying. 
But the most startling scenery is the huge lumps of concrete, some the size of 
a five-story buildings laid on end, that dot the sand dunes. Arromanches is 
dubbed "Port Winston," as in Churchill, because the Prime Minister came up with 
the idea to float in an artificial harbor to speed the delivery of equipment 
and troops. Crepes, and cider with 5% alcohol, are a Normandy specialty, and 
the four of us enjoyed some at a restaurant near the water. One crepe, with 
mushrooms and cheese, cost $10 but was so light I could have eaten a 
half-dozen.  
</P>
<P>
 By now the rain was reduced to mist, and children were running around in their 
swimsuits, never mind that the July temperature was no more than 60 degrees. On 
D-day, the Allies' dead, missing and wounded totaled about 10,000; German 
casualties ran as high as 9,000. Part of all that was so these children could 
enjoy summer on this beach.  
</P>
<P>
 One of our last stops was Ste. Aubin-sur-Mer, a coastal town along Juno Beach 
where the Canadians landed. Andre turned into a military surplus garage that 
claims to specialize in World War II gear. The owner was Monsieur Goulard, a 
grease-stained mechanic in fatigues and boots. Andre studied an American jeep, 
with an Army star painted on the hood, that looked 20 years old. Price: 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulard told us that he used to run a military surplus garage in Caen, 10 
miles south, but since moving to the Normandy coast his business had doubled. 
Why? "This close to the beaches, you can still smell the war." GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Reinvasion of Normandy 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The Normandy beaches are about three hours north of Paris by 
train or car. To drive from Paris, take the A13 highway to Caen, then the N13 
into Normandy. From there, use a Michelin road map and watch for the plentiful 
road signs of D-day beaches. Trains leave from Gare St. Lazare station in Paris 
and stop in Bayeux, a town seven miles from Omaha Beach. In Bayeux you can pick 
up a rental car from Hertz (in the U.S., telephone 800-654-3131). 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around: From Paris, there is a one-day bus tour to the D-day beaches. 
Price: $159 per person; call Cityrama (tel. 212-683-8120) for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of companies offer D-day package tours, although many are sold out for 
the June 6th anniversary. Holt's Battlefield Tours in England still has some 
space on its anniversary tour, and in August Holt's offers four- and six-day 
escorted tours that leave from London. Price: $375-$575 per person, including 
lodging, meals (tel. 011-44-304-612248). Galaxy Tours (tel. 800-523-7287), 
offers six and nine-day trips in August. Price: $963-$1,320, including air fare 
from the East Coast, lodging and meals in London, Paris and Normandy. (Add $900 
for round-trip air from L.A.) Grand Circle Travel (tel. 800-248-3737) from 
spring to fall offers 19-day, D-day tours that depart from Boston, with stops 
in England, France and Germany. Prices start at $2,895. British Airways also 
has various D-day packages departing from the U.S.  
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The best deals in Normandy are B&B inns, which cost $40-$50 a 
night for two. For a B&B list ("Chambres d'Hotel") write the Normandy Regional 
Tourist Board, 14 rue Charles Corbeaux, Le Doyenne, 27000 Evreux, France (tel. 
011-33-32-33-7900). 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: French Government Tourist Office, 9454 Wilshire Blvd., 
Suite 715, Beverly Hills 90212; tel. (900) 990-0040 (calls cost 50 per minute). 
Also, the British Tourist Authority (tel. 212-986-2200) will send a list of 
D-day tours from England.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: PHOENIX; WRIGHT PLACE; HE'S STILL CRAZY FOR THE BILTMORE 
INSPIRED BY THAT ARCHITECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Dean writes for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I came here three decades ago when this was a swamp-cooled, one-horse city 
with a few yards of freeway and a decayed downtown. But we always had escapes 
to the Arizona Biltmore, a winter hangout for Eastern railroad money and a 
great oasis of lawns, luxury eating and Art Deco romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Phoenix maintains an impeccable ascent as an NBA and NFL city of 1 
million souls. Chefs speak French and the food is herb-rubbed and pan-seared. 
There's a strong cultural pulse to its renascent, refrigerated downtown of 
high-rise black glass and stainless steel. And the Arizona Biltmore keeps 
plugging along; a decorous monument to the good times of the '30s, our passages 
since, and now the economically reviving months of '93-'94.  
</P>
<P>
 Within these sandstone walls, Edna Ferber wrote novels. Here we celebrated my 
son's high school graduation -- and the purchase of his first suit -- with 
dinner in the Gold Room. And I brought my British parents to poolside brunch at 
the Biltmore. For once, their rarely timid son hesitated before a social 
challenge. So they walked over and introduced themselves to Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Hollywood trysted here in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 The lady in my life and I came here last month to hide from things that go 
bump at 4:31 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 I also wanted to check the health of the Biltmore, my 65-year-old friend, 
which is emerging from the latest phase of a seemingly perennial restoration. I 
was helpless at her side in 1973 when a six-alarm fire barbecued the main 
building. I have worried as the Biltmore's 1,200 original acres shrank by 
subdivision into a 39-acre patch of landscaped desert where Phoenix's 
northeastern corner pokes into Paradise Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 20 years under several owners, wings have been added, pools 
dismantled, rooms renovated, old ballrooms closed, a conference center built, 
decor changed, tennis courts torn up, restaurants moved -- noisy upheaval that 
at times forced the Biltmore's off-season, summer rates down to $80 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old management of Westin Hotels and new ownership of Biltmore Hotel 
Properties since June, the latest refurbishing is almost done. And the base, 
on-season rate is back to exotic resort levels: $280 a night. The Biltmore, I'm 
happy to report, is buffed to better than new. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the 500 rooms -- at a cost of $15,000 per boudoir -- have 
been finished in a delightful advance to the past. Ours in the Valley Wing was 
a typical revival -- beds and Stickley chairs crafted in dark oak, and replica 
bronze lamps with vellum shades and rawhide whipstitching. That's what was here 
when architect Albert Chase McArthur was designing the Biltmore, and mentor 
Frank Lloyd Wright was counseling him. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim trendiness of peach, green and other colors standard to the '60s 
and '70s has been replaced by beige with cream accents that will be fashionable 
forever. Five-star touches include voice mail in the room, a concierge who 
calls to vow absolute devotion, and door attendants who sneak peeks at incoming 
luggage tags to address arriving guests by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon tea is now being served at the Biltmore. But somewhat haughty 
waitresses weren't about to pour a pot when we showed up Friday, 15 minutes 
beyond close of brewing at 4:30 p.m. Nor were they impressed by my recitation 
of the gospel according to Fortnum & Mason: In England, tea doesn't even start 
until 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Art Deco pool, all gold and lapis and an original glory, has been 
kept. Two new pools have been added, one with a bar in the shallow end. And 
there's a three-story water slide that spits human projectiles through a 
waterfall into a chlorine lagoon. Surrounding this new area are 23 cabanas with 
bathrooms, showers, bars, television, butler service and Brown Jordan teak 
patio furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was a red-tailed hawk, head ranging, that seemed aloft whenever I 
walked the grounds early. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first night, a Friday, merged Phoenix's two eras (old Wild West and new 
arts-center-style sophistication): cocktails with jazz trio backing in the 
Biltmore's elegant lobby bar, then a five-minute drive to raucous Richardson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows what magic dust turns a small neighborhood tavern into an insider's 
place with enough raw energy and fun for David Letterman to enjoy when he is in 
town. Or so goes the management claim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lure could be owner Richardson Brown himself; tall, blunt, with a shaved 
skull and a face that looks like it has paid a mercenary's dues. It could be 
the bar crowd, which is academic, cowboy, gay, old politicians with dead 
ideals, new tourists with too-bright Navajo jewelry, young marrieds, and most 
drinking Double Diamond ale on tap. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's popularity seems to be all these things, plus Santa Fe cooking so 
good you'll never need to visit Santa Fe. Be prepared to wait because this is a 
10-table place and nobody is in a hurry to give up the ambience. I ordered 
tricolored rotelle pasta with sauteed avocado and jumbo shrimp in a garlic 
cream sauce. She had marinated pork tenderloin, grilled and basted with green 
and red chili jelly. We waddled back to the Biltmore filled with superb food 
and disbelief at its cost: $42. 
</P>
<P>
 A morning rite of spring and fall weekends in Phoenix is climbing Squaw Peak. 
It's a 1.2-mile trek, mostly hiking, sometimes clambering, to a 2,608-foot 
summit where on clear days you can see Pasadena. We made the climb Saturday 
morning as physical therapy from Richardson's. At the top we were sweating 
Double Diamond but feeling reborn. I looked up. There was a red-tailed hawk 
just wheeling, staring and hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening we passed up the Biltmore's flagship restaurant, the Orangerie -- 
no relation to West Hollywood's haughty and haute L'Orangerie -- and drove to 
3930 E. Camelback Road, and Vincent's, more officially Vincent Guerithault on 
Camelback.  
</P>
<P>
 Guerithault is French, apprenticed at Maxim's, was chef at Fauchon in Paris 
and introduced Phoenix to rustic Southwestern ingredients cooked with modern 
French flair. Now Guerithault's reputation is international. Wolfgang Puck, his 
friend from their years in Provence, eats at this pink adobe bistro, and 
weekend reservations are best made two weeks in advance. My rack of lamb 
sounded like ordinary fare -- but with a pepper jelly, rosemary and grilled 
whole garlic. And served with a sprig of smoldering thyme that smelled like 
something illegal. Everything seemed French about her order of sauteed veal 
sweetbreads -- but went Western with blue corn meal and a wild mushroom potato 
cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday we fell to Arizona's undying cowboy legacy and saddled up. Our riding 
skills fall somewhere between city slicker and world champion cowboy Larry 
Mahan. The Miller Ranch in Scottsdale, a 45-minute drive from the Biltmore, is 
the perfect compromise. It is home of Missouri Fox Trotters -- tough, spirited, 
working animals with a respect for those who ride with their knees.  
</P>
<P>
 For beginning to graduate riders, manager Carol Prellberg has one-day 
adventures to Sedona or Zane Grey's Mogollon Rim, with approximately five 
hours' saddle time, or extended night camping rides to the Grand Canyon and 
through tribal lands of the Apache and Navajo, with 14 days in the saddle. I 
rented Son, a palomino stallion, for $80 for two hours. She chose Fancy, a 
sorrel mare, who hadn't been out in a week and really needed the exercise. 
Wrangler Ken Newton came along to see that nothing happened to horseflesh worth 
$6,000 and $3,000 in saddlery. 
</P>
<P>
 We loped, cantered and galloped through chaparral, along sandy washes and deep 
into the raw desert. Native Americans had been here a millennium before. Recent 
rains had brought their pottery shards to the surface. They'd also left 
everything there is to love about the Arizona desert. Road runners spooked by 
hooves and sprinting frantically to no place in particular. One, five, then a 
small swarm of bees heading to wild hives dangling from billion-year-old rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 I wished then I could have spoken with the spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have known why that red-tailed hawk was back, sitting atop a 
saguaro, staring us down as we rode. Or maybe, all this time, he'd been 
inviting us to his place. Budget for Two

BOOKS TO GO: FEAR AND SAFETY ON THE AIRLINE TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 COLLISION COURSE: The Truth About Airline Safety by Ralph Nader and Wesley J. 
Smith (TAB Books/ McGraw Hill, $21.95 hardcover); THE FEARFUL FLYERS RESOURCE 
GUIDE, edited by Barry Elkus with Murray E. Tieger, Ph.D. (Argonaut 
Entertainment, $13.95 paper); FREQUENT FLYER by Bob Reiss (Simon & Schuster, 
$23 hardcover) and HOW TO BEAT JET LAG: A Practical Guide for Air Travelers by 
Drs. Dan A. Oren, Walter Reich, Norman E. Rosenthal and Thomas A. Wehr (Henry 
Holt & Co., $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 According to airline industry sources, somewhere between 25 and 50 million 
Americans are afraid of flying. Some of these will not fly, period -- 
preferring to lose jobs or strain relationships, or whatever, than to actually 
let themselves be sealed into one of those winged metal tubes that shoots 
through the air higher and faster than (perhaps) humankind was meant to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- the vast majority, I'd imagine -- do fly but aren't crazy about it, 
and variously fortify themselves with alcohol, tranquilizers or sleeping pills, 
meditation techniques, prayer or anything else that helps to get them through 
the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, of course, air travel is an extremely safe way to travel: U.S. 
airlines, for instance, have had an average annual fatality rate of 130 
passengers over the past 10 years; during the same period, about 50,000 people 
have died annually in traffic accidents in this country. But, propose consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader and author-attorney Wesley Smith, air travel really is 
dangerous -- and is growing more so all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often, aircraft are outmoded, pilots are insufficiently trained, 
maintenance has not been performed, airspace is too crowded, anti-terrorist 
security is lax and so on.  
</P>
<P>
 After backing up their claims in sometimes alarming detail, what they 
recommend is not avoiding air travel, but flying "smart" -- knowing how to 
dress and act and what to watch for -- and taking an active role in passenger 
advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Elkus and Murray Tieger, who clearly don't think anyone should be 
particularly scared of flying, outline more than 100 programs, services and 
other resources aimed at banishing the frightened flyer's fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Reiss would seem to have good reason to be afraid of flying: The Swissair 
747 on which he and his wife were flying between New York and Zurich in the 
winter of 1989, lost an engine and then rapidly lost altitude and speed -- 
though it did land safely, returning to New York. Reiss' reaction, though, was 
journalistic: What goes on behind the scenes on a jetliner? he wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out, he convinced Delta Airlines to let him ride for three days and 
nights in the jump seat of an 18-year-old Lockheed TriStar, and then to hang 
out around various Delta facilities and dig into virtually every other aspect 
of the airline's operation. The resulting book is snappy, sometimes funny, 
sometimes even vaguely astonishing (as when Reiss watches the jetliner 
virtually land itself) -- and, some less-than-confidence-inspiring tales 
notwithstanding, will probably make even the flight-fearing feel better about 
taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, to some seasoned fliers, the worst thing about flying someplace is 
the way it makes you feel when you arrive. Drs. Oren et al. have studied the 
literature on jet lag carefully and developed a scientifically based program 
for eluding jet lag's discomforts. This has to do largely with exposure to 
light or darkness and patterns of exercise and rest, and involves the use of 
eyeshades and a sleep mask -- both included with the book. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't tested the method proposed, but the instructions are detailed and 
lengthy. It takes six pages, 18 steps and six days of modified behavior to 
counteract jet lag from a trip between Thailand and the East Coast, for 
instance. Jet lag can certainly be a problem, but in letting it rule his or her 
life for nearly a week in this manner, I suspect, the traveler takes a cure 
that is worse than the malady.

THE HEALTH TRAVELER: CONSIDER WHAT'S ON TAP AWAY FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think before you drink the water, especially in developing countries, and you 
boost the chances of returning home healthy. Dirty water can lead to traveler's 
diarrhea, giardiasis (infection of the small intestine) and a host of other 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The best plan? Maintain a healthy skepticism about the quality of drinking 
water as you travel. And before departing, try to find out the quality of the 
water supply at your destination and if preventive measures are necessary. Know 
when it's best to bypass water and choose other beverages. Just in case, learn 
the best disinfection techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Places with poor sanitation services are more likely to have poor drinking 
water," said Eric Rodenburg of the World Resources Institute, an environmental 
policy research organization in Washington, D.C. Small cities, towns and rural 
areas are more likely to have unpure water than major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those generalities aside, the danger of water-borne disease is widespread, 
said Dr. James Runnels, who heads the Baylor Travel Medicine Service at Baylor 
College of Medicine, Houston. "Southeast Asia, South America, Central America 
and parts of Africa all pose significant risk of water-borne illness," he said. 
"The United States, Canada, Western Europe and Australia, by and large, are 
considered as safe as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pack an anti-diarrheal medicine, suggested Runnels, and ask your doctor if 
taking along prescription antibiotics is advisable, in case of contact with 
contaminated drinking water. Depending on destination, the doctor may suggest a 
preventive dose of immune globulin (formerly called gamma globulin) to protect 
against hepatitis A, which can be contracted through contaminated water, ice or 
foods. (Although not yet available, two U.S. companies have developed hepatitis 
A vaccines and are currently awaiting federal approval to market.) Additional 
information on food and water precautions during foreign travel is available by 
telephone or fax from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
international traveler's hot line, (404) 332-4559. 
</P>
<P>
 If specific information about water at a destination isn't available, consider 
the drinking water unsafe, said Fred Reiff, regional adviser on water quality 
for the World Health Organization/Pan American Health Organization in 
Washington. Reiff said he never travels without a water test kit and 
disinfection supplies. If water purity is questionable, choose hot coffee, hot 
tea, beer, wine or canned or bottled carbonated beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking directly from a can or bottle is safer than transferring the beverage 
to a glass that could be contaminated, according to the CDC. Be sure to dry wet 
cans or bottles before drinking and to wipe clean the area of the container 
that will come in contact with the mouth. Don't brush teeth with tap water if 
there is any chance it is contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is only practical for travelers staying in suites or, perhaps, 
rented homes or apartments, CDC experts consider boiling to be the most 
reliable method for making water safe for drinking. Bring the water to a 
vigorous boil and continue boiling for 10 minutes. Allow it to cool to room 
temperature and do not add ice, which could also be contaminated. Store the 
water in a covered and sterilized container to avoid recontamination. Boil 
water the evening before you need it, Runnels suggested, and then cover it 
overnight so it will cool and be ready for drinking the next morning. To 
improve the taste, add a pinch of salt to each quart. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical disinfection is another alternative. CDC recommends using 2% tincture 
of iodine or disinfection tablets -- both sold at sporting goods stores. Use 
five drops of tincture per quart or liter, if water is clear, and 10 drops if 
water is cold or cloudy. To treat with the tablets, follow manufacturer's 
instructions, doubling the number of tablets if the water is cloudy. Increasing 
the recommended disinfection time is another way to increase purity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another option -- portable water filtration devices -- are promoted by 
manufacturers as the easy way to purify water. But even though some kill and 
remove many microorganisms, CDC experts do not recommend this method, noting a 
lack of what they consider to be valid scientific evidence in support of such 
claims. The systems work better on filtering bacteria than viruses, Runnels 
said. "Even the best portable water filter devices are not adequate to filter 
viruses," he said. While the devices may be good for a camper concerned only 
about filtering out the parasite responsible for giardiasis infection, the 
filters should not be relied upon to filter out the viruses that cause such 
diseases as hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 When should a doctor be consulted? "If you feel severely ill, pass any blood 
or throw up blood, have significant nausea or vomiting or symptoms last longer 
than three days, get medical help," Runnels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month.

DESTINATION: UNITED STATES; THE SILENT TREATMENT; 10 QUIET -- AND UNBELIEVABLY

<P>
 The name is ominous, but Death Valley really is a beautiful, mountain-ringed 
realm of multicolored rocks, a curiously rumpled terrain, geological oddities, 
magnificent panoramas -- and, not the least of its attractions, a quiet both 
awesome and wonderfully relaxing. Far from fearsome, the parkland is a 
comforting retreat for weary travelers in search of repose and contemplation.  
</P>
<P>
 Tourist brochures hype adventure, but sometimes excitement isn't what you are 
looking for. A destination wrapped in an aura of peace and quiet can sometimes 
hold more allure. As a frequent traveler, I've chanced on a number of offbeat 
places in the United States that seem uncommonly peaceful, and I've put 
together a list of 10 favorites -- all of them essentially outdoor escapes -- 
that gently massage your psyche and send you home with spirit refreshed. 
NORTHERN LAKES, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</P>
<P>
 The northern tip of New Hampshire, where it nudges up against the Canadian 
border, is a forested wilderness of deep lakes, rushing streams and maybe more 
wandering moose than there are people. On U.S. 3, which heads north from 
Pittsburgh, visitors are advised to slow down and keep a watch out for moose. 
The local folks call it "moose cruising," and it passes for big excitement in 
this part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a rugged land, still possessing a raw, frontier look -- home, as one 
guidebook author writes, of chain saws and pickup trucks. Good country for 
moose. Every other house, it seems, has a sign posted advertising maple syrup 
for sale. A relatively empty corner of the state, it draws outdoor enthusiasts 
in search of hiking, fishing, swimming and canoeing.  
</P>
<P>
 But the most impressive feature of northern New Hampshire is the string of 
lakes formed by the Connecticut River. U.S. 3 touches each of four southern 
lakes, snaking through a wooded corridor formed by Connecticut Lakes State 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon we picnicked at a lone roadside table set splendidly on a rocky, 
pine-shaded peninsula jutting into Second Connecticut Lake. Water circled us on 
three sides, a perfect picnic spot, and when we finally left it was 
reluctantly. Go in the summer to enjoy the lakes and in the fall for the 
foliage. Lodging is in rustic-looking but comfortable lodges at lakeside. For 
more information, contact the New Hampshire Office of Travel and Tourism, P.O. 
Box 1856, Concord, N.H. 03302-1856; tel. (603) 271-2666. VIRGINIA HIGHLANDS 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked into the lightly populated corner of southwestern Virginia, the Mt. 
Rogers National Recreation Area is a sprawling, 115,000-acre mountain preserve 
encompassing the state's loftiest and most remote real estate. Countless 
rushing streams spill out of these hills, and their densely forested slopes and 
open valleys are laced by miles of hiking, mountain-biking and horseback-riding 
trails. Still relatively undiscovered, the parkland seldom fills its campsites, 
even in midsummer. I went in late spring a year ago, and sometimes felt I had 
the place to myself.  
</P>
<P>
 Unusual characteristics of these Virginia mountains are the open areas called 
"balds" splashed across their slopes. These rocky, treeless expanses in the 
midst of the forest resemble the Big Sky landscapes of Montana and Wyoming. Go 
any season. Most overnight visitors camp, but other lodging is in motels and 
B&Bs. For more information, contact the Virginia Department of Tourism, 1021 E. 
Cary St., Richmond, Va. 23219 (tel. 800-847-4882), or 1629 K St. NW, 
Washington, D.C. 20006; tel. (202) 659-5523 and (800) 934-9184 for B&B 
reservations. KENTUCKY GHOSTS 
</P>
<P>
 In the crumpled landscape of southeastern Kentucky, I stumbled in 1991 on the 
ghost of an abandoned coal-mining town called Blue Heron, all but hidden deep 
in the rocky gorge of the Big South Fork River. Now a part of a national 
parkland -- called the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area -- the 
old community tells a haunting story of a harsh life only partially redeemed by 
the splendor of the surrounding countryside.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the park, set in the rugged Cumberland Plateau, is a reclaimed 
wilderness. Kentucky 742, one of the few roads entering the park, winds past 
superb overlooks and then drops in series of breathtaking swirls to the bottom 
of the gorge at Blue Heron.  
</P>
<P>
 In its heyday 50 years ago, the town was home to 300 miners and their 
families. But all that remains now is a giant coal tipple, which towers like a 
skyscraper on stilts. Elsewhere, open-air "ghost" structures have been erected 
to outline the shapes of former houses, the school, company store and the 
miners' bathhouse, where they washed off the coal dust. Go any season. Lodging 
is in motels, nearby state park lodges and B&Bs. For more information, contact 
the Kentucky Department of Travel, Capital Plaza Tower, 500 Mero St., 22nd 
Floor, Frankfort, Ky. 40601-1968; (800) 225-8747. MISSOURI OZARKS 
</P>
<P>
 Dense green forests blanket the convoluted slopes of southeastern Missouri's 
Ozarks, and in the deep hollows solitary farmers raise cattle and harvest crops 
of hay. Only a few winding back roads trace the mountains, and they are so 
empty that one afternoon a couple of years ago I spotted a portly wild turkey 
ambling across my path. In many places, natural springs gush forth from beneath 
high rocky ledges, forming beautifully tinted pools of turquoise or royal blue 
that make up one of the nation's largest concentrations of springs.  
</P>
<P>
 This is rural Missouri, a lightly populated corner of the Ozark Plateau that 
still holds firm to many of its mountain traditions. I went there to canoe the 
Jacks Fork and Current rivers, which form the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. 
The rivers meander like mountain roads descending into the distance, and even a 
novice like me could manage without much difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't have to canoe to enjoy the rivers and the region. Several of the 
springs, including Big Spring, one of the largest in the world, can easily be 
reached by car. At numerous access points along the length of the two rivers, 
you can park the car beneath a shade tree and, like canoeists and tubers, go 
for a swim almost anywhere. And every road I drove yielded lovely mountain 
views.  
</P>
<P>
 Go mid-week from spring into fall. Lodging is in motels, lodges and B&Bs from 
modest to deluxe. For more information, contact the Missouri Division of 
Tourism, P.O. Box 1055, Jefferson City, Mo. 65102; tel. (800) 877-1234. PIONEER 
COUNTRY, NEBRASKA 
</P>
<P>
 As a native of Nebraska, I am partial to the state, but I can assure you that 
it offers a rich pioneer heritage along with the quiet, distinctive beauty of 
rolling grasslands and an all-enveloping blue sky. The immensity of the open 
spaces is incredible. To some, such emptiness might be stupefying -- trees are 
so few you can almost count them and farms are widely spread. But every time I 
return, I find the solitude a release from the everyday clamor and clutter of 
urban life. My spirit soars. 
</P>
<P>
 To my mind, no other state tells the tale of America's pioneers quite so well. 
Earlier this year, I drove the full length of the famed Oregon Trail, which 
pushes across Nebraska for hundreds of miles, and here I found some of the most 
interesting and evocative sites along the way -- among them, a restored Pony 
Express station; Windlass Hill, where pioneers inched their wagons down a steep 
incline leaving still-visible ruts; and Scotts Bluff, the red sandstone 
mountain that was a landmark for wagon trains.  
</P>
<P>
 I drove surprisingly scenic back roads, as empty as any I have ever seen. Much 
of the land is given over to pasture for cattle-raising, and the wind-tossed 
grass in every shade of green is a constantly pleasing prospect. To its great 
credit, Nebraska has established roadside parks overlooking lakes or streams, 
and they are perfect places to stop for a picnic or to contemplate the glory of 
open spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 Go in late spring when the grass is green. Lodging is in motels, B&Bs and 
guest ranches. For more information, contact the Nebraska Travel and Tourism 
Department, 700 S. 16th St., P.O. Box 96444, Lincoln, Neb. 68508; tel. (800) 
228-4307. DAKOTA BADLANDS 
</P>
<P>
 This is another destination with an uninviting name, and yet the two badlands 
national parks in North and South Dakota are strangely captivating. Indeed, I 
was dazzled by them and apparently so was Teddy Roosevelt, who in the 1880s 
bought a ranch in the western hills of North Dakota. The two parks -- Badlands 
in South Dakota and Theodore Roosevelt in North Dakota -- are situated close 
enough to be visited on the same trip. The region's often violent thunder and 
wind storms have eroded the landscape of the parks into a bleak, yet fantastic 
jumble of pinnacles, buttes and spires that constantly amazes. The parks are 
also home to wild horses, bison and communities of prairie dogs. As awesome in 
its way is the emptiness of the Great Plains, which envelops the parks in a sea 
of wild grassland. In the spring, the grass is a thick and beautiful green, 
varying in tone from light to dark depending on the play of sun and clouds 
overhead. When breezes sweep the Dakota hills, the grass is tossed wildly like 
waves in an ocean squall. It is a magnificent sight.  
</P>
<P>
 Go in late spring when the grass is green. Lodging is in motels. For more 
information, contact North Dakota Tourism, 604 East Blvd., Bismarck, N.D. 58505 
(tel. 800- 437-2077) or the South Dakota Department of Tourism, 711 E. Wells 
Ave., Pierre, S.D. 57501-3369 (tel. 800-732-5682). WIND RIVER RANGE, WYOMING 
</P>
<P>
 The Old West -- the real West -- is alive and well in Wyoming's Wind River 
Country, one of the wildest and emptiest places in America. Out there, working 
cowboys still ride the range and hang out in cowboy bars, and you can wear your 
Stetson and pointy-toed boots and not feel like a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors to Wyoming head for the chic resort town of Jackson and Grand 
Teton and Yellowstone national parks to the north, and in summer the park roads 
are jammed. When you tire of the crowds, turn east to the 100-mile-long Wind 
River Range, and the throngs and the traffic evaporate. My wife and I circled 
the range on roads on which ours often was the only car in sight. We hiked in 
the mountains, went trail riding at a guest ranch, danced the cowboy two-step 
in a Western bar in the little town of Dubois, and woke up morning after 
morning to the sight of moose and other wildlife grazing in the quiet outside 
our cabin window.  
</P>
<P>
 Go in the summer. Lodging is in motels, B&Bs and guest ranches. For more 
information, contact Wyoming Division of Tourism, I-25 at College Drive, 
Cheyenne, Wyo. 82002; tel. (800) 225-5996. OREGON COAST 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I could see, up Oregon's mountainous coastline and down, 
white-tipped waves, heavy with muscle, pounded the shore mercilessly. I had 
stopped at cliff's edge at Cape Perpetua, a soaring headland that thrusts out 
into the Pacific. The rugged cape, draped in tall Sitka spruce, stood at about 
midpoint on my three-day coastal drive from historic Astoria on the Columbia 
River to little Brookings, an Easter lily-growing community 365 miles south 
near the California border. I was alone on this trip but not lonely -- the 
awesome clash of sea and rock was much too impressive to permit any form of 
self-pity. I shouted my joy at simply being there to see it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon coastline, one of the country's most scenic drives, can spark that 
kind of strange behavior. For much of the way, U.S. 101, a mostly two-lane 
highway, clings to the shoreline. As I drove south, the Pacific was on my 
right, and on my left hovered the lush forested slopes of the Coast Range. 
</P>
<P>
 I lingered along the way, taking time from behind the steering wheel to hike 
several mostly empty beaches. These beaches are not for swimming, really, 
although the hardy do venture into the water. The surf in many places is too 
wild, the undertow dangerous, and the water is unpleasantly cold, even in 
midsummer. Fog is frequent in summer, casting the morning with a gray, brooding 
beauty. When it finally disappears, however, the sun is warm and bright and the 
sea air, scented with damp spruce and fir, is as fresh as you have ever 
breathed.  
</P>
<P>
 Go any season. Lodging is in roadside motels, small inns, an occasional plush 
resort and B&Bs. For more information, contact the Oregon Tourism Division, 775 
Summer St. NE, Salem, Ore. 97310; tel. (800) 547-7842. MOLOKAI, HAWAII 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively few travelers bound for Hawaii make the little island of Molokai 
their primary destination. But this is a loss, because Molokai is the most 
Hawaiian of any of the islands open to tourists, and it is as scenically 
spectacular as any of them. What it doesn't have are high-rise resorts, 
expensive restaurants, nightspots or crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Graced with the same high, cloud-draped cliffs and wide sunny beaches that 
give exotic beauty to all the islands, Molokai remains that rarest of a 
traveler's dreams: a relatively untouched tropical escape where masses of 
coconut palms sway in the breeze, and there's never a hint of the irritating 
traffic jams that plague neighboring Oahu and Maui. Visitors pretty much have 
the island to themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 On the rainy northeastern shore, sea cliffs regarded as the world's highest 
rise to more than 3,000 feet. Down their steep, wrinkled face tumbles Hawaii's 
longest waterfall, Kahiwa Falls. The best land-based view of this impressive 
coast is from the height of Palaau State Park, sprawled at cliff's edge. Far 
below is Kalaupapa Peninsula, site of a national historical park that recalls 
the era when this spot served as a settlement colony for victims of leprosy. 
Tucked in the folds of high, rumpled mountains on Molokai's eastern tip is 
Halawa Valley, where a 2 1/2-mile trail follows a rushing creek to the base of 
Moaula Falls. There you can cool off and satisfy a recurring tropical fantasy 
by plunging into a deep, clear turquoise pool.  
</P>
<P>
 Go any season. Lodging on the island is limited but choices range from modest 
to deluxe. For more information, contact the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, 2270 
Kalakaua Ave., Suite 801, Honolulu, Hawaii 96815; tel. (808) 923-1811. DEATH 
VALLEY, CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
 In 1849, a party of would-be miners from Illinois was searching for a shortcut 
to California's Gold Rush when they stumbled into a large desert valley and 
almost never made it out again. They did escape, but their arduous trek earned 
the valley its fearsome name: Death Valley. Despite this image, Death Valley 
National Monument is -- at least in the winter -- an inviting place of quiet 
and beauty. In a multicolored moonscape, freshwater springs burble from the 
rocks, animal and plant life survive, and oases of palm trees shelter 
comfortable accommodations.  
</P>
<P>
 Most winter days are mild and sunny, just about perfect for exploring the 
valley's rich mining history and its amazing geological phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
 In some parts of the canyon, extreme erosion has created a badlands where 
nothing grows. Yet the slashed and contorted slopes have the aesthetic appeal 
of dramatic architecture.  
</P>
<P>
 Go in winter. Lodging in park inns run from modest to deluxe. For more 
information, contact the California Division of Tourism, 801 K St., Suite 1600, 
Sacramento 95814; tel. (800) 862-2543 for a brochure or (916) 322-2881 for 
additional information.

DESTINATION: MOROCCO; AN OASIS IN MARRAKECH; REMINISCENT OF THE FILM 'ENCHANTED 
APRIL,' THREE AMERICAN WOMEN RENT A HOUSE NEAR THE CASBAH AND EXPERIENCE 
MOROCCO FROM THE INSIDE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE MOORE , Moore is an editor on the national desk of the Miami Herald. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the starry-eyed ladies in "Enchanted April," we've rented a house for a 
month in a faraway, exotic land. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Italy, like the film, but Marrakech, Morocco's legendary oasis city 
of desert caravans, ancient palaces and luxuriant gardens -- the gateway to the 
Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, we're savoring the enchantment. 
</P>
<P>
 From our courtyard, the sweet scent of orange blossoms drifts into the open 
windows. Beyond the iron gate, a street peddler chants as he trundles his cart 
down the alley. The aroma of cinnamon, ginger and beef simmering in a 
terra-cotta tajine floats in from the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's missing from this enchanting morning is our luggage. "Pas de 
probleme, madame," they tell us at the airport. No problem. "Peut-e tre 
demain."  
</P>
<P>
 That means "Maybe tomorrow." On the other hand, it could mean man ana. Which 
could mean trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing luggage, however, really does appear the next day, on the evening 
flight from Casablanca, accompanied by charming, profuse apologies in three 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days into our stay we've already learned some basics: Morocco is a country 
both tantalizing and maddening, fascinating and irritating, opulent and 
inconvenient, seductively soothing and impossibly frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tourists pass through Marrakech briefly on tours but my two women friends 
and I had done that years ago. This time around, in February, 1993, we wanted 
to try living there. 
</P>
<P>
 We're hardly neophytes: a retired foreign service officer, a retired travel 
consultant and me, a writer/editor for the Miami Herald -- all over 60, all 
living in Florida and friends for several years. The house in Marrakech belongs 
to an American acquaintance who is renting it to us for a month as a favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term house rentals are somewhat rare here, though one may occasionally 
turn up a home or apartment through the Moroccan National Tourist Office or 
various international rental services (see accompanying guidebook). Our 
three-bedroom house is reasonable by United States standards -- $1,350 for the 
month -- and a bargain when divided by three. And it comes with a 
cook/housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The location is perfect -- just off Marrakech's main boulevard, Mohammed V, in 
the downtown section of Gueliz -- the "new" part of the city built by the 
French during the 44-year protectorate that ended in 1956. We are within 
walking distance of restaurants, shops, tourist agencies and the French Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cook -- Fatima -- is young, olive-skinned, dark-haired and pretty, and 
arrives in the morning dressed in a hooded, floor-length djellaba.  
</P>
<P>
 She asks us to put about $12 a day for food in a bowl on the hall table. She 
prepares a continental breakfast of rolls, pastries or croissants, with coffee, 
tea and juice -- and a succulent midday dinner. In the evening, when she has 
gone, we warm up the leftovers and add soup, rice or pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatima's heady concoctions are coaxed from a two-burner tabletop gas stove and 
a pressure cooker. There's also a tiny oven-toaster and a pint-size 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Our house isn't modern, but it has a peaceful, private courtyard shaded by 
lemon and orange trees and shielded from the alley by a stuccoed wall and metal 
gate. Indoors are three simply furnished bedrooms and a living-dining room with 
a low, round table and a typically Moroccan cushioned banquette extending along 
two walls. We have no telephone, no TV, no screens, no air-conditioning and no 
hot water in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 On our first night, we realize that the only artificial light comes from 
single bulbs in the ceilings, too dim and high to read by. It's early March and 
in Marrakech, at the foot of the snow-covered High Atlas mountains, the air is 
still knife cold. We struggle with a gas heater that finally lights after 
dozens of matches and endless attempts -- then flickers out minutes later. 
Defeated, we crawl into bed dressed in jogging suits and socks, burrowing under 
thick woolen blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 We're lured outside next day when we run out of matches to light the stove and 
heater. We find our way up Mohammed V to the French Market and prowl among its 
dozens of stalls. Each sells its own specialty: vegetables, meat, groceries, 
flowers, spices, souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a while to sort out the shopping puzzle. Meat comes from the butcher 
but sausage and cold cuts from the charcuterie . Bread at the boulangerie but 
sweet rolls and cakes at the pa tisserie . For light bulbs one makes a 
pilgrimage across town to the electrical supply store. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, a loaf of French bread costs 10 cents; buttery, 
feather-light chocolate or almond pastries, 30 cents; a bottle of pleasant 
Moroccan wine, less than $3. Restaurant meals are moderately priced by U.S. 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 When we begin to get lazy about locking up, Fatima gives us a lecture about 
Marrakech security. All the windows and doors in the house have heavy metal 
grilles with numerous locks. Coming home with groceries, we pass through the 
front gate, front door and grille, back door and grille, kitchen door and 
grille -- 10 keys, 10 locks. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most visitors to Marrakech the major problem is not thievery but 
persistent, unshakable, ubiquitous street vendors and would-be guides. Even 
accompanied by an escort, you can still be hassled, though your guide will 
chase them off. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrakech has no bus sightseeing tours. We were exceptionally lucky to make 
friends. One led us through the labyrinthine souks , or markets, of the Medina 
(the Old City). Another took us strolling through the lotus blossoms and bamboo 
of the Majorelle Gardens, which adjoin designer Yves St. Laurent's exotic villa 
(you can peer at its exterior through an iron fence). 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, we learned to put together our own "tours." Government-certified 
guides are available at the government tourism office on Mohammed V and at the 
desks of major hotels. We hired a guide for a half-day for about $10. 
</P>
<P>
 One can walk or ride a caleche (horse and buggy) or a petit taxi . ( Grands 
taxis are for out-of-town trips.) Taxis and caleches are modestly priced, but 
we learned to negotiate the rate ahead of time. A cab from mid-town Gueliz to 
the Medina is about $1.20; to the airport about $3.50. We paid about $2.50 for 
a half-hour ride in a caleche. Don't even attempt to explore the Medina without 
a guide. 
</P>
<P>
 A word about walking: Marrakech streets were built by an evil genie who 
scattered every obstacle imaginable across the pavements. Besides cracked and 
broken concrete, there are uncovered cavities where trees once grew, gaping 
drain holes with their covers missing, sudden steps up and down, and manhole 
covers with raised handles and padlocks lying in wait for unwary pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked Fatima when she was going to cook couscous -- how could we leave 
North Africa without the couscous experience? Friday is couscous day, she 
advised, and when Friday arrived, she served us enough couscous to feed a 
Berber tribe, heaping it around a chunk of veal with cabbage, carrots, squash 
and bowls of tomato and onion sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is one of Morocco's prime enchantments -- a wonderful meld of Berber, 
Arab, southern European and French. One of my favorite Fatima lunches was 
k'fta, which she provided in abundance. k'fta is a dish of savory meatballs 
served with tiny round pasta and a spicy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 We rarely went to restaurants, partly because we had our own cook, but also 
because it's difficult for women to go out at night without a male escort. 
Lunching out was a problem because we were in Morocco during Ramadan, the holy 
month of fasting when practicing Muslims give up eating, drinking and smoking 
from dawn until sundown. During Ramadan, a sidewalk cafe is no place to linger 
at midday, with hungry passersby coveting your lunch. (It's also considered not 
quite comme il faut to snack in front of someone who's fasting.) 
</P>
<P>
 One of the highlights of our placid social life was an invitation from an 
American friend to breakfast in the apartment she shares with her husband, a 
Moroccan. This was not "breakfast" as in 7 a.m. toast and coffee, but "break 
fast," which brings an end to the Ramadan day of fasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated on banquettes in their stylish living room, we gathered around the 
traditional low table and watched as dish after dish was brought from the 
kitchen. We waited expectantly for the siren and the cannon boom marking the 
end of the day's fasting. Then everyone dipped into steaming bowls of harira, 
the traditional fast-breaking soup of beans and lamb (there are dozens of 
variations). 
</P>
<P>
 Harira was followed by m'flakbah, a hot, cracked-wheat cereal; bowls of dates, 
figs and hard-cooked eggs; shebbakia, a honey-coated twist pastry; sliloh, a 
mixture of brown sugar, flour and spices, and cafe au lait. "Break fast" is 
only meant to ease the national hunger pangs; a full-blown dinner follows later 
in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 By the second week, the weather had warmed considerably. We ate our meals 
outdoors under the fruit trees and climbed the spiral staircase to the roof to 
hang our laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of Ramadan, we could feel the excitement in the air. The fasting 
ordeal would soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final night, we waited all evening for the signal. It came just before 
10 p.m. when the house shook with the thunder of five cannon salvos. The next 
morning I awoke to the music of reedy pipes and a man singing outside the gate. 
With our neighbor, we went for coffee on the roof of the nearby Cafe de 
Renaissance, making our way through streets suddenly full of crowds and 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sidewalk cafes, every table was taken. Families paraded together in new 
clothes -- the men in crisp white djellabas and new pointy-toed babouches, the 
women in brightly colored djellabas and high heels, little girls in starched 
skirts and ruffled lace collars, a little boy in a pink dress shirt, pink tie 
and very large black trousers that would surely last him out the year. The 
elevator operator at the cafe beamed at us and crowed happily, "Fin de 
Ramadan!"  
</P>
<P>
 Some of our U.S. friends cock their eyebrows at our tales of housekeeping in 
Morocco. I get the impression that they think, as world travelers go, we're 
missing a few marbles. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a point. Instead of our house in Marrakech, with all its charms and 
quirks, we could have had an air-conditioned hotel with a taxi stand outside 
the door and a concierge at our beck and call. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would have been too easy. And twice as expensive. And not half as 
enchanting. GUIDEBOOK

HIKING: SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS: NATURAL DRAMA UNFOLDS ON CALABASAS PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From fire and flood comes a flowering beautiful to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains, scorched by brush fires and inundated by winter 
rains, are beginning to bloom again. While springtime in the Santa Monicas 
always means floral rebirth and renewal, the changes this spring are 
particularly dramatic after the devastating fires last November. 
</P>
<P>
 A brush fire removes dead wood, relieves floral overcrowding and gives healthy 
plants room to grow. Chaparral, the hardy shrubs that blanket the Santa Monica 
Mountains, not only have evolved to live with fire; they require it for good 
health. "It's nature's way of cleaning house," naturalists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaparral's rebirth is best seen along Calabasas Peak Trail, which cuts 
through the fire zone and offers grand views of both charred and uncharred 
areas of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first plants appearing after the fire in the Calabasas Peak area is 
the wild cucumber, a vine whose four-inch-long, bright green fruit has soft, 
spiny prickles. (Though it's called a cucumber, there's nothing edible about 
this plant.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another plant quick to recover from fire is laurel sumac, a six- to 12-foot 
evergreen shrub with smooth, reddish-brown bark. Also much in evidence along 
Calabasas Peak Trail is the humble, homely Santa Susana tarweed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As spring advances, look for white and pale blue ceanothus blossoms, Indian 
paintbrush and Catalina Mariposa lily," suggests Milt McAuley, author of 
"Wildflowers of the Santa Monica Mountains" (Canyon Publishing Co.; $15.95). 
</P>
<P>
 The hike to Calabasas Peak, over blackened hillsides, is definitely not for 
everyone. Some Southlanders dislike walking through chaparral, burned or not. 
Others will find the blackened hillsides about as charming as burnt toast. 
</P>
<P>
 The main (pre-fire) incentive for climbing Calabasas Peak -- the terrific view 
-- hasn't changed. Calabasas Peak (2,163 feet high) stands head and shoulders 
above neighboring summits and offers great clear-day views of the Santa 
Monicas, the San Fernando Valley and the snow-capped San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From the Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101) in Calabasas, 
exit on Las Virgenes Road and travel 3 1/4 miles south to Mulholland Highway. 
Turn left (east) and proceed four miles to Stunt Road, bear right and drive 
exactly a mile to the parking area on the right side of Stunt Road. The trail 
head is on the left side of Stunt Road by road paddle "1.0." 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Ascend north on the fire road. Behind you is a view of Cold Creek 
Canyon, considered (until the fires, that is) one of the treasures of the Santa 
Monica Mountains. The slopes of the north-facing canyon are already healing, 
and no doubt the canyon will again nurture a rich variety of ferns and 
flowering plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Trail-side geology, laid bare by the fire, is fascinating. Large, tilted slabs 
and fins of sandstone have been sculpted by erosion into weird shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of a mile from the trail head is a saddle, sometimes known as 
Red Rock Saddle, and a three-way road junction. The right-forking road descends 
two miles through the blackened Red Rock Canyon to Old Topanga Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A very rough, bulldozed road ascending from the saddle leads to a narrow 
ridge. A trail-less, milelong, ridge-top route winds among sandstone rocks, 
then joins a dirt fire road for another half-mile ascent to Topanga Lookout. 
From the lookout are views of downtown Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and 
Santa Monica Bay. (Don't try this route if it's wet; it gets slippery.) 
</P>
<P>
 Your path, Calabasas Peak Trail, is the fire road that continues north from 
the three-way junction, leading another mile past intriguing sandstone 
formations. After a couple of very sharp bends in the fire road, you'll gain 
the top of a ridge and stand just south of Calabasas Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The road edges a bit east, but you join a left-branching fire break leading 
directly to the peak. Enjoy the view east to Topanga Canyon, west to the famed 
Goat Buttes towering over Malibu Canyon, and north to the metropolis. Calabasas 
Peak Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Calabasas Peak 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 4 miles round trip, with 900-foot elevation gain. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Charred, chaparral-covered hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Nature's inspiring recovery from fire; great vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate

BACKPACK & BUDGET: PIECING AMSTERDAM TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first few days in a foreign country can be the toughest for independent 
travelers. If Amsterdam is your gateway, here's how you can prearrange an 
economical start. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Amsterdam-based Future Line Travel, which was founded by the Youth 
Hostel Assn. of the Netherlands, independent budget travelers can purchase 
do-it-yourself packages. These include three nights' accommodations in a youth 
hostel, three breakfasts, a three-day ticket for public transportation, a pass 
for free entry to the main museums in Amsterdam (and many museums all over the 
country), a canal cruise and a dinner in an Indonesian restaurant. The package, 
which provides accommodations in dormitory rooms, costs about $128, or $113 for 
those under 19. The youth hostels used are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stadsdoelen Youth Hostel, at Kloveniersburgwal 97. It can be reached by 
taking a train from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam Central Station, 
then tram 4, 9, 16, 24 or 25 from Central Station to Munt. From there it's a 
short walk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vondelpark Youth Hostel, at Zandpad 5. Take tram 1, 2 or 5 from Central 
Station to Leidseplein. It's a short walk from there. The hotel version of the 
package costs about $200, or $128 for those under 19, for accommodations in a 
room with two beds. You can reach it by taking tram 2 from Central Station to 
the Westlandgracht stop, then it's a three-minute walk. 
</P>
<P>
 These rates are available until Dec. 31. Guests will need a passport photo for 
the museum ticket, a sleep sheet to use at the youth hostels (you can rent them 
at the hostels for $3), and membership in Hostelling International, which you 
can buy from the Santa Monica Travel Centre, 1434 2nd St., Santa Monica (tel. 
310-393-3413), before leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 Amsterdam, founded more than 700 years ago, is a popular European gateway with 
a youthful atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 It's alive with street theater, outdoor cafes and pubs. There are hundreds of 
miles of canals and renowned museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands is an ideal country for cyclists. There are thousands of miles 
of bike paths separate from the traffic. Bicycles can be rented in every city 
and town, usually at the rail station, for $2.50 to $4 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Future Line Travel, Holland Bike Holiday packages, which cost $298, 
include a brand-new bicycle (male or female model, no gears) that you can keep, 
plus vouchers for seven nights in youth hostels in the Netherlands (with 
breakfasts), a youth hostel membership (valid only in the Netherlands), a 
double pannier bag, tire repair kit and an information kit with a road map. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicycle can be picked up at the Heemskerk Youth Hostel, a medieval castle 
on the rail line about 18 1/2 miles northwest of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>

weeks (no sailing experience required) or one-week parachute-jumping courses,

STUDENT TRAVEL; THE BOOK ON TEEN STUDY TRIPS; TOURS: SOME GET PASSING GRADES; 
SOME DON'T. IT PAYS TO CHECK RATINGS AND ASK PLENTY OF QUESTIONS.

<P>
 No one wants a vacation trip to go wrong, but a bad travel experience is 
perhaps worse for teen-agers who have signed up for a week or a month or more 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be away from home for the first time in their lives and may not be as 
prepared as an adult to cope with unexpected hassles. Compounding the 
disappointment of dashed expectations is a sense of hopelessness. What do you 
do when Mom or Dad is an ocean away? 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is Rachel Wellborn, a 17-year-old Washington high school 
student who returned home last summer feeling "frazzled and ripped off" after 
an expensive five-week tour of Spain and Morocco. Wellborn had hoped to 
practice her Spanish-language skills, soak up a bit of Mediterranean and 
African culture and -- quite naturally -- have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some of her strongest memories are of problems with the tour 
program and with its two leaders. One of the tour guides had never been to 
Spain and spoke little Spanish, she reports, and -- even worse -- the two 
guides apparently didn't get along with each other. On one occasion, a tour 
guide swore abusively at a Spanish waiter -- "I wanted to crawl under the 
table," she says. Poor planning resulted in days of tedium rather than 
education and enjoyment. Complaints to the tour company's home office brought 
no satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing the tour, Wellborn and her parents thought they had done a 
thorough job of research. They got a positive reference from a friend who had 
traveled with the company the year before; they talked by phone with the tour 
organizers; they asked lots of questions; they read all the firm's literature, 
and they consulted guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 What can other high school students and their parents do to assure a more 
satisfactory summer holiday abroad? 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, thousands of teen-agers head for Europe, Asia, Australia, Mexico 
and elsewhere on a variety of organized trips that last from a week to a full 
summer. By one count, as many as 400 U.S. organizations -- profit and nonprofit 
-- offer teen-age travel programs, and foreign firms have put together even 
more. Some trips are primarily sightseeing tours, such as the one Wellborn 
chose; others are home stays, where students live for one or more weeks with a 
foreign family, and still others promise adventure. This summer, Austravel, an 
Australian travel agency, is introducing a 25-day camping trip for teens to 
Australia and New Zealand called "Teen Camp Down Under." Many trips are 
regularly advertised in magazines, such as Seventeen, published for teens. 
</P>
<P>
 For most student travelers, a trip abroad "is such a positive experience," 
says Anne Shattuck, director of operations for the Council on Standards for 
International Educational Travel, a nonprofit organization charged with keeping 
an eye on travel programs aimed at American high schools. The 10-year-old 
council, located in Leesburg, Va., has established a list of nine standards in 
an attempt to assure that participating tour companies are financially sound, 
that their programs are well-organized and that guides are properly trained. 
Students and their parents use the list to judge the quality of trips in which 
they are interested. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the standards, a tour organization must show that its programs have 
clearly established goals and learning objectives; it must submit a signed 
statement from an independent certified public accountant attesting to its 
financial stability; its brochures and other promotional material must be 
accurate; it must assure that all participating students possess health and 
accident insurance, and it must provide effective screening, selecting and 
training of its tour leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The council maintains a mailing list of the approximately 400 U.S. 
organizations offering teen tours. Each is invited to submit voluntarily to a 
detailed evaluation by the council's 13-member study team, but many do not. The 
evaluations are repeated annually, and for the review period of 1993-94, a 
total of 58 tour organizers met all nine standards. The qualifying 
organizations are listed in an annual booklet, "Advisory List of International 
Educational Travel and Exchange Programs." Copies are mailed to every high 
school, but they also can be ordered by sending a check for $8.50 to the 
council at 3 Loudoun St. S.E., Leesburg, Va. 22075. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, young travelers interested in study tours abroad -- and their 
parents -- should compare the programs of more than one tour organization and 
ask plenty of questions. Shattuck and others in the teen travel business cite 
some of the many factors to investigate: 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the program provide what you are looking for? Be specific in your 
queries. If you hope to practice your classroom Spanish, find out what 
opportunities will be available. Will you get to meet Spanish teens? Know 
exactly what you are getting. 
</P>
<P>
 * What is your money buying, and are there any extra costs? Ask if the cost 
includes all meals. What type of accommodations will you be assigned? If you 
want to go sightseeing, will you be conveniently located in the city center? 
Will you have to share a room with one student or as many as four? Are museum 
admissions covered?  
</P>
<P>
 * Who are the tour leaders, and what training and experience have they had? 
Many student tours are escorted by high school teachers who take a group of 
their students abroad. But many trips are led by someone unknown to the 
students and their parents. What expertise do the leaders have in the 
destination to be visited? Do they speak the language? Have they received any 
training in how to lead tours and handle teen-agers? World Learning, a Vermont 
organization that sent 500 high schoolers abroad last year, customarily 
requires its leaders to undergo a four-day indoctrination session at its 
Brattleboro headquarters, says spokeswoman Nancy Leitch. World Living, formerly 
called Experiment in International Living, is one of the 58 organizations that 
have passed the council's evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a pre-departure orientation? According to Shattuck, some tour 
organizations make a practice of arranging for students and leaders to meet two 
or three times before departure. Students and their parents can assess the 
leaders, and if they aren't pleased they can cancel from the tour.  
</P>
<P>
 * With whom will you be traveling? Many tours are filled by students from the 
same school or community. But World Learning, which sponsors a variety of 
home-stay and touring programs, prefers to mix students from all over the 
country.  
</P>
<P>
 * Is the tour company financially sound? This is not information easily 
obtained. Last June, hundreds of students and their teachers were left without 
airline tickets to Europe they already had paid for when Milestone Educational 
Institute of Cambridge, Mass., a tour organizer, suddenly shut down operations. 
Shattuck's council requires a financial statement and other documents from tour 
organizations hoping to be included in its approved listing. "Going Places: The 
High-School Student's Guide to Study, Travel and Adventure Abroad" (St. 
Martin's; $13.95) -- a guide compiled by the Council on International 
Educational Exchange, which details more than 200 travel programs for students 
ages 12 to 18 -- recommends asking nonprofit organizations for a copy of their 
annual reports and checking on commercial tour operators with the Better 
Business Bureau. And find out what safeguards are being taken to protect your 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 * What are the organization's cancellation policies? If civil unrest, 
terrorism or war erupts in or near your destination, do students get their 
money back if they or their parents want to cancel a trip or cut it short? 
</P>
<P>
 * What kind of supervision will the leaders provide? "This is very important," 
says Shattuck. Will the students always be accompanied by a guide? Can they 
tour on their own, or in a twosome or trio? Will they have free time for 
shopping, personal sightseeing, athletics or other recreation?

WHITEWATER'S POWERFUL UNDERTOW; THE DAMAGE OF DAMAGE CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around Washington last week, political types have two major reactions to the 
continuing Whitewater uproar. Some people express highly vocal astonishment at 
how the still- unknown, probably-not-so-big Whitewater offenses have acquired 
all the trappings of a major scandal. Other folks are just tickled at the 
Clintons' troubles and opine righteously about the First Couple's arrogance of 
power.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither school seems to see that a big part of Whitewater's fascination is its 
role as a mirror to the bitter politics of the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton defenders are surely right about one thing: The underlying offenses 
now laid at the door of the Clintons, especially of Hillary Rodham Clinton, are 
sins often committed in state politics with only minor comment. Money may have 
moved illegally between Bill Clinton's Arkansas campaign funds and the 
Whitewater Development Corp. -- but so far we've heard no evidence that the 
Clintons knowingly violated the law. It may also be that indebtedness to 
Clinton swayed an Arkansas banking regulator's decision about whether to 
sanction the practices of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, but such crimes are 
notoriously hard to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 True, it was not just these allegations that made Whitewater fester and 
spread. There was also what is now known as the "cover-up." The Clinton 
Administration has behaved almost inexplicably in reacting to this scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently ousted White House Counsel Bernard W. Nussbaum and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton both worked for the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate in a 
successful attempt to bring down President Richard M. Nixon. In other words, 
they helped create the climate of pervasive political mistrust without which 
Whitewater, at least in its current bloated form, could not happen. No wonder 
people are asking how these same two people could be so blind to the moral and 
practical dangers of stonewalling? 
</P>
<P>
 But the puzzle is broader than that. In the time since Watergate, we have seen 
scandal after scandal follow the same pattern: exposure of wrongdoing, 
cover-up, exposure of cover-up, conflagration. In other words, we have had 20 
years of training in the difference between successful and self-destructive 
damage control. Where were the Clintonites while all this was going on? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the facts are unmistakable: In the wake of Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s 
suicide, some of the Clintons' papers were removed from his office and sent to 
their outside personal lawyer rather than remaining available to federal 
investigators. The First Couple strenuously resisted giving the Justice 
Department documents in their control. Other documents were shredded by Hillary 
Clinton's old law firm. White House aides met with regulators to discuss an 
investigation in which the Clintons were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is going on here? Well, one factor at work is that the Clinton White 
House has been operating with an insufficient amount of adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 The tales of White House staff behavior are numerous and consistent: Meetings 
called on the spur of the moment. Often anyone can walk into a meeting and ask 
a question. Whenever crisis strikes, everyone drops what he or she is doing and 
races in that direction. As one Administration official described, "They're 
like little kids just learning soccer. They don't know how to play their 
positions: When the ball moves, the whole team just follows it." 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time, an outsider, like David R. Gergen or Lloyd N. Cutler, is 
brought in as savior and legitimizer. But the White House insiders resist 
acculturation. Thus, it is no surprise that some of the Whitewater mess is due, 
just as Administration spokespeople have said, to dumb mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Hillary Clinton is right to charge that partisanship is at work here. 
She blames it on Republicans and others who have political or financial reasons 
for opposing her husband's programs, but here she is off the mark. The 
passionate rage with which the opposition party and its writers pursue the 
Clintons comes from 20 years of being told by Democrats that Republicans and 
people who like the private sector are slimeballs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years after Watergate, many of the Clintons' comrades, who were not 
known as notable sticklers for the rules, used the issue of ethics as a tool 
against Republicans and conservatives. The ethics enthusiasts encouraged 
journalists in the habit of thinking of scandal as the center of political 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the press is hooked, with an addict's craving for scandal politics. 
Republicans have come into possession of a satisfying fix. To ask them now to 
stop in their tracks, assume the mantle of statesmen, and proclaim this an 
occasion for both parties to kick the scandal habit is useless and perhaps even 
counterproductive: The current scandal-mongering will probably not stop until 
both parties have had their noses rubbed in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, perhaps the strongest subterranean stream feeding this scandal is 
ambivalence about the First Lady. This resentment is somewhat unexpected. 
Hillary Clinton is admired by many for embodying the idea of the new, more 
assertive woman who shares in her husband's career without sacrificing her own 
individual work, interests and open access to political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people doubtless hate her for precisely this reason: She is a woman 
exercising unprecedented female political authority. Others probably dislike 
her certitude -- men because they think it pushy, women because it refuses to 
acknowledge the tensions and ambivalence of their own lives as workers, wives 
and mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Hillary Clinton has run afoul of the deep American animus 
toward nepotism. We hate the practice because it announces that power will be 
distributed not according to rules by which all can compete but within 
unbreachable walls of blood and kinship. Also, it enables some people in power 
to escape the normal channels of accountability. Mrs. Clinton has so far not 
been forced to give direct answers to questions about Whitewater. Each public 
appearance she makes, answering only what she chooses to answer, delivers the 
reminder that some politicians under scandal fire are more equal than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater shows us a scandal machine -- built of multiple rules and the 
large-scale urge to exploit them -- that is expert in magnifying public 
figures' sins. It also shows us that some of the designers of this machine did 
not take it seriously either as a threat or as a guide to their own conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal displays a generation, finally come to power in the White House, 
seemingly incapable of the self-discipline necessary to build an organization 
that might present a reasoned response to a crisis like Whitewater. Finally, it 
reveals a First Lady who does not understand that she must sometimes be 
governed by the rules and attitudes that constrain more ordinary politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 We have seen the 1960s all grown up, and the sight makes a depressing 
prediction about the course of the Whitewater scandal and the future of the 
Clinton Administration from here on in.

WHITEWATER'S POWERFUL UNDERTOW; CLINTON'S AGENDA MAY BE IMPERILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Schneider, William Schneider, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
political analyst for CNN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I do not believe that the politics of personal destruction is what the 
American people are interested in," President Bill Clinton said at his news 
conference Tuesday. He's right. Unlike his institutional critics -- the GOP and 
the press -- most Americans give a sitting President the benefit of the doubt. 
They will continue to do so until they are confronted with irrefutable evidence 
of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 No such evidence has surfaced. So let's be fair to the President and give him 
the benefit of the doubt. Whitewater is not Watergate. Clinton, personally, may 
not be in any trouble. But one conclusion is inescapable: his agenda is. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the Administration has two tough issues at the top of its domestic 
agenda this year: health care and welfare reform. Plus the continuing struggle 
to reinvent government. Plus deteriorating situations in Russia, the Middle 
East and Bosnia. Plus the possibility of a trade war with Japan. And now 
Whitewater? They don't need the aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater creates collateral damage. It makes the White House -- and by 
implication, the entire federal government -- look foolish and incompetent. 
That's Clinton's defense, after all. As presidential adviser David R. Gergen 
put it Monday, "There was no cover-up. There was a screw-up." 
</P>
<P>
 The impression that the federal government screws everything up has been 
building for 30 years. The number of Americans who say they trust the 
government in Washington to do what is right -- one in five -- is already at an 
all-time low. That view has consequences. Anything that undermines trust in 
government undermines the Clinton agenda. Why? Because Clinton is out to prove 
that smart Democrats like him can do something a lot of people don't think is 
possible: Make government work. 
</P>
<P>
 To which critics reply, "Make government work? They can't make the White House 
work." The percentage of Americans who describe Clinton as an "effective 
manager" has dropped nine points since January, according to last week's 
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Almost 60% of the public say that, when it comes to 
corruption, they see little difference between this Administration and previous 
Administrations over the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater is also taking a toll on White House morale. Just when the economic 
recovery was under way and the President started moving up in the polls -- 
kaboom! Whitewater lands a blow upside the head. White House staffers are under 
orders not to empty burn bags and trash baskets until it is determined that the 
contents do not relate to Whitewater.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the diversion effect. "I'm trying to minimize how much time I 
have to spend on this," the President said. "This is not what I was hired to 
do." Maybe not, but in last week's poll, a majority of Americans said they 
considered Whitewater an important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the White House has only limited control over the 
Whitewater agenda. The special prosecutor has a lot more control -- as he 
demonstrated on March 4, by issuing subpoenas to six high-level White House 
officials. The prospect of testifying before a grand jury concentrates the mind 
wonderfully. The White House quickly switched into full-cooperation mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and the press also have an agenda. And theirs, even more than the 
special prosecutor's, is in conflict with that of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 For Republicans and the press, it's pay-back time. Republicans remember how 
congressional Democrats never lost an opportunity to embarrass Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush -- Iran-Contra, Clarence Thomas, Edwin Meese III. The Democrats 
even held hearings to look into Neil Bush's financial affairs. So the 
Republicans are now threatening to hold up presidential appointments and turn 
Whitewater into a campaign issue unless the Democrats agree to hold public 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an irony here. Back in January, Republicans were clamoring for Clinton 
to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Whitewater. But Monday, the 
special prosecutor warned that congressional hearings would "pose a severe risk 
to the integrity" of his investigation. Witnesses might offer "premature 
disclosures." They could demand immunity in return for their testimony. Oliver 
L. North got just such a congressional grant of immunity during the Iran-Contra 
hearings. That's why his conviction on criminal charges was ultimately set 
aside, enabling him to run for the U.S. Senate today. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, it was the President -- he who originally resisted appointing the 
special prosecutor -- who said, "The whole idea was that we would lodge this 
inquiry in the special counsel so that the rest of us could go on with our 
business. The special counsel requested yesterday that (congressional) hearings 
not be held. I think that is a request entitled to respect." 
</P>
<P>
 It's pay-back time for the press, too. They couldn't get Clinton on Gennifer 
Flowers. Or the draft. Or drug use. Or even Whitewater, when it first came up 
in the 1992 campaign. Now, maybe they've got something on Clinton -- and on his 
wife, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The President may want to talk about health care or the Middle East. But all 
the press will ask him about is Whitewater -- and that's going to lead the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 It can can hurt the President in another way, too -- by pushing down his 
job-approval rating. That rating, which had been rising with the economic 
recovery, dropped to barely 50% last week for the first time since November. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers matter in Washington, because popularity is power. Members of 
Congress are all in business for themselves. If a President is popular, they'll 
support him because they want to be with a winner. If he starts losing 
popularity, they'll abandon him. Even members of his own party don't want to be 
associated with a loser. Not in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is already facing big problems in Congress. His field commander in the 
House, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), is facing possible indictment any day 
now. After 18 terms in Congress, Rostenkowski is fighting for his life in a 
tough primary this Tuesday. If he is defeated, or indicted, the President will 
lose an irreplaceable ally. Rostenkowski is one of the few House members who 
can get things done. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more bad news for the President on the Senate side. Last week, 
majority leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) announced he will retire at the end 
of this year. It's a wide-open race to find a new majority leader -- with 
perhaps half the Democrats in the Senate thinking about running. Mitchell was 
one of the few leaders who could hold the quarrelsome Democrats together -- 
just enough, it turned out, for the President to get his budget passed by one 
vote last year. Now the 56 Senate Democrats are bound to start splitting up 
into factions.  
</P>
<P>
 Among House Democrats, the center of gravity is to the left of Clinton. 
Rostenkowski pulls his fellow Democrats to the center, closer to the President. 
Senate Democrats tend to be to the right of Clinton. In that chamber, Mitchell 
pulls them toward the center, closer to the President. Mitchell and 
Rostenkowski delivered for Clinton. No one who replaces them is likely to be as 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the President who's losing points because of Whitewater. Hillary 
is, too. Her unfavorable ratings, at 40%, are higher than the President's. Most 
Americans now say the First Lady has "too much influence" in the Clinton 
Administration, up 12 points since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary is not only at the center of the Whitewater controversy. She's at the 
center of the health-care debate. She has played a crucial role in mobilizing 
public support for the Administration's plan -- in fact, her plan. Now 
Whitewater is turning the First Lady into a controversial figure. If she loses 
her political effectiveness, she could bring the health-care plan down with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that the Republicans are not in such good shape, either. 
They retreated to Annapolis last week and couldn't reach agreement on an 
alternative GOP health-care plan. They can't even agree on whether the 
health-care system is in crisis. The GOP has no heroic figure the party can 
rally around as the man to lead them into the future (Dan Quayle? Bob Dole? 
Newt Gingrich?). 
</P>
<P>
 And was there just a hint of contempt in Clinton's voice when he said last 
week, "The Republicans have decided that Sen. (Alfonse) D'Amato (R-N.Y.) will 
be the ethical spokesman for the Republican Party in Congress"? 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Whitewater hands the Republicans an issue. It may not be a 
scandal they can use to destroy Clinton. But they can use it to bolster their 
argument that government is part of the problem, and it is unwise to make it 
bigger and more powerful.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans don't want the government to take over the health-care system and 
run it like the post office. Or like the White House over the past few weeks.

IN THE FACE OF 'THREE STRIKES,' CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS ROLL OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a contributing editor to 
Opinion, is a senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at 
Claremont Graduate School and a political analyst for KCAL-TV.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's signature on "three strikes you're out" legislation won't 
end the potlatch politics of crime that has infected Sacramento. Don't be 
surprised if the last bill to hit Wilson's desk before the November election 
mandates pre-trial sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 For the saga of "three strikes" is a case study of the failure of government 
and policy-making, and of its leaders and the citizens who elect them. 
</P>
<P>
 At one stage, the "three strikes" bill was lambasted by Senate President Pro 
Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) as "overly broad, poorly written and fiscally 
irresponsible." Yet, it rapidly sailed, with Lockyer in tow and with virtually 
no reservations, through the Legislature, the governor's office and into law. 
</P>
<P>
 One may argue that Sacramento's elec-tion-year capitulation is a legitimate 
and proper response to voter anger over violent crime. But it's one thing to 
make policy with an eye toward reelection; it's quite another to purposely run 
from economic and social reality. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the governor and Legislature did on "three strikes." In doing so, 
they abrogated their responsibility as leaders. And by pandering to public 
cynicism and fear, they enlisted California voters as willing accomplices in 
the breakdown of the deliberative function of the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of "three strikes" also shows the pernicious effect that 
Proposition 140, which imposes term limits on state elected officials, can have 
on the legislative process. On issues like "three strikes," the proposition 
allows officeholders a free vote: instant political gratification whose price 
someone else will have to pay later. Few politicians can resist such 
temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Proposition 13 rocked the Legislature in 1978 has Sacramento been so 
cowed by a single idea and its advocate. That was when Howard Jarvis harnessed 
voter anger over skyrocketing property taxes, and legislative inaction fueled 
the middle-class tax revolt. This time, it was Mike Reynolds, who launched the 
"three strikes" initiative to overcome legislative diddling on crime bills. And 
this time it was the kidnaping-murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas that 
galvanized middle-class fears about violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jarvis could not do what Reynolds has done. Jarvis provoked legislative 
debate. Reynolds pre-empted it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the threat of Jarvis and his draconian tax-cutting initiative 
motivated lawmakers to place a more reasonable alternative on the same ballot. 
This time, despite serious questions of cost and effectiveness, the Legislature 
bailed out. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Reynolds has every right to be heard in the legislative process, 
even to challenge it. But he has not earned the right to control it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was unyielding in his demand that lawmakers pass the unaltered 
version of his ballot initiative, or face the issue -- and voter anger -- come 
November. His stubbornness short-circuited reasoned deliberation of any policy 
alternatives. And that still has not appeased Reynolds, who has refused to back 
off qualifying his initiative. "I don't want any room for squirming out of 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a disquieting difference between now and 1978 that does not bode well 
for representative government in California. In 1978, the Democratic-controlled 
Legislature had no credibility on the issue of cutting taxes. Nor did 
Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. Jarvis could easily circumvent 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson and his attorney general, Dan Lungren, enjoy the credibility 
necessary to shape the debate on crime. Either could have exerted leadership to 
secure greater public safety without paralyzing the criminal-justice system or 
causing undue economic pain. Armed with a crime-fighting legitimacy that 
Democrats could never muster, they might have moved Reynolds and lawmakers 
toward a rational compromise on "three-strikes" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But election-year politics prevailed. Wilson and Lungren chose to fan voter 
cynicism and anger over crime rather than work to redirect public emotion 
toward practical solutions. Doesn't that make these two even more blameworthy 
than the Legislature when it comes to abrogating the public trust? 
</P>
<P>
 Today's legislators -- and statewide officeholders -- have learned the lessons 
of 1978: When public opinion is on the rampage, the safe strategy is to duck 
and take cover. After Proposition 13 passed in June, Brown became a "born-again 
tax-cutter." And later in November, a slew of legislators who had opposed 
Jarvis were defeated for reelection by conservative Republicans who embraced 
the rhetoric of the anti-tax movement. 
</P>
<P>
 By voting for "three strikes" legislation before this June's primary, 
lawmakers moved to inoculate themselves against any such voter retribution. 
Even if the Reynolds initiative goes on the Nov. 2ballot, insists one 
Sacramento observer, the issue has been "depoliticized"; it no longer threatens 
incumbent legislators -- and Democrats, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 But hard fiscal choices will be required to implement "three strikes," as 
prison costs eat up a larger and larger portion of a budget already in the red. 
It is the height of irresponsibility for the governor and Legislature to avoid 
their obligation to make these choices. Or, at least, to educate voters about 
what making a choice will mean: Other programs will have to be cut, bonded 
indebtedness and taxes increased, to pay for more law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson rightly said that the bill's fiscal impact would only gradually be 
felt. So gradually, it turns out, that the tab for this new policy won't come 
due before term limits remove most of the current players from the state 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the media-driven frenzy over crime, Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego) 
said: "We aren't leaders. We aren't needed anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of voters and politicians appear to like it that way. Why, then, bother 
to have a Legislature? Who needs a governor? When will Californians understand 
that where policy and governance are concerned, there is no such thing as a 
free lunch? Or a no-cost prison?

WHITEWATER'S POWERFUL UNDERTOW; ASSUME THEY'RE BUYING THE TRASH; PERSONAL 
PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every day, plastic bags full of paper leave my office for the shredder. Almost 
every day, my secretary takes especially sensitive documents and shreds them 
herself. Am I para noid and overcautious? I doubt it. I believe most busy, 
competent lawyers behave the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 As a lawyer, I am in the business of confidentiality, and a client is entitled 
to feel that his confidences are being protected. If shredding can help with 
the protection, why not shred? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the process can get out of hand, of course. One local attorney 
instructed his secretary to shred anything sensitive about an important new 
client. He meant, of course, anything sensitive that was no longer needed. When 
he returned from court, he found that the entire file had been shredded -- 
including his client's original documents and, worsestill, the retainer check, 
which had not yet been deposited.  
</P>
<P>
 "It all seemed sensitive" his secretary wailed. In a way, it all was. Only now 
it was sensitive and gone. 
</P>
<P>
 I was first alerted to the necessity of shredding several years ago. I was 
incredulous. "Buy my garbage? Who'd be dumb enough to buy a lawyer's garbage?" 
It seemed unbelievable. "Only about a hundred different guys," replied my 
investigator. "How about the supermarket tabloids, for starters. They'd love to 
get their hands on the stuff about your clients right there in your 
wastebasket." 
</P>
<P>
 Now I know better. People do buy your garbage. They go through it piece by 
piece, pushing aside the orange peels and old Kleenex, to get inside 
information about what you're doing and, worse, what you're thinking and 
planning. They do it in Los Angeles. They do it in New York. And you can bet 
they do it at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark. After all, Clinton-related 
papers that gave away what they were planning and doing are generally more 
newsworthy than anything I might discard. 
</P>
<P>
 So today I shred regularly. I now assume every piece of paper I throw out is 
going to be read by some sleazy snooper. What I don't want anyone to see, I 
shred. 
</P>
<P>
 My practice involves many confidential matters. Roughly 10% to 15% of my 
clients don't want it known that they've even consulted me. Studio head X feels 
his job may be in jeopardy. What are his rights? What moves should he make? No 
one can learn that he's concerned enough to retain me. Any piece of paper with 
X's name on it must be kept in a locked file or shredded. Nothing bearing his 
name can just be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie star Y is being blackmailed. We've got a plan to handle the situation, 
but, if the facts get out, his career can be destroyed. Every memorandum gets 
shredded the day it's no longer needed. Until then, it's kept in a locked file. 
Certainly, it's not just tossed in the wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day I open three or four new files. My secretary prepares new case memos 
for each, so the data can be fed into our computers. The moment that occurs, 
the memo is shredded. It's nobody's business who I represent or what I'm doing 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefs are a special problem. I'll go through 20 to 30 drafts of an important 
brief before it's filed with the court. Obtaining those early drafts would give 
the other side a big advantage by revealing in advance my approach to the case. 
Would opposing lawyers buy my garbage to obtain those briefs? I'm sure they 
would not -- at least not most of them. But their clients or their 
investigators might. I can't take the chance. I shred them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shredding can, of course, be used improperly. It can be used to destroy 
evidence beyond recall. But so can an ordinary kitchen match. Ninety-nine 
percent of the shredding that goes on in law firms is legitimate and is done to 
protect the clients' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were no shredding, the improper 1% would be destroyed, anyway, only 
by other means. The shredder simply gives us a more efficient tool. Like a 
knife or a golf club, it can be used properly or improperly, depending on the 
intent of the user. But that's not a reason to regard it as an instrument of 
evil. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when you read that the Clintons' law firm, where both Hillary Rodham 
Clinton and Vincent W. Foster Jr. worked as partners, shredded thousands of 
documents, don't leap to the conclusion that they were engaged in a sinister 
cover-up. After all, we don't know what the shredded documents were. The 
explanation could well be as simple as that they were trying to protect their 
clients' confidential information or to preserve the privacy of a deceased 
partner from disclosure of personally embarrassing material.

JEWISH FANATICS IN HEBRON RAISE SPECTER OF CIVIL WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Yaacov Even, Yaacov Even, a retired brigadier general and former spokesman 
of the Israeli Defense Forces, writes on political and security issues for 
various Israeli newspapers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baruch Goldstein's murderous deed in Hebron has put the historic agreement 
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on hold. To revive the 
peace talks, many Israelis -- and Jews else where -- have called for the 
forcible removal of Jews like Goldstein who live in settlements surrounded by 
Arabs. Would such a move lead to Jew fighting Jew in the occupied territories? 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, the "doves" in Israel have 
tended to think that any Jewish settlement was a mistake. They considered the 
territories a "deposit" to keep until the day came to trade the land for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The various "hawkish" groups emphasized the historical, religious and biblical 
right of the Jewish people to settle wherever they wished in the land of 
Israel. To this view they always added the argument of security. A settlement 
was always a "security asset." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Israelis support the Alon Plan, named for Yigal Alon, a military leader 
during the War of Independence. According to his plan, Israel is never to 
return to the borders that existed before the Six-Day War in 1967. But it must 
not absorb the Palestinian masses. The densely populated cities of Hebron, 
Nablus, etc., are to remain Arab enclaves connected to Jordan by an Arab 
corridor. Israel retains "only" greater Jerusalem, Gush Etzion and the Jordan 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Likud Party held power, the principles of the Alon plan, especially 
with regard to settlement sites, were ignored. Settlements were the means to 
create an irreversible reality that would frustrate any future effort to trade 
land for peace. The name of the Likud game was: "Not an inch!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, we have "mini" villages consisting of about 30 families each. Netzarim, 
Nissanit, Kefar Darom in the Gaza Strip are examples. And there are Jews in the 
heart of Hebron, among them zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tel Aviv imports psychopaths from Brooklyn -- it's bad enough. Put them 
together in Hebron, and you have a sure calamity on your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose mentor was Alon, has good reasons to 
leave the Jewish settlers where they are -- at least for the time being: 
</P>
<P>
 * It is important to understand Rabin's natural inclinations. Former Prime 
Minister Menachem Begin represented "political Zionism" -- history is made by 
treaties, contracts, wars, annexations, peace, declarations and other political 
acts. Rabin is the golden boy of "practical Zionism" -- in order to have a land 
for one's people, one has to plow another acre, milk another cow, dig a new 
well, erect a new kibbutz. Thus, to uproot a Jewish settlement is, for him, as 
tough as evacuating Algeria was for Gen. Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to the agreement between Israel and the PLO, no settlement will be 
evacuated or relocated during the "interim period" -- that is, until at least 
April, 1996. When Rabin resists the call to remove the Jews from Hebron, he is 
defending a principle embodied in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Israel domestic politics, evacuation may annoy many political parties, 
putting the stability of the government at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rabin knows well the rules of negotiation. He wishes to retain bargaining 
assets for the crucial stage of talks that begin after 1996, when settlements 
will be important to all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it thus safe to assume that the Jewish settlers in Hebron, and in similar 
cities, will not be evacuated? 
</P>
<P>
 The massacre in Hebron highlighted a certain "catch" in the Declaration of 
Principles agreed to by Israel and the PLO. One of its paragraph states: "In 
the redeployment of its forces, Israel will be guided by the principle that its 
military forces should be redeployed outside the populated zones." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hebron settlers are situated, alas, in the heart of a densely populated 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to another paragraph, Israel will continue to be responsible for 
the overall safety of Israelis wherever they are, and will ensure and protect 
public order and security. If Israeli forces withdraw from Hebron, who then 
will protect Rabbi Moshe Levinger and his disciples? Would it be the "strong 
Palestinian police," soon to be established? 
</P>
<P>
 This is too optimistic. At most, it would an "infant" police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin will thus have to postpone the withdrawal of the army, a breach of the 
agreement, or eject the settlers. Between these two alternatives there is only 
one choice: evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a case, will a Jewish settler open fire on Israeli soldiers? I think 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 The tensions, of course, will be enormous. Incidents will occur, but not a 
full-scale armed rebellion. It should be noted that any additional evacuation 
of settlements is unlikely to occur before November, 1996. The talks on the 
final arrangement are scheduled for April, 1996, but since they will be 
occurring in an election year, both political parties will be reluctant to take 
any decisive steps beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 After November, it's a new ball game. If the Likud wins the elections, there 
will be no evacuation, and the whole agreement will be in jeopardy. If Rabin 
wins, and his government leans on a wider coalition, it will be Israel's hope 
that he will usher in the peace. Even if shootings do occur in places like 
Hebron, they will be promptly silenced. Reluctant as he may be, Rabin will do 
what needs to be done. Amen.

THE BIG TRADE-OFF: CLINTON'S ASIA POLICY STRESSES HUMAN RIGHTS AND ECONOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Manning, Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Progressive 
Policy Institute, served as a State Department policy adviser on Asia from 1989 
until March, 1993. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From human rights in China to trade issues with Japan, the controversy stirred 
during Secretary of State Warren Christopher's current Asia trip reflects the 
persistent tensions between U.S. interests and values -- something that plagues 
Bill Clinton's entire foreign policy. The Administration rightly seeks to 
balance these concerns. But this means making difficult choices and trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the Clinton Administration has recognized the importance of the 
dynamic economies of the Asia-Pacific to Clinton's top domestic priority -- 
economic growth and jobs. Yet, Clinton also wants to promote human rights and 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, while appreciating Asia's importance, the Administration's 
in-your-face tactics display little grasp of regional dynamics -- a defect that 
may prove harmful to U.S. interests. While the goals of expanding free markets 
and democracy are related, the former tends to produce the latter, particularly 
in East Asia. But with Clinton's policy, there appears no sense of cause and 
effect: He wants it all -- now. 
</P>
<P>
 In regard to China, Clinton has found the prose of governing far more 
troublesome than the poetry ("coddling the butchers of Beijing") of 
campaigning. While the Administration has, in recent months, wisely sought to 
redefine its China policy, its rhetoric has painted Clinton into a corner. A 
growing number in Congress realize that most-favored-nation trading status is, 
as the Australian foreign minister said to Christopher last week, "not a 
privilege, but a normal basis for trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Clinton's campaign rhetoric is enshrined in the executive order issued 
last May, during the annual MFN drama that requires China to meet absolute 
conditions on immigration and prison-labor exports and achieve "overall 
significant progress" in five other categories of human-rights issues. Until 
the recent crackdown on pro-democracy dissidents -- related, in part, to the 
coincidence of Christopher's arrival and the convening of China's Parliament -- 
Beijing had begun to take a number of steps that, if continued, would have met 
minimum U.S. demands. But no Chinese leader will make concessions amid the loud 
warnings Christopher issued en route to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 If human rights were the only interest Washington had in China, then putting 
the entire relationship on the line to express our outrage might be arguable. 
But beyond our $40-billion trade relationship with one of the world's most 
important emerging markets, there is far more at stake than human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of U.S. policy toward China is to see Beijing integrated into the 
world system as a responsible global power. To put it bluntly, with 22% of the 
world's population, a seat on the U.N. Security Council, a nuclear arsenal and 
perhaps the third-largest economy, if China is not integrated into a post-Cold 
War system, there will not be a viable international system. 
</P>
<P>
 From non-proliferation and North Korea to global environmental issues, the 
United States has a rich agenda to pursue with China -- and human rights is one 
of several important elements. The Administration recognizes this, and has 
hoped China would meet its conditions for renewing MFN and then, in essence, 
Washington would declare victory and delink the issue from human rights. But 
that strategy is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Christopher's stop in Japan was also in the "we want it all now" 
category. Even as a deal was being brokered to give Motorola fair access to 
Tokyo's cellular-phone market, Christopher was chiding Japan for failing to 
meet its commitments. There is no question that Japan's global surpluses and 
low proportions of foreign investment and import of manufactured goods are 
indefensible signs of an economy that must become more open. But as with human 
rights in China, the question is less about the objective than finding the best 
way to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan, it's not clear what the United States wants. Clinton's own Council 
of Economic Advisers issued a recent report saying that if Japan did everything 
Washington wanted, the trade deficit might be reduced by only $9 billion -- to 
$50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration's "results-oriented" approach has defined the bilateral 
trade deficit as the issue. As long as the United States is running large 
deficits and has relatively low savings and investment rates, we will have 
trade deficits -- particularly with a U.S. consumer-led recovery while Japan is 
in recession. The problem is long term and structural: Japan needs 
deregulation, tax cuts, more open markets and political reform to empower 
consumers. This is precisely the agenda of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
But Clinton's approach only increases Hosokawa's difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's team appears to be in an intellectual time warp, circa 1989. 
U.S.-Japan policy is marked by a deep distrust -- not entirely unearned -- of 
Japan, reflecting the revisionist view of Japan. The revisionists argued that 
"Japan Inc." was an unstoppable, impervious economic juggernaut bent on 
dominating the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But reality discredited this. Japan is in its third year of recession, its 
stock market has shrunk in half, its investors lost billions in U.S. real 
estate and it is in the throes of political change. Yet, it is the revisionist 
view of Japan that still drives U.S. Japan policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is right to make economics the centerpiece of U.S.-Japanese 
relations and to demand more responsible Japanese behavior. But the style and 
substance of its approach are likely to be counterproductive. There is a 
near-term danger of imperiling the political and security aspects of the 
relationship. Longer term, there is a risk that bullying tactics amid change in 
Japan will fuel those who view Japan as part of Asia rather than part of the 
West -- to the detriment of Asian stability. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of the Administration's Asia policy is that, in its yuppie desire 
for instant gratification, it is fighting battles it is almost certain to win 
-- if it practiced patience. The consistent pattern in East Asia has been that 
export-led economic growth produces a large urban middle class that then 
demands political participation and pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, inspired by the "people power" revolution in the Philippines, South 
Korea began to democratize in 1988. Taiwan has undergone a similar process and 
in Thailand, in 1993, activists armed with cellular phones forced out the 
generals and restored democratic rule. In a sense, China's Tian An Men was an 
effort by new social forces created by economic reform to assert themselves 
politically. As long as economic reform expands, political reform in China will 
follow. Beijing's octogenarians are not immortal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's call for a "New Pacific Community" is right. But it comes just as 
Asia is coming of age. Asians are trading and investing with each other far 
more than with America. As U.S. markets diminish, so does U.S. leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond shared interests and shared responsibility, there is a need for mutual 
respect if a sense of community is to be built. Asians are quick to point out 
the imperfections in American society -- from the murder rate to illiteracy. 
Unless the United States pursues a more enlightened engagement in the 
Asia-Pacific, it may find itself increasingly marginalized.

THE UNTOLD TRUTH BEHIND THE MAMMOGRAM DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Center.

<P>
 The national angst over whether women aged 40 to 49 should undergo regular 
mammography cancer exams surfaced again last week. Some members of Congress 
took turns criticizing the National Cancer In stitute for "irresponsibly" 
recommending that these women need not be routinely tested. "They (the NCI) 
play it very fast and loose with women's health," Rep. Patricia Schroeder 
(D-Colo.) told a House subcommittee looking into the institute's new 
guidelines. "This is one of the final insults." 
</P>
<P>
 One byproduct of this controversy is endangering lives. All the tumult and 
emotion have buried an important message. Every study of mammography screening 
on women 50 and older has shown the exam's potential to save lives. Yet, only 
about one-third of these women are getting mammograms. Why? Because we are 
obsessed with cancer risks faced by younger women. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every woman's magazine article about breast cancer is illustrated with 
a photograph of a 25-year-old. The public-service announcements on television 
all feature a 30-year-old discovering cancer. The older women most likely to 
develop breast cancer simply don't identify with these women. The message is 
lost on them -- and will continue to be unless we change the way information 
about mammography is delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, what should women under 50 do? Last December, the NCI reviewed the data 
on pre-50 mammogram exams. As a result, it backed off its 1987 recommendation 
that women 40 to 49 should automatically be tested every other year. 
</P>
<P>
 This change in policy was not prompted by a desire to save money in President 
Bill Clinton's health-care reform, as many critics have charged. Nor was it an 
"insult" to women. Nor was it intended to deny younger women their God-given 
right to radiation. Rather, it was about telling the truth: We simply do not 
have the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, the American Cancer Society, on the basis of a few inconclusive 
studies, decided that mammography screening might save younger women's lives. 
It recommended mammograms for women at age 35, and exams every year and a half 
to two years for women 40 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, these guidelines, although more the product of wishful 
thinking than good science, became etched in stone. Women believed they were 
rooted in established fact. Many professional organizations uncritically echoed 
the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight major studies of mammography screening, however, have failed to 
demonstrate a single benefit for women 40 to 49 five to seven years after their 
first mammogram. Ten to 12 years later, the benefit is marginal, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the American Cancer Society quietly dropped, in 1991, its 
recommendation for a mammogram at 35. But it clung steadfastly to its advice of 
"Once a Year for a Lifetime" for women 40 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
 When a long-awaited Canadian study recently confirmed the results of all 
previous investigations, the cancer society came face-to-face with the 
contradictions between its guidelines and the data. Astoundingly, it declared 
that women would be "too confused" if they were told the truth and that the 
guidelines should thus stand. For its part, the National Cancer Institute 
acknowledged that women younger than 50 are capable of reviewing the pros and 
cons and making their own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the pros and cons faced by a 45-year-old woman weighing her options? 
Mammography can detect small or early cancers in some women. But that is not 
the issue. Rather, it is whether finding such lesions early can actually save 
lives. The answer is consistently no. In some women, cancer is so slow growing 
that it doesn't matter whether it is found this year or next; they will live, 
either way. In others, the cancer is so aggressive they will die no matter when 
diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be other benefits to considering mammography, however. What if 
screening detects a cancer that can be treated without mastectomy, thereby 
improving the quality of a woman's life even if it cannot extend her years? 
That difference may be important to some women, making screening worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a real risk that stems from imperfect technology. Many mammograms 
will be read as negative when there is, in fact, a tumor because the breast 
tissue is dense, lulling women into a false sense of security. Other mammograms 
are read as suspicious, leading to extra X-rays and unnecessary biopsies. These 
issues will be weighed differently by different women. A 45-year-old with a 
family history of breast cancer may find the risks worth taking, while a 
low-risk woman with dense breasts may not. 
</P>
<P>
 Women over 50 need to be encouraged to get yearly mammography screenings. 
Younger women need to review the issues and make up their own minds. True 
prevention of breast cancer requires that women be given the truth about 
medical tests, and that means better-funded studies rather than fiery rhetoric.

RETHINKING THE BIOSPHERE; ARIZONA EXPERIMENT COULD BE GREAT TOOL, IF LEADERS 
SHED IDEOLOGICAL BLINDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the arid Arizona countryside just north of Tucson stands a superb 
scientific machine, a tightly sealed glass and steel complex rising 91 feet 
over the desert floor and covering the space of three football fields. It is a 
private global-ecology lab to probe the human future on Earth and beyond, 
extending to the colonization of Mars. Even NASA scientists say the space 
agency could not have done better. The only trouble is that its owners do not 
quite know how best to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine is Biosphere 2, built privately at a cost of $150 million and 
bankrolled largely by Edward P. Bass, a Texas billionaire. Last September, 
seven people emerged after two years of attempting self-sufficiency in a closed 
system with 3,800 other species. (The overly rich soil caused oxygen to drop so 
low that fresh air had to be pumped in.) 
</P>
<P>
 Just what was proved in those two years is unclear. When details of the 
proposed Biosphere first became known, some derided the project as more 
showmanship than science; many mainstream scientists said it had no testable 
hypotheses or controlled experimental design. 
</P>
<P>
 The Biosphere team responded well by asking for a review by a panel of outside 
scientists chaired by a leading ecologist, Thomas E. Lovejoy of the Smithsonian 
Institution. But the panel quit in frustration, saying its calls for more 
rigorous science fell mostly on deaf ears. "That was not science, it was 
enclosed gardening," says Gerald A. Soffen, a panel member who was NASA's 
project scientist for the Viking mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Biosphere folks learned lessons, and these now are being applied in 
a second venture. Last Sunday, seven new "Biospherians" entered the planetary 
test tube. This time their stays will be shorter and more flexible, and various 
scientists will visit to conduct atmospheric, entomological and agricultural 
research. Oxygen will be piped in as needed; the outside advisers say that 
scientific results will be valid as long as input and output of chemicals or 
gases are measured. Thus, properly, the notion that Biosphere must be sealed 
has been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, 40 geckos and 50 toads have been introduced to control cockroaches, 
which seem to be determined to follow human beings wherever they go.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Biosphere leaders bridle at strict scientific methodology. The director 
of research, John B. Corliss, says that normal academic standards "blunt" 
creativity. "Our goals are high," he says. "The point of going to Mars is to 
strive for perfection." As for outside advice, Corliss is candid: "We listened 
more to those who were enthusiastic about Biosphere than those who were not." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, criticism is unwelcome. The Biosphere is a magnificent tool 
that could be a great boon to mankind, permitting ecological science on a scale 
never before possible. Let us hope that its leaders can see beyond their 
romantic ideological blinders.

CENTRAL LIBRARY SUNDAY HOURS

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I think both sides of the issue need to work together on a compromise. The 
Central Library weekend patron would be at a significant disadvantage by not 
having the services of the professional librarian.Volunteers, though 
well-meaning, will not be able to serve the clientele in the manner they 
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 I also believe that the librarians who are insisting on being paid extra for 
weekend work should re-examine their priorities in the reality of these 
difficult fiscal times. Local government's financial capabilities are so 
stretched right now that just being able to keep this wonderful resource open 
on weekends is a terrific strain on the budget. Librarians should be trying to 
facilitate the process, not obstruct it.

DEPARTMENT OF PERRIER AND POWER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The curious spending habits of the Department of Water and Power are again 
under scrutiny, as well they should be. This time, City Controller Rick Tuttle 
is refusing to cut a $75,000 overtime check for retired DWP general manager Dan 
Walters until the City Council reviews the matter.The disputed compensation is 
the latest example of ill-conceived practices at the city-owned utility -- for 
which the taxpayer gets the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters retired in February after a controversial tenure as general manager, a 
$165,000-a-year post. The same day he retired, he was "demoted" to assistant 
general manager. The voluntary demotion allowed Waters to collect on the comp 
time he had accrued before taking the top job. He could not collect the money 
while general manager because the position is exempt from overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The very odd practice, questioned just last week in a report on the city's 
rising overtime costs, is allowed under an agreement between the DWP and the 
Management Employees Assn. In 1990, another retiring general manager, Norman E. 
Nichols used a similar demotion to collect $27,000 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters is no stranger at making the most of feeding at the public trough. 
Under his leadership the DWP was taken to task for spending abuses, including 
pricey catered meals for supervisors, during last fall's employee strike.  
</P>
<P>
 The Waters case again raises nagging questions about management at DWP. It's 
hard to have confidence in government that allows such outrageous stuff.

 * Starr's article calls the police and the librarians' unions "irresponsible 
trade unionism." As a union member for almost my whole working life, I am 
offended by his attack on these unions, even so far as to suggest that these 
people should lose their jobs, while ignoring the role management plays. 
</P>
<P>
 According to him it's all the unions' fault and their members' fault. Had 
Starr looked around, I am quite sure he would have seen the management side 
refusing to bargain or negotiate with anything close to a meaningful offer. 
When the management side shows a lack of interest in resolving the issues, what 
other choice is there than to do something outrageous, as these unions have 
done? I suspect they had no choice. Now let us hope they can be recognized as 
full partners in the negotiations and their respective issues addressed.

 * As a former spectator of events at the Olympic Auditorium, I was happy to 
read Tim Kawakami's article about current efforts to revive and reopen that 
arena. However, your history summary states: "1945: The Olympic Auditorium 
begins wrestling shows, promoted by Eaton. . . ." This gives the impression 
that there was no wrestling at the Olympic prior to 1945.I saw wrestling 
matches there from the '30s up to World War II, promoted by Jack Daro. Among 
the wrestling notables I saw in the Olympic ring during this period were Jimmy 
Londos and Sandor Szabo, as well as former football star Bronco Nagurski and 
former heavyweight boxing title contender, George Godfrey. These old-timers, 
and many more, from the Olympic's pre-baby-boomer past may be unknown to 
younger generations, but they were there!

WHY 'THREE STRIKES' MAY TAKE CALIFORNIA FOR A RIDE; ACT OF FISCAL RECKLESSNESS 
MAY YIELD TO THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Would that complex and seemingly intractable problems like crime, welfare 
fraud and deteriorating schools were amenable to quick and facile solutions. A 
simple idea embodied by a catchy phrase, a stroke of the governor's pen, and, 
presto, the problem is on the road to solution. Alas, it's not so easy. But no 
one seems to have told our state leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes and you're out" is now law in California. Last week Gov. Pete 
Wilson signed the first of several bills destined for his desk, imposing life 
prison terms without the possibility of parole for three-time felons. The 
notion of incarcerating for life incorrigible criminals has enormous appeal; 
indeed, we support a much more precisely targeted -- and fiscally responsible 
-- version of the idea. But the bill passed by the Legislature with blinding 
speed -- and promptly signed by the governor amid much talk about getting 
"tough" on crime -- is anything but a reasoned, promising new tool to stop the 
bloodshed in our streets, homes and schools. It is, instead, an act of fiscal 
recklessness on the part of this state. And from first reports, it's a law 
already yielding to another sadly familiar law: the Law of Unintended 
Consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-strikes law casts far too wide a net. The law defines as "strikes" a 
number of felonies, most but not all of which involve violence or attempted 
violence. (One of the first felons to be charged under the law is a man who 
allegedly wrested 50 cents from a homeless man.) Individuals who have 
repeatedly committed serious, but not always violent, crimes like residential 
burglary or selling drugs to a minor could be imprisoned for the rest of their 
lives. As a result, California's prison population of 120,000 inmates, already 
the largest of any state, easily could swell to more than double over the next 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And while there is no clear evidence that this new law will deter crime, there 
is plenty of reason to believe that it will gridlock the criminal justice 
system through more and longer trials and fiscally contort California. Wilson's 
own Department of Corrections, in recent weeks, estimated that "three strikes" 
may cost as much as $5.7 billion annually by 2030. But reliable cost estimates 
were unavailable, or seemingly were considered of no consequence by lawmakers, 
as the bill sped to passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature and especially the governor, who values his reputation as a 
tough fiscal manager, have been inexcusably vague about exactly how this 
financially strapped state can afford to maintain an estimated 275,000 prison 
inmates to their graves. Where will the billions of dollars come from? Will 
some college campuses, hospitals, libraries and schools be closed so new 
prisons can be built? Will children be denied schoolbooks or immunizations so 
the necessary prison guards can be hired? Will some laid-off Californians get 
no unemployment relief or job training in order to create the perverse welfare 
system this law calls for -- one that, as Wilson said, will "turn career 
criminals into career inmates"? 
</P>
<P>
 The unseemly haste of the Legislature and the governor in enacting "three 
strikes" may be only the first act of a long-running crime-control drama this 
year. Other versions of "three strikes" are now moving through the Legislature, 
and backers of a tough "three strikes" ballot initiative seem unsatisfied with 
the bill Wilson signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more troubling are Wilson's plans to move well beyond the "three strikes" 
concept and to seek passage of bills that would put first-time rapists and 
child molesters in prison for life without the possibility of parole. These 
crimes are indisputably detestable but, apart from the truly incalculable 
expense such proposals would entail, would it be just or appropriate to impose 
such harsh punishment for a first offense? Would it be constitutional? Would it 
be cost-effective? Would it deter others from committing crimes?  
</P>
<P>
 Crime is a problem in California, a deadly serious one. But addressing it 
calls for more than forceful speeches and fist-pounding. We need carefully 
targeted and fiscally responsible laws that are less likely to run afoul of 
that infamous Unintended-Consequences Law.

REVITALIZING VERMONT

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was appalled when I read "Tug of War Over Revitalizing Vermont" (Feb. 28). 
I live on the east side of Vermont and I resent the suggestion that somehow we, 
and those who live north and south of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), 
deserve less than those who live on the west side of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there "a battle royal between two of the city's top African American 
political heavyweights?" The former Pepperdine building and lot have been in 
the same condition for years. Why can't some of the $3 million Waters helped 
win after the 1992 riots be used for other projects along the Vermont corridor? 
There are many vacant lots on Vermont from 83rd Street south, past Manchester, 
left after the riot, that were for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 If these two political leaders in South-Central would work together this could 
be a model community. Whether they work together or not, let them both remember 
that voters live to the east, to the west and to the south of Maxine Waters' 
residence on the west side of Vermont. We have lived in our home for 21 years. 
I love this area, but it needs all the help it can get.

unionism (Opinion, March 6) he hides behind a grievous offense: irresponsible 
journalism. Where was his moral outrage when year after year, budget after 
budget, libraries' services were savaged, spreading staff people impossibly 
thin, reducing hours and often leaving the public literally locked out? 
</P>
<P>
 Now it seems our librarians have the audacity to ask the city to honor its 
contract and pay them a premium for working Sundays, a day our society 
traditionally reserves for workers to be with their families. Irresponsible 
unionism? Not hardly. Basic unionism: protecting working people against the 
insensitive whims of the powers that be. 
</P>
<P>
 No question about it, the library should be open on the weekends, but don't 
blame staffers for city neglect in finding the resources. Starr should point 
the finger closer to home. The Times -- after years of just barely reporting 
the steady mutilation of library services -- deserves much of the blame.

 * For those with an interest in Los Angeles' architectural heritage it was 
good news to learn of the reopening of the Olympic Auditorium (March 4), and 
The Times is to be commended for providing its readers with a summary of the 
building's history. No mention was made, however, of its architect, Gilbert 
Stanley Underwood, who was commissioned to design the Olympic shortly after 
graduating from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood went on to make many contributions to the city as the designer of 
the original Garden of Allah hotel on Sunset, our federal courthouse and post 
office annex nearby, and he was also the architect for many of the National 
Park hotels, such as the Ahwahnee in Yosemite.

PERSPECTIVE ON SEXISM; WHITEWATER ISN'T A MATTER OF GENDER; HILLARY CLINTON'S 
BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE IS WARRANTED. BUT THE SCORN BEING HEAPED ON HER AS A 
WOMAN IS SOMETHING ELSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRIETT WOODS, Harriett Woods is president of the National Women's 
Political Caucus. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since Adam and Eve, whenever a couple is in a garden and there's trouble, 
a finger of suspicion points toward the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently that applies to First Couples as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be clear. Whitewater itself is not about gender. There are allegations 
of possible wrongdoing in Arkansas that should be investigated objectively and 
resolved once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 But a sly anti-feminism has crept into the attacks on the White House that 
should trouble women all over this country. For example, under the headline "Is 
She a Liability?" one commentator cited the First Lady's "insistence on gender 
and race quotas in presidential appointments." 
</P>
<P>
 This reveals a continuing resentment of Mrs. Clinton's powerful presence and 
the priority that she and many others place on diversity in government, 
particularly on bringing in people outside the personal circles of long-time 
Washington pundits and power-brokers. It is telling that the criticism of 
female and minority appointments was followed by this sentence: "Any Washington 
insider can list a half-dozen top-notch white males who failed to get jobs in 
which they could have done fine work for the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the idea that there are quotas is nonsense. As chair of the 
Coalition for Women's Appointments, I know better than most the constant 
pressure and diligent searches for qualified candidates that went into 
achieving increases for women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 To repeat the obvious: Hillary Clinton should be accountable for her actions 
as an attorney and as decision-maker on financial and legal matters. She should 
be responsible, and responsive, about any policy-making, such as her assignment 
on health policy. In other words, if you take bows before a joint session of 
Congress, then be prepared for a few blows when things aren't going so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Women don't want or need a double standard. There has been too much gender 
condescension already. Remember the congressmen who seemed astonished that Mrs. 
Clinton could testify knowledgeably without using notes? 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton isn't the first modern First Lady to serve as a political 
lightning rod. Those opposed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt wore buttons 
that said: "We Don't Want Eleanor, Either." Rosalynn Carter was snidely 
referred to as the Iron Magnolia; Nancy Reagan was accused of manipulating her 
husband with astrology. But the current attacks on Mrs. Clinton are more 
troubling because they are aimed at the economic and social advances for women 
that she has come to symbolize. They reveal a continuing unease with powerful 
women. This bubbled up during the campaign in complaints that she was "too 
pushy" and, after the inauguration, "too powerful." Compared to what 
expectations? 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton is the admired heroine of many women who are balancing the 
responsibilities of breadwinner, home manager and caretaker, often under great 
stress. They are proud to see a woman who respects herself enough to use her 
training to make a substantial contribution to public service. But the dangers 
of hero status are clear. Mrs. Clinton is bound to make mistakes, whether in 
style or substance. At a time when some claim to have discovered a political 
snake in the Rose Garden, there are those who want to identify Mrs. Clinton as 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Women need to remember the price they have paid through history for the 
lessons drawn from the biblical story: Women aren't to be trusted; they are 
weak and lack judgment; men must hold authority. 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty for everyone to learn from the handling of Whitewater -- inside 
and outside the White House. Mrs. Clinton's role in that matter, and as a 
leader within the White House, ultimately will be judged by history and the 
American people. That controversy has nothing to do with gender. We must not 
let it be used as an excuse for returning women to a cartoonish role of 
weakness and incompetence.

COLUMN RIGHT / ELTON GALLEGLY: JUST HOW MANY ALIENS ARE HERE ILLEGALLY?; A 
SCHOOL CENSUS IS A SMART PLACE TO START, EVEN WITH NAMES AND ADDRESSES KEPT 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

County.

<P>
 One thing that just about everyone involved in the emotional debate over 
illegal immigration can agree on is that nobody really knows how extensive the 
problem is. The trouble is, too many people don't want to know, as illustrated 
by the fate of an amendment by my colleague, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach), that would have required schools receiving federal funds 
to provide the U.S. Department of Education with enrollment figures for 
students who are here illegally or whose parents are here illegally.  
</P>
<P>
 The amendment, which was soundly rejected March 3 by the House, would not have 
required school districts to provide lists of names and addresses to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. All it would have done was help give 
the American taxpayer a clear accounting of the amount of money our schools 
spend in educating illegal aliens -- costs estimated at $2 billion a year in 
California alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the quality of debate descended to a level of demagoguery 
unusual even by House standards, with many opponents of the amendment viciously 
equating the proposal to the Nazi tactics depicted in "Schindler's List." Even 
more reasonable opponents, who at least pay lip service to the need to do 
something about illegal immigration, argued that we shouldn't ask schools to 
help provide reliable statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Right alongside the Los Angeles Times report on the House debate was a 
slightly more encouraging article, which noted that Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) has asked the General Accounting Office to try to determine the 
costs that illegal immigration imposes on hard-pressed California. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer's motives may be blatantly partisan -- she hopes that the study will 
discredit Gov. Pete Wilson -- and the GAO does have a well-documented history 
of tailoring reports to meet the desires of powerful congressional Democrats, 
but she is absolutely right when she says we need to have the best possible 
estimates.  
</P>
<P>
 But to get the information, government and self-appointed activists on this 
issue are going to have to drop legal and administrative barriers that keep us 
from finding out how many illegal aliens are living in our nation, and how much 
they are costing -- and contributing to -- our economy. It's simply absurd that 
the law would punish a school principal who asks about a parent's residency 
status, while an employer who doesn't ask a new hire the same thing also faces 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason these barriers exist is simple. Advocates of illegal immigrants 
have to be able to say that there aren't so many in the United States, and that 
the ones who are here benefit our economy. Evidence to the contrary would cause 
their arguments to collapse. That is why they fight so fiercely to prevent the 
American people and their leaders from learning the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The media aren't immune from this hemming and hawing over finding out the 
facts, either. The press -- and certainly not just The Times -- tends to 
criticize only those studies that conclude that illegal immigration is a 
serious problem in our nation. Why is it that articles are printed in which 
expert after expert tears apart the work of Donald Huddle of Rice University, 
for example, without similar scrutiny being paid to these critics and their own 
biases? 
</P>
<P>
 During the past several years, I have met with dozens of Border Patrol agents 
and INS officials, and with health-care providers in Southern California and 
local government officials trying desperately to find ways to pay for the 
services the skyrocketing illegal immigration population is demanding. I also 
have met with advocates of illegal immigrants and with Californians from all 
ethnic backgrounds and all walks of life who have felt the impact of illegal 
immigration on their lives. My conclusion is that we do have a major problem, 
and what needs to be done first is simple: Shed as much light as possible on it 
and then take action based on those facts.  
</P>
<P>
 It would be helpful to know whether the illegal-alien population in the United 
States totals 3.5 million, 4.8 million, 6 million or more than 8 million. And 
I'm confident that behind the shrouds of secrecy is conclusive proof that 
illegal aliens do take jobs and are a drain on scarce public services such as 
health care, government assistance and education -- jobs and services that 
American citizens are entitled to. I hope the veil is pulled back soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that those who are hurt the most by illegal immigration are those 
who can least afford to be hurt -- our less-fortunate citizens, many of them 
members of minority groups, who need entry-level jobs and government assistance 
to lift themselves out of poverty. These are the people we cannot forget in the 
debate over numbers and dollars.

COLUMN LEFT / HARRY BERNSTEIN: WORKPLACE TOTALITARIANISM TAKES A HIT; LABOR 
DROPS ITS OPPOSITION TO DEMOCRATIC PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein was for many years The Times' labor writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It will be more difficult to end workplace totalitarianism in America than to 
democratize Iraq with Saddam Hussein in charge, yet there is a sudden growth of 
interest in trying to create industrial democracy in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, this country's union leaders have ended their often heated arguments 
and wisely agreed to call for a radical shift to industrial democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions have always been one major obstacle to forming partnerships between 
labor and management and minimizing if not eliminating their long-standing 
tradition of often harsh, costly adversarial relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The blame for refusing to accept a system that works well in so many other 
countries now lies entirely on corporate leaders who still refuse to share any 
of their extensive powers with workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in labor's attitude was long in coming. Many union leaders feared 
management would use the concept of close labor-management cooperation as yet 
another weapon to destroy their organizations by arguing that unions would no 
longer be needed when workers had a voice in management.  
</P>
<P>
 But as union ranks diminished under the onslaught of anti-labor legislation 
and intensified fights with management, the time had come for change. The 
AFL-CIO executive council unanimously agreed, at a meeting in Bal Harbour, 
Fla., last month, to a revolutionary policy calling for an alteration "in the 
most basic ways the manner in which work is organized, businesses are managed 
and labor and management treat each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of sharing decision-making power between management and workers 
has long been common in all other major industrial powers. Power in those 
countries is rarely shared equally, but workers and their union representatives 
are involved directly in almost every daily decision from the corporate 
boardroom to the office and shop floor. 
</P>
<P>
 With encouragement from the government, some enlightened managers and a few 
unions, the idea of cooperation and workplace democracy began to spread here 
slowly, but has had little impact -- to-day, only about 5% of U.S. corporations 
actually practice democracy on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Donahue, AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer and chair of the AFL-CIO committee 
that now is urgently calling for close labor-management cooperation, denounced 
the idea 15 years ago. He said then, "We do not want to blur in any way the 
distinctions between the respective roles of management and labor." 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined by AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, who concluded in a prologue 
to a book on the subject by myself and Joanne Bernstein: "I believe that most 
American trade unionists who study the matter will remain convinced that the 
potential of our system of arms-length collective bargaining is so far from 
exhaustion as to make a detour into routes carved by other tighter little 
societies an inexpedient diversion." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kirkland did add that "one should keep an open mind."  
</P>
<P>
 Not only has labor changed its collective view, but the Clinton Administration 
is pushing it hard in the federal government and touting it for all. Labor 
Secretary Robert Reich is particularly enthusiastic, and the AFL-CIO wants the 
government to provide the legal framework for labor-management partnership 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Such partnerships must be among equals, however, and therefore workers need a 
union to give them some equality with management. The alternative is a sham 
industrial-democracy system created to avoid unions and easily eliminated by an 
order from management. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with labor and Clinton Administration support, though, industrial 
democracy isn't going far unless management accepts the idea of cooperation 
with workers and their unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the most virulent opposition to the idea comes from corporate 
executives who would have to share their often profitable powers with workers 
and from mid-level managers who stand to lose the ego-satisfying control they 
now have over underlings. But as world economic competition continues to 
increase, workplace totalitarianism will surely prove to be not just ruthless 
but as inefficient as political totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 Management must wake up to the fact that true labor-management cooperation is 
far better for companies and workers than the customary fights they've had 
under the old-fashioned system of strictly adversarial collective bargaining.

THEATER; A GANG OF HIS OWN; WHILE THE MOVIE STUDIOS STAY ON THE SIDELINES, TIM 
ROBBINS AND OTHER STAR PATRONS PUT THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR HEARTS ARE -- IN LOS 
ANGELES THEATER. THE ACTORS' GANG PROVES WHAT THEY CAN DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, Barbara Isenberg is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tim Robbins started out in street theater, the actor recalls, he was 
competing for attention with noisy trucks, mothers hollering out of windows at 
their children and neighborhood drunks who would wander onstage and sing along. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Today Robbins is one of the hottest film actors around, given his highly 
visible portrayal of the sleek studio executive in Robert Altman's "The 
Player." But neither that nor the making of his own film "Bob Roberts" has 
distracted him from a substantial commitment to non-traditional theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Should all go according to plan, the Actors' Gang, the theater company Robbins 
and friends founded at UCLA in 1981, will open a new home on Saturday. On Santa 
Monica Boulevard, on the eastern end of Hollywood's "Theatre Row," the Gang's 
renovated warehouse space will offer up "The Oresteia." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oresteia" is an ambitious undertaking, an evening that sweeps in 24 
actors, three of the city's top stage directors and three commissioned plays 
based on the tragedies of Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles. "I like the idea 
it's the first performance in the space," Robbins says, "and we go back to the 
roots of theater." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not Greek tragedy the way the Greeks wrote it, however. "Orestes," one 
of the three plays, is set in what its director, David Schweizer, describes as 
a "wacko medical environment." Doctors wrestle on the ground and nurses sing 
choruses of "Close to You" as Helen of Troy discusses the exfoliation of her 
skin and Electra gets astrological advice by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins and the Actors' Gang are not interested in staged sitcoms and frothy 
musicals. In 1992, Robbins wrote and directed "Mayhem: The Invasion," a radio 
drama reinterpreting Christopher Columbus' role in history, and earlier Actors' 
Gang plays took on the U.S. bombing of Libya and evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing glamorous here. The theater may be newly renovated, but it's a big 
barn of a space in a pretty run-down neighborhood. Gang members work for almost 
no money playing to audiences of fewer than 100 people, and plenty of those 
people stretch to afford the $15 ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
 Says director Brian Kulick, who is coordinating "The Oresteia": "This is not 
the kind of work that agents or casting directors come to and say, 'This person 
would be perfect on "Wings." ' No one there is under the delusion that some 
casting director will discover him. They're there because they're hungry for 
something with some meat to it, for material that scares them and means 
something to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Harnessing that passion is Robbins, Actors' Gang's artistic director. And what 
Robbins' long-term commitment to the Gang illustrates best is the significance 
of the Hollywood patron to local theater. From the now-defunct Los Angeles 
Theatre Center to the flourishing Mark Taper Forum, it is usually the 
individual film star, producer or studio executive -- and not his employer -- 
who supports local theater. 
</P>
<P>
 For years now, theater professionals here have complained that the industry 
ignores their economic plight, failing to support what many consider research 
and development on local stages. Movie studios and production companies, they 
say, have scooped up the town's writing, acting and other talent without 
suitably rewarding the region's theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Broadway, where studios have often been major investors, Los Angeles 
theater is rarely the recipient of institutional largess. Columbia Pictures may 
have backed Lisa-Maria Radano's play "Brooklyn Laundry" back in 1991, but even 
Columbia Vice Chairman Sid Ganis readily concedes it was the exception rather 
than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 More customary here is the lone giver, the star, playwright or producer who 
deeply believes in a given play -- or in its potential to attract agents, 
casting directors or potential employers. Robbins, who doesn't even live here 
anymore, takes that one step further, financing and overseeing not one or two 
plays but 13 years' worth of ensemble theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The high profile of Robbins, currently starring in the Coen brothers' film 
"The Hudsucker Proxy," also draws attention to the many other film and TV 
people with ties to the city's theaters. Producer Joseph Stern has long 
subsidized plays at his Matrix Theatre by working in film and TV, while TV star 
Marla Gibbs recently announced a season of plays at her Vision Theatre in 
Leimert Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Altman, Annette Bening and Robin Williams are on the Actors' Gang 
board, and Ed Harris, Amy Madigan and Holly Hunter are on the board of 
Hollywood's Met Theatre. One-third of the Center Theatre Group's 36 board 
members are producers, studio executives and such. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest is individually oriented instead of corporately oriented," says 
actress Hunter, currently a co-producer of Raymond Barry's play "Mother'Son" at 
the Met. "It would be a lovely thing if there were some sort of subsidizing of 
local theater through the movie industry. But that only happens on a personal 
level rather than as an across-the-board industry philosophy of how studios 
contribute to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Larry Gelbart, the film, TV and theater writer who took the industry to 
task in "City of Angels": "Hollywood helps Los Angeles theater by giving Tim 
Robbins wonderful salaries for him to put into theater," Gelbart says. "I think 
it's very healthy for the theater when someone like him stays committed and 
takes those risks, artistic and financial. It's wonderful bait -- let's see if 
anyone bites." 
</P>
<P>
 Theater people in Los Angeles are not exactly fishing in a well-stocked 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here it is in their own back yard," says Matrix producer Stern. "But there is 
no sense of any continuity or relationship between theater at large and film 
and TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran local producer Susan Dietz says she tried unsuccessfully to get studio 
support at each theater she ran, and she is hardly alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime LATC board member Frank Pierson, a writer and director, estimates 
that he spent three or four weeks a year attending meetings with key studio 
executives and their grants people, making pitches and writing letters, with 
little luck. "Some were not interested at all," he recalls. "Some were 
committed elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Hollywood has long put investment dollars into Broadway. Paramount and 
Warner Bros. have had theatrical divisions over the years, and Columbia and 
others have backed individual Broadway shows. Disney not only will open a 
Broadway version of "Beauty and the Beast" next month but also recently bought 
its own Broadway house. 
</P>
<P>
 David Geffen has invested in several New York shows, although none that 
originated here, and movie producer Scott Rudin last year aligned himself with 
New York's Jujamcyn Theaters chain. Then, last fall, Steven Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment announced a sizable development project with New York's 
Playwrights Horizons, the nonprofit, Off Broadway house that produced Alfred 
Uhry's play "Driving Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spielberg gave $100,000 to the Los Angeles Theatre Center at one 
point, this time around his donation seems less charitable than practical: 
Amblin will fund, reportedly for $100,000 a year, the commissioning of 10 
mutually agreed-upon plays during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully from that process, some movies will come," says Deborah Newmyer, 
Amblin's senior vice president of development. "But we don't have automatic 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Why wasn't it done here? "Credit Don Scardino," Newmyer says of Playwrights' 
artistic director. "He approached Steven directly, after Steven had seen one of 
his plays, and made it very easy and appealing for Steven to be part of 
Playwrights. Playwrights also has a long history of talented writers who have 
been able to make the transition to screenwriting, such as Wendy Wasserstein, 
Alfred Uhry and Christopher Durang." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of writer roster is unlikely at local theaters. Aside from the 
Taper, Los Angeles is primarily a city with big theaters for traveling shows 
and small spaces that rarely have longstanding management or companies. 
Institutional, Off Broadway-style, nonprofit houses like Playwrights Horizons 
simply haven't flourished here. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes it that much more difficult to ask studios for money. And, 
say film and theater people alike, studios are corporations that often have 
other charitable or business priorities as well as high job turnover in key 
decision-making posts. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions, of course, such as Columbia's backing of Radano's 
"Brooklyn Laundry" for a limited four-week run in 1991. James Brooks directed 
Glenn Close, Laura Dern and Woody Harrelson at the Coronet Theatre, and if the 
creative team had been able to work out some problems in the second act, says 
film producer Polly Platt, the play's co-producer, "I might have been driven to 
do it as a film. But it was truly not what we had in mind. We did it because 
both Jim and I always loved theater." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Holly Hunter. The much-honored actress co-produced (and starred in) 
friend Beth Henley's play "Control Freaks" at the 99-seat Met here last year, 
she said at the time, because "there was no other way it was going to be done." 
She is now co-producing Barry's play there because "I have been riveted by this 
particular performer and writer for years; I want Ray to have a home." 
</P>

 MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman was the first Center Theatre Group president back 
in the '60s, and Mark Taper Forum Artistic Director Gordon Davidson says he has 
long courted film people. That courtship formalized, he says, when CTG in 1991 
established its 50-member Entertainment Council, a group whose mission includes 
supporting the Taper's new-play development programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Entertainment Council's charge," says Columbia's Ganis, also a CTG 
board member, "to make sure this community, which runs around hyperventilating 
all day long about its own art forms, remembers that theater is a feeder to 
those art forms." 
</P>
<P>
 LATC founder Bill Bushnell, now living on a sailboat in the Virgin Islands, 
has a suggestion: "If the studio heads and production company heads really 
could see past next week and really cared about their art form, they'd set up a 
fund for Los Angeles nonprofit theaters. It would be a tax write-off for them 
and get everyone off their backs. One executive and a secretary could 
administer it." 
</P>
<P>
 But until they do, philanthropists like Robbins seem the most likely film 
industry patrons of local theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins spent several summers hanging out with the Theatre for the New City in 
New York before heading to UCLA to study theater. At UCLA, he assembled a group 
of actors for a production of French surrealist Alfred Jarry's "Ubu, the King." 
After graduating, Robbins recast and restaged it for the Pilot Theatre here, 
where it ran for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the oldest Actors' Gang fan," says director Kulick, who was also at UCLA 
in the early '80s. "I saw their first production of 'Ubu.' I thought it was 
amazing, and to this day I think it is one of the best things I've seen. It is 
rare for someone of that age to have a vision of what kind of theater he wanted 
to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins' vision? "We were going to do theater that was more energetic, more 
socially responsive, more geared toward athleticism than the theater we'd been 
surrounded by," he said by phone from his New York office. "A lot of our energy 
and tack came from the music we were listening to at the time -- the Clash, the 
Sex Pistols. We wanted to bring onto the stage some of the anarchy and energy 
we saw in those clubs, listening to this music." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival and Georges Bigot, an actor with 
France's highly regarded Le Theatre du Soleil who stayed on in Los Angeles to 
lead an extensive workshop. Robbins and two associates came away, he says, with 
"a form and a structure to our energy and commitment -- we developed a style 
that was unique to our own sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Actors' Gang grew from its original 12, picking up members with each play. 
The group did one show a year, sometimes two, generally to favorable reviews 
and good houses. And it received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle's 
Margaret Harford Award in 1989 for continuing contributions to Los Angeles' 
smaller-theater arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the sort of risk-taking, original, often political work the Actors' Gang 
delivers is not mainstream theater fare. Many theater and film people queried 
for this article praised Robbins and his support while indicating little 
familiarity with what exactly he and the Gang are doing.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the shows always successful. The Gang's 1989 foray to New York's 
Public Theatre was considered "amateurish" by then-New York Times drama critic 
Frank Rich, for instance. Rich ended his devastating review by referring to 
"Carnage, a Comedy," a play by Robbins and Adam Simon, as a "preening exercise 
in show-biz self-indulgence." 
</P>
<P>
 Shows like "Carnage" are developed in ensemble workshops that reflect the 
Gang's commedia dell'arte roots. First at a downtown loft space called "the 
actory," now in a storefront near its new space, the group gathers again and 
again to talk out stories and ideas, then put on costumes and makeup to create 
characters and plots, often to improvised rhythmic music. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who has been living in New York since 1987, stays hooked into the 
process. Besides making a video appearance as Apollo in "Orestes," the actor 
huddled with directors Kulick, Schweizer and Oskar Eustis and took notes during 
last weekend's run-throughs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not unusual, Gang members say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were on the phone several nights in a row, going through every scene of my 
play last fall," Gang actor and writer Brian Brophy says of his "Smoke From an 
Orangutan." "He gave me really specific notes, and to me that's the real 
essence of Tim. He could have just walked away, but he really kept his 
commitment to us and to continuing our work." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins figures he currently contributes three dollars for each dollar raised 
by the Gang but says the ratio used to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just throw the money up for a production," he says. "Because it was 
on a smaller scale, it was more of a nuisance than help to go about the 
fund-raising process." 
</P>
<P>
 That is no longer the case, given the cost of renovation and mounting plays in 
this new, bigger space. So far, the renovation alone has cost about $200,000, 
not counting sound system, lights or production costs. Robbins figures it will 
cost another $5,000 to $15,000 to mount "The Oresteia," plus running costs. 
</P>
<P>
 (Robbins has put in hundreds of thousands of his own dollars but declines to 
be more specific: "My grandfather said, 'If you're going to give money, part of 
the spirit of generosity is to never mention the amount.' ") 
</P>
<P>
 When he first started out, he says, he'd work half the year on various film 
and television jobs, then put his earnings into theater. "It made my agent 
crazy because any momentum I was developing would have been stopped," he says. 
"Now it's a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins directed a Gang production of "The Good Woman of Setzuan" in 1990, and 
he's usually involved in choosing material and directors. He also works with 
the directors on casting and design concepts by phone, he says, and pops into 
town for rehearsals whenever he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often when a young actor takes off in the very glamorous world of film and 
television, he bids a fond, regretful farewell to his theater activities, and 
it seems to me Tim never has," says Susan Loewenberg, producing director of 
L.A. Theatre Works. "It was stunning to me when 'The Player' was coming out, 
and Tim was arguably one of the two or three hottest actors in the country, and 
he was committed to me to do a radio play about Columbus. Despite the enormous 
swirl of publicity and personal appearances, he went ahead with it. He wrote 
it, directed it and starred in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins is in town, making a fast trip here to host an Actors' Gang benefit, 
watch a run-through of "The Oresteia" and check progress on readying the new 
space. It is two weeks until opening night, and the place is a mess -- lumber 
stacked everywhere, men drilling by the front door, sparks flying from welders 
up on the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's on schedule," Robbins says, stepping over cables and lumber, 
"but it will be right down to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, he and his colleagues have waited a long time for this. After 
years of randomly scheduled productions in theaters all over town, the Gang 
finally experimented in 1992 with a season of plays at the Second Stage theater 
in Hollywood. When that went well, Robbins says, they were encouraged to seek a 
permanent space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taper provided interim rehearsal space, helped with commissioning expenses 
for "The Oresteia" and donated props and costumes. But like so many other Los 
Angeles theater companies, the Actors' Gang is very dependent on the kindness 
of strangers. One neighbor saw the troupe moving into the space and recycled 
his washer-dryer as a donation. 
</P>
<P>
 The space is very large, spanning 7,500 square feet, and offering high, 
16-foot ceilings and flexible seating for up to 99 people. The Gang has a 
renewable lease that could extend for 12 years, says Managing Director Mark 
Seldis, at which time the group could talk about possibly buying it. And, he 
says, adjacent property could possibly also be acquired to add playing space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best theater has elements of the epic, the religious event, stories of 
kings and queens and machinations of power," Robbins says. "The stage can be an 
arena, a ritualistic place. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've also been bored to tears at theater, and those moments are just as 
inspiring as seeing good theater because that's everything we want to smash 
with Actors' Gang -- that complacent, self-serving, masturbatory theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Lee Arenberg, who co-founded the Gang at UCLA, says Robbins helped find 
him an agent, and several other Gang members also work in film as well as 
theater. While most of the company's actors do work the usual day jobs of 
waiters, teachers, writers and office workers, Seldis estimates that 12 to 20 
of the Gang's 45 actors actually make a living in film, TV or commercials.  
</P>
<P>
 Gang alumni have also started their own companies. John Cusack, Steve Pink and 
others launched Chicago's New Crime Productions in 1988. "We talked about how 
great it would be to start a company that had the kind of energy and spirit 
that was brought to Tim and that Tim brought to us," says Pink, co-artistic 
director of New Crime. "It's what happens when a theatrical style is handed 
from group to group. It gets transformed." 
</P>
<P>
 That transformation also includes film. Cusack, Pink and others have set up 
New Crime Productions, the Chicago theater's film arm, on the Paramount lot. 
Gang members, meanwhile, work out of Robbins' Havoc Inc. film offices as well 
as Gang offices, moving back and forth between both mediums; designer Richard 
Hoover and producer Seldis even appeared in Robbins' "Bob Roberts." 
</P>
<P>
 Next for the Gang is a reprise of Tracy Young's "Hysteria," a feminist musical 
that juxtaposes women of 19th-Century England and 20th-Century Woodland Hills, 
and "Mein Kampf," which Seldis describes as "a twisted fictional account of 
Hitler's early days." Other coming productions include Brophy's "Smoke From an 
Orangutan," a play about the death penalty, Shakespeare's "Titus Andronicus," 
plus a late-night show about wrestling, a musical about drugs and a comedy set 
in an insane asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Box-office receipts from these and other shows will help pay expenses but will 
certainly not cover them all. A benefit screening of "The Hudsucker Proxy" last 
weekend raised $18,825 toward renovation costs, and Gang members expect to do 
more fund-raising in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to take some of Tim's connections and organize them," designer Hoover 
says. "Each step you make, you need a bigger budget, and Tim Robbins can't in 
the long run be the only patron of the Actors' Gang."

JAZZ; STILL FRESH; AT 67, BARITONE SAX GIANT GERRY MULLIGAN IS AS RECEPTIVE TO 
INNOVATIVE IDEAS AS HE WAS DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY DECADES OF THE '40S AND 
'50S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, Don Heckman is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He still has the classic jazz image: tall, reed-thin and bearded, bending 
slightly at the waist as he stands, arms reaching out to embrace the complex 
tubes and keys of an unwieldy baritone saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
 Then come the sounds, the stream of notes that pour forth from the 
instrument's large, brassy bell -- equally classic and instantly recognizable. 
The vibrantly muscular tone, the buoyant melodies, seductive harmonies and 
irrepressibly rhythmic music of Gerry Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
 A true man for all jazz seasons. One of the surviving masters of the 
revolutionary be-bop music of the '40s and '50s. The premiere baritone 
saxophonist of the last four decades. The winner of an incredible 29 
consecutive Down Beat magazine Readers Poll Awards, with enough other honors to 
fill a closet. 
</P>
<P>
 And a big fan of Kenny G. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me," you might say, "Did I miss something? Gerry Mulligan is a fan of 
Kenny G ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely. Or, as he put it, in his own words, "Kenny G has a beautiful sound 
on soprano." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Prince of the Dark-Toned Baritone finds something to like in the merry 
music of the Pied Piper of Pop? Why not? Baryshnikov likes tap dancing, 
Bernstein was a fan of the Beatles, and the French love Jerry Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 But it shouldn't be all that surprising. At 67, Mulligan, who appears Saturday 
night with his quartet at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena, has never been one 
to close his mind to new musical trends. The fiery red hair of his youth may 
have matured to a magisterial, snowy white, but Mulligan continues to be as 
alert and receptive to fresh ideas as he was during the revolutionary jazz 
decades of the '40s and '50s. Although the jazz of the '90s doesn't strike him 
as comparable, either in substance or intent, he obviously has listened to it 
selectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny seems to do things that are more like a kind of floating rhythm," 
Mulligan explained. "And that's part of the charm, I guess, because it's based 
on the current pop rhythm section sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing, of course, is that the saxophone seems to be the 'in' 
instrument for the record industry these days. Altos and sopranos have finally 
been discovered -- maybe because their sounds are easier to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan's comment was tinged with a touch of irony. He has spent the last 
four decades almost single-handedly bringing the cumbersome baritone saxophone, 
with its bold, resonant sound, to the attention of the listening audience. 
Arguably, he has been the dominant performer on the instrument in all of jazz 
history. It has to be perplexing for him to watch the long parade of successful 
pop/jazz soprano, alto and tenor saxophonists such as Kenny G, David Sanborn, 
Tom Scott, Kirk Whalum and Grover Washington Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does he feel about the fact that the soprano, alto and tenor saxophones 
have become the "in" instruments, while the baritone continues to be a kind of 
oversized black sheep? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he says softly, in a kind of reluctant concession, "the higher-voiced 
saxophones do make nice-sounding records." 
</P>
<P>
 The shifting boundaries between pop, jazz and other musical forms that have 
brought new prominence to the saxophone family are not exactly surprising to 
Mulligan. After all, he's seen it before. His own first jobs as a musician were 
with big bands in the '40s, at a time when pop and jazz music were freely 
intermingled, and many listeners felt that Jimmy Dorsey and Tex Beneke -- not 
Charlie Parker and Lester Young -- were the greatest saxophonists in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the idea of fusing pop and jazz elements in Kenny G's music is 
concerned," said Mulligan, "it's kind of inevitable. Musicians are always 
trying to relate the various styles that are around in their own time and 
trying to make music out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also stresses that jazz and pop music -- despite superficial 
similarities -- both in the '40s and the '90s evolved from strikingly different 
points of view. Aware of the currents of jazz drifting through rap, hip-hop and 
other pop music arenas, and the sampling of jazz riffs by groups such as 
Digable Planets, Mulligan keeps creative matters in context. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large," he said, "jazz musicians are very single-minded about staying 
with the music. Pop musicians, on the other hand, seem to be primarily 
concerned with dealing with the business. To them, the audience is just part of 
the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, look at the stage productions some of these bands have," he said. 
"Man, the stage stuff they carry with them -- my God, you can't deviate from 
the light program or the whole thing would go out of whack." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan is also quick to place the productions associated with crossover 
performers such as Kenny G in perspective. He relates their kaleidoscopic 
lighting, big-screen projections and performer strolls around the arenas to 
their logical predecessors -- nightclub shows, theatrical musicals and Las 
Vegas reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are shows that give the illusion of spontaneity, but not the reality," 
he said. "If you go to see them, it's the shows that you're going to see, not 
necessarily the music. To me, it's the new circus." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not precisely the kind of environment Mulligan has in mind for his 
own music. Given his choice, he would prefer to explore a far-reaching range of 
musical interests -- without the light shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to do more recording with ensembles of various kinds, and different 
projects that are aside from the things I do in concert," Mulligan said. "But 
it's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mulligan has remained quite active in the recording studios, his 
recent work -- like that of many jazz artists of his generation -- appears to 
have been bypassed by major labels in favor of younger mainstream musicians. In 
1993, he released his first Brazilian-oriented collection, an album called 
"Paraiso" on Telarc. However, before 1992's "Rebirth of the Cool" album for GRP 
Records, his most recent jazz release on a major label was "Lonesome Boulevard" 
in 1990 for A & M. It's difficult to understand why he doesn't have a long-term 
contract with a major label. Both his playing and his composing are as good as 
ever, and the young-blood probing of his youth has been attractively tempered 
by a mature creative overview. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan has an answer: "Back in the '40s," he said, "popularity was geared on 
sales levels of hundreds of thousands. Today, it's based on a scale of tens of 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you deal with a company that is focused on the pop scene, things can get 
very hard. I've done albums for companies like that, and the result is that my 
records get dropped from the catalogue after a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a common complaint from veteran jazz musicians, but one which doesn't 
preoccupy Mulligan, who persists in sustaining an upbeat attitude. Asked if he 
feels any resentment toward the young, contemporary players who are selling 
their fusion mixtures of lightweight jazz and pop in the millions of copies, he 
was characteristically nonplussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of those questions about artistic integrity which don't really 
concern me," he said. "Because I can only do what I can do. Sure, I wouldn't 
mind having the opportunity to make albums that would reach a broader public. I 
like to write tunes in the good old American song form. . . . What I'm not so 
interested in doing is adapting what I do to the momentary styles." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, unpredictable as ever, Mulligan shifts gears and, almost whimsically, 
adds that the possibility of playing with a pop group might be pretty 
intriguing to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people want to use me on their albums for some kind of contemporary pop 
sort of thing, I'm always willing to try," he said. "Because I figure with any 
opportunity to play, I can always find something musical to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Something musical" is something Mulligan has been doing with notable success 
from the moment he turned up on the jazz scene in the mid-'40s as a precocious 
teen-ager. Playing tenor saxophone and arranging for local Philadelphia bands, 
he once performed for a special concert at the Academy of Music that featured 
such then-emerging stars as Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan. When 
Mulligan was invited to play at a post-concert jam session, he declined, at 
first, until Parker handed him an instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," recalled Mulligan. "But Charlie was helpful and 
encouraging. It never hurts to have someone like him give you a shove when 
you're young." 
</P>
<P>
 At 19, Mulligan was in New York City, playing and writing for the Gene Krupa 
and Claude Thornhill bands, studying with Gil Evans and hanging out with an 
innovative group of young Turks that included John Lewis, Miles Davis, Lee 
Konitz, George Russell and John Benson Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an important time," he said. "And I think we were aware that it was 
important while it was taking place, which is kind of unusual. But Gil and the 
kind of people he attracted, and the kind of conversations that went on, made 
it a kind of spiritual time for all of us, a real learning process." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the principal results of the get-togethers -- which usually took place 
casually in Evans' room behind a Chinese laundry -- was the influential Miles 
Davis "Birth of the Cool" recordings. Rich with uncommon timbres (the ensemble 
included a tuba and French horn in addition to jazz horns and rhythm section), 
unexpected counterpoint and colorful dissonances, the recordings had a powerful 
impact on jazz composition and arranging for the next 15 to 20 years. In fact, 
it probably would be difficult to find a composer or arranger in today's 
entertainment world who has not been affected on some level by the 
tradition-busting charts written by Mulligan, Evans, Lewis and Johnny Carisi. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Mulligan re-recorded the "Birth of the Cool" pieces with a new 
ensemble in which Wallace Roney replaced Miles Davis, and Phil Woods filled in 
for an unavailable Lee Konitz. Critical responses were mixed. Questioned about 
the differences in sound and style -- about the fact that Konitz, when told of 
Woods' participation, laughed and said, "I think you just invented the 'Birth 
of the Hot' " -- Mulligan shrugged and said, "Don't miss the point here. This 
was intended to be a different band. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole reason for doing it was the curiosity of seeing how the same 
arrangements would sound with a different band and with all the musical changes 
that have taken place over the years since the first recording." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s and '60s, Mulligan continued his efforts to stretch the jazz 
envelope. The piano-less quartet he organized in 1952 with trumpeter Chet Baker 
simultaneously challenged musicians to expand their harmonic ideas while 
setting a tone and manner that became a framework for the emergence of "West 
Coast jazz." And it did so with vibrant, often playful tunes such as Mulligan's 
"Walking Shoes," "Soft Shoes" and "Rocker," which blended the collective 
counterpoint of New Orleans jazz with the articulate lines of be-bop. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in New York in 1960, Mulligan formed his concert jazz band at a time when 
sizable musical aggregations were rapidly disappearing. To many observers, it 
seemed a quixotic act, yet it restated, at precisely the right moment, the 
enduring relevance of large ensembles. And it was a very good band, featuring 
Mulligan and Bob Brookmeyer's solos, and expanding upon the essential elements 
of the piano-less quartet. An "A list" destination for young arrangers, the 
band introduced the work of such important new talents as Gary McFarland -- who 
soon became one of the most successful composer-arrangers of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsequent appearance of dozens of rehearsal groups around the country, 
dedicated to the creative exploration of big-band instrumentation, continued to 
be energized by Mulligan's intermittent return to leading big bands over the 
next few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been fun to have a big band," he said, "even though it's never 
really worked out, if only because it's so expensive. Ultimately, despite the 
musical achievements, I'm not sure that I've ever made my investment back with 
the big band in any kind of noticeable way. I still have to sink a lot of money 
into it every time it goes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the '60s, he has led a variety of different-sized groups, always 
returning, at one time or another, to the big-band format. The common aspect of 
all has been the structure and cohesiveness of the music, even when he is 
working -- as he will be at the Ambassador -- with a traditional piano, bass 
and drums rhythm section.  
</P>
<P>
 His program will be a Mulligan overview, familiar tunes contrasted with new 
material, performed with musicians -- Ted Rosenthal on piano, Dean Johnson on 
bass and Ron Vincent on drums -- who have been long-term regulars with his 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But the siren call of the large ensemble, expenses and all, clearly remains 
for Mulligan. "I'll always think as an arranger," he said. "Each band, large or 
small, represents another writing approach." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, he frequently performed with symphonic ensembles ranging from the 
Los Angeles and Stockholm philharmonics to the Philadelphia Orchestra, the 
National Symphony and Salzburg's Mozarteum Orchestra. Mulligan commissioned 
Harry Freedman's "The Sax Chronicles" in 1984 to showcase the saxophonist's 
melodies in the styles of such composers as Bach, Brahms and Mozart. A 
saxophone concerto, commissioned from composer Frank Proto, was performed with 
the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mulligan is not at his home near Stamford, Conn., much of his time these 
days is spent working in Italy (and living in an apartment in Milan, "just 
around the corner from La Scala"), where he continues to have a major 
following. "I get there as often as I can," he said. "I love to go to the 
rehearsals at La Scala. It's like having a busman's holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, he sees in the European audience a sophistication not 
always present in American listeners, due in part to the wider array of music 
available there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a pleasure in Europe to turn on the radio and not get one single 
thing constantly thrown at you," he said. "Stations play a very wide variety of 
stuff. They'll go from a Beethoven string quartet to Sting to Charlie Parker. 
It's very different from what you hear in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan noted, for example, that free jazz music -- an improvisational 
approach that has passed whatever peak it reached in the United States -- 
continues to draw audiences in Europe. Although the style has never been 
noticeably present in Mulligan's music, he praises its intentions, adding that 
European listeners, because of their eclecticism, are more receptive to free 
jazz's complex sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes it interesting to me, and probably to European audiences, as 
well," he said, "is the fact that free jazz has opened up the possibility for 
every member of a group to be an instant composer. And musicians like that. 
Maybe eventually there will be enough of a sense of group composition to be 
able to control it so it's not always so chaotic. But I think that the desire 
to go in that direction is understandable." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan added that European audiences are equally responsive to the 
resurgence of mainstream jazz, and find no contradiction in hearing and 
appreciating, side by side, the two radically different approaches to jazz 
improvisation. He bemoans the lack of similarly eclectic receptivity in 
American listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much that happens in our culture," he continued, "at least not 
much that's easily available to people, that helps make our audience 
particularly sophisticated in the same way. The television coverage of the 
Olympics was a case in point. It was so shallow. I mean the interviews were 
unbelievably maudlin. How can they do that -- much less how can people sit 
still for it without being sick on the rug?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the audiences are receptive or not, whether he's working in front of 
knowledgeable Europeans or pop-drenched Americans, Mulligan will continue to 
follow his own unique, personal, truth-telling muse wherever it leads him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music's a little unique," he concluded. "The more you know about it, the more 
you can appreciate it. And that's why you really have to give something back to 
music. Because the more you give, the more you get."

ART; THE ART OF THE BODY PART; SCULPTOR KIKI SMITH HAS FOUND SUCCESS IN THE ART 
WORLD WITHOUT REALLY TRYING WITH HER DEFIANTLY FEMINIST BODY POLITICS

 There was much clucking of tongues last fall when the New York Times Magazine 
ran a laudatory profile of New York mega-dealer Arne Glimcher of the 
Pace-Wildenstein Gallery. There was Glimcher on the cover surrounded by his 
stable of talent -- all of them solidly established male artists on the 
downside of 50. Pace, a notorious bastion of male chauvinism, built its 
foundation largely through representing Louise Nevelson during the '70s but 
hadn't taken on a woman artist since Agnes Martin joined the gallery in the 
mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of that, it came as a bit of surprise last month when Glimcher 
decided to throw his weight behind 40-year-old New York sculptor Kiki Smith. 
Not only is she a woman, but she makes intensely emotional, defiantly feminine 
art that's markedly at odds with the generally ultra-cool Pace aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every so often an extraordinary artist happens, and Kiki's one of them," 
Glimcher says of Smith, who since 1990 has shown locally with the Shoshana 
Wayne Gallery. "Her work is resonating very powerfully in the culture right now 
because it's intensely personal. . . . Kiki's work isn't the product of a 
system or school -- it's about her." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is inarguably the toast of the town at the moment, but all it takes is a 
brief conversation with her to deduce that she's singularly lacking in the 
careerist instincts one assumes are mandatory if one wants to play hardball 
with the big boys in the upper echelons of the art world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a hippie, and the work I make is totally sentimental and schlocky," 
Smith cheerfully points out during an interview in the bar of a Santa Monica 
hotel. Smith, the subject of an exhibition at the University Art Museum at UC 
Santa Barbara on view through April 17, scored her first solo show just five 
years ago and seems to regard the fact that she's currently hailed as one of 
the most influential artists of her generation with a mixture of incredulity 
and delight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where my career came from -- it's a miracle," says the artist, 
who reportedly decided to leave her dealer of 10 years, Joe Fawbush, and 
relocate to Pace on the advice of her astrologer. "I don't even know that I 
wanted it -- it just happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's career is indeed happening -- she was lauded as one of the few 
redeeming presences in last year's otherwise much-maligned Whitney Biennial, 
and prices for her major works currently hover around $75,000. The reasons for 
Smith's ascent are easy to trace. For starters, she takes the human body as her 
central theme, and at the moment the body is the subject in art (this could 
have to do with the fact that baby boomers, hard hit by the politics of 
abortion and the AIDS epidemic, are now middle-aged and are looking death in 
the face for the first time). 
</P>
<P>
 Exploring ideas concerning mortality and the body first introduced by Joseph 
Beuys and Bruce Nauman, Smith's work presents the body as a politicized arena 
in which the great battles of culture and humanity are waged. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sculpture, however, differs from most current militant body art by virtue 
of its unabashed lyrical edge; Smith is an unrepentant romantic, and whereas 
her colleagues cultivate a clinical edge in their art, she inflects hers with 
mysticism and the heavy perfume of Surrealism. In a sense, her art can be read 
as a reaction to dominant art-world trends of the '80s, when irony ruled 
supreme, money and power was the name of the game, and art was big, slick and 
often produced assembly-line fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The mark of the artist's hand is front and center in Smith's sculpture, which 
is fashioned out of a diverse range of materials, including exotic papers, 
beads, salt, tin, beeswax, cloth, human hair, glass and bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideologically, Smith's work is painfully human, direct and free of irony. Her 
imagery, focusing on the body's failures and traumas, as opposed to an 
eroticized idealization, has been described as morbid by some who squirm at 
evocations of bodily fluids, fetuses and mammary glands. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the Santa Barbara exhibition, overseen by museum curator Liz 
Brown, is "Train," a 1993 life-size wax figure of a female nude with a spray of 
red beads trailing from her vagina. A few feet away is "Zweite Auswahl (Second 
Choice)," a 1987 work of ceramic and bronze that is essentially a bowl of human 
organs, and "Untitled (Red Man)," from 1991, a life-size human form cast in 
paper; the arms and head have been torn loose and laid in front of the torso, 
which is tacked to the wall like a forlorn, deflated balloon. The room fairly 
pulsates with intimations of mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body has always treated me well -- I've hardly been sick at all -- but 
despite that, I don't have a good relationship with my body," says Smith, a 
tall, exotic woman who tends to dress in black, sports several tattoos and has 
an ethereal air that is at odds with the challenging art she makes. "I wasn't 
raised to have a relationship with my body at all, and maybe it's because I'm 
not very physically conscious that I make the work I do. I think of myself as 
sort of floating and have to make an effort to think about the body because I'm 
not in it enough." 
</P>
<P>
 So precisely what is on her mind as far as thinking about the body these days? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, certain body parts don't hold as much meaning for me -- I never really 
cared much about brains, for instance," she says with a laugh. "There are other 
body parts that seem used up -- hearts, for example; there are zillions of 
images of hearts around -- so that's something I avoid. As to what body parts 
are most compelling to me, that changes all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment I've been thinking a lot about the back of the knee -- it's 
such a sexy spot -- and I've been thinking about parts of the body where 
there's no fat and the skin is very thin. The skin between the upper leg and 
the abdomen, at the back of the knee, and under the arms is very vulnerable and 
thin, and maybe people fly in and out of your body there -- maybe those are 
entry points. These areas of the body remind me of Santos figures popular in 
the Philippines, where the trunk and extremities are carved out of wood and the 
joints are made of cloth." 
</P>
<P>
 Religious art -- particularly the medieval sculpture of southern Germany -- is 
a major influence on Smith, who was born in Nuremberg, Germany, and raised 
Catholic. More significant than Smith's religious training, however, was the 
cultural milieu she grew up in. As the daughter of opera singer Jane Wilson and 
the rigorously pure proto-Minimalist sculptor Tony Smith, she was raised in a 
world where "art was never separated out from life -- it was just part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Smith, an internationally acclaimed sculptor credited with having served 
as a crucial link between '50s Abstract Expressionism and Minimalist art of the 
'60s, was also represented by the Pace Gallery before his death in 1980 -- 
which, coincidentally or not, also happens to be the year when Smith discovered 
the body as the ideal vehicle for the things she wanted to express in her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to my father's death I was having a hard time committing to a career as 
an artist, but that's not because of who he was -- it was because of who I am," 
she points out. "It's true, though, that I felt I shouldn't compete with him 
and that those feelings went away after he died. But I don't see my work as 
diametrically opposed to my father's -- some people say it is -- and I've never 
felt the need to metaphorically 'kill' my father or deny his existence. I love 
my father's work and I learned a lot from him -- the most important thing being 
that art is a practice of necessity. He absolutely had to do his work and it 
always came first in his life, and though I probably didn't like that as a 
child, I'm very sympathetic to it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith grew up in the suburbs of New Jersey, the eldest of three girls. She 
describes her childhood as "not quite normal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised to do nothing," she says, laughing. "I don't know what my 
parents had in mind, but I had no ambition whatsoever. I practically flunked 
out of high school, then enrolled in trade school and studied baking because I 
thought I'd do manual labor the rest of my life. After baking school I went to 
live in San Francisco, but it was too lackadaisical for me -- everybody was 
smoking pot, which I never liked, and being from the East Coast, I wanted to do 
something. Lounging around in nice weather didn't make sense to me, so I left 
after a year." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Smith enrolled at the Hartford Art School in Connecticut, but she 
dropped out after a year and a half. She finally rolled into Manhattan in 1976 
planning to go to art school, but "after I dropped my portfolio off at the 
School of Visual Arts, I never went back to pick it up because I was afraid 
they wouldn't let me in. Then a friend told me, 'You don't have to go to school 
-- you can just be an artist,' and that seemed more appealing than finding out 
whether I'd been accepted at school." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Smith embarked on the perfunctory series of odd jobs -- she was 
employed by a factory where she airbrushed clouds and starbursts onto dresses, 
worked as a bartender, a short-order cook and an electrician -- and hung out on 
the fringes of New York's then-burgeoning punk scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my hair cut off and wore ripped T-shirts," recalls Smith, who plugged 
away at her art when she wasn't at a day job. At the time she was making dolls 
and teapot cozies, life-size canoe sculptures and paintings of guitars. "For a 
year I drew a pack of cigarettes to teach myself perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979 Smith fell in with a group of artists known as Colab (short for 
Collaborative Projects) that includes Robin Winters, Tom Otterness and Jane 
Dickson, and began to make body-related artworks that were included in group 
shows. With the death of her father the following year, the themes of death and 
the body became increasingly prominent in her work, and she embarked on a 
course of research that included three months of emergency medical training in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been making things about the body that were totally subjective, and I 
thought it would be interesting to be in a situation where the agenda with the 
body was different," she says of the experience. "What I discovered was that I 
basically wasn't interested in the physical healing of things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also went to some schools to look at dead bodies, but the more I did that, 
the more it distressed me. At first I was thrilled to get to see what bodies 
really look like, but then I began to be offended by the situation. Seeing 
people chopped up with their brains pulled out -- yes, it's interesting, and 
yes, I've used it in my work, but still . . . we don't really know where 
consciousness resides. What parts could you lose and still think of yourself as 
yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
 With the AIDS epidemic gathering momentum during the '80s, the issue of 
mortality occupied an increasingly important role in art; it became all but 
unavoidable for Smith in 1988 when her younger sister Bebe Smith died of the 
disease. (Smith's other sister, Seton Smith -- Bebe's twin -- is also an artist 
and lives in Paris). 
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS has critically affected my life, and yes, I have done work about it, but 
I don't like to think of my work as being specifically about things," Smith 
says in response to the fact that the critique that has developed around her 
work often pivots on the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on how she sees her work evolving, Smith says her interest in the 
body seems to have shifted "from a fascination with the inside of the body and 
internal processes to the outside of the body." 
</P>
<P>
 "Having people accept my work has been really beneficial, and proved to me 
that a little bit of nurturing goes a long way," she says. "My earlier work was 
much cooler and relied conceptually on language -- I wanted to hide behind the 
idea that the work was about concepts as opposed to being about me. As I gain 
more confidence, I see my work becoming more true to my real nature and growing 
increasingly decorative -- I've always loved decorative things and see my work 
as residing somewhere between decorative art and fine art. 
</P>
<P>
 "As to where it's going next, I don't know if I want to make work about the 
body for the rest of my life -- an artist's work is always changing, and I 
don't have any control over the way it changes. My work has always been 
super-autobiographical, and it's always the result of me trying to figure out 
some question that's prominent in my mind -- I don't expect that to change. In 
fact, some pieces are so personal that it's hard for me to put them out into 
the world. I'm a fairly secretive person in my intimate relationships with 
people, and the essential challenge of my work is that it forces me to expose 
myself. One of the things I keep learning from art is that it's OK to put 
yourself out there and trust life." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the six new works included in the show at Santa Barbara (the bulk of the 
exhibition is drawn from California collections) is "Untitled (Roses)," a 
life-size cast-aluminum figure of a woman with a thicket of roses blooming from 
her spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm terrified to show this work -- it's a highly sentimental piece about 
self-appreciation," Smith says, "and it has to do with my belief that when a 
person is in love with you, they give you space to bloom in. I wanted to make 
something overtly romantic, but because of the roses this piece feels really 
vulnerable. For the last few years I've wanted to use flowers in my work, but 
artists tend to be punished for using flowers, probably because they've come to 
be associated with women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much deeply internalized hatred for women and for anything 
associated with the feminine in this society -- it's like this endless onion 
and you can just keep peeling back the layers of hatred. I'm often amazed that 
when I really examine something dismissed as unimportant to us as a culture, it 
turns out to be somehow associated with women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women's bodies have always been given an eroticized depiction in art," she 
adds, elaborating further on her interpretation of the female form, "but I 
don't present it that way, because unfortunately, that's not as big a part of 
my life as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this mythical history of legions of women who lounge around naked, 
and I wish I could do more of that," she says with a laugh, "but I have to go 
feed the cat or do some work. So my work presents what I guess you could call a 
more realistic depiction of women's bodies in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems like a worthwhile thing to do too, because it seems to me that 
ideally, the way art should function in society is it should make more space 
for people's lives."

FILM COMMENTARY; THEY NEVER COME IN FROM THE COLD; JOEL AND ETHAN COEN'S MOVIES 
MAY BE ONE OF A KIND, BUT IS IT A KIND YOU CAN WARM UP TO? AFTER THE 
INCREASINGLY CHILLY 'MILLER'S CROSSING,' 'BARTON FINK' AND 'THE HUDSUCKER 
PROXY,' THE ANSWER IS NO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend of mine once described the films of Joel and Ethan Coen as the movie 
equivalent of eye-catching curios you stare at in an antique shop without ever 
wanting them in your home, and I know what he means. 
</P>
<P>
 Their latest film, "The Hudsucker Proxy," set in 1958 but often deliberately 
evoking the '30s, is a $40-million curio. As gewgaws go, it's monumental, a 
ship-in-a-bottle in full launch. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the detailing in their films, starting with their first, the 
low-budget, whacked-out Texas Gothic "Blood Simple" (1984), was always 
scrupulously applied. It's just that now there's more applique to play with. 
</P>
<P>
 Through five films, which also include "Raising Arizona" (1987), "Miller's 
Crossing" (1990) and "Barton Fink" (1991), the Coens have managed to make films 
that don't look like anybody else's, even though they draw unapologetically on 
other movies. (Several of their movies, like "Barton Fink" and "Hudsucker 
Proxy," revolve around the ambiguities of authorship.) The paradox of the 
Coens' films is that they seem both one-of-a-kind and derivative, personal and 
impersonal. They draw on our memories of other movies not in order to evoke the 
same feelings in us but to distance us from those feelings. The Coens -- 
artists as control freaks -- want us to know they're in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Their movies may be one-of-a-kind, but is it a kind you can warm up to? The 
dissociation one feels watching the Coens' films -- particularly the most 
recent three -- comes not so much from the gap between form and content as 
between form and feeling. This gap, like everything else in their films, is 
intentional. The Coens like to send you out of the theater with a postmodernist 
chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the amount of gluey sentimentality in most Hollywood movies, the 
wise-alecky frostiness of the Coens' films is something to be reckoned with. At 
least they don't slobber all over you. Technically the films are ambitious, so 
chockablock with references to old movies and myth that they ought to come with 
illuminated skeleton keys so audiences can follow along in the dark. But 
emotionally the films don't aim high. Often what you're left with, as in "Blood 
Simple" or "Barton Fink," is a parched giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 From the very start, with "Blood Simple," it was the "knowingness" of the 
Coens that endeared them to critics and movie producers. "Blood Simple" was a 
gory pulp melodrama with corpses buried alive and a heroine in peril in the 
final reel. But it was also a kind of critique of the form. The fancy camera 
moves, like the celebrated one in which the camera glides along the length of 
the bar and then lifts up over a napping drunk, were a way of placing the 
screen action within a cine aste' s quotation marks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fanciness didn't serve any artistic agenda really; it didn't attempt to 
alter our way of seeing but instead tried to flatter it. (That's why movie-wise 
people loved the film.) When Jean-Luc Godard used movies tricks and quotes in 
his '60s films, he did it to break through to new subject matter, new states of 
political awareness. The Coens simply want us to know they've seen the same 
movies we have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising Arizona," the Coens' next film, was breakneck where "Blood Simple" 
was deliberately laggard. If the dialogue in "Blood Simple" was paced 
Pinter-slow -- for that extra-special mock-ponderous effect -- the banter in 
"Raising Arizona" was positively hopping. The film featured those two 
world-class jaw-boners, Holly Hunter and Nicolas Cage, as a childless couple 
who, in desperation, swipe a quintuplet. Until the film skidded off-road with a 
wart-hog "Road Warrior" fantasia, it was amusingly madcap. (The sight of Cage 
fleeing a convenience store hold-up with a box of Huggies wedged under his 
armpit was a great yuppie era joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sequence like the one where the placid baby quint is left unattended 
in the middle of the highway, or toted along for a bank robbery, the film also 
betrayed the Coens' penchant for giggly heartlessness. They outsmarted 
themselves on this movie. Playing to the audience's movie-inspired 
anticipations as avidly as any action-movie hack, they didn't allow for where 
we might draw the line in our suspension of disbelief. (The film was a modest 
hit anyway, their only one.) 
</P>
<P>
 In "Miller's Crossing," in which Gabriel Byrne played a gangland henchman who 
inexplicably offers himself up as sacrificial avenger out of loyalty to the 
boss who abused him, the Coens chucked their lickety-split cartoonishness and 
instead sunk deeply into the goo of mythic seriousness. It was a gangster art 
piece set in 1929 in an unnamed city -- gangster films, of course, should never 
be set in unnamed cities. Hermetically sealed off from any origins except old 
movies, "Miller's Crossing" was the closest the Coens have come to standard 
sentimentality. Maybe that's why it's so nerveless: They couldn't muster any 
conviction for those old Hollywood crime movie conventions because they live on 
the flip side of those conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Barton Fink," the Coens seemed crouched inside a private vision that 
always threatened but never quite succeeded in going public. (It had some of 
the same humid, congealed tricksterism as the worst of David Lynch.) John 
Turturro's Barton, a Broadway playwright with a proletarian hit on his hands a 
la Clifford Odets, drags his heels to Hollywood to work on a Wallace Beery 
wrestling picture. He checks into a faded dump of a hotel where he befriends a 
burbly tenant who turns out to be a mass murderer, and inexorably unravels. 
Barton is passionate about the life of the mind and ends up toting a severed 
head in a box. (So much for the mind's life.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Coens deliberately made Barton a pointy-headed object of pathos; his 
ravings about creating "a new theater of and about the common man" are made to 
sound sickly and condescending. It's a cruel caricature but the cruelty is 
partly self-inflicted. Barton may represent the Coens' worst image of 
themselves. Opposite him is the studio head who has his own rant: "We need some 
heart in motion pictures." To Barton he wheedles, "Can you make us laugh, can 
you make us cry?" He's the crude Philistine voice of the Coens' harshest 
critics, and we're meant to side with him (sort of). But since his criticisms 
anticipate and preempt our own, the Coens manage to one-up the audience anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coens were onto something bigger and more interesting and self-examining 
in "Barton Fink" than they were able to fully develop. Barton's blather about 
the Common Man turns to ashes before that Man's worst-possible-case embodiment, 
next-door neighbor Madman Mundt -- and Mundt, played with proletarian heft by 
John Goodman, is metaphorically linked to Hitler, who also invoked the masses. 
The one good idea nearly buried beneath the hallucinatory gimcracks of this 
movie is that common-man playwrights like Barton Fink -- like Odets and all the 
rest -- are too touched by innocence and idealism and fellow feeling to 
recognize the true depravity inside the masses. They're sentimentalists 
presiding over their own undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The script for "The Hudsucker Proxy" had been worked on by the Coens, along 
with Sam Raimi, since the "Blood Simple" days. (Movie trivia alert: Cage in 
"Raising Arizona" can be glimpsed for a second wearing a Hudsucker Industries 
work uniform.) It's their most cynical opus yet, and cynicism on this elaborate 
a scale really sours the atmosphere.  
</P>
<P>
 Tim Robbins plays Norville Barnes, a hayseed from Muncie, Ind., working in the 
Gargantuan, nightmarish Manhattan mail room of Hudsucker Industries, when 
suddenly he's installed as the company president. It's a Machiavellian ploy by 
the firm's board to avoid a public takeover by shaking investor confidence and 
allowing them to buy a controlling interest. But Norville, fresh-faced and 
oblivious, stymies the fix by getting the company to market his pet project -- 
which turns out to be the Hula-Hoop. But this is not a success story, exactly: 
It all flashes back from Norville about to jump from the 44th floor of the 
Hudsucker building on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a neo-Capra fairy tale -- the borrowings from "Meet John Doe" in 
particular are legion -- but with Capra's plump populism turned inside out. 
That might not seem like such a bad reversal except that, compared to the 
Coens' empty cackle, Capra's we-the-people balladeering at least had a hearty 
ring. Capra on some level believed in his boosterism.  
</P>
<P>
 The Coens believe only in their own thin cynicism. They condemn Norville as a 
lucky schnook in a schnooky world where you can be No. 1 only by creating 
useless fads for all the other schnooks out there -- for, you know, we the 
people. Norville's comedown (or his comeback, for that matter) has no power or 
despair, because we are never allowed to glimpse any emotional possibilities in 
him. He's a puppet on a string -- a plummeting puppet. And the Coens are 
puppetmasters. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when even the most talented American independent filmmakers, like 
Gus Van Sant and Richard Linklater, are fiddling with anomie, the Coens' 
boisterous blankness can seem almost rousing. But only in a cynic's paradise 
could their designed-to-the-teeth exercises in nattering flapdoodle metaphysics 
satisfy our appetite for high style. Even Terry Gilliam, whose elephantiasis of 
style is even more unfortunate than the Coens', puts real passion into his 
panoramas. The Coens, by comparison, keep a smart, tight cool. They're the 
perfect postmodernists for a race of androids.

 "It's very difficult to explain to people who don't have children," says 
enfant terrible -turned-new father Roman Polanski. "It's like trying to explain 
to a child what it's like to make love. What do you say, it's like ice cream 
but 10 times better?" 
</P>
<P>
 Can this really be Roman the Terrible sounding like any middle-class dad? 
Polanski is one of those icons of pop culture that rattle around in our 
collective consciousness. His personal history reads like one long tabloid 
headline. The Nazi occupation of Poland when he was a child; the murder of his 
wife, Sharon Tate, by the Manson family when she was nine months pregnant; the 
raging libido that led him to flee the United States rather than face 
sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old Los Angeles girl in 1977. He 
acknowledged in his 1984 autobiography that people see him as an "evil, 
profligate dwarf." So when Polanski starts talking about children as the only 
tangible and lasting expression of love between two people, one can hardly 
believe one's ears. After all the Sturm und Drang , Polanski's answer to 
getting older is as tame as what many of his contemporaries in Hollywood have 
devised: raising a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roman always struck me as having a lot more conventional values than was 
generally perceived," suggests longtime pal Jack Nicholson, himself the father 
of two young children. "He's kind of an old-style Continental gentleman. I've 
always been at strong odds with his public image." 
</P>
<P>
 At 60, Polanski may have matured, but he hasn't mellowed. Having settled into 
a kind of domestic contentment with his 28-year-old wife and leading lady, 
Emmanuelle Seigner, and their year-old daughter, Morgane, he says there are now 
more important things in his life than making movies. Part of his 
disillusionment with filmmaking is a reaction to years of disappointment trying 
to find and finance projects from his adopted home of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 At his best with films like "Knife in the Water," "Rosemary's Baby" and 
"Chinatown," Polanski was one of the most gifted filmmakers of his generation. 
The tragedy of his exile is that he has made only four films since leaving the 
United States in 1977. Polanski insists that he gets offers from American 
studios "but it's usually something so debasing that I can't possibly accept 
it. I know there are certain action pictures I could easily give some class but 
very few, and they are usually developed from the start by someone who has more 
access. Kubrick is at the same disadvantage living in England. Look how few 
films he makes." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski's latest film, "Bitter Moon," finally opens in Los Angeles on Friday 
after sitting on the shelf for more than a year waiting for an American 
distributor. "Sometimes I ask myself if it's worth it. One wastes so much time 
to pull all the strings together. I have been weary of it for a long time, but 
now it is past all limits," the director says over oysters one night in a 
favorite hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 For Polanski, "Bitter Moon" is a transitional film about getting older and 
coming to terms with the excesses of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, set on a cruise from Venice to Istanbul, creates a whirlpool of 
twisted love in which one couple (Peter Coyote and Seigner) devours itself 
while drawing a staid English couple (Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott-Thomas) into 
a storm of sex and self-destruction. The film has the physicality of a young 
man's work but also the perspective of someone who has gained something from 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But one can't help wondering if Polanski's personal growth and newfound 
contentment are beneficial to an artist who has fashioned a body of work based 
on the treachery of relationships. For all its sexual intensity, "Bitter Moon" 
comes to some rather traditional conclusions about love and obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 In early drafts of the "Bitter Moon" screenplay, written by Polanski with 
Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn, based on Pascal Bruckner's novel, the action 
was even more explicit. The film has received a mixed reception in Europe, and 
Polanski acknowledges that some people didn't know they were allowed to laugh 
at scenes of domination and degradation. He hopes an American audience will get 
what he calls the black humor of the film better than the French who, he says, 
don't understand irony and satire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing really that controversial, nothing that explicit in this 
film. I don't show frontal nudity; I find it boring. It's just the tone of the 
film that may shock the weak at heart," the director explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Polanski's history, the temptation to draw parallels between his life 
and a tale of predatory sex is irresistible. Unfortunately, he won't have any 
of it. He greets such suggestions with a mixture of impatience, denial and 
clowning. This is clearly an area he does not care to examine, privately or 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the similarities are tantalizing. Friends say that the central 
relationship in "Bitter Moon," with its bickering and power struggle, is, in 
spirit, a mirror of his relationship with Seigner. A longtime associate 
describes the construction of the film as a theater within a theater in which 
Polanski plays out some of the drama of his own life. Whether it is true or 
not, people will see the film as a firsthand report from a battle zone most of 
them have never visited. 
</P>
<P>
 Youthfulness is perhaps Polanski's greatest creation. For years he has 
resisted the impulse to grow up. It is his way of defying the rules. Pinned to 
his green nylon bomber jacket is a likeness of Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's 
apprentice. With its pointy nose, impish grin and diminutive stature, it is a 
figure that bears a striking resemblance to the director. Polanski stands just 
a few inches over five feet. His wild hair and the ring in his left ear give 
him a boy's appearance to go with his young man's body. His films have 
consistently reflected Polish street punk attitude and the charged sexuality of 
a hormone-crazed kid. Even more startling is how his face can transform in an 
instant to show his years, a walking Dorian Gray. It's as if he carries both 
men within him and by sheer will keeps his older self bottled. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child fleeing the Nazis after his parents had been taken to Auschwitz, 
Polanski hid out with Polish pig farmers in the countryside, pretending he was 
not Jewish. German soldiers fired at him for sport. Perhaps Polanski had seen 
enough for a lifetime and somewhere deep inside decided to stop growing 
emotionally simply as a way to survive -- to become invulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 In a piece about Polanski written more than 20 years ago, his friend Kenneth 
Tynan related a story that even then demonstrated Polanski's refusal to believe 
that one day his physical powers would erode. A man in his mid-40s whom 
Polanski knew was experiencing migraines. Polanski was impatient, as he often 
is with things that don't obey his idea of how they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's wrong with you, you used to be such a healthy bugger? Is it male 
menopause?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose so." 
</P>
<P>
 "Will that happen to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Up your arse," Polanski replied. "It's all psychological."  
</P>
<P>
 When Polanski is reminded of the story, he proudly proclaims, "Well, it hasn't 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Humor is Polanski's other great defense. He delights in telling bad jokes and 
pulling pranks. With his buddy Nicholson he orchestrated a grand practical joke 
on the Paris set of "Bitter Moon." In one of the film's raciest scenes, Coyote 
is crawling around wearing only a G-string and a pig's snout. When he looked up 
to deliver his lines to Seigner, he was stunned to find himself cheek to jowl 
with Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Polanski a tough personal question and you are likely to get a joke in 
return. If life, as he believes, is made up of tragedy and farce, Polanski will 
choose farce every time. "Even at the funeral of someone very dear to you," he 
says, "if you see the priest slipping on the mat and falling on his face, it 
will make you laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Having a good time has always been more important to Polanski than morbid 
thoughts of his own demise. He skis and drives like a maniac and took boxing 
lessons a few years ago. Some friends wonder why he chooses to spend time with 
people who clearly don't challenge him in any way. Many of the women Polanski 
has been involved with, among them Catherine Deneuve and Nastassja Kinski, were 
archetypal innocents unspoiled by experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roman is into total control and ties into women who like to be controlled," 
says Polanski's sometime editor Sam O'Steen. "Emmanuelle's certainly that way. 
She likes to be molded." 
</P>
<P>
 Seigner acknowledges that she sees little of her husband's dark side spilling 
over from his films to his everyday life: "I don't ask why, if he's a happy 
person, his films are so dark. I'm not very intellectual; I try not to 
masturbate my brain. Just leave it, try to enjoy it the most. We're going to 
die anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski says fatherhood hasn't changed his life very much, except that he 
stays home a little more now. He is amused by friends who for years did nothing 
but run from one disco to another and now whip out their wallets to show baby 
pictures. Still, when friends visit him in Paris he gives them the grand 
night-life tour of clubs spilling over with young women. They go home happy, he 
says, thinking, "Ah, this is Polanski's Paris." Polanski's outrageousness has 
served him well over the years; it puts people on the defensive and deflects 
closer examination. It is really only in the last few years that he has started 
to slowly and selectively show another side. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the change is aging, inevitable even for him. At dinner one night, 
Polanski is rubbing his hip and complaining of various aches and pains. The 
prolonged illness leading to the death of his father several years ago from 
cancer made him consider his own mortality: "All of a sudden you realize that 
the remote light at the end of the tunnel is the train going in the opposite 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor of Polanski's emotional life seems to have been set by his 
relationship with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never really gave me any physical signs of affection," he says, "except 
the time when he returned from the concentration camp and took me on his knee." 
This made a deep, lifelong impression on Polanski, who grew up being "very 
discreet about my feelings and who I would expose them to." 
</P>
<P>
 If Polanski is just learning to show affection for his friends, the big change 
started with his marriage in August, 1989, to Seigner, the granddaughter of 
French actor Louis Seigner. He started seeing her when she was 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I met him, he was very lonely," she says. "He had no one. It was a bit 
sad for him going from one girl to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the sexual kamikaze he has created in "Bitter Moon," there doesn't seem 
to be much that Polanski hasn't tried. By the end of the film, the character 
played by Coyote is like an old junkie who is addicted to new thrills but can 
no longer get his fix -- he's hit a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never went that far," Polanski says, "but I came close. I never thought, 'I 
want to live on the edge.' I was just following my desires." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Polanski consistently dodges the topic, "Bitter Moon" poses questions 
he seems ready to address in his own life. After years of indulgence, what else 
is there besides sex and the pursuit of pleasure that makes life worth living? 
The problem of how to sustain a relationship after the initial sexual fireworks 
have gone off is not exactly revolutionary territory, but to see how one of the 
great libertines of our times grapples with the question is both ironic and 
amusing. He recognizes the absurdity of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the answer is for anyone else," he says rather sheepishly. 
"And I'm not one to give advice about how to deal with attractions outside of 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 It is surprising to realize that for all of its raciness, "Bitter Moon" is 
really something of a morality play, a point that is likely to be obscured by 
the unabashed sexuality of the material and the glare of Polanski's past. It is 
his first film to offer a ray of hope at the end, instead of his usual 
cul-de-sac. But anyone who can dress his wife in a leather harness, put a whip 
in her hand and put her on screen hasn't gone totally respectable. Asked if he 
would consider directing a real romance, he says sure -- as long as the couple 
dies in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Polanski's next film, "Death and the Maiden," which started shooting 
in Paris earlier this month, continues his claustrophobic examination of 
psychosexual tensions. Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley star in the adaptation 
of Ariel Dorfman's play about a politician, his wife and the doctor who may 
have tortured her. 
</P>
<P>
 By necessity Polanski's whole life has been a moving target, and he's not 
about to stop now. Friends say that in the right light the scars of the past 
are still visible. When he's bone tired and can't run anymore, at odd hours of 
the night on the set, driving on a desert highway, he will talk about the past. 
But not often and certainly not to a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you ever look back?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I do . . . only to avoid mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "What mistakes have you made?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm not going to go into specifics trying to recall them. And not to 
enumerate to a journalist. You asked me if I looked back; I said only to avoid 
mistakes. Anybody who repeats mistakes and doesn't learn is just plain stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bitter Moon" opens Friday at the Nuart, Santa Monica Boulevard at the San 
Diego Freeway, West Los Angeles, (310) 478-6379. In addition, the theater plans 
a retrospective of 15 of Polanski's films, from today through Thursday, 
including "Dance of the Vampires," "Rosemary's Baby," "Chinatown" and "The 
Tenant." Call the theater for specific schedule information.

<P>
 People in the audience at Jabberjaw, a small, kitsch-adorned club on Pico 
Boulevard in a dilapidated Midtown neighborhood, duck as bucketfuls of fried 
chicken and biscuits whiz past their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The finger-lickin' goods are being hurled by Southern Culture on the Skids, a 
bizarre trio from North Carolina that has found a niche in the underground rock 
scene by celebrating its white trash roots. 
</P>
<P>
 As a final drumstick slides greasily off a patron's jacket, the band resumes 
playing, filling the club with intentionally wrong notes. Through it all, the 
audience does its best to look Jack Kerouac-cool, but is charmed enough to 
reward the band with loud applause at the end of its set. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away at Raji's, a subterranean club near Hollywood and Vine, a 
frazzled blond named Beck sings, "I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?" 
with his back to the audience. When he finished his set of acoustic-backed 
poetry on everything from squashed Twinkies to Walkmans, the crowd applauds, 
and he bows to the back wall before exiting the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the border of Beverly Hills, LunaPark is serving arty and eclectic 
entertainment -- from drag queens to psychedelic duos -- for the 90210 crowd. 
While a flamenco guitarist plays, a cameraman from a local TV station asks 
patrons whether drugs are making a comeback in upper-crust club culture. Two 
customers sip their mineral water thoughtfully before one replies, "I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 These moments reflect the diversity and vitality of today's revitalized Los 
Angeles rock club scene -- a raw, creative environment that is rebounding after 
losing much of its edge in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. scene was born in the mid-'60s, when bands such as the Doors honed 
their skills at clubs on the Sunset Strip, and it escalated in the '70s as Los 
Angeles took over from New York as the commercial center of the pop world. 
</P>
<P>
 The record industry's presence in Los Angeles initially enriched the club 
scene, as venues played host in the early '70s to such emerging acts as Jackson 
Browne, the Eagles and Van Halen, all of whom went on to significant success. 
But that commercial thrust ultimately proved a curse: By the end of the decade, 
clubs and rehearsal halls were filled with formulaic bands playing generic hard 
rock and sappy pop. 
</P>
<P>
 The real energy shifted underground, driven by an anti-Establishment credo 
that spawned what evolved into today's alternative-rock scene. Bands from Black 
Flag and the Germs to X and the Blasters put into practice a "do-it-yourself" 
ethic by creating indie record labels and playing anywhere they could plug in 
an amp. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-'80s, glam bands such as Motley Crue, who made no bones about their 
aims for fame and fortune, took over the Strip and kicked off the big-hair rock 
trend. The L.A. scene then became known as a cheesy metal mecca until later in 
the decade, when Guns N' Roses redeemed the city's reputation temporarily. 
Punk/metal thrived at clubs like Riki Rachtman's Cathouse and Dayle Gloria's 
Scream. 
</P>
<P>
 With all these bands knocking at their door, Sunset Strip clubs such as 
Gazzarri's, the Roxy, the Whisky and Troubadour introduced a controversial 
policy called "pay-to-play." Bands now had to pay the club or promoter to play, 
as opposed to the venue paying them. The scene was no longer ruled by the best 
bands, but by the ones that could buy their way on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the deterioration of the scene, musicians who might have once been 
drawn to Los Angeles to get a deal or just play to a bigger audience stayed in 
Seattle or San Diego and started their own scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 While this new generation of bands, from the critically adored Nirvana to 
hard-core purists Fugazi, carried on the spirit of L.A.'s underground club 
scene in their hometowns, bands began to protest outside the Sunset Strip 
clubs. By the early '90s, the pay-to-play venues were stagnant and dull, and 
new clubs with a rawer appeal began to spring up in converted office buildings 
and restaurants. Bands were again booked on merit rather than money. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazzarri's went under as clubs like Raji's and Jabberjaw became successful. 
The Whisky and Troubadour got wise in the past year and a half and have almost 
pulled away from the pay-to-play policies, re-emerging as more relevant venues. 
The majority of bands now playing these places come from around the country, 
but many are descendents of L.A.'s punk scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. scene has really turned itself around by going underground again," 
says Bill Holdship, editor of the nearly 20-year-old California rock magazine 
Bam. "Bands know that it's the little coffeehouses and dives that have the 
credibility, and those are the best places to start. They've pumped life back 
into the city." Adds Tom Carolan, an Atlantic Records A&R executive who works 
with Stone Temple Pilots and the Lemonheads, "Musicians aren't stupid any more. 
They respect the integrity of small places like Jabberjaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the 10 key clubs on the scene for bands and fans, picked for their 
calibre of acts and informal ambience. Some of them have been around for years, 
but even they seem re-energized by the back-to-basics spirit that infuses the 
music. They are where you can hear the best of the new music -- from bands just 
breaking on MTV to bands just breaking out of the basement.

 Southern Culture on the Skids, drumsticks and all, is typical of the offbeat 
attractions that grace the stage of this funky, no-frills room, whose anonymous 
exterior is hardly distinguishable from the deserted storefronts that neighbor 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has featured the garage-pop sounds of L7 as well as the petrifying 
dissonance of Courtney Love's quartet Hole and the post-hard-core of Rocket 
From the Crypt -- long before these bands were signed to major labels. Fiercely 
independent bands such as "riot grrrl" leaders Bikini Kill and the Jon Spencer 
Blues Explosion have also packed the long, narrow structure. 
</P>
<P>
 As Southern Culture plays, Jabberjaw employees serve coffee while they shake 
their beehive wigs and shimmy in stretch pants that Doris Day would have killed 
for. Paintings of big-eyed clowns and children stare sadly down at the 
alcohol-free coffee bar that faces the stage. A "Welcome Back Kotter" board 
game and KISS dolls are among the other kitsch items hanging on a wall that 
vibrates to the music.

</P>
<P>
 Chicago group Royal Trux grinds out anesthetized mutations of classic rock as 
singer Jennifer Herrema belts indecipherable lyrics from under her mass of 
tangled hair. The scene is Mr. T's Bowl, a Highland Park bowling alley that the 
roving club Fuzzyland has taken over for the night. Unused lanes packed with 
junk lie behind the stage, and the clank of beer bottles replaces the crash of 
pins. The band's dense noise is driving out the last of the bar's daytime 
regulars, who delayed the Trux show by occupying the main floor to watch boxing 
on the big-screen TV.  
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzyland is a concept club that happens whenever creator Jac Zinder gets the 
inclination, which is usually twice a month and always on Saturday. It often 
runs with a theme -- such as "the Evening of Dangerous Hicks," pirate night and 
clown night -- and patrons dress accordingly. Bands from England's 
trance-masters Stereolab to L.A. feedback manipulators Medicine have played 
Fuzzyland, and Zinder complements the cutting-edge shows by spinning obscure 
dance records between and after the acts.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, under the low, sparkling, smoke-stained ceilings, a heavy-metal mime 
band and a country group headed by industrial-rock hellion Carla Bozulich open 
for Royal Trux. A late-night crowd dressed in everything from rotting leather 
gear to Levi's to blue lame chaps has packed into the narrow hall that leads to 
the dance floor and stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I book whatever I can throw together," says Zinder, an L.A. native who 
started the club over a year ago. "If I can't get an act, I'll just make 
something up." That's when Zinder features off-the-wall acts such as the 
karaoke punk band the Worm Boys and performance artists who dress as teddy 
bears.

 The Auditorium

<P>
 Call for schedule. All ages. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine the beefy singer Tad Doyle, who heads the Seattle band 
called Tad, thundering around on the tiny, floor-level stage at the Auditorium, 
but he manages. The group, whose sound is as thick and weighty as its leader's 
frame, is part of the stream of raw bands that keep the room's mosh pit in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nirvana, Tad is a band that has gone from the hip, underground Sub Pop 
label to a major record company, but the Auditorium gig provides a low-profile 
chance for the group to return to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-story room, which used to house a beauty school, sits at the top of 
a wooden staircase near Hollywood and Vine. Inside, broken-down couches and 
chairs add to the grass-roots ambience of the club, which was put together by 
the transplanted British industrial-rock group Tunnelmental. It's run strictly 
by the band and operates on the anyone-can-do-it spirit that fueled early 
punk-rock clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The alcohol-free venue features mainly  
</P>
<P>
 local bands such as San Diego's tribal percussion outfit Crash Worship, but 
also grabs whatever underground bands coming through town it can -- from the 
Japanese noise group the Boredoms to the Mexican techno group Artefacto. Its 
unrestricted age policy allows kids to experience up-and-coming bands in an 
intimate setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a part of me that wants to be an idiotic punk-rock rebel," 
says Tunnelmental leader Bif. "Los Angeles needs a local scene. It lacks it 
because there's so much competition and everything has this industry, showcase 
appeal. It takes all the art away from it."

 Right off a ritzy stretch of Robertson, just above Melrose, Andy Palcaio plays 
a sweat-inducing strain of aggressive Calypso, charming the arty crowd in the 
stylish cellar of this intimate, upscale club. On another night, the 
atmospheric group Downy Mildew plays its moody, ambient rock, and Exene 
Cervenka sings her urban folk. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclecticism is the byword at this 5-month-old space, where three separate 
rooms offer an offbeat variety of entertainment for the goatee-and-beret crowd 
and the offspring of L.A.'s economically privileged. Dinner is served along 
with the entertainment in the main room of this spacious venue. 
</P>
<P>
 A large back room just opened, and owner-booker Jean-Pierre Boccara plans to 
feature everything from punk poet Henry Rollins to performance artist Ann 
Magnuson. Patrons can escape the music and hit the outside patio for a 
breather. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are, like, 10 words to describe L.A., starting with trendy , snobby and 
grungy ," says Boccara, a Frenchman who used to run the equally arty but 
grittier Lhasa Club, and then the Largo on Fairfax. "We want to add new words 
to the old ones. We want to bridge the gaps not only between musical genres, 
but between stereotypes and age groups."

 Dark and lusty dance music fills Sin-a-Matic. Deejay Joseph is spinning rare,

showy dance band My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult performed.

Ethyl Meatplow mix sexy, provocative stage antics with an addictive beat.

<P>
 The three-room club also offers the delightfully obscure. Electronic noise 
pioneers Psychic TV and up-and-coming percussion-with-keyboards group Beat 
Mistress have moved booties across the club's main dance floor.  
</P>
<P>
 This night, a young woman in a tight nurse's uniform shakes her hips on the 
dance floor to the dark beat of the Revolting Cocks' "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" 
single. A middle-aged man with Pollyanna braids wearing only construction boots 
and a vertical strip of cloth jiggles to the driving sounds of Meat Beat 
Manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to expose people to a lot of different things," says Joseph Brookes, 
who runs Sin-a-Matic with his partner James Stone. "It's too easy to always 
listen to the same thing. That's why people come here, for a taste of the 
strange and new."

 Highland Grounds 
</P>
<P>
 742 N. Highland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Open nightly, 9-12:30. All ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering a chance to sip top-notch java while watching acoustic music, 
Highland Grounds is a welcome rest stop between the feedback and noise of the 
Auditorium and the dark beat of Sin-a-Matic. It offers mostly amateur artists 
unplugged -- from Chinese and Albanian groups to rockabilly and blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Many a guitar strum and earnest lyric -- from the likes of country-rock 
heroine Rosie Flores to rock-spoofing Spinal Tap -- have bounced off the high 
ceilings of the club, whose setting includes a small balcony area and a lush 
mini-jungle of a patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Funky, sculptured metal tables and chairs fill the bright space of the 
laid-back venue, while a large coffee and food bar churns out the joe. The food 
is actually edible (a rarity in the coffeehouse world), and dining among the 
patio's numerous trees and tall plants somehow makes it all the more enticing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always looking for the next Bob Dylan to walk in, but we're mainly a 
neighborhood place, a place where locals can play," says Rich Brenner, the 
club's co-owner.

 Troubadour 
</P>
<P>
 9081 Santa Monica Blvd.

<P>
 West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Open nightly. Times vary. 
</P>
<P>
 All ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Phair sings insightful and blunt lyrics about one-night stands, boring sex 
and sleazy guys. The jam-packed crowd hangs on every word from the latest 
underground rock star, and rightly so. The songwriter's debut album is smart, 
raw and hard-hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 She's just one in the string of many worthy acts that the Troubadour has 
booked in the last year. The 35-year-old club, on a high-rent stretch of Santa 
Monica Boulevard, is dumping its former image as a glam-metal club to change 
with the times.  
</P>
<P>
 The Troubadour once featured some of the best acts of the '60s and '70s, from 
Lenny Bruce to Joni Mitchell and Elton John. Doug Weston's club then got into 
the metal scene in the '80s -- and stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
 The club started picking up in the last few years, and while paintings of 
macho metal heroes such as Vince Neil and Jon Bon Jovi still decorate the main 
showroom, the club is taking steps in new directions by booking fresh 
independent and major-label alternative acts as well as respected folk artists. 
Some of the recent attractions include the Breeders, speed-core band Helmet and 
seedy lounge-rockers Morphine, as well as Joan Baez, Guy Clark and jazz diva 
Cassandra Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to diversify and get back to the respected level we once were," 
says Lance Hubp, the club's manager and promoter. "It's really not that hard 
'cause there's a lot of great music out there now."

 The Gaslight and Gaslight II

 1608 Cosmo St., Hollywood

<P>
 Sundays, 7 p.m.-2 a.m; 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesdays, 9 p.m.-2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 21. 
</P>
<P>
 To the average passer-by, Cosmos bar, where the Gaslight club is located, may 
seem like just another Hollywood dive, and for good reason. Until a group of 
club promoters took it over two years ago, it was a smoky barfly haven. Now, 
five local bands grace its tiny stage every Sunday at Gaslight and Wednesday at 
Gaslight II, playing to a party-minded crowd of mainly Hollywood locals.  
</P>
<P>
 On this night, Green Thumb pounds out shards of driving rock to an audience 
that's dancing, socializing, playing pool and just plain hanging out. The group 
is one of the many unsigned, local bands, such as Loungefly and S.T.S., that 
the Gaslight I and II feature regularly. The feel here is that of a 
neighborhood pub rather than a Hollywood showcase, and most of the bands that 
play here are casual enough to fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons in faded T-shirts and jeans talk over the music in cubbyholes around 
the cavernous club. Upstairs, couples smooch in a comfortable room on satiny, 
granny-style furniture. The pool tables next to the dance floor are constantly 
in use, while the small brick patio boasts a quieter appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the week the bar is host to different clubs that feature jazz 
bands and deejays spinning hip-hop and retro tunes.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's way more bands than there are places to play," says Dayle Gloria, who 
books shows at the Gaslight along with Mary Nixon. "It's just a matter of 
giving them a chance at this level, and then sitting back to see what happens."

<P>
 Open Tuesday through Sunday. Times vary. Over 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The acoustic guitarist Beck plays an entire set -- including his KROQ hit 
"Loser" -- with his back to the audience. Regulars who look as if they're 
wearing the clothes they slept in are crammed into the seedy, subterranean 
restaurant, alongside record-industry types wanting to get a look at this 
newest weird wonder on the L.A. rock scene.  
</P>
<P>
 "Raji's has been a forum for a lot of artists like Beck," says the veteran 
club's promoter Riff Mercy. "No other club let them play because of their 
obscure nature. That's what Raji's is for -- the freaky stuff."  
</P>
<P>
 Nirvana has played here. So has L7, and lesser-known local stars such as Pigmy 
Love Circus and New Improved God. The club has been a fixture on the scene for 
10 years, and 90% of the bands that play here are local and unsigned. It's hit 
and miss, but a sure way to see something different. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Mercy: "A lot of industry people go to see bands and a lot showcase here 
because we specialize in music away from the norm -- not the everyday MTV 
thing. When people want a taste of something different, they come here."

 Whisky a Go-Go 
</P>
<P>
 8901 Sunset Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Open nightly. All Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the grand old Los Angeles rock club -- a fixture since the '60s that 
has played host over the years to everyone from Led Zeppelin to Elvis Costello 
to Smashing Pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, yet another in an endless string of promising new bands -- the 
Dutch group Bettie Serveert, with its endearing lead singer Carol van Dijk -- 
is causing a buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Troubadour, the Whisky lost some of its glamour in the '80s when it 
flirted with a pay-to-play policy, but it has rebounded in recent years with a 
dazzling array of newcomers, from England's PJ Harvey to Soul Asylum (before 
"Runaway Train") to Yo La Tengo. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to hear something new, yet sample the history and tradition of Los 
Angeles rock, the Whisky is where you go. The club is every bit as 
indestructible as rock 'n' roll itself.

DR. LAURA'S LIFE LESSONS; LAURA SCHLESSINGER'S SIGNATURE STYLE IS BEYOND 
NO-NONSENSE. THE RADIO SHRINK WANTS EVERYONE TO STRAIGHTEN UP AND FLY RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the radio scourge of the immature, has a lesson for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate it, she plucks one from a zillion stories of Angst and ennui 
crammed in her head, ready to roll in moments like this. The tale is about a 
short-lived early marriage, the unfurling of a union of hard-working New York 
professionals with a luminous future. 
</P>
<P>
 On a fateful stroll across the George Washington Bridge shortly after they 
met, the woman was wearing heels, and the walk cost her knee-cap cartilage and 
a couple of years of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 So the young man took care of her. He carried her on his shoulders. He came 
home at noon and put her on the potty. And then one night at dinner, he told 
her his fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid when you get better," he said, "because I don't think you'll need 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 She did get better and he did become more afraid, which translated into 
rudeness, and the woman left him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He created what he most feared," says the popular KFI AM-640 talk-show 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Laura Lesson No. 1: Do trust anyone under 30 -- just not enough to marry 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Laura Lesson No. 2: When a guy tells you something, listen. "He was 
telegraphing that he needed me to be helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 Me ? 
</P>
<P>
 Today's lesson stems from Schlessinger's first marriage to an orthodontic 
student at Columbia University, where she earned her doctorate in physiology ( 
ergo , the Dr. in Dr. Laura). When Dr. Laura talks and sometimes hectors her 
radio audience into shaping up and flying right, she may very well be drawing 
on her own life.  
</P>
<P>
 So the ultimate Dr. Laura lesson is this: There's a lesson in everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always look for it," she says, sitting back straight, hands folded, in a 
KFI office. "One of the ways I survive is, I look for what I can get out of 
this, how I can be a little stronger from this point on, what can I learn to be 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger packed a course-worth of Dr. Laura life lessons into her new 
book, "Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives." The in-your-face 
title is vintage Dr. Laura, whose signature style is beyond no-nonsense. Take 
her take on the word stupid . 
</P>
<P>
 "Not intelligent," she says crisply. "Not using one's brain. Using one's 
immediate need. Emotion. Weaknesses. Genital titillation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Feelgood she's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger, 47, whose on-and-off radio career spans 18 years, long ago 
dispensed with such therapeutic niceties as being non-judgmental, the principle 
on which many counselors cut their teeth. Schlessinger's orneriness wins her 
high ratings -- she's No. 2 in her noon-to-2 p.m. time slot after KLAX-FM, a 
Spanish-language music station, according to the fall '93 Arbitron ratings. And 
she says her show will go national in late spring, but she declined to give 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent KFI promo, Schlessinger calls one woman lazy. During a show, she 
tells a caller that a boyfriend who believes in hitting an 18-month-old is 
insane: "Get rid of this guy or just date him, but keep him away from your 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to get people's attention, and I call something what it is," 
says Schlessinger, a petite woman in big red Sally Jessy Raphael glasses and a 
suit like blue stained glass. "People are very used to hearing New Age sweetie 
stuff and I wasn't doing that at all. . . . You could say, 'This is a choice 
determined by all the historical pain you've had.' I don't think these motivate 
people to face the truth and do anything constructive." 
</P>
<P>
 Which summons up another Dr. Laura story. This one is about a lesson learned 
in therapy school, as she calls it. One of her supervisors, a refined woman of 
a certain age, invited her to imagine people who lived in houses with slats for 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they don't have a bathroom, so they do it in between the slats. People 
basically will not move until the poop gets too high.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a shock of recognition of what a brilliant concept that was. And it's 
true. So the bluntness brings the truth of the moment and I think the ultimate 
pain to the fore, and I think that makes people realize they have to move. 
Until that, there are rationalizations, denial all over the place. I only have 
a few minutes with people, so my style has evolved in that I've been taught by 
my callers what works." 
</P>
<P>
 But her distinctive kick-butt style earns her mixed marks from other 
therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling callers cowardly and lazy is "absolutely outrageous," says a former 
Pepperdine student of Schlessinger. "Laura said one time in class that she 
always gets mad at a client if a client says, 'I don't know.' She said, 'I 
don't believe a client doesn't know. I hate that answer.' My feeling is, what's 
Laura's need to be answered? She yells at people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schlessinger's impassioned on-air sessions have also won her fans among 
colleagues. "She's no-nonsense and yet she does it with compassion, which I 
admire," says Santa Monica clinical psychologist Diane Medved, the author of 
"The Case Against Divorce" and, briefly, a talk-show counselor herself. "There 
is no such thing as a non-judgmental shrink, and those who claim to be 
objective are being less than honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger acknowledges that people have ended relationships after minutes' 
worth of on-air talk, a fact borne out by letters. But she doesn't pretend that 
what she does substitutes for professional counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing therapy," she says. "What I do has many therapeutic parts to 
it. I'm expressing my views, my attitudes, my experience, my education, my 
beliefs. I'm clarifying things for people based on all my training and 
experience as a therapist, but this is not a couch. This is not an hour with 
each person." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the American Psychological Assn., concerned about the fallout from 
broadcast therapy bites, prohibited psychotherapy over the airwaves in its code 
of ethics in 1977. But pressured by the popularity of radio psychology talk 
shows, the APA relaxed the ban in 1981, allowing advice-giving, but nixing 
psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, some therapists say, is that the distinction between advice and 
therapy can be blurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a radio psychologist says, 'This isn't therapy, this is advice,' what's 
the difference when push comes to shove?" asks David Levy, associate professor 
of psychology at Pepperdine University, who has published studies on radio 
psychology talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a mental health professional advises you to do something, that happens in 
therapy all the time. The problem as I see it is, given a two- or three-minute 
phone contact to make an accurate assessment, to offer advice that's meaningful 
but appropriate to the caller, it can be at best misleading, and at the very 
worst, it may be harmful." 
</P>
<P>
 In Dr. Laura's view, her naysayers eventually come around. When she delivered 
her stingingly clear opinions on early childhood -- she believes moms should 
stay at home for the first few years -- to a group of working mothers last 
year, only half the women agreed with her message, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, the room seethed with hostility as I endorsed the absolute necessity 
of babies being with mothers and/or fathers who attend to them," she wrote in 
her book. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after her hostility bath, one of the mothers approached her at a 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'You know, I used to think you were mean,' " Schlessinger says. " 
'Now I understand it's depth.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For all her taking to task career moms with babies, Schlessinger considers 
herself "the ultimate feminist role model. . . . What better role model do you 
want than somebody who's done it right?" 
</P>
<P>
 So she figures she's qualified to tackle the National Organization for Women, 
which sent her a sniffy letter after she snapped at a caller who became 
pregnant with a noncommittal partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'It's your fault. This is your body. You didn't take care of it. You 
were too busy wanting to have a chuckle at the moment. This weak-kneed stuff 
got you to spread your knees and now you're pregnant. He doesn't care.' Now 
that's basically for the listener, because she's already pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got this ferocious letter from one of the NOW organizations in Southern 
California, which said something that put me up the roof, and that was with all 
the trials and tribulations that women have, how can they possibly take 
control? I thought, 'This is what the feminist movement is perpetrating, women 
are weak and have no control. They are helpless corks bobbling around on the 
ocean. A wave comes. They're drowned.' I can't stand this. It enfeebles women 
and it treats them (as) second-class." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger boils at the thought of women who opt out of a first-class life, 
partly because she grew up with one who did. Her mother was an Italian beauty 
whom her Brooklyn-born father brought home after World War II, but family life 
became a caldron of tension and frustrated ambition. Her mother was a unhappy 
homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was frustrated and angry about it, but in my opinion, she complained 
about it but didn't take any risks. And I don't admire that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking on the responsibility and the job of being a mother and a wife is 
something to enjoy, not to use as an excuse for one's own weakness and fear of 
taking the risks for doing other things." 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, that is the lesson she learned from her mother's experience. And yes, 
even her mother got a dose of Dr. Laura's no-nonsense life prescription 15 
years or so ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't take it well," Schlessinger says with some understatement. "I 
think it was more of an angry confrontation. It was like I had a revelation. I 
didn't believe all this whining and complaining and demanding of everybody else 
when you could have done it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not because you had a kid that you didn't do it. You didn't do it. Don't 
blame me." 
</P>
<P>
 After Schlessinger got her doctorate and got out of her first marriage, she 
moved to Southern California for a job as an assistant professor at USC. It was 
there that she first "locked eyeballs," as she puts it, with her husband, Lewis 
Bishop, 60, a former USC biology professor who now manages her career. That was 
about 20 years ago, and they've been married for 10. 
</P>
<P>
 So when she tells callers to wait 1 1/2 years before marrying anyone, "I say, 
'Listen, I'm being nice to you. I really think it's two.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Commitment "means that you pledge to work out the difficult parts, but when 
people jump into things quickly, it's because they don't want to deal with the 
difficult points," she says. "They want to be happy now and that's why they're 
less likely to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger's experience as a new mother was characteristically intense. She 
had her son, Deryk, eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got pregnant with our son, I woke (Bishop) up at 3 in the morning and 
I said, 'I want you real clear on one thing. If I even think you hurt him, I 
will take you down to the molecular level.' And he said, 'As well you should.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 When Deryk popped out, he was given his mother's last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband had a prior family. And I figured I went through 12 hours of labor 
and a C-section. I figured, I'm going to name this thing anything I want, and I 
said, 'Lew, do you have any problem with the last name Schlessinger?' He said, 
'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop says he's mesmerized by his wife's outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laura has the ability -- and I've always been fascinated by it -- to take 
things from disparate corners and put them together. And that's what she does 
on the air, and sometimes when I listen to her, I say, 'How the hell did you 
get from here to there?' It's almost an altered state of concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger did post-doctoral work in psychology at the USC Human Relations 
Center and earned her license as a marriage, family and child counselor in 
1980. She spent most of the '80s as an adjunct professor in psychology at 
Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which explains her leap into the radio psychology talk-show business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the silliest story," she says of the time she called the Bill 
Ballance program on KABC, a talk show for women that tackled Schlessinger's 
specialty -- relationships. The question of the day was, "Would you rather be a 
widow or a divorcee?" Schlessinger got on the line, said that her name was 
Cathy and that she'd rather be a widow: 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you don't have to second-guess yourself whether you made the right 
choice in leaving. You don't feel guilt. Everybody feels sorry for you. They 
come over and cook for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballance was so intrigued by her quick wit and common sense that he kept her 
on through two commercial breaks and took her phone number. He later visited 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, the first day of meeting me, 'You are going to be a big star.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger started as a human sexuality expert on his show, then got her own 
show, first with guests, eventually without. She started at KFI in 1990 on 
nights and moved to the noon-to-2 slot in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She also gave up her private practice, partly to spend more time with her 
family in Woodland Hills and partly to avoid the pitfalls of high-profile 
shrinkage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a celebrity and a therapist, either way, you're dealing with 
people who have difficulties. . . . I got worried that somebody might hurt my 
reputation because they think I'm a deep pocket. That happened to a friend and 
I went, 'Whoa.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So instead she ministers to her callers, many of whom are women with tired 
lives. Schlessinger's audience is about evenly divided between men and women, 
KFI says. But according to Pepperdine professor Levy's paper on the subject, 
nearly twice as many women as men call in to radio psychology shows, and those 
women are likely to be unmarried, unemployed and not highly educated. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger wrote her book, "Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their 
Lives," primarily for those callers, the many who can't find identity in their 
work, so they look for it in their men. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Laura Lesson No. 45: Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a quality love relationship, the love between the two people is an even 
kind of give-and-take and has a priority in their lives," she says. "What you 
see with the troubled situations is love doesn't mean the same thing to the two 
of them, and I would say when women think of love, they think of it as the 
whole sentence. And when men think of love, they think of it as commas in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of women find the love instead of development. The love is the 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 So the women hold onto their relationships for better or for worse, often 
worse, to avoid the void. And then they call Dr. Laura.  
</P>
<P>
 One woman said her boyfriend wasn't crazy about her daughter, so she was 
trying to figure out how to unload the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I landed all over her with both feet. Sometimes it's amazing to me, but then 
I realize that they know what they're doing is wrong. It's like getting the Dr. 
Laura KFI Seal of Approval. 'This is right that I'm doing wrong, isn't it?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yes, it's right you're wrong.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'OK. I'll take care of it.'  
</P>
<P>
 "People are hungry for some kind of moral and value system. It's gone. See, 
I'm from the '60s and the '60s were, you do whatever you damn well feel like 
and if somebody is unhappy about it, it's too bad, it's their problem. And I 
remember that vividly, and I don't think it's gone away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are days that are intense and intractable, filled with callers who 
refuse to be fixed, people who won't learn the lessons. There are days that 
make Schlessinger cry, when she has turned off the microphone and let her head 
thud.  
</P>
<P>
 One caller wasn't protecting her kids from their abusive father, and 
Schlessinger worked hard to reach her, but she knew as the minutes flicked by 
that she hadn't. She was so upset that she threw down her headphones, hurled 
her pencil across the room and paced through an extra commercial until she 
could pull herself together. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's a lesson in that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, I do respect how hard I work and how sincere I am, and how hard I 
try and how I persevere and have never taken the easy way. I've never cut 
corners. I haven't lied, cheated, stolen. I admire all that. 
</P>

 "So if somebody criticizes me, 'Gee, you were too tough on that call,' you 
know, maybe I was. But all in all, my heart's in the right place. So I forgive 
myself that I can't be right on in everybody's estimation of what I should be 
all the time, even my own." Reality, According to Dr. Laura 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Schlessinger packed a course-worth of lessons into her new book, "Ten 
Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives," including: 
</P>
<P>
 * If you kiss a toad, you don't get a prince -- you get slime in your mouth 
and bad memories. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sex-too-soon is self-love-too-late. 
</P>
<P>
 * When you move in with a man without a commitment, he already knows one 
crucial thing: He doesn't have to do much to get you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look out for the word compromise if it ends up meaning you give up what is 
precious to you so that maybe you'll get what you want later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Too often, hope is just postponed disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Procreation has little to do with your needs; it has everything to do with 
the child's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is this the Catch-22 Syndrome of women? You're miserable, so you make kids, 
now you have kids and you can't get out for the sake of the kids -- even though 
you are miserable with him? 
</P>
<P>
 * The ultimate sadness for me is to hear how people refuse to stop trying to 
get love and approval from bloodsucking, slime-producing, im- or a-moral, 
insensitive, unloving, uncaring, self-centered, disgusting sperm and egg donors 
(a.k.a. "lousy parents").  
</P>
<P>
 * Water and self-esteem seek their own levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * There are no two ways around it: Women must have more dimension in their 
lives than "looove"!

DANA PARSONS: DEPUTY SENTENCED TO LIFE TERM OF DOUBT AND QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cops will tell you that the file never closes on a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is publicly calling Brian Scanlan's shooting of fellow Deputy Sheriff 
Darryn Robins a homicide, but it likely will linger in local history as the 
case that never closed. 
</P>
<P>
 It will linger because some people will never be able to understand how it 
could have happened. I talked to several current and former law enforcement 
officers in the days after the shooting and, almost unanimously, they were 
incredulous that a veteran officer like Scanlan would use a loaded gun during 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 No explanation given since then makes it any more believable. Scanlan took his 
gun out. . . . Robins startled him during the drill by pointing a gun at him. . 
. . Scanlan jumped back and reflexively squeezed the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 That the explanation is hard to believe doesn't mean it isn't true; it just 
means that there always will be a pool of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 For Scanlan, that will be part of his curse to bear. Surely, he will lose his 
job and most likely any chance of ever working again in law enforcement. There 
is always the possibility of a lawsuit. On top of all that -- if we accept 
Scanlan's version of events -- is the lifelong pain of knowing he killed one of 
his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a heavy load, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 In that regard, I'm wondering about crimes and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how, in the long run, Scanlan will handle what he did. I wonder if 
the grand jury really has done him a favor by exonerating him. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure Scanlan wasn't begging anyone to charge or convict him of something, 
but somewhere down the road, he may wish someone had. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney had that option and let it go. Prosecutors said they had 
a case, on paper, of involuntary manslaughter. They could have filed a charge, 
and no one could have vociferously challenged them. After all, Scanlan was 
mindlessly careless, and the result was a dead man. 
</P>
<P>
 People have gone to jail for crimes like that. This wasn't an accidental 
shooting in the sense that someone cleans a pistol they think is empty and it 
discharges and hits someone. It strikes me more like a drunk driver -- perhaps 
a fine citizen, otherwise -- hitting and killing a pedestrian. The system 
understands there was no malice involved, but it still punishes the driver for 
the loss of life because he should have known he was placing people in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office recognized that there was a case against 
Scanlan, and because it knows the law and is supposed to dispense it 
dispassionately, says it wanted to file the appropriate charge. Maybe it 
thought no jury would ever convict Scanlan. Maybe the grand jury's decision 
bears that out. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I was in a minority among my colleagues about taking this to the 
grand jury. Doing so opened up the district attorney for exactly what it's 
received -- questions about uneven distribution of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the jurors more sympathetic toward Scanlan because he was a law 
enforcement officer? Did race, however subconsciously, enter into the jurors' 
minds? Just what was Darryn Robins' life worth, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the kind of things the district attorney shouldn't have to think 
about when it prepares a case. They are the things a grand jury of citizens may 
think about. 
</P>
<P>
 All this may sound like I'm out for Scanlan's neck. Absolutely not true; I 
don't have any overwhelming indignation that he isn't being charged. I'm even 
prepared to accept at face value that things happened as he has said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was a crime, and it deserves punishment. It's always amazing to me 
how so many law-and-order types suddenly become bleeding-heart liberals when it 
comes to explaining away law enforcement officials on trial. 
</P>
<P>
 You may scoff, but I think Brian Scanlan would be better served by punishment. 
That doesn't mean putting him in jail and throwing away the key. Perhaps jail 
time isn't even appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 But to make sense of this case, and to assure everyone that justice is blind, 
he should have been charged and either pleaded guilty or taken his chances with 
a jury. The grand jury has said that, in the eyes of the law, he did nothing 
wrong. Everyone, including Scanlan, knows that isn't right. A conviction and a 
sentence, even one that only included a minimal jail time or probation, would 
have matched crime and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way this case file could have been closed, once and for all. That's 
the way that some sense of order and fairness could have been carved out of a 
situation that is a disaster for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, the district attorney should have filed the charge 
warranted under the law -- however unpopular it may have been. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been the best outcome for a public that deserves accountability 
for deaths caused by recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a strange way, over the long haul it perhaps would have been the best 
outcome for Brian Scanlan too.

OLD-GROWTH YEW SPARED AS CANCER DRUG SOURCE; HEALTH: DRUG FIRM DECIDES IT CAN'T 
RISK MILLIONS PRODUCING MEDICATION THAT COMES ONLY FROM SLOW-GROWING WILD 
TREES. INSTEAD, IT USES ORNAMENTAL VARIETIES GROWN IN NURSERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just two years ago, bark from the Pacific yew was in such high demand to 
produce the new anti-cancer drug Taxol that poachers were stealing it from the 
Northwest's national forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Pacific yew that falls in the course of logging on federal land is 
left to rot, unless someone wants the strong wood for fence posts or 
traditional English longbows. 
</P>
<P>
 And the special law passed in 1992 that made it illegal to waste yew bark on 
national forests is headed for the sunset, said Jim Simonson, yew coordinator 
for the Willamette National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything changed a year ago when Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. decided it 
couldn't risk millions of dollars on producing a drug that came only from 
slow-growing trees in the wild that could be snatched away by forest fires, 
drought or environmentalists saving old-growth forests for the northern spotted 
owl. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercially available for the last year, Taxol is approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration as a second stage of treatment for ovarian cancer and is 
recommended for approval as a treatment for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Once its contract with supplier Hauser Northwest runs out at the end of July, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb will produce all the Taxol anybody wants from ornamental 
varieties of yew grown in nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of concern that we would use up all the trees, we would get 
into the old-growth forest, we were destroying unknown sources of new drugs as 
we cut the forest," Jonathan Adams, head of the clinical research pharmacy 
section of the National Cancer Institute, recalled of the early Taxol years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out there are plenty of these trees and they grow everywhere. The 
scientists found out a way to make it from clippings so we didn't have to kill 
the trees," he said. "This was a very good learning experience that maybe we 
should use as a guide for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Taxol was first isolated nearly 30 years ago, but it was 1971 before 
scientists mapped out the complex molecular structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Horwitz, professor of molecular pharmacology at Albert Einstein College 
of Medicine in New York City, discovered in 1979 that Taxol had a unique way of 
stopping the uncontrolled cell growth in cancerous tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Cancer Institute soon began testing the drug. By 1991 it signed a 
five-year cooperative research and development agreement with Bristol-Myers 
Squibb that gave the drug company exclusive access to the yew bark harvested on 
national forests. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Bristol-Myers Squibb spent more than $5 million for the Forest 
Service for research, law enforcement and an environmental impact statement, 
and provided the National Cancer Institute with free Taxol for clinical testing 
on 7,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to passage of the Pacific Yew Act in 1992 and a special environmental 
impact statement in 1993 to assure that yew bark wouldn't be wasted and demand 
wouldn't wipe out the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 But logging on national forests was being cut back drastically to preserve 
habitat for the northern spotted owl, a threatened species, and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb went looking for a steady supply. 
</P>
<P>
 It found it in a process that takes a precursor of Taxol, called 
10-deacetylbaccatin III, that is found in ornamental shrub varieties of yew, 
and partially synthesizes the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the pharmaceutical industry, we always felt that nature provided the best 
lead," said M. Dianne DiFuria, senior director of business development for 
Bristol-Myers Squibb. "But it is up to the industry to either improve that lead 
or come up with alternative sources." 
</P>
<P>
 That sent stock tumbling for Hauser Northwest, which was the sole supplier of 
Taxol to Bristol-Myers Squibb. The company is still collecting a little Pacific 
yew bark from private lands, but gave up collecting on national forests because 
of all the restrictions, said Phil Hassrick, executive vice president of the 
Boulder, Colo., company. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol-Myers Squibb buys the Taxol precursor from a company based in Milan, 
Italy, that makes it from the European and Himalayan varieties of yew. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at Florida State University recently announced that they can now 
wholly synthesize Taxol, but the process has little chance of ever being cheap 
enough to compete with partial synthesis, DiFuria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to pursue research into new ways 
to produce Taxol, such as tissue culture, as well as related compounds that may 
also be potent cancer fighters, DiFuria said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it expects to soon face competition from other drug makers, notably 
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a French company developing a related drug called 
"taxotere."  
</P>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser, the nation's biggest timber producer, hopes to take over as the 
top source of the Taxol precursor. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser has planted more than 12 million ornamental yews, testing them 
for Taxol as well as the precursor and related compounds, said Dick Piesch, 
manager of the company's Taxol program in Centralia, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, Weyerhaeuser harvested 40,000 4-year-old seedlings of a hybrid 
of Japanese and European yews and gave them to Bristol-Myers Squibb for 
testing, Piesch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that the bark of older trees as a commercial resource 
would disappear long before the demand would," said Piesch. "I think we can all 
say . . . that Taxol is not limiting any more. There is plenty of it to go 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Taxol approved by the Food and Drug Administration is made from 
Pacific yew bark, but Taxol partially synthesized from ornamental yews is 
likely to be approved before the end of the year, said Saul Schepartz, deputy 
associate director of the developmental therapeutics program at the National 
Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The new process will have to be approved to meet the growing demand. Breast 
cancer kills 46,000 women a year and ovarian cancer 13,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists are testing Taxol against a variety of other cancers, particularly 
lung cancer and cancers of the head and neck, said Adams.

LINK BETWEEN WRESTLERS' STRENGTH, WEIGHT LOSS STUDIED; HEALTH: ATHLETES WHO 
SHED POUNDS TO COMPETE IN A LOWER WEIGHT CLASS DO NOT BECOME PROPORTIONATELY 
STRONGER, RESEARCHERS FIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA DREYFUSS, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<P>
 Despite what many high school wrestlers think, losing weight doesn't make you 
stronger, a study indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers checked whether weight loss would affect the muscle-to-fat 
ratio enough to make a wrestler proportionately stronger for his weight. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen, said the study in Pediatric Exercise Science, the journal of 
the North American Society of Pediatric Exercise Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrestlers who lost weight showed no change -- or a change for the worse -- in 
strength over the course of the season, said researcher Joan M. Eckerson of 
Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous studies that looked at weight loss shortly before a match also found 
no benefit or a loss in strength, the report said. This study investigated 
whether a benefit might show up if the weight stayed down over a longer period. 
</P>
<P>
 The report indicates that wrestlers who force themselves to lose weight, 
thinking they can win by wrestling in a lower weight class against presumably 
weaker opponents, may be deluding themselves, according to Eckerson, an 
assistant professor in the department of Health, Physical Education, Recreation 
and Dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckerson conceded that she did not check the win-loss records of the athletes 
that she and her colleagues studied. But the strength data indicate victories 
won't become more common because of their weight loss, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study looked at 35 varsity-level high school wrestlers with an average age 
of 16, who had their weights checked every week to determine the weight class 
in which they would compete. All were weighed before the first match of the 
season and after the season ended -- before district competition. Twenty-six 
were an average of almost five pounds lighter at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also tested the wrestlers' arm and leg strength before and 
after the season. They statistically adjusted their findings for weight, to 
determine whether athletes' strength was higher in proportion to their new, 
lighter weights. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no change in 10 and a decrease in two of the strength measures, 
Eckerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that dieting robbed the athletes' bodies of fuel they needed for 
strength, Eckerson said. It's also possible that intense training, another way 
to burn calories, led to overtraining, which saps strength, she said. Her study 
did not look for causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of water can also reduce weight quickly, and can reduce strength. 
Although the study did not examine the athletes for dehydration, they were 
asked and said they were not skimping on fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are losing weight but the strength per weight is the same, some of 
the loss is muscle and a lot is water," said another researcher, Edward J. 
Zambraski, chairman of the exercise science department at Rutgers University in 
New Brunswick, N.J. "The results are really not surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 Another expert, however, suspects that the athletes might have cut back 
strength training during the season, which also could make them lose strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they are not training as hard," said research scientist Craig A. 
Horswill of Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Horswill also said he believes that a wrestler who doesn't force down his 
weight may find himself at a disadvantage against an adversary who does, just 
because the adversary has a larger frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody does it," Horswill said. "If you are the guy who doesn't, you are 
left to compete against someone who is bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the study measured strength only in the lab, so it's possible that 
thinner wrestlers got some benefit that wouldn't show up in a lab test, 
Horswill said.

VICTIM IS NOT ENTITLED TO U.S. HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In regards to the article "Crash Victim's Coma Ends, But Not Troubles," 
(March 3), I would like to say to Mr. John Palacio of Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund that he is way off base when he says that this 
illegal (immigrant), a felon, lawbreaker and intruder, has like everyone else 
in this country the right to full and complete health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Send this illegal (immigrant) to Mexico and see if the Mexican government will 
help him. What a fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
 SAL JUAREZ 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * The plight of Roberto Morales is indeed a tragedy. (But) the idea that the 
taxpayers here in California have already been stuck for a six-figure Medi-Cal 
bill, to provide medical services to an illegal (immigrant) fleeing the Border 
Patrol in a high-speed car chase, is a tragedy of monumental proportion. Now, 
John Palacio of MALDEF is demanding that we, the taxpaying public, provide 
long-term rehabilitation care as well. His argument, that regardless of Mr. 
Morales' legal status, he has a right to subsidized health care for however 
long and expensive it may be, elevates the discussion of illegal immigration to 
a whole new level. Mr. Morales is not an American citizen and is in the country 
illegally. The only thing he should receive is a one-way ticket back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Palacio and MALDEF are so concerned that Roberto Morales receive this 
long-term care, I'm sure they will be willing to reimburse the rest of us for 
costs to date and assume responsibility for any future costs as well. 
</P>

 * Your story "Crash Victim's Coma Ends" is another in a never-ending stream of 
white, middle-class bashing, which is, of course, never overtly mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The outrageous quote, "whether this man is here legally or illegally, he has, 
like everyone else in this country, the right to full and complete health 
care," attributed to John Palacio of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, is notable for its arrogant greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand that citizens of any country provide free services -- whether food, 
shelter or health care -- to people not citizens is greedy, wrongheaded and 
damaging to the entire well-being of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This concept, that is that anyone who crashes U.S. borders is entitled to be 
rewarded for their cleverness with limitless benefits to support all aspects of 
life, is advanced by The Times to the detriment of all law-abiding, taxpaying 
American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. citizens demand a stop to this madness of pressuring citizens to pay for 
every service every gate-crashing illegal immigrant demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man in question can do what others do -- or should do -- in similar 
situations: go back to his own country and ask that government to pay for his

PENSION SPIKING LEAVES A BAD TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If Huntington Beach residents have had enough of the retirement salary 
spiking, if they do not think it is fair that the taxpayers pay 100% of city 
employees' retirement contributions, and if they are sick and tired of having a 
special tax levied on their property to pay for all of this, then they should 
help us amend the city charter to put a stop to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens Against Retirement Tax is circulating a petition to put a charter 
amendment on the November ballot to repeal the special property tax and to 
force city employees to pay a portion of their own retirement contributions.

 * To say I was furious when I read about the pension spiking plans by local 
cities and public agencies understates the point. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only imagine the anger of other taxpayers who don't have the luxury of 
inflating their salaries by an average of $79,000 in their last year, as 34 
employees in Huntington Beach did, so that their pensions can be heftier. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a public employee, working as a faculty member at Orange Coast College in 
Costa Mesa. I am concerned, of course, that people reading about such abuses 
will attribute these activities to everyone who works in the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
 I can assure you that such perks aren't available to any faculty members with 
whom I associate. The only way I can "spike" my less-than-adequate state 
teacher retirement is the old-fashioned way -- I save.

POLICE HAVE NO BUSINESS SELLING GUNS; * SANTA ANA IS RIGHT IN PROMISING TO STOP 
PUTTING SEIZED WEAPONS BACK IN CIRCULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana was right to promise to end the sale of guns seized by police. Costa 
Mesa halted the practice last year, and most cities in the county do not do it 
at all. Those that do sell guns would do well to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that in hard economic times, cities must scramble for revenue. In 
Santa Ana, sales of confiscated weapons to private dealers netted close to 
$50,000 in each of the last two years. But after the appalling death toll last 
year in the county's largest city, and the explosion of gang violence that so 
often includes drive-by shootings, it would be untenable for police to keep 
peddling firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana began selling confiscated weapons in the mid-1980s. Some were 
destroyed, including high-velocity assault-type weapons. But more than 70% were 
sold, most of them to a Modesto auction house that handles sales for numerous 
police departments in the state. Last month Santa Ana officials said that after 
their contract with the auction house expires in July, the city will destroy 
confiscated weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Paul M. Walters correctly cautioned that the halt will not stem 
crime in the city. Walters argued that the sales did not add to the supply of 
guns and noted that there is no limit on the number of firearms that can be 
made or sold, so long as they are legal. Still, such sales send the wrong 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Police departments have stepped up their efforts to get guns off the streets, 
lately assisted by private businesses willing to exchange tickets for sporting 
events or automobile services for firearms handed over to law enforcement 
officials. Police should not recycle these weapons back into their own or other 
cities. Even if there is an auctioneer as middleman, and a licensed gun dealer 
buying from the auction house, there is no guarantee that the guns will not 
wind up in the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Lt. Chuck Poe got it right in saying that, with a big 
push to have people trade in their guns, "it doesn't make any sense for us to 
sell them and put them back on the streets." The political message appeared to 
have reached Modesto, too, where the auction house said that once its contracts 
with police departments expire, it will stop auctioning off firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police said they are reviewing whether to continue consigning their 
guns to the Modesto auction house. They should stop, as should Orange and 
Huntington Beach. The money earned is not worth sending the wrong message and 
running the risk of guns on the street falling into the wrong hands.

TOP-NOTCH SCHOOLS NEED ACCESSIBILITY; * BRING BACK-TO-BASICS CAMPUSES TO 
CENTRAL SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana's "fundamental" public schools began in the 1970s as a 
"back-to-basics" response to perceived educational needs, and, many say, as a 
means of stemming white flight in an increasingly Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the schools provide strict dress and appearance codes and engage 
students and parents in contractual commitments aimed at advancing educational 
excellence and ensuring a nurturing home environment for achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualities of commitment that the district's two elementary and one 
intermediate schools have achieved are in step with calls across the country 
for increased parental involvement. Locally, they are the envy of many in the 
city and around the county. The results show why: The fundamental schools have 
far outpaced their conventional counterparts in the district in academic 
achievement. Reading, language and math scores on standardized tests are 
significantly higher at the fundamental schools than districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, some of the differences between neighborhood and fundamental 
schools have begun to dissolve as teaching strategies increasingly are used by 
different schools, and as fundamental schools have adopted new technology and 
accepted special state grants and special-education students. And innovations 
that began in fundamental schools, such as improving study habits, have been 
adopted in other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The achievement and special environment created at the fundamental schools 
have put them in line with advanced thinking for educational reform, and 
understandably, there are some in the district who wonder why those advantages 
are not available to more students. The location of the schools on the 
perimeters of the city has led critics to ask whether the fundamental schools, 
in effect, create a separate system of education for the district's more 
affluent students, who can get more easily to the fundamental schools, and 
generally are more aware of their offerings. District Supt. Rudy Castruita has 
acknowledged that while "everybody has access, not everybody has equal access." 
</P>
<P>
 The district now plans to open a second intermediate fundamental school in 
1996, on the north side of town. That school itself is the subject of 
controversy over the cost of purchasing the land. But a more basic concern is 
that it, like the other fundamental schools, is to be located outside the 
center of the city. And there are concerns about whether even opening that 
school will change the demographics in any significant way by serving more poor 
students. Since the district does not provide transportation to the fundamental 
schools, it remains difficult for low-income families living in central-city 
areas to get to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The district should see what it can do to make fundamental schools more 
accessible to the poor. It has 36 elementary and intermediate schools, but 42% 
of white students attend the three fundamental schools. It would make sense to 
try establishing a fundamental school in the central part of the city when the 
district builds new schools there, thereby making access easier for low-income 
students. The district says it is interested in providing "choice" for those 
who would like fundamental schools; it should do what it can to make good on 
that promise in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing one or more fundamental schools in the central part of the city 
would go a way toward sending a signal to the community. It would suggest that 
the same standards of parental involvement and voluntary commitment to 
excellence can be applied all across the district, and not just for the 
students who can afford transportation.

WORKING TO ENSURE THE SWALLOWS' RETURN; * LAUDABLE CAMPAIGN TO PRESERVE SAN 
JUAN CREEK AS A BIRD HABITAT IS A COOPERATIVE EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Juan Creek is far less celebrated as a returning site for swallows in San 
Juan Capistrano every March than the famous mission, located nearby in the 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everybody has heard of the crowds gathered in hopes of seeing the 
homecoming of a fabled bird. But, in fact, says Monique Rea of the South Coast 
Audubon chapter, "if you really want to see swallows, come to the creek." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of bird species actually live in a lush, four-acre area along the 
creek, but the swallows are there, too, and they really do come to the site. In 
a laudable campaign to preserve the area as a bird habitat, the Audubon chapter 
has been working there to restore the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 It is working with the city. And in a public-private partnership, a developer, 
TMC Development Inc., has agreed to do reed eradication in return for city 
approval for a 400-unit housing project. The Audubon Society is focusing on 
clearing work and overseeing rehabilitation of the area. In recent years, 
arundo nonax, a non-native reed that grows thickly, has engulfed the area and 
crowded out native plants, which are a food source for birds and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine spirit of those working to preserve the area from the perils of 
growth has been contagious; residents and students who live and go to school in 
the neighborhood have helped Audubon members with the creek rehabilitation. 
Students from a nearby elementary school even drew signs to mark the area where 
a recent planting was done. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a cooperative community effort to improve a wilderness area that 
is situated close to a developed neighborhood, and therefore accessible to 
residents and visitors. At a time of year when people in San Juan Capistrano 
and those just passing through naturally are thinking about the swallows, here 
is a meaningful program to preserve their habitat, and those of other birds, in 
the very same city.

SCHOOL LAND PURCHASE VIEWED BOTH AS IRRESPONSIBLE, PROPER PROCEDURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Minutes of a closed meeting, Santa Ana Unified School District board -- as I 
envision them:  
</P>
<P>
 Board member 1: Let's buy 11 acres from Bristol Market Place for $23 million. 
They're stuck with the land and can't use it for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member 2: Boy, that's almost $46 a square foot and we can buy land on 
the open market for $15 to $18 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member 3: That doesn't make any difference, this is free money from the 
state; we need money and the state gives it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member 4: Don't we have a responsibility to limit any land purchase to a 
price that reflects market value? 
</P>
<P>
 Board member 5: I agree with member number 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member 3: Don't you understand, this is free money from the state. If we 
get any public static, we won't have to take the heat; we can lay it off on the 
State Allocation Board. Besides, (Assemblyman Tom) Umberg got us that Waldron 
appraisal and we can always play dumb and claim reliance on the appraisal.

 THE VOTING: Members 1, 2 and 3 voted in favor; 4 and 5 voted against.

<P>
 * Indifference to spending taxpayer money or a conspiracy to make too many 
bucks, too fast? 
</P>
<P>
 Two recent Times articles on the Santa Ana Unified School District's "Space 
Saver" school imply that one of these must be true. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality the district is taking the correct actions. This state-imposed 
process puts the district "out of the loop" in determining the property value. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who dislike this process should complain to Sacramento instead of 
condemning the district. 
</P>
<P>
 That process requires a price estimate for the site. This estimate was given 
to the State Allocation Board (SAB) over four months ago. The SAB, including 
State Sens. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) and Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), 
and its executive director, Lyle Smoot, were aware of this estimate when they 
reserved $22.7 million on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 That this estimate is confidential is not surprising. The district has no 
desire to reveal its information when it enters into the final negotiations. 
This disclosure has seriously weakened the district's position in those 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 If school district attorneys profit, it is due to hours spent combatting 
disinformation spread by this project's opponents. It is sad that those who 
call for wise use of taxpayer dollars have forced them to be spent this way. 
</P>
<P>
 There is far more involved than the casual observer will notice. Those truly 
interested have come to understand the system by directing relevant and pointed 
questions to the board and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 I continue to be convinced that the district is acting in good faith and with 
great care.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON CRIME; PUBLIC-PRIVATE WAR AGAINST CRIMINALS 
MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE; THE SAME POWERFUL COALITION THAT BROUGHT ABOUT MEASURE M 
FOR ROADS COULD ALSO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. CAPRETZ, James T. Capretz is chairman of Orange-based Western 
Interstate Bancorp and an Irvine attorney. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren recently came to Orange County to espouse his 
strong message about fighting crime with more police, more jails and tougher 
laws. But he also stressed that the battle against crime is one in which each 
of us must take a part. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that Orange County's business, community and governmental leaders 
have the ability and determination to help wage this important battle. When 
Orange County faces problems, it has a tradition of marshaling its vast 
resources and finding solutions that work. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is the traffic dilemma that arose from our dramatic growth 
over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, traffic was far and above the most serious problem cited by 
residents. Traffic, according to the Annual Orange County Survey conducted by 
UCI Professor Mark Baldassare, was one of the main concerns voiced by county 
residents for several years in a row. In response, a powerful coalition of 
business, community and academic leaders came together to campaign for the 
adoption of Measure M. The result of that effort has been dramatic -- our roads 
and freeways are being improved everywhere we look. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, according to Baldassare's 1993 survey, traffic is no longer one 
of the major concerns; it is now fourth on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Good news! But now the county appears to be confronting an even bigger problem 
-- the specter of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime obviously is not new to Orange County, but the number and severity of 
the crimes are reportedly getting worse, particularly with the current harsh 
economic times. At least Orange County residents think so. Baldassare's survey 
shows that 29% of county residents believe crime is the most important public 
policy issue we face, followed by jobs and the economy, and then immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disturbing is the fact that 47% of the respondents said they felt 
unsafe in their own neighborhoods. A surprising 28% said they or members of 
their family had been victims of a crime in the past year. This is troubling 
information, but the news gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
 We all know from President Clinton's State of the Union address that the fight 
against crime is also a national priority of the Administration. Unfortunately, 
as part of that battle, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently named 
Orange County among the top 10 counties with the biggest problem of escalating 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a Justice Department study which showed that the top high-crime areas 
in the United States accounted for 23% of the nation's felonies, Secretary 
Bentsen has directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to conduct a 
study tracking the sale of firearms in Orange County, and the nation's other 
designated high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 While the study indicated that the total number of crimes in Orange County per 
100,000 population actually fell from 1982 to 1992, violent crimes increased 
over the same period by more than 60%. Underscoring how pervasive and serious 
the nature of crime in our county has become, on Jan. 24 a murder was reported 
in the upscale and seemingly secure community of Turtle Rock in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, a high-crime area! Detroit, yes. Washington, yes. But Orange 
County? 
</P>
<P>
 So here we are; we have the proverbial tiger by the tail and the rest of the 
world knows it. A steady and insidious rise in all types of violent and 
white-collar crime threatens the core of the county's self-composure. The 
realization that the safety of our communities has been compromised to such an 
extent is further damaging to our cherished life- and work-styles. The largest 
economic losses from crime are in productivity and lost work. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents and businesses located here because they placed a high premium 
on the safety of our communities and the favorable environment for building 
their futures. For instance, some companies locate in Santa Ana to take 
advantage of its favorable tax enterprise zone. Pacific Rim companies move to 
places such as the Irvine Spectrum because they are attracted by the security 
and lifestyle factors, as are the so-called "knowledge industry" firms involved 
in electronics and medical technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's tourism industry, powered by such future undertakings as Westcot 
and the expansion of Knott's Berry Farm, is on the verge of the first stages of 
recovery, the recent earthquake notwithstanding. And there are the big 
investment institutions actively seeking opportunities within the county's 
cash-starved real estate industry. The long-awaited turnaround of our economy 
could also be energized by new opportunities that will be available to us 
through NAFTA. These are seen as driving forces behind the county's economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But rising crime threatens to undermine the general economic recovery, and 
efforts are being made locally by civic and political leaders, such as 
Partnership 2010 and the Economic Development Consortium, to quickly pull the 
county out of the recession. Our most valuable assets -- our quality of life 
and the dynamic nature of our business and industry -- are essential to our 
continuing strength and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the fact is that the county is no longer the oasis of blissful 
suburban tranquillity that it once was, immune to the urban blight of drugs and 
escalating gang warfare. Adjusting our thinking and reacting quickly to control 
the growing problem are essential to preserving our quality of life, the safety 
of our communities and our future prosperity.  
</P>
<P>
 Quite simply, the anticipated rebound this year of the county's economy could 
very well be undermined by the crime issue, especially if it appears to be 
getting worse. We cannot afford to let this happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Our valued economic and community assets must be protected, and a systematic 
game plan for addressing crime must be implemented with the support of local 
residents, public officials, religious leaders and business and academia. It is 
the Measure M scenario with a passion because the stakes are much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 While government has no more important role than ensuring the public safety, 
law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system cannot be expected to 
fight the battles by themselves. Even if we were not in an era of restructured 
public budgets, they do not have the resources to do it alone. The county's 
leadership from both the private and public sectors must coalesce to confront 
this social tumor head-on to bring it into remission. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, business and professional leaders, working with other county 
leadership, need to focus on the problem, understand its dynamics to get at the 
roots, propose measures and implement those measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an action will send a powerful message to those who want to work and live 
here that Orange County is the place to be in the 21st Century, and that its 
leaders are willing to take decisive action to solve its problems in a direct 
and effective manner. 
</P>
<P>
 A call to leadership is needed and the time is now. Our foundation -- the 
rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- are only meaningful if 
the social order is maintained through secure communities. Business leaders 
must get involved and offer their solutions to stem the tide of crime and make 
our county safe.

RACISM CROPS UP IN UNLIKELY PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Is there no place safe from racist remarks? Even here in this nice quiet 
community, described by some as intellectual, racism lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Right after I moved here last spring I saw a horrible racist remark on the 
front of the building that now houses BJ's pizzeria, right there on beautiful 
Main Street! And last weekend I was faced with just how racist people are.I met 
a woman who reportedly is a caring individual, giving to the community, someone 
respected within the community. During the course of a conversation she said 
(speaking about her black church members), "They are not a book-reading group." 
Now perhaps my interpretation of this remark could be wrong -- perhaps she was 
referring to a small group of people, and not all blacks. But how could she 
make such an authoritive statement about a group whom I'm quite certain she 
doesn't know, individually or intimately. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the context or intent (she tried to "explain" her statement), it 
was like a slap in the face. You see, she had no idea she was talking to a 
black woman. Why must I, just because I look white, be subjected to your racist 
remarks? It behooves all of us to think before we speak. You never know who 
you'll hurt or anger! 
</P>
<P>
 One last thought, why can't people who do make racist remarks simply say "I'm 
sorry" when confronted with it? Why must they always tell you about all their 
black friends and all the wonderful things they do in the community and how 
they love Africa? Give me a break!

 * We understand the need for pile drivers in the process of building and 
expanding our freeways, but is it absolutely necessary to begin the infernal 
pounding before 7 a.m. every morning? As a resident of the Saddleback Mobile 
Home Park at Main and Williams streets, and on behalf of several thousand 
elderly folks living within a few hundred yards of the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa 
freeways interchange, I strongly protest this early disturbing noise. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now over two years that we taxpayers -- who are financing this work -- 
have had to put up with this problem.Wouldn't you think that they could at 
least wait until 8 a.m. to begin their deafening bang, bang, bang, bang?  
</P>
<P>
 Time after time we have contacted Caltran's public relations department to 
protest this early, excessive, disturbing racket. 
</P>
<P>
 All we get in return is that the contractors are "within the law" and that's 
that! Most cities have rules and regulations that confine unreasonable noise to 
reasonable hours, but not Tustin.

RESTAURANT'S NUDES HAD A GOOD SIDE

<P>
 * Regarding the Ritz restaurant removing the nudes ("Nudes No Longer Dress 
Bar," March 8): 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a regular at the Ritz and lunch with a group of women who love those nude 
paintings.They make us feel like we can eat as much as we like and still look 
good (thanks to the Rubenesque style!). 
</P>
<P>
 Don't our opinions count as much as these so-called businesswomen? I say that 
any woman who can't close a deal because of a painting is not a real 
businesswoman. Let them eat at the Mariners Elementary School cafeteria with 
the little girls.

HONOREE AIDS NOT JUST LATINO CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was pleased to see recognition given to Frederick Aguirre in the article 
"Writer, Lawyer Make It to Hall of Fame" (Jan. 20). Mr. Aguirre has made 
significant contributions to the community and deserves to be honored by 
Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the article focused primarily on Mr. Aguirre's activities within the 
Latino community. Mr. Aguirre has made significant contributions and been 
involved in numerous civic programs and projects of a more general nature and 
not limited in focus to a singular community. 
</P>
<P>
 I point this out to hopefully foster awareness among the public that persons 
of Latino descent make contributions to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 He serves as a role model for the Latino community, that is true. But he also 
demonstrates that someone of Latino descent or birth can make a difference in 
the Anglo community. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentioning only his ethnic achievements serves, unwittingly of course, to 
foster perceptions that Latinos should only be appointed to ethnic programs, 
committees and boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Aguirre has demonstrated that this need not be the case and in fact it is 
not the case. MICHELLE A. REINGLASS

FULLERTON RECALL DRIVE IS JUSTIFIABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Charles and Peg Lindahl's letter ("Fullerton Recall Efforts," 
Feb. 20): These writers want "to hear from the many Fullerton citizens who 
stand behind their elected city (government) members who are being threatened 
with recall for voting for a 2% utility tax." They may be disappointed in the 
response they receive, because an overwhelming majority of the electorate want 
these officials ousted for ignoring the will of the people.These officials were 
well warned prior to imposing the tax. Hundreds of citizens attended two 
council meetings, which lasted into the wee hours of the morning, and dozens 
spoke against the tax and asked that it be placed on the ballot. We just 
couldn't get through to them, but now we can. 
</P>
<P>
 I, personally, canvassed door-to-door around my neighborhood with recall 
petitions, and these are the dramatic results. For recall of each of the 
officials: 
</P>
<P>
 * Yes -- 423 (85%) 
</P>
<P>
 * No -- 73 (15%) 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious, is it not, that the council is out of touch when they vote for 
a tax that 85% of the people do not want. The writers then compare the 2% tax 
(soon to become 3%, and who knows how much higher) with that of other cities 
and say it "is not out of line." For goodness' sake, how can the people get the 
message across that any additional tax is completely unacceptable? Reduction in 
taxes is the way to go.

NO RACISM LURKS BEHIND MOVE TO CONTROL STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: Control of local city streets ("Bill Would Let Cities Ban Street 
Vending," Feb. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim is entitled to control the use of its city streets through 
ordinance regulation. The bill proposed by state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden 
Grove) will return such control to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city previously found that the actions of street vendors were 
significantly detrimental to the quiet enjoyment of their community by Anaheim 
residents. The recent misguided appeals court decision negated this local 
control action by the Anaheim City Council and required correction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed improper by Javier Barajas to label the efforts of Hurtt, to 
maintain local control of a local problem, as a racist action. The action by 
the City Council was not racist, but based on control of a problem that had 
adversely impacted many Anaheim residents (who) have been disturbed by the 
noise, trash and unsanitary conditions attendant to these vendor trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Labeling anyone a racist because they have an honest difference of opinion on 
the subject of vendor trucks avoids the issue that these trucks have created 
significant neighborhood problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The local control of local streets should be a rightful function of the 
Anaheim City Council. This is not a racist position.

</P>
<P>
 * Anaheim street vendor Javier Barajas' cry of racism is so predictable. Why 
is it that anything a member of a minority community doesn't like is 
automatically labeled racism? 
</P>
<P>
 Calling someone who disagrees with you a racist is a cheap shot, a way to kill 
debate when you can't come up with a logical argument. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of state Sen. Hurtt's bill is to give logical municipalities 
control over the sales of goods on their own streets and to allow citizens to 
have safe, peaceful residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had enough of these labels that kill debate. If Mr. Barajas thinks he 
speaks for everyone of Latino descent, he is seriously mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 How long before the American people realize what is happening? How long before 
we all stop cowering when attacked like this?

VOICES: TOO MANY PATIENTS; HIGH RATE OF PREMATURE BLACK BIRTHS FILLS INFANT 
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN E. KLEIN, Dr. Xylina Bean is a neonatologist and director of the Rosa 
Parks Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center. 
Bean recently presided over the dedication of the neonatal unit by Parks, the 
81-year-old seamstress whose refusal to give up her bus seat to a white rider 
in 1955 sparked the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott, which in turn propelled the 
civil rights movement. Bean has worked at the medical center since her 
residency there in 1973. She was interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a tremendous need in the South-Central Los Angeles community for 
critical care for premature and very ill babies. We've always had higher rates 
of infant mortality and prematurity in South-Central relative to the county and 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, we averaged over 20 patients at our facility, which was 
licensed for only 10 beds. In 1975, we stopped taking transfers into our unit, 
and patients who delivered premature or sick babies in the area had to go to 
Long Beach Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried for many years to get the unit licensed for more beds, but we could 
not get licensed in our existing space. That's why we built the new unit. It 
was all built by county employees -- we didn't contract out to a fancy firm -- 
and as a consequence, it took a year and a half to build it. 
</P>
<P>
 The new unit opened in June, 1993, licensed for 42 beds, which we're phasing 
in. We're using 24 beds now. We have to get the county to allocate the 
appropriate resources, primarily funds for staffing, so we can use all the 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 We never have problems getting patients. In 1975, the rate of women who were 
delivering babies here who had had no prenatal care was about 10%, a little 
higher than the rate of 8% for the country as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as access to prenatal care became more difficult and the drug epidemic 
hit, we started to get rates of 30% of patients who had not had any prenatal 
visits with a doctor. In the last five years, Gov. Pete Wilson has made a 
commitment to providing prenatal care to the underserved population, and the 
waits at clinics for prenatal visits have dropped from two to three months down 
to one to two weeks for an initial appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 That has made a difference. We have seen the rate of patients with no prenatal 
care fall to about 18% recently, which is a dramatic decrease but still more 
than twice the rate of the country as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a continuing problem with infant mortality rates for African American 
women being much higher than they should be and with African Americans 
delivering three times more premature babies than would be normal for their 
population. For instance, about 12% of our deliveries are to black women, but 
black babies make up about 50% of our neonatal unit patients. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been all kinds of studies to try to determine why this is. It's a 
fundamental kind of thing, with drugs, lack of prenatal care and just the 
problems that go along with being black in this country all contributing 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that intervention -- early intervention -- works. Giving special 
attention and special care to this population will decrease the rates of infant 
mortality, but it's hard to get the extra resources allocated for extra 
programs. It's very frustrating, because we spend so much time and money on 
these very sick babies when, if their mothers had gotten basic care early on, 
they would not be born premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, we work so hard to save these babies, then many of them are released and 
go to homes that are unequipped to care for their special needs and they are 
dead two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is a constant thing in our unit, and it's very hard for the nursery 
staff to cope with that. No matter how hard we try to save some babies, they 
still die on us. We try to tell our people that they have to do the best they 
possibly can and make their contribution matter.

VOICES: SPEAKING UP FOR THE FUTURE; LEARNING MANDARIN, CANTONESE AND VIETNAMESE 
WILL HELP ASIAN AMERICAN CHILDREN GET JOBS AS ADULTS, A TEACHER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tommy Li, Attendance has dropped at the Vietnamese-Chinese School in Lincoln 
Heights in recent years, and Holly Tran, a 23-year-old volunteer teacher, is 
determined to reverse the trend. Tran says the school, which caters to ethnic 
Chinese from Vietnam, is more important than ever because the Chinese 
population has doubled in the surrounding area since the school was founded in 
1979. Students attend public school during the week and the Vietnamese-Chinese 
School on Saturdays and Sundays. Tran, herself an immigrant from Vietnam, 
graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1992 and is in her second year of the 
teaching credential program at Cal State Los Angeles. She was interviewed by 
Tommy Li. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot has changed at the Vietnamese-Chinese School since I was a student here 
more than a decade ago. I liked learning Chinese, its language and its culture. 
At that time, I guess, the kids at the school had barely immigrated over here 
or had been here just for a few years, so they were still into their Chinese 
backgrounds. The kids were really interested in studying Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a lot of them don't seem motivated. They just sit there. They're only here 
because their parents wanted them to be able to understand the Chinese culture 
and the language. 
</P>
<P>
 We also used to have a large number of students -- 200 to 300. It's getting 
less and less to only more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
 After noticing these dramatic changes, I was disappointed. So when I heard 
that they needed someone to teach the first-grade-level class, I was interested 
and asked them if I could teach. I volunteered because I just wanted to help 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though we're primarily teaching Mandarin, we do speak Cantonese to the 
kids, too, and Vietnamese. I tell the children, you might not think it's 
important right now because you're not working -- you're a student. But once 
you start working, you'll find out that even though a lot of people are 
unemployed, you'll be able to get a job because you speak more than one 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 In teaching, I use some of the techniques I learned from college and from my 
experience in working as a teacher's aide in an American school. 
</P>
<P>
 If students behave well, I give them rewards. I give them coupons made out of 
index cards. I just cut them in half and stamp my signature on it, accompanied 
with the phrase "Keep up the good work!" 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of a school semester, students receive prizes for collecting the 
most coupons. What I did was give everyone a chance to get a gift even though 
they may not be the top students. 
</P>
<P>
 I give them something they can use for school. I have bought pencils, erasers, 
pencil sharpeners and folders. Students are really interested. They like 
getting something. It's a little motivation thing. Now they're staying in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 But rewards aren't the only things that keep students focused. Those who don't 
behave need to learn discipline as well. 
</P>
<P>
 True, some of them come to Chinese school without any respect for their 
instructors and without any interest in their own culture. They are more into 
rap and all those types of music. They try to act cool. To them, it's cool to 
be rebellious. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think there's hope. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Chinese school, one important aspect for students to learn is to respect 
teachers and their classmates. Every time when we come into class, when I say, 
"It's time for class" in Chinese, everybody has to stand up and afterward they 
have to bow to me to show their respect. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's one student who is always running around, usually if I give him 
some sort of a punishment he will behave all day. Whenever someone in the class 
gets out of hand, I would just raise my hand and everybody would raise their 
hand and be very quiet. They know that once I do that, if they're not quiet, I 
would take their coupons away or I would make them stay for recess or after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm going to stay here until there's no more students left, or as long as they 
will have me. I like teaching.

THE TROUBLES OF DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found it absurd that Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke sees legislation as 
the only alternative to the problems of day laborers loitering and soliciting 
work in Ladera Heights ("Toil and Trouble," Feb. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest, most cost-effective way to please both residents and day 
laborers is to create an agency similar to a temporary agency.The money to 
start this up would have to come from the state and the day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 The day laborers could check in at the agency to see if there is any work. 
Some day laborers would handle phones, coordinating workers with jobs, and 
compiling work history records for the employees -- many of whom have worked 
years but have no resumes. A solid work record is essential for a good-paying, 
enduring job, which is all that most day laborers are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus in forming an agency would be the collection of income taxes, 
which most day laborers do not pay.

Americans. These are the men and women who work for minimum wages to provide 
the bread and butter for their families.

Crenshaw evenly Thursday at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Jackrabbits started slowly and could not keep up with the 
Cougars, losing 66-59 in the Southern California Regional Division I 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory set up a rematch between defending State Division I champion 
Cougars and top-seeded Santa Ana Mater Dei, which was played Saturday at the 
Anaheim Arena. The Cougars beat Mater Dei, 63-61, last season in the Southern 
California Regional Finals on Kristaan Johnson's last-second shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw used its 1-2-2 zone press to force 16 first-half turnovers, including 
10 in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie McFerren, a 6-foot-6 guard, scored 10 of his 18 points in the first 
quarter as the Cougars rushed to an 18-8 lead. Tremaine Fowlkes had 26 points 
and nine rebounds, and Johnson had 15 points. The "Big Three" accounted for all 
34 of the Cougars' first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had too many turnovers," Long Beach Poly Coach Ron Palmer said. "I thought 
the key to the game was the first five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press bothered us early on," Palmer said. "They're so quick. Even their 
big guys run the floor well. We had trouble getting the ball inbounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 34-27 at halftime, Long Beach Poly pulled to within three on Chris 
Hardy's two free throws and Damion Dawson's three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Cougars went on a 13-3 run to take a 47-34 lead late in the third 
quarter and were never threatened again. Fowlkes, a 6-6 1/2 forward, scored 
eight of the points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who have been accused of running up the score, briefly ran a 
four-corner stall in the fourth quarter with a 16-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't hitting our shots like we normally do," Crenshaw Coach Willie West 
said. "There was no need to shoot the ball outside so I decided to run some 
time off the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars made 27 of 65 shots from the field (41.5%) and five of 12 from the 
free throw line (41.6%). Long Beach Poly was 20 of 51 (39.2%) and eight of 17 
(47%).

SOCCER; BELMONT DEFEATS NO. 1 BELL FOR CITY CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When anyone used to mention City Section soccer, Bell High School came to 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But that changed last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont is the name for City soccer now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (10-1-2) toppled the seemingly unbeatable Eagles, 1-0, at Van 
Nuys' Birmingham High on March 5 to win the City Section championship for the 
second time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Eagles (12-1-1) were the third undefeated team to fall in as 
many games to Belmont. Second-seed San Pedro (11-1-1) lost its sole match in 
the semifinals, 2-1, and No. 3 Garfield (8-1-3) was squashed, 4-0, in the 
quarterfinals.  
</P>
<P>
 With Jose Salmeron's 14th goal of the season, a gorgeous half-scissors kick in 
the 60th minute, the Sentinels avenged last year's first-round playoff loss to 
the Eagles' wild-card squad. Salmeron's goal was only the 10th given up by Bell 
all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's scoring trio -- Oswaldo Williams, Maynor Alvarez and Jorge Iberri -- 
were held scoreless by the Sentinel defense, led by Octavio Calvillo, for the 
first time since it tied Garfield, 0-0, at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how the seniors feel," said Waldir Guerra, the Eagles assistant coach 
and a former Eagles player who faced Belmont when it won its first City 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reminder of the 1986 match." In that game, the last time the two 
teams met in the finals, the Sentinels garnered their first City title. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens picked up its third Southern Section Division III title, 
defeating Burbank Burroughs, 3-1, on March 5 at Cerritos Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
 The game came down to two coaches' strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs midfielder and leading scorer Roberto Perez, an All-America pick by 
the National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America, was expected to be double-teamed. 
Indians Coach Mike Kodama figured it would open up the field for his other 
scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Orlando Brenes, who has guided the Lancers to 12 league titles in 14 
seasons, didn't fall for the decoy: "I wasn't going to get into that ploy, so I 
matched (Perez) with Hernan Acosta and he did his job." 
</P>
<P>
 A job well done. Perez had only one shot on goal in the entire match. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Castillo, an Almont League MVP, was a "key in defending their other big 
gun, Eddie Melgar," Brenes said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half, Lancer Gustavo Garita scored in the 47th minute 
on a back pass by Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
 About three minutes later, Garita set up Jaime Olivares to make it 2-0. After 
the Indians scored, defender Roberto Arredondo converted a penalty kick to seal 
the win.

 Bell's Ramses Ochoa finished 12th in the 145-pound division of the State High 
School Wrestling Championships on March 4-5 at the University of the Pacific in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to South Hills' Steve Duran, 7-4, in his first match, Ochoa beat 
Don Meceri of San Diego Valhalla High, 9-6, Edgar Esquivel of Valejo, 6-2, and 
Chris Jaime of Santa Ana El Modena, 9-4. Ochoa lost to Tim Bonebright of 
Thousand Oaks, 9-4, in his only match on March 5. Track 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Los Angeles men's track team was no match for UCLA, the 
eight-time NCAA champion, in a quadrangular meet with UC Santa Barbara and Cal 
State Long Beach in Westwood on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which has lost only one dual meet in the last decade, recorded victories 
in 14 of 18 events to win with 106.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. finished second with 25 points followed by Santa Barbara and 
Long Beach with 18.5 and 17.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. managed to score in all the sprints, including a victory by 
Ruben Benitez in the 400 (48.22). 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagle 400 relay team of Jason Gibbs, John Hensley, Benitez and 
Keadrick Washington and the 1,600 relay team of Benitez, Sharpe, Gibbs and 
Washington finished second to the Bruins with times of 42.09 and 3:18.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington also won the 400 intermediate hurdles in 53.10 and placed second in 
the 110 high hurdles in 14.71. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hurtado (167 feet) and Robert Clark (158-2) finished second and third in 
the hammer. Hurtado and Clark were also second in the shotput and discus at 
48-2 1/2 and 160-8. The Golden Eagles also received a third-place finish from 
Oscar Urizar in the 3,000 (8:41.24). 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Hill, the defending Division II champion in the shotput, won her 
specialty with a heave of 48-5 1/4 and Lisa Henderson won the javelin with a 
throw of 127-1 to pace Cal State L.A. to second in the women's competition with 
36 points behind UCLA's 98. KIRBY LEE

 For the second consecutive season, Crenshaw High girls' basketball team lost 
in the preliminary rounds of the CIF State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi McKinney had 32 points and 10 rebounds to lead Peninsula to a 73-55 
victory Tuesday over the Cougars in the first round of the Southern Regionals 
at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Cougars were beaten by Ventura Buena, 60-52, in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, coming off a double-overtime victory in the City Section 4-A 
Division finals, fell behind 27-10 in the first quarter and never really 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristi Lattin had 22 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Cougars, who finished 
the season at 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Crenshaw's troubles began in the first quarter. The Cougars had seven 
turnovers and made only nine of 26 shots. Meanwhile, McKinney scored 15 of her 
points in the first quarter, making seven of nine shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers went on a 9-2 run to widen the margin to 24 points and led 45-23 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 49-26, the Cougars scored 13 unanswered points to close the gap to 
10, with Lattin scoring nine points during the spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crenshaw could get no closer the rest of the way.SEAN WATERS

ST. PAUL STEAMROLLERED BY VERBUM DEI, 103-76 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Verbum Dei Eagles waltzed their way into the Southern Regional Division IV 
championship game by keeping their playoff opponents on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Kearney's vaunted full-court press, a staple in Verbum Dei's 
successful regular season, continues to pay dividends in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei, the Southern Section Division IV champions, forced 29 turnovers 
Thursday in a 103-76 blowout over the St. Paul Swordsmen of Santa Fe Springs in 
a Division IV semifinal game at Compton College. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys took it to 'em," said Kearney. "The press is what we have been doing 
all year. It has been good enough so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei's trapping defense worked so well -- St. Paul committed 25 
turnovers during the first three quarters -- that Kearney was able to pull his 
starting five for most of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kearney: "There is still room for improvement on defense, but when our 
press is working it eventually gets to people." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul stayed close early in the game by breaking the press and finding 
spot-up shooters to hit three-point shots. The Swordsmen's last four baskets of 
the first quarter were all three-pointers -- the last of which by Sergio Ramos 
cut the Eagles' lead to 19-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Three-pointers) kept us in the game in the first quarter but when we started 
missing, Verbum Dei had three-on-one fast-breaks," St. Paul assistant coach 
Randy Castilla said. "Verbum Dei's press was really intense ... they were 
unstoppable on the open floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Jamaal Cobbs benefited most, gathering six steals to score 16 of 
his game-high 24 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Andre Miller, who chipped in 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting from the 
floor, scored 10 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul forward Jason Reynolds scored 14 points and pulled down nine rebounds 
for the Swordsmen.

LAGUNA HILLS TIES FOR 2ND IN ACADEMIC QUIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their team includes a baseball pitcher, a volleyball player, a few basketball 
hotshots, a wrestler and an offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Laguna Hills High School academic decathlon team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, aren't these the kids who are supposed to read all day and do calculus 
in their sleep? Team member Jamie Miller -- known as "Piggy" to his soccer 
teammates -- thinks otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not some nerds," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake about it, though. The Laguna Hills team wins and wins often. 
Team members take their decathlons very seriously, studying until the last 
minute with flash cards and skipping social activities that draw other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, after months of preparation, they tied for second place in the Super 
Quiz portion of the California Academic Decathlon in Stockton, a game 
show-style contest held in front of rows of cheering parents and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills' squad tied with Sacramento County's Bella Vista High School at 
the Super Quiz, which was held at the University of the Pacific's basketball 
arena. It was the last event of the two-day competition, and the only event 
open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft High School of Woodland Hills and West High School of Torrance tied for 
first place, scoring 5,400 points out of a possible 6,000. Laguna Hills, 
representing Orange County, scored 4,900. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz accounts for only 10% of the competition's total points, so 
coaches were optimistic the Laguna Hills team may still win the overall title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the hunt," said Kathy Lane, who coaches the Laguna Hills Hawks 
with fellow English teacher Roger Gunderson. The event's organizers will 
announce winners of individual and team medals today.  
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills team began the competition against 378 students from 42 other 
teams Friday. After nervously cramming all week, contestants took exams in six 
areas: mathematics, science, social science, economics, languages and 
literature, and fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants were quizzed on this year's topic, "The Documents of Freedom," 19 
historical texts ranging from the Mayflower Compact to the 1978 Camp David 
Accord between Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Each academic decathlon team is divided evenly among students with A, B and C 
grade-point averages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills team members are Miller, Genevieve Go, Alex Fung, Romy 
Christensen, Bryan Cotta, Megan Ferrell, Terry James, Loren Colin and Renn 
Amstead. All are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a clear sky and hot sun outside the pavilion before the Super Quiz on 
Saturday, team members said they felt relieved to be so close to the end of a 
competition that they have anticipated since last summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just want it to be over!" Cotta said. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the Laguna Hills team beat 47 other squads to win the Orange 
County competition and advance to the state contest in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft High, an academic powerhouse that in 1993 won the statewide crown and 
took second place in the national contest, is the favorite to win here. Taft 
has won its district title four times and has gone undefeated in its three 
trips to the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills team took the state title in 1990 and 1991. The school has 
represented Orange County in the state competition every year for the past six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills High Assistant Principal Kary Bemoll said competition is fierce 
just to land a spot on the school's decathlon team. "There are a lot of kids 
that try out and don't make it," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Fung, for one, tried out annually since his freshman year before making the 
team this year, Bemoll said.  
</P>
<P>
 The California Academic Decathlon originated 14 years ago as an outgrowth of 
an Orange County competition. Former Orange County Supt. of Schools Robert 
Peterson created the contest in the 1970s as a way to encourage students to 
study a variety of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is sponsored by a nonprofit organization funded by corporate 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 James, a stocky senior, plays offensive tackle for the varsity football team. 
Last December, he had to compete in a California Interscholastic Federation 
conference playoff game the night before the county academic decathlon 
championships -- and still pulled through on his tests, his coaches said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amstead is on the wrestling team, and Christensen participates in basketball, 
softball and volleyball. Miller, who pitches for the baseball team, said he 
studies to the sounds of "punk music." 
</P>
<P>
 Team captain Ferrell wields an intimidating decathlon pedigree. Her older 
brother, Jeff, a member of Laguna Hills' team the last time the school carried 
home the state title, notched the highest individual score in last year's state 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson called Ferrell "a selfless leader" who helped other teammates 
improve their scores. 
</P>
<P>
 As quickly as they sat down Friday night for dinner, the coaches and the team 
rose to rush back to the Holiday Inn where they were staying to prepare again 
for the next day's competition. While other teams attended an ice-cream social 
that night to meet and exchange gifts, the Hawks practiced speeches and studied 
flash cards to prepare for the Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to win," coach Lane explained. Laguna Hills' hard-nosed rival to the 
north, Taft, also skipped the party.  
</P>
<P>
 Hawk team members said they take winning very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 They began putting together study packets last summer for the rest of the 
team, Colin said, and they met after school and on weekends for about 20 hours 
a week before the competition.  
</P>
<P>
 Ferrell's parents hosted the students at their home for numerous weekend and 
after-school study sessions. They said they were pleased with the team's 
performance Saturday and with the competition's importance to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have my kids go through four years of (the Orange County Academic 
Decathlon) than go to class," said Todd Ferrell, Megan's father. Questions From 
State Decathlon 
</P>

TEARFUL FAREWELL TO A FRIEND; FUNERAL: POPULAR PREP ATHLETE KILLED IN SUDDEN 
KNIFE ATTACK IS BURIED IN TRADITIONAL BUDDHIST CEREMONY ATTENDED BY HUNDREDS OF 
CLASSMATES.

 About 600 people, most of them classmates, attended a traditional Buddhist 
funeral Saturday for Moukda Chounlamany, a popular high school football star 
who was stabbed to death Tuesday in a sudden attack on a Garden Grove street. 
Dressed in customary orange robes that hung off one shoulder, four monks and 
six mourners -- all with shaved heads -- began the ceremony at Mount Olive 
Mortuary and Memorial Park with a 15-minute rhythmic chant designed to ease 
Moukda's transition to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old Stanton student was eulogized in Lao, his native tongue, as 
the mourners listened quietly, some with their hands clasped together in a 
gesture of prayer. Others bowed their heads as they wept. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so popular and he got along with everybody," said Eddie Duran, a 
19-year-old senior and Chounlamany's best friend for the past four years. The 
two became friends after Chounlamany introduced himself as they waited in line 
for physical examinations needed to play freshman football. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just patted me on the back and introduced himself. He invited me over to 
have dinner with his family that night," Duran said. "After some time, we 
became like brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Chounlamany's Rancho Alamitos High School football teammates sat 
motionless during the 90-minute ceremony, gazing toward the open casket 
containing the body of the 5-foot-6-inch, 150-pound dynamo who had led them to 
a sectional championship last December. 
</P>
<P>
 After relatives, classmates, teachers and friends viewed Chounlamany for the 
last time, covering him with red and pink roses, a rope measuring about half 
the distance of a football field was tied to the closed casket. 
</P>
<P>
 It was held taut by the monks, who stood outside the church. Chounlamany's 
family and friends then grasped the rope and pulled the casket outside, a 
Buddhist tradition that symbolizes the beginning of the dead youth's journey to 
heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, as a woman showered mourners with foil-wrapped coins -- a good luck 
gesture -- the prevailing question was "How could this happen to such a nice 
kid?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours before he was to become the victim of the sudden assault, 
Chounlamany learned that he and Duran had just been hired for part-time jobs as 
telemarketers by a Costa Mesa mortgage company, Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, they went to a local restaurant to celebrate. They talked about 
their futures. They discussed how they might attend a local community college 
and room together. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old Gregory Allen Callison has been charged with murder in 
connection with Chounlamany's death. The youth, who turned himself in to police 
hours after the 9 p.m. attack, will be tried as a juvenile. He is being held in 
Orange County Juvenile Hall and is scheduled to appear in Juvenile Court on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany's brother, Tootoo, has said the attack stemmed from a 
misunderstanding over a dune buggy that Callison may have believed Tootoo was 
trying to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Moukda Chounlamany's brother-in-law, Duong Nguyen, was one of about half a 
dozen mourners younger than Chounlamany who shaved their heads as a sign of 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always hyper and had his own ways of doing things. But he would ask me 
for advice sometimes," Nguyen said. "He liked to do impersonations. He was 
really good at doing Jean-Claude Van Damme." 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany's sister, Sithara, a 16-year-old junior, sat teary-eyed in the 
back seat of Nguyen's car after the funeral and attempted to lighten things up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved to yell at me," she said in a soft voice, with a small smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were always together," Duran remembered. "I stayed at his house every 
weekend. He was a very trustworthy person, always a leader."

AFTER SHOOTING SISTER-IN-LAW, WIFE'S LOVER, MAN KILLS SELF; DEATHS: THE 
31-YEAR-OLD GUNMAN SMASHED INTO HIS ESTRANGED SPOUSE'S FULLERTON APARTMENT 
THROUGH A WINDOW. SHE AND THEIR CHILD, HOME AT THE TIME, WERE NOT INJURED.

 A 31-year-old man broke into his estranged wife's apartment late Friday night, 
shot his sister-in-law to death and critically wounded his wife's boyfriend 
before killing himself, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, identified as Carlos Jose Delgado, smashed through a living room 
window at 11:17 p.m. into the apartment in the 1800 block of East Wilshire 
Avenue, said police Sgt. Steve Matson. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, Delgado shot his sister-in-law, Ana Arauz Velasquez, 38, several 
times in the torso, police said. She died at the scene. Also shot several times 
in the chest was 23-year-old Juan Jose Ceballos of Fullerton, who is in 
extremely critical condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado's estranged wife, Gioconda Reyes, 30, and their 7-year-old daughter 
were inside the apartment at the time but were not injured. Police said they do 
not know whom the gunman intended to shoot or what his motivation was. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes and Ceballos were watching television in the living room, police said, 
when Delgado broke through a window of the second-story apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just walking in and saw him break the glass out (and) climb into the 
window. Then I heard gunshots," said neighbor Monda Morgan. "I hit the lights, 
got down on the floor, then called 911. I was shaking so badly I couldn't talk. 
I thought he had killed the entire family." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor David Benson, 30, drove up just seconds after the shootings and was 
parking his car when he said he saw the gunman run past him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked panicked," Benson said. "He had something in his hand, but I 
thought it was keys. I just went inside and didn't know anything was wrong 
until I heard sirens." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that after the shootings, Delgado, who cut himself as he was 
breaking through the apartment window, left a trail of blood as he ran from the 
complex. He crossed nearby Chapman Avenue, and ran into an alley where he shot 
himself in the head with a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighbors said there had not been any previous problems at the 
one-bedroom apartment shared by Reyes, Velasquez and the child. Neighbors at 
the small, 18-unit apartment complex said Ceballos stayed at the apartment 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan tried to comfort Reyes after the shooting but said the woman was 
inconsolable. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was screaming," Morgan said. "She was very, very upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, who regularly baby-sits Reyes' daughter, said the couple had been 
separated for many years. The neighbor said she was under the impression that 
the family had been "hiding" from Delgado since moving into the complex last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little girl said she didn't visit her father because he gets mean," 
Morgan said. "I don't think he knew where they lived. I feel so sorry for the 
little girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said her 8-year-old daughter and Reyes' daughter were playmates and 
that her daughter had been in the apartment where the shooting occurred only 
hours before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an awful experience," said a shaken Morgan, her eyes swollen from 
crying. "I really feel like moving away from here right now. I never thought 
something like this could happen here. Why did it happen here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Ceballos, who sustained several gunshot wounds in the upper 
torso, held a vigil at the hospital Saturday. They declined to discuss the 
shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the Spaghetti Factory in Fullerton, where Reyes has worked for 
more than two years, said they had heard about the shooting but were unaware of 
any problems in the woman's life.

POWER RANGERS' FOLLOWERS BATTLE MIGHTY LINES; KIDS WAIT HOURS IN ANAHEIM FOR 
FAST PEEK AT SUPER HEROES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 For a fleeting glimpse of a tornado kick and pink spandex, the ardent admirers 
of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers would have braved any hazard -- perhaps 
even the monster army of Rita Repulsa, Empress of Evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they confronted gridlock and line-jumpers, boredom and balky cameras, 
two-hour delays and the factory-line efficiency of security guards who droned 
their own version of a Gregorian chant: "Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep 
moving." 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked them for an autograph," fumed Kimberly Salsbury, an Anaheim mother 
who brought her children to the Anaheim Convention Center on Saturday to salute 
the Power Rangers, "and they wouldn't give me one because I'm an adult. I stood 
in line for two hours! I deserve something. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is terrible: For two hours of standing outside we get two seconds?" As 
television super heroes met their super fans, the quick karate kick and greet 
never seemed to last long enough for the faithful followers of Tommy the Green 
Ranger -- played by actor Jason Frank -- and Kimberly the Pink Ranger -- in 
reality actress Amy Jo Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 When the doors opened at 10 a.m. for the Power Rangers' appearance at the 1994 
Kids Stuff Expo, the line of ticket holders was about 2,000 long, wrapping 
around the convention center and wandering a block down an asphalt 
truck-loading lane behind the exhibition halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellflower resident Hannah Reid, her 10-year-old son, Joshua, and his friend, 
Christina Elliott, 7, had staked a spot in line at 5:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have stayed in line all night if my husband could have been with me," 
Reid said. Last month, Reid and her son never even saw the hem of a spandex 
spacesuit after the evil forces of traffic ended their quest to see the Power 
Rangers at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated crowd of 35,000 that day broke attendance records at the theme 
park and snarled traffic for nearly eight miles into downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got pretty close to the off-ramp," recalled Reid, "but that was it. 
(Joshua) was crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's super hero crush was considerably more subdued, although doting 
fans still encountered some traffic delays. Anaheim traffic Sgt. Steve Walker 
said the busy tourist area was more crowded than usual as the 20,000 spectators 
for the expo and Rangers joined an estimated 60,000 visitors headed to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty well gridlocked," Walker said. "But they have been getting 
everybody in, even if there has been a bit of a delay. For the most part, 
people are being patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Rangers "Tommy" and "Kimberly" were scheduled to make their back 
flips and kicks from a booth in the main exhibit hall. But after the expo's 
organizers saw what happened at Universal Studios, they shifted the stars to a 
separate arena, where two more Rangers are also scheduled to appear today. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7 admission included entrance to the expo and a viewing of the Rangers, 
which for some fans seemed about as brief and impersonal as passing a toll 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first hour, families had 10 seconds each with a Ranger for a greet and 
photo snap. Then organizers tried to speed the line by circling the Rangers 
with barriers to discourage contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people complained that they had to contend with line-jumpers edging 
into the endless queue. Exhibitors in the Kids Expo complained that the Rangers 
drained attendance from their educational exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people brought their kids only to see the Power Rangers," said Julie 
Cole, who was selling felt storybooks at the expo. "It's a little 
disappointing, since the organizers told us only to bring educational 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Fielden of Long Beach gauged the stamina of her 3- and 5-year-old 
children as she inched 100 feet in a half-hour. Five-year-old Felicia Fielden 
seemed perfectly content to pass the time talking about bad guys, dinosaurs and 
Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really more a question if we have the sanity," Fielden said.

BILL BOYARSKY: ARCHITECT OF RIORDAN'S BLUEPRINT FOR STREAMLINING L.A.

<P>
 As senior managing director of the Wall Street firm of Bear, Stearns & Co., 
Michael E. Tennenbaum has put together some complicated deals. 
</P>
<P>
 From Bear, Stearns' Los Angeles office, on the 32nd floor of a Century City 
high-rise, Tennenbaum was pivotal in financing the MGM Grand Hotel and folding 
Pacific Southwest Airlines into USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of these or Tennenbaum's other deals were as risky and tenuous as the 
long-shot enterprise that has taken up much of his time recently -- heading the 
committee of business leaders that conceived Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to 
reduce the size of Los Angeles city government. The savings would be used to 
enlarge the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is based on the old American notion that politicians and 
bureaucrats are incompetent. If a hardheaded business person were in charge, 
government would run smoothly and economically. 
</P>
<P>
 This notion has been tested many times, most notably in Ronald Reagan's state 
and national administrations. Invariably, the business executives, accustomed 
to a corporate world where people jump at their command, end up frustrated and 
confused by the compromise, consensus and many votes required in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea will not die. It helped elect Riordan in June, and is now firmly 
entrenched in his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee faces an especially difficult task because its members are 
challenging some of City Hall's most entrenched interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The interests are varied. Powerful municipal unions will fight any attempt to 
reduce pension funds or turn over some city work to private companies. The 
Department of Water and Power, a semi-independent agency with great political 
clout, will battle efforts to reduce its operating expenses. The airline 
industry and municipal unions will oppose leasing the airport to a private 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast scope of these proposals poses a political risk for Riordan. For 
their fate will help determine whether his Administration is a success or 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I visited Tennenbaum in his office recently so I could ask him about what he's 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a graying, tennis-playing grandfather who on that day was dressed in a 
sport coat, slacks, dress shirt and a Georgia Tech necktie. He's a trustee of 
the university, his alma mater, and later in the day was to fly to Atlanta for 
a board meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was in New York from 1962 to 1977 so I watched the decline of one of the 
world's great cities," he said. But because he was a young newcomer from 
Georgia, Tennenbaum couldn't crack the power structure. "I disagreed with a 
great number of policies," he said, "but I was never in a position to influence 
events there." 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided that living in New York had too many limits," he said. "I moved 
from a hotel suite to Malibu beach and adjusted in about 12 hours. . . . My 
financial and professional success has been considerable, in terms of meeting 
my goals. Los Angeles has given me just about everything I want. It is a 
wonderful lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, for the past 3 1/2 years, I have had a sense of 
foreboding." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, like New York, was going downhill, with decaying streets, failing 
schools and sewers and inadequate police protection, he said. Unlike New York, 
newcomers can break into the power structure here. Maybe that's why we're still 
rooted in the frontier notion of the stranger walking into town and being 
elected sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had known Dick Riordan for 20 years," Tennenbaum said. "We never did 
business, but we discussed business opportunities. We became friends. He's just 
a really smart fellow and you can't know too many smart fellows. . . . So after 
he was elected, I said I'd like to be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 A top Riordan adviser, UCLA professor Bill Ouchi, asked Tennenbaum to conduct 
a study of how the city could save money through improved leasing and debt 
financing practices. Tennenbaum quickly became convinced that a study of the 
entire city government was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the report is finished, Tennenbaum has this advice for the mayor: "We 
are talking about the welfare of the great mass of people of Los Angeles. We 
are saying this is the truth. . . . It is doable. Don't let people tell you how 
difficult or impossible it is to do it. Just tell them to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing for Riordan to fire off such orders. But as Reagan found with 
his business task forces in Sacramento and Washington, it's something else to 
get people to obey them. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the program will be contained in the budget Riordan will soon submit 
to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan needs eight votes on the 15-member council to pass his budget. By the 
same token, his opponents require eight votes to remove the business leaders' 
program from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say that the council wipes out the Riordan program and passes a budget 
that is unacceptable to the mayor. Riordan can veto it. His opponents would 
have to muster 10 votes to override the veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's game now is to gather enough votes to prevent the council from 
overriding his veto. That would put him in a strong position for 
mayoral-council negotiations that could produce a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Riordan can do this will be determined by the political mathematics of 
City Hall, a much more complicated version of the art than corporate math. In 
the corporate world, the bottom line rules. Political mathematics are governed 
by votes, and by the people who cast them.

A RECONCILIATION?; COLLABORATION YIELDS MANY ARRESTS, FOSTERS THAW BETWEEN 
AGENTS, OFFICERS; THE FBI'S J. EDGAR HOOVER AND LAPD CHIEF WILLIAM PARKER 
SPARKED A DECADES-LONG FEUD. BUT NOW THE AGENCIES ARE TRYING TO REPAIR THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP, ARRESTING FUGITIVES WITH ASTONISHING SUCCESS. 
</P>

<P>
 When it comes to corralling criminals in the city of Los Angeles, no one 
stands taller than the LAPD and the FBI, two of the nation's biggest and 
proudest law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for decades the organizations often have eyed one another with suspicion, 
feuding quietly at some times, noisily at others. Their differences -- 
exacerbated most recently by the resentment many LAPD officers harbor for FBI 
agents who investigated the beating of Rodney G. King -- have been known to 
hamper the efforts of both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, some FBI agents stereotype LAPD officers as thick-skulled cowboys, 
ill-equipped for sophisticated investigations. Many police officers, in turn, 
deride FBI agents as little more than tight-lipped bureaucrats -- "accountants 
with guns" is a favorite put-down. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, however, the twin towers of Los Angeles law enforcement have 
begun reconstructing their relationship, producing a wealth of successful 
cases, particularly in apprehending fugitives. It may be too soon to declare 
the feud over, law enforcement sources say -- just last month, the FBI opened a 
civil rights investigation into an LAPD shooting, a move sure to anger some 
police officers. But for the first time in years, there are glimmers of a 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't really been a happy world between the FBI and the LAPD," said 
Special Agent Geoff Bickers, who started up the Los Angeles office's Gangster 
Apprehension Team, one of two fugitive units that combines FBI agents and 
representatives of local law enforcement agencies. "But this has been seen as a 
kind of a bridge. . . . Things seem to be on the mend." 
</P>
<P>
 And partly as a result, certain kinds of arrests are sharply on the rise. In 
the early 1990s, the FBI was catching 50 or 60 felony fugitives a year. Last 
year, two special units -- one made up of the FBI, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department and the state Department of Justice, the other combining 
the FBI and the LAPD -- reeled in 230. 
</P>
<P>
 As the collaboration progressed, the local law enforcement agencies solved 
some old and difficult cases: Last November, Robert Lee Perkins was arrested in 
Montgomery, Ala., and returned to Los Angeles to face charges that he murdered 
his girlfriend in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 That arrest cleared a case that was buried deep in the LAPD's unsolved 
homicide files, and members of the fugitive units say it helped cement the 
working relationship between the police officers and FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They handed us this case and said: You want a challenge, try this one," said 
FBI Special Agent Mark Llewellyn, who supervises the Fugitive Task Force. "We 
kind of proved ourselves right off the bat." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Lt. Sergio Robleto, the commanding officer of South Bureau Homicide, was 
among those most impressed by the quick work in that and other cases: "We're 
working better together than we used to. . . . It's been very effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk is quite a departure from the legendary confrontations of yore. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said the hostilities date back 
to 1950 -- when William H. Parker took over the LAPD and J. Edgar Hoover was in 
charge of the FBI.

 "The bad blood between the LAPD and the FBI began when Parker, as the new 
chief, demonstrated that he was his own man and that he would not be beholden 
to J. Edgar," Gates wrote in his autobiography, "Chief: My Life in the LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of a particular incident; in fact, I don't believe the two men 
ever met. But Parker made his thoughts on law enforcement clear through his 
speeches, articles, and the direction in which he was taking the department. 
All of this was duly reported back to Hoover through the local head of the FBI, 
whom Parker tended to ignore. In the '40s, I am told, Hoover enjoyed visiting 
L.A., hanging out with movie stars and studio chiefs. His visits abruptly 
ceased after Parker became chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "In time our officers were excluded from the three-month training academy run 
by the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 That may have been the beginning. But it was far from the end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take the 1981 hijacking of a Continental Airlines jet at Los Angeles 
International Airport. Police and FBI agents rolled to the scene. Once there, 
each insisted that the other agency back off. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD officers, led by Gates, declared that they would handle the crisis 
because it was their city; the FBI agents asserted federal jurisdiction because 
it was an airline hijacking. After a tense standoff on the airport Tarmac, the 
FBI prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, when Armenian terrorists murdered the Turkish consul general in 
Los Angeles, the LAPD and the FBI again butted heads: The FBI claimed 
jurisdiction because the crime involved terrorists and a diplomat, while the 
LAPD asserted itself because murder is a state offense. In that case, each 
agency came away with a piece of the action. The federal government 
investigated and prosecuted a related firebombing. The LAPD and state 
authorities handled the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies' cooperativeness was tested yet again when the Olympics came to 
Los Angeles in 1984. The FBI touted its expertise in combatting terrorism; the 
LAPD trotted out its highly acclaimed special weapons and tactics forces and 
other specialized units and said it was prepared to play the lead role. Gates 
visited Asia, Europe and the Middle East to learn more about the business of 
terrorists, and he steadfastly refused to pledge that he would defer to the FBI 
in the event of a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, FBI Director William H. Webster pulled Gates aside at a meeting in 
Washington and urged him to reconsider. Gates stood firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys will screw the thing up and go back to Washington and you'll leave 
me to deal with this," Gates remembers telling federal officials. "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gates agreed that if there was an attack and national security was 
threatened, he would consider turning over jurisdiction at that point. There 
was no attack, so the agreement was never tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a little bit of tension between local authorities and federal 
authorities," said Stephen S. Trott, a federal appeals judge who was the U.S. 
attorney in Los Angeles during the early 1980s. "That's been especially true in 
Los Angeles because the LAPD is a very proud agency and feels it can handle any 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 That is as true today as it was then, but longtime observers of the Los 
Angeles law enforcement scene say the FBI and LAPD began warming to one another 
about two years ago. A key breakthrough, officials say, occurred in the wake of 
the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 With public attention riveted on the brutal beating of trucker Reginald O. 
Denny and other motorists during the opening hours of the riots, it was an FBI 
informant who first identified Damian Monroe Williams as one of the attackers. 
The FBI passed that tip on to the LAPD, whose detectives joined with FBI agents 
to investigate the crimes that occurred at Florence and Normandie avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how all this started," said FBI Special Agent Joe Waggoner, who 
supervises the Gangster Apprehension Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important as that tip and its repercussions have been the changing 
faces at the top of the two agencies. Special Agent-in-Charge Charlie J. 
Parsons was named as the FBI's Los Angeles field division chief in July, 1991, 
and he quickly set out to court the LAPD. He appeared in public on several 
occasions with Gates, most visibly in the wake of the riots when the two men 
announced the arrest of Williams and others involved in the Florence and 
Normandie attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons' overtures helped initiate a thaw between the agencies. But the most 
important personnel change for sealing the new cooperation, according to 
longtime law enforcement sources, was Gates' 1992 departure from the Police 
Department, now headed by Willie L. Williams. As was evident in the jostling 
over the 1984 Olympics, Gates was fiercely committed to the notion that the 
LAPD could take charge of any situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daryl would arrive at a scene and plant the flag," one law enforcement source 
said. "He would announce: 'We can handle this."' 
</P>
<P>
 Gates agrees. "It's always been an uneasy situation with the FBI," he said. 
"They don't have expertise in a lot of areas that they get into. . . . I wasn't 
afraid to say that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, if Gates' departure expedited a detente, the Rodney G. King case 
certainly set it back. In that case, FBI agents were assigned to investigate 
LAPD officers, and they pursued their quarry with a vengeance that angered many 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers thought the investigation and prosecution were politically 
motivated; others accused the federal government of violating the accused 
officers' right not to be subjected to double jeopardy -- a claim with little 
legal merit but great emotional significance. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of that case, two LAPD officers went to federal prison. Many of 
their colleagues blamed the FBI and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt they prostituted themselves to the politicians," said LAPD Detective 
Bill Arnado, a 28-year veteran who stressed in an interview that he was 
speaking only for himself, not the department. "I know a lot of fine street 
agents, but the FBI, as an agency, was overzealous and was right on the verge 
of violating police officers' rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers throughout the city still bristle at the mere mention of the 
FBI, and the agents and officers who work with the fugitive unit say they have 
felt that tension on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times, I've met a little resistance," said Detective Robert Vanina, an 
LAPD officer who works with the Fugitive Task Force. "There are people in the 
department who are of the opinion that because of Rodney King, we shouldn't 
have anything to do with the FBI. It may be too much to say that they think the 
FBI's the enemy, but they sure don't think they're friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Vanina said, many police officers are gradually coming around, 
persuaded by the success the task force has enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanina heads the LAPD's half of the Fugitive Task Force, one of two units 
combining federal agents and local authorities to round up fugitives. The 
other, the Gangster Apprehension Team, was the first to get under way. Although 
it too originally included LAPD officers, today it combines the FBI, the 
Sheriff's Department and the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups hunt for fugitives, and both have racked up impressive numbers of 
arrests. Moreover, the cases they produce are a prosecutor's dream because most 
of the suspects have been convicted of crimes and often are sent straight to 
jail once they are caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrests have ranged from the mundane to the spectacular -- from 
run-of-the-mill attackers to a more exotic stripe of criminal. There was the 
art thief who would call prosecutors every year and boast that he would never 
be found; he committed suicide when the task force showed up at his door. Then 
there was the Gypsy accused of robbing elderly people who turned himself in 
after the Arizona king of the Gypsies intervened on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a call from his lawyer who said: 'Do you want to talk to the king of 
the Gypsies?' " recalled FBI Special Agent Scott Hanley, a member of the 
Fugitive Task Force. "I said: 'Sure, put him on, I've never spoken to a king 
before."' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hanley told the Gypsy king that if the suspect turned himself in, he could 
save himself the punishment for fleeing a federal warrant. Two weeks later, the 
suspect returned from Arizona and surrendered to the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fugitive and gang units embark on their second year, law enforcement 
officials warn that they alone will never entirely end the wariness between 
federal and local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But success has a way of smoothing over differences, and police officers and 
federal agents say the fugitive units have dramatically served the interests of 
both agencies. That may be the strongest foundation for a new law enforcement 
alliance, they say. With Cooperation, Arrests Soar 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI and local law enforcement agencies -- including the LAPD, the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the California Department of Justice -- 
joined forces in late 1992 to seek out and arrest fugitives. Since then, 
arrests have skyrocketed. 02,06,09 Year Arrests 1990 63 1991 53 1992 129 1993 
230 Note: The Gangster Apprehension Team was formed in October, 1992; the 
Fugitive Task Force was formed in March, 1993. Fugitive Profiles 
</P>
<P>
 There are thousands of felony fugitives at large in Los Angeles County. 
Members of the federal-local law enforcement teams say there are a few they are 
especially eager to find. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sarkis Vartan Peltakian 
</P>
<P>
 * Age: 32 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: White male, 5'8" tall, 200 lbs., black hair, brown eyes. A 
native of Lebanon, Peltakian legally immigrated to the United States in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why he is wanted: On July 2, 1993, Peltakian allegedly lost control of his 
vehicle on a freeway and hit a pickup, knocking the truck off an overpass. 
Seven teen-agers riding in the truck were killed and two other people suffered 
major injuries. Peltakian was arrested and charged with driving under the 
influence and seven counts of vehicular manslaughter. About three weeks after 
the accident, he quit his job and moved out of his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jong Pal Kim 
</P>
<P>
 * Age: 30 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Asian male, 5'7" tall, 165 lbs., black hair, brown eyes. Kim 
has a silver front tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why he is wanted: On Nov. 12, 1989, Kim's girlfriend tried to end her 
relationship with him. The two argued, and witnesses said Kim yelled: "If I 
can't have you, no one can!" According to police, he then pulled out a pistol 
and shot his girlfriend in the right temple, killing her. Police spotted Kim in 
1990 in Honolulu, but he escaped. He is thought to have returned to California, 
where he still is wanted in the murder.

BALMY DAY, SMELL OF GRASS, SPRING RITUAL COMES AT LAST; BASEBALL: PINT-SIZE 
ORIOLES, METS, EXPOS AND THEIR PARENTS CROWD THE FIELD AS ENCINO'S LITTLE 
LEAGUE SEASON OPENS WITH STAR-STUDDED PAGEANTRY.

 If there is a place that craves a sense of normalcy, Los Angeles is it. 
</P>
<P>
 After earthquakes, fires, floods, riots, high unemployment and reports of 
approaching killer bees, how better to celebrate order and renewal than with 
the spring ritual of youth baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 As if to proclaim that life goes on, Mayor Richard Riordan on Saturday morning 
joined hundreds of parents and children for opening day ceremonies of the 
Encino Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 Other community Little Leagues will hold opening day events this weekend and 
next, but few will be as elaborate or star-studded as the one staged on 
Encino's manicured fields. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 miniature Orioles and Mets, Angels and Yankees, Expos and Twins -- 
along with at least as many parents -- welcomed Riordan, Los Angeles Raiders 
defensive end Anthony Smith and other guests, including strolling cartoon 
characters Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Sylvester the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was "a great example of people getting together -- of not being depressed, 
of being optimistic," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is amazing," said Smith, adding that he was taking notes to bring the 
experience to disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was a well-orchestrated pageant that included a Cub Scout color 
guard and recital of the Little League pledge: "I will play fair and strive to 
win. But win or lose, I will always do my best." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 34 teams of brightly uniformed youngsters, ages 5 to 12, paraded into 
the outfield about 8:30 a.m., Riordan snipped the tag from his new "Encino 
Baseball" sweat shirt and prepared to throw out the first ball. He did so by 
warming up for several minutes in foul territory, creating an extended photo 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Dave, high five for the mayor," said a man to the small boy he held in 
his arms. But Dave would have none of it and squirmed deeper into his father's 
embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The master of ceremonies was radio personality Charlie Tuna, a former Encino 
Little League coach known to many here by his real name, Art Ferguson. He 
called Riordan to the microphone as strains of Randy Newman's "I Love L.A." 
blared from the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan threw out the first ball twice -- because television missed it the 
first time. Positioned behind home plate, Jackie Tatum, director of the city's 
Department of Recreation and Parks, snagged both throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time in the history of Encino Little League that anyone has 
caught the first ball," quipped league President Gary Lazar. 
</P>
<P>
 As hundreds of helium-filled balloons rose into the sky, parents, children and 
well-wishers poured onto the field to pose for pictures with the mayor. 
Officials shooed the throng from the diamond to make room for the opening 
contest between the Yankees and Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Samrock, one of the organizers, seemed pleased with the day and recalled 
the days he was a boy. "I was sort of smelling the grass and thinking . . . 40 
years ago the grass smelled the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smelled like that . . . when you played as a kid. . . . It smelled like 
that when Ty Cobb played."

TAFT HIGH TIES FOR 1ST IN STATE SUPER QUIZ; ACADEMICS: WOODLAND HILLS' 
DEFENDING CHAMPS AWAIT TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE OVERALL WINNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles won the Super Quiz at the state Academic Decathlon in the name of 
the city and the county Saturday as William Taft High School of Woodland Hills 
tied West High School of Torrance to take the high-stakes event. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the results of only one of the competition's 10 events announced, 
neither school can claim the California title yet. The overall winner will be 
announced at an awards banquet today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz is the last -- and most pressured -- of the tournament events. 
Students demonstrate their mastery of a predetermined subject by answering 10 
oral questions, each worth 100 points; scores are publicly displayed after each 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz is the only decathlon event to which the public is invited. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have every eye in that room looking at you, hoping you either get it 
right or get it wrong," said Daniel Berdichevsky, 17, of Taft, who along with 
teammate Sage Vaughn, 17, scored a perfect 10 out of 10. "Either way you please 
somebody, but you hope to please the people from back home."  
</P>
<P>
 Both schools had plenty of people back home to please. About 50 Taft parents, 
siblings, teachers and friends -- wearing red sweat shirts emblazoned with "GO 
TAFT!" across the chest -- took over a section in the University of the Pacific 
sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
 West, representing Los Angeles County, had almost as many supporters, waving 
yellow pom-poms and shouting approval every time quiz proctors announced the 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills High School, representing Orange County, and Bella Vista High 
School of Sacramento County tied for the Super Quiz's second place. Casa Grande 
High of Sonoma County finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall winning team will go on to represent California at the U.S. 
Academic Decathlon in Newark, N.J., in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft, the strong favorite going into the competition -- both because of its 
win last year and for its record-setting scores in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District competition -- said from the beginning that its biggest worry 
was West High's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to congratulate them," said Andrew Salter, 17, of Taft. "Super Quiz 
was not our strongest subject because we allocated so much time to the others, 
so we were happy to tie for first." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's topic, "The Documents of Freedom," tested students' knowledge of 
excerpts from historical documents, including the Magna Carta, the Declaration 
of Independence, Frederick Douglass' Address to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery 
Society and the Camp David Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 While their teammates, parents and friends looked on, three sets of three 
students from each of the 43 teams were given seven seconds to pick the correct 
answer to multiple-choice questions such as: what penal code Gandhi was 
prosecuted under, the attitude of the Mayflower Compact colonists toward King 
James, and why the preamble of the United Nations Charter says people should 
unite in strength and live in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday's Super Quiz, the students wrote a 60-minute essay, gave a 
four-minute prepared speech, a two-minute impromptu speech and underwent a 
seven-minute interview with a panel of judges.  
</P>
<P>
 The Taft group was disheartened after Friday's events, in which they took 
written tests in math, fine arts, economics, science, literature and social 
studies. Several coaches complained that the tests were unusually difficult, 
asking students to do square roots without calculators on the science test, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a few tests, I felt like giving up," said the team's only junior, Stephen 
Shaw. "But I just had to plow through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft teen-agers were so concerned about their performance that they 
decided to study instead of going to the traditional Friday night social, in 
which the students exchange tokens symbolizing their home region. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Rissman and Michael Michrowski, both 17, hunkered down at the desk in 
Mike's hotel room, near a taped-up map of Eastern Europe, and quizzed each 
other on the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 p.m. Friday, Taft Coach Arthur Berchin still had plans to review 
18-year-old Sheldon Peregino's prepared speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Sage Vaughn, 17; Chris Huie 17, and Kimberly Shapiro, 16, found an empty hotel 
conference room next to the West Coast Bass Fisherman's meeting, and tried to 
concentrate amid the lingering smell of fish, beer and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills school has won the California title each of the three times 
it has represented the Los Angeles Unified School District at the state 
competition. Last year, the team also finished second in the U.S. Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Their preparation this year was no less intense than in previous years, 
Berchin said. The nine team members were culled from a pool of 25 students who 
began taking practice tests during the summer.  
</P>
<P>
 So all told, Berchin said, the team has probably put in 450 to 500 hours of 
formal study on top of each of the students' private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 With only the announcements of the winners left to go, the students were torn 
between wanting to collapse from strain and exhaustion and wanting to celebrate 
at the tournament's Saturday night dance party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get in trouble, so it won't be much," Sage said. "We're going to get 
down and dance. Even if we don't win tomorrow, we've earned it."

NEW LAW PUTS 30,000 ON BRINK OF LIFE TERM; CRIME: REPEAT OFFENDERS FEEL THE 
PRESSURE OF THE 'THREE STRIKES' RULE. BUT SOME SAY IT WILL NOT BE A DETERRENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Joe Lopez does not think of himself as a criminal, even though heroin has put 
him behind bars nearly a dozen times. Nor does the gaunt, 48-year-old addict 
think of himself as a violent man, even though armed robbery is his favored 
technique for scoring the next fix. 
</P>
<P>
 "My philosophy is not to hurt anybody," said Lopez, his wavy hair streaked 
with gray, as he waited just after sunrise at a methadone clinic on Los 
Angeles' Eastside. "But my sickness always comes first." 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the tough "three strikes and you're out" sentencing law went into 
effect, Lopez is no longer merely a repeat offender, but one of at least 30,000 
"two-strikers" statewide who face life imprisonment if they commit one more 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, the controversial measure is not a detached debate, one waged over 
politics, ideology or the mechanics of the legal system. They know this is 
about their margin for error, that even a nonviolent crime -- such as receiving 
stolen property or forging a check -- now could mean growing old in the dank 
confines of a prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man," Lopez said, "this is a killer." 
</P>
<P>
 From the housing projects of Watts to the homeless encampments near MacArthur 
Park, the new law has become a hot topic of street-corner debate, with rage and 
fear invariably giving way to fatalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Few habitual offenders, whether gangbangers or crack addicts, believe that the 
threat of a life term will serve as much of a deterrent. But they all feel the 
pressure of suddenly being thrust into the ranks of the unforgiven, aware that 
a criminal past -- even one that has been left behind -- can come back to haunt 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really depressing living with this over your head," said Manuel Johnson, 
25, an ex-Crip who works in the Beverly Hills office of Amer-I-Can Inc., a 
self-esteem course for former gang members. "It's almost like the system is 
saying: 'I dare you. I dare you to mess up again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such consequences, a Compton gang member said the kingpins who run 
his neighborhood simply would employ young followers with clean records to do 
more of their dirty work. A Venice surfer with convictions for cocaine and 
methamphetamine abuse expressed dismay at the prospect of life behind bars. 
Then he casually fired up a joint. And a Downtown panhandler known as Tex 
claimed he was not inclined to violence, but would rather go on a bloody spree 
than waste away behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might as well go out as a Trojan," said the 37-year-old ex-con. "Nobody in 
their right mind wants to sit between four walls and have someone tell them 
what to do and what to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a handful of horrific slayings helped generate support for the 
stringent sentencing guidelines, the large majority of felons affected by the 
law are not serial killers or child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglars, many of them addicts who steal to feed their habits, are responsible 
for more than 70% of repeat offenses, according to the state Department of 
Corrections. Largely because these thieves could be sent away for life, 
officials estimate that it will cost $21 billion just to build enough cells to 
house the additional 109,000 inmates expected by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert (Chano) Morales said he could be one of them, if a paycheck does not 
come soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanning the traffic that zips past Lucy's Drive-In on Pico Boulevard, the 
24-year-old day laborer waits vainly for a chance to trim hedges or bust 
concrete, the only legitimate avenue he has found for a tattooed ex-con. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has no interest in reliving the gangbanging days that twice landed 
him behind bars, first for assault with a deadly weapon, then for armed 
robbery. But he also says he could cross that line again -- if he finds no 
other way to care for his 3-year-old daughter at their decrepit Westlake 
tenement hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to steal food to keep her fed, I'll do it," said Morales, his long 
brown ponytail peeking out of a backward baseball cap. "Whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the measure, signed into law Monday by Gov. Pete Wilson, shed no 
tears for those who choose to break the law. Crime is out of control, they 
argue, precisely because California has coddled its criminals rather than 
removing them from society. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Fisher, whose brother was shot dead in 1987 by an ex-girlfriend who 
stalked him at his Carlsbad apartment, said the cost of constructing more 
prisons pales in comparison with the toll extracted on a victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you from a personal experience what the cost of crime is -- the 
cost is lives," said Fisher, who serves on the board of the Doris Tate Crime 
Victims Bureau, an advocacy group named after the late mother of Sharon Tate, 
the actress killed in 1969 by members of the Charles Manson family. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that get-tough policies have boosted the state's prison population 
by nearly 300% since 1980 while doing little to enhance safety on the streets. 
Moreover, they add, the brunt of such laws likely will fall on Latino and 
African American men, who account for 63% of California inmates -- and whose 
bleak economic prospects are seen by some as the driving force behind many 
criminal deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've left a Darwinian situation in the inner city and should not be 
surprised at the results," said Constance L. Rice, western regional counsel for 
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, each of the first two strikes must be one of 26 violent or 
serious felonies, which include murder, rape, assault with a deadly weapon, 
armed robbery, residential burglary, arson and furnishing drugs to a minor. The 
third strike can be any of the more than 500 felonies on the books in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Had such a law been in place in his teen-age years, Robert Fuiava could be 
doing life, although he doubts that would have deterred him from opening fire 
on gang rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuiava, a 21-year-old Crip with "Samoa" tattooed across his rippled stomach, 
packed his first pistol at an age when most kids start Little League. By 14, he 
had been convicted of seven counts of attempted murder and sentenced to the 
California Youth Authority. Paroled at 20, he was sent back seven months later 
when police raided his Compton home in a drug sting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're out there getting ready to do a drive-by, you're not thinking 
about what's going to happen if you get caught," Fuiava, who will be paroled 
again when he turns 25, said during an interview at the CYA facility in Chino. 
"You're thinking: 'I got to go to the neighborhood, do my shooting and get out 
and go home and drink a 40 ounce.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who go straight say the journey is fraught with pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been six years since Charles (Chopper) Harris was in trouble with the 
law, the same amount of time that the former gangbanger spent locked up for 
armed robbery and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 27, he makes $600 a week working for P W Construction Inc., which is 
remodeling apartments at his old stomping grounds, the Jordan Downs housing 
project in Watts. Dressed in a sleek leather jacket and black corduroy slacks 
at his 102nd Street office, Harris stands out as one of the community's success 
stories, literally helping to rebuild a neighborhood he also helped ravage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harris still worries every day about the unpredictable forces that he says 
can misdirect a man's life, especially in an environment where the illegal road 
to survival sometimes seems to beckon more readily than positive paths. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mission is to obey the laws of a free society," he said. "But down here, 
the abnormal is accepted as normal and the normal is unspoken of -- it's all 
backwards. Just walking down the street, you can get caught by that bad 
influence anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs catch hold of some people and never let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a trash-strewn lot near MacArthur Park, a woman stares vacantly at 
a tiny makeup mirror cupped in the palm of her hand. Her dress is a festive 
burst of brightly colored blue, yellow and orange squares. But at 33, her brown 
eyes are sunken and her cheeks hollow, testament to years of using heroin and 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 She figures she has been convicted at least "a couple dozen" times, mostly for 
robbery and drug possession. But consequences do not matter when the craving 
calls. She will do whatever it takes to get high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you help me out?" the woman asks, hoping for a couple of dollars in 
exchange for sex. "I can help you."

COURT OFFICIAL HAS TAKEN 34 TRIPS SINCE '91; EXPENSES: SHEILA GONZALEZ HAS BEEN 
CRITICIZED BY SOME ON HER STAFF. BUT OTHERS SAY HER TRAVELS BENEFIT THE COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
 Sheila Gonzalez, who recently received a $12,400 pay raise as Ventura County 
courts administrator, has spent nearly five months of workdays out of the 
office on business trips since mid-1991, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In that time, Gonzalez has taken 34 trips out of town, including 15 outside 
the state, according to the records. On most of the out-of-state trips, she 
conducted business for organizations not directly affiliated with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the 34 trips kept the 50-year-old Gonzalez out of town for 123 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's frequent absences have not gone unnoticed by some of her staff, 
especially in light of the controversial pay hike that raised her base salary 
to $109,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear criticism from employees that they can't get money for basic things, 
and yet Sheila is always gone," said Barry L. Hammitt, executive director of 
the Service Employees International Union Local 998. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez and her supporters defend her travels as being beneficial for 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say that nearly half the funds for the trips out of state came from 
two private, nonprofit national courts groups of which Gonzalez is a board 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 They also credit the trips for helping boost the county's image as a national 
leader in court efficiency and technology. Gonzalez supporters argue that 
without the trips -- and without her staying on top of new court technology -- 
the Ventura County system would lose its label as a national model. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to note that the courts in Ventura County are not an 
island unto ourselves," said Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark, a presiding judge 
the past two years who authorized many of Gonzalez's trips. 
</P>
<P>
 But one judge, who did not want to be named, called the court administrator's 
travels "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the trips by Gonzalez were to San Francisco or Sacramento to lobby 
legislators and judicial authorities on behalf of the county. But 15 trips were 
taken outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as her Ventura County duties, Gonzalez is a board member for the 
National Center for State Courts and the National Assn. for Court Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her out-of-town trips were to take care of business for one of those 
groups -- either to speak at a conference or to attend board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 In her capacity as a county administrator, she took several out-of-state trips 
either to arrange equipment buys or attend educational seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's busiest stretch for out-of-state travel came during a five-month 
period in late 1991, when she visited Miami, Philadelphia, Chicago and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few court administrators nationwide get appointed to the board of the 
National Center for State Courts," Clark said. "That's a real plum. And it's 
through these contacts that she has made on a national basis that enable 
Ventura County to remain on the cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said she maintains regular contact with her office and with the 
judges while she is away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm away but I'm not away. I'm always running the office," Gonzalez said. "If 
I have to baby-sit this office, then I haven't done a good job of training or 
selecting management." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the travel is often a headache for her, causing her to rise 
early from bed and often return at odd hours. She also argued that most of the 
travel does not interfere with her work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at most of it, it is on the weekends," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez had $11,710 in bills on her 15 trips outside the state. The county 
paid a little over half of that total -- $6,099. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the travel did not occur on weekends, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The travel records -- including requests for cash advances, reimbursement 
reports and airline itineraries for the past 31 months -- show that only 28 of 
the 123 days Gonzalez spent on the road were Saturdays or Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who was hired seven years ago as Municipal Court executive officer, 
said the judges realize the value of her travel. "I think it has brought not 
just money, but ideas here," she said. "We don't have to reinvent the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 But many other local officials rarely take more than one or two trips out of 
state a year. For example, during the time Gonzalez made the 15 out-of-state 
trips, Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg made four, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1989, the Ventura County courts became the first in the state to 
combine their Municipal and Superior administrations. Gonzalez was appointed to 
head the combined operations as clerk, executive officer and jury commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how extensively she traveled before July, 1991, the latest 
period for which records are available. 
</P>
<P>
 That July, however, Gonzalez attended the 10-day annual conference of the 
National Assn. for Court Management in Philadelphia. It was the first of six 
out-of-town trips she would take over the next four months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In August, she spent two days at a conference in Dallas. A month later, she 
attended a four-day conference on fine collections in San Francisco. A week 
after that, in October, she traveled to a municipal-clerks convention in Lake 
Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to Ventura for a week, then attended a four-day conference on 
sentencing alternatives in Chicago. She ended the travel during that period 
with a four-day committee meeting in Miami for the courts-management group of 
which she's a member. 
</P>
<P>
 But her busiest travel year was 1992, when 14 trips kept Gonzalez on the road 
for 52 days, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, she visited seven out-of-state locations: Chicago; New York, 
Austin, Tex., Kissimmee, Fla.; Dallas and New Orleans (twice). 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said she believes most of her staff understands what her travel 
missions are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am open with the staff, and they know that I have a lot of commitments away 
from the courts," she said. "I don't do these things for me. It's not like 
someone is paying me an honorarium."

GONZALEZ'S RAISE STIRS CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When some powerful judges from across the state tried to cut $860,000 from her 
budget, Sheila Gonzalez changed their minds with a breathtaking lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Massachusetts computer manufacturer quoted Ventura County an $800,000 
price for some much-needed equipment, the court administrator negotiated the 
price down to $380,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a Thousand Oaks firm asked to show off one of its $60,000 video 
recorders in a local courthouse, she agreed to the deal -- as long as the 
county could keep the equipment afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez supporters say those are just a few of the ways she has helped save 
the budget-strapped county millions of dollars in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But controversy has surrounded Gonzalez since Feb. 8, when Ventura County 
judges awarded her a $12,400 pay raise. The 12.85% raise brought Gonzalez's 
salary to $109,000 and made her one of highest-paid court administrators in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 While few people doubt her skills or fault her work for the county, many have 
criticized the raise, calling it untimely and too large. 
</P>
<P>
 "To give one person a major salary increase while you are holding the line on 
what others are getting sends the wrong message," said Michael Saliba, the 
president of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. "Our position is irrespective 
of the quality of the work she has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Hammitt, executive director of the Service Employees International Union 
Local 998 representing county employees, agreed. "It's not to say that Sheila 
doesn't deserve a pay increase," Hammitt said. "Nobody says she didn't do a 
good job. But in terms of fairness and equity, how do you single out one county 
employee and say 'You did a good job'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Several judges said there were many reasons for awarding the double-digit 
raise to Gonzalez, the only county employee whose salary they set. 
</P>
<P>
 She had gone nearly four years without a pay increase, they said. She assumed 
broader responsibilities in that time and was credited with improving the 
morale of her 296 employees. Without a raise, she might easily be lured to 
another county, several judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, they argued, she has saved the courts more money through 
shrewd bargaining for equipment purchases and streamlining her staff than even 
the judges thought was possible. 
</P>
<P>
 They cited some of the equipment deals she has made as the courts continue to 
computerize operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mettert, president of Court Vision Communications in Thousand Oaks, said 
he had been looking for a way to put one of his firm's newly developed video 
court reporting systems in a courtroom for display when he began negotiating 
with Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 It was March, 1992, and the trial of the four officers accused of beating Los 
Angeles motorist Rodney G. King was set to be held in the East County 
Courthouse in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez entered into an agreement that allowed Court Vision to test its new 
system and even advertise to other courts that it is being used in Ventura 
County. In return, Court Vision agreed to let the county keep the system after 
the officers' trial. It is now used in Courtroom 23 at the Hall of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the savings Gonzalez has achieved for the county have not swayed 
opponents of her pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 26 judges who voted on the raise, seven were opposed: Superior Court 
Judges Frederick A. Jones, William L. Peck, James M. McNally, Charles R. 
McGrath and Ken W. Riley, and Municipal Judges Vincent J. O'Neill and Thomas 
Hutchins. Superior Court Judges Lawrence Storch and Allan L. Steele abstained, 
while the rest approved the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck said his negative vote "had to do with the timing and the amount and had 
nothing to do with Sheila and her performance. She has saved hundreds of 
thousands, if not millions of dollars for this county in the programs she and 
the judges have put into effect." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the timing of the raise "could not have been worse with the state 
in such fiscal straits." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has had to fight hard to persuade county and state budget officials 
to provide her office with the funds needed to keep the court on the cutting 
edge of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark, a key supporter of the pay raise, said 
Gonzalez's knowledge of computers and how to best use them to serve the public 
was one of the reasons he pushed to raise her salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark recalled a meeting on Dec. 17 in which Gonzalez fought with the state 
Trial Court Budget Commission in Sacramento over a proposal to cut $860,000 
from the money it was allocating to Ventura County courts. The money was 
earmarked for data processing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County officials had appealed the decision and mailed documents to the 
commission supporting their position. But when a Ventura contingent arrived in 
Sacramento to argue its case, it discovered that those documents had not 
arrived. So Gonzalez addressed the commission without preparation and delivered 
what Clark calls an impassioned speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "She pointed out that you cannot punish courts that are innovative and on the 
cutting edge because you would be rewarding mediocrity," Clark recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee stepped aside and said, based on Sheila's reputation in 
technology, 'We know that this is justified,' " Clark recalled. "And I don't 
know of any other administrator or court that that would have been done for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is now one of only eight court administrators in California earning 
more than $100,000 a year, according to public records listing such salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Court administrative salaries range from $169,700 for the head of the 
319-judge Los Angeles Unified Courts, to $52,000 for the chief of the one-judge 
South Sacramento Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending a 12.85% raise for Gonzalez, a group of four local judges 
studied those salaries and others. Another Superior Court judge, Frederick A. 
Jones, made a separate study and concluded that such a raise was unjustified, 
excessive and "will be perceived by the community we serve as extravagant and 
born of arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones further noted that the county Board of Supervisor had frozen merit 
raises for Gonzalez's employees. He suggested a raise for Gonzalez of no more 
than 5%, which would have increased her pay to $101,420. 
</P>
<P>
 The differing conclusions of Jones and the four other judges illustrate how 
deciding a court administrator's pay can be both difficult and inexact. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor complicating comparisons with other courts is the fact that the 
Ventura County court is one of only two in the state with consolidated 
Municipal and Superior Court administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The other consolidated court is the 48-judge Sacramento County court. The 
salary of its executive officer is $101,952, or about $8,000 less than 
Gonzalez's, even though Sacramento has 21 more judges. In voting against the 
Gonzalez pay raise, some of the judges felt this analogy was proof she did not 
deserve the 12.85% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 But some judges who favored Gonzalez's raise noted that the administrator of 
the 10-judge El Cajon Municipal Court in San Diego earned $97,593, or about 
$1,000 more than Gonzalez before her raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-judge San Francisco County Superior Court offers more of a middle 
ground for both sides. That court has only one judge more than Ventura County. 
Its executive officer's pay is $110,000, or $1,000 more than Gonzalez's since 
her raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and some of her supporters suggest that opposition to the pay raise 
might reflect more than budget concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people who cannot handle that a woman should get the same 
amount of money as a man for the same job," Gonzalez said in an interview. 
"That has to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Clark made a similar statement. "I wonder to myself whether she's 
hitting a glass ceiling based upon gender," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so did William Vickrey, director of the statewide Administrative Office of 
the Courts. "I don't think the judiciary is exempt from that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vickrey also said that despite Gonzalez's high-level responsibilities there 
appeared to be an impression of her as "an executive secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is this is a wise expenditure," Vickrey said of the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Peck said his vote against the raise had nothing to do with sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's absurd," he said. The other four Superior Court judges who voted 
against the raise either declined to comment or did not return phone calls. The 
two Municipal Court judges opposing it could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said in addition to savings from the various deals she has negotiated 
for equipment, the consolidation of the courts that she oversaw has saved the 
county another $3 million to $4 million over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not telling you that if someone else was sitting in this chair that would 
not have happened," Gonzalez said. "But I do know that there were three people 
in this chair before me, and that didn't happen."

HONORING THE IRISH; VENTURA DEDICATES ITS ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE TO SLAIN 
DETECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last five years, Catherine Stinson has sat on the curb of Ventura's 
Main Street to watch the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. But this year, she 
peered at the colorful floats and bands from a different vantage point -- a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after being shot eight times in the legs during a Ventura 
gunman's deadly rampage at an unemployment office in Oxnard, Stinson took a 
break from her rehabilitation to attend the Saturday event, which was dedicated 
to slain Police Detective James O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm honored that I'm alive to be here to honor him," said Stinson, a Port 
Hueneme resident who worked as a claims representative at the state jobs 
office. "Jim had a love for life. He was involved in the community. He was 
doing a community service when he was killed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard detective was one of four Ventura County residents killed Dec. 3 
when Alan Winterbourne, an unemployed computer engineer, opened fire in the 
Oxnard office. Winterbourne was then killed by Ventura police. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was posthumously named grand marshal of this year's parade.  
</P>
<P>
 Stinson, 40, clapped and cheered as the floats, some decorated with green 
shamrocks and others blaring Irish folk music, traveled up Main Street in 
downtown Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
 Cheering beside her was O'Brien's mother, Patricia, and members of the O'Brien 
family, who had led the parade's 72 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all honored, the whole O'Brien clan," said Patricia O'Brien, who 
joined Stinson to watch the parade after the lead car had traveled the 
six-block route. "We have always come to the St. Patrick's Day Parade, the 
whole family. We'd sit on the curb. It's a good day for the Irish." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia O'Brien felt that the clear blue skies and warm temperatures were her 
son's contribution to the day's festivities. "I think he had something to do 
with this weather today." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's widow, Leslie, and their two children, Katie and Sean, waved to the 
several thousand onlookers from a convertible Mustang driven by one of 
O'Brien's former partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie O'Brien said appearing in the parade was difficult, but rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really happy to see how many people were out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade committee member Nan Drake said the choice of O'Brien was natural.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a groundswell of support in memory of him," she said. "I knew 
that Jim was very proud of his Irish heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Department officers were pleased with the decision to 
acknowledge their friend and co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deserves all the recognition," said Oxnard Police Department bicycle 
Officer Cliff Waer. "They've honored heroes today and he was a true hero. It's 
definitely fitting." 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's parade was "Our Fighting Irish Heroes -- Dedicated to 
Those Who Protect and Serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Waer said O'Brien would have enjoyed the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have had a lot of fun," Waer said. "He loved being Irish." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Oxnard and Ventura police departments were out in force 
Saturday, and the motorcycle stunt team from the Bakersfield Police Department 
drew cheers and gasps from green-clad spectators as team members sped up and 
down Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Ventura County high school bands -- Ventura, Buena, Santa Paula and 
Oxnard -- marched down the parade route. And veteran entrants like the Claddagh 
School of Irish Dance and a 20-foot inflatable green pig gave a touch of the 
Eire to the day as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade coordinators were thrilled with the response to this year's event, 
which they said drew more people than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a nice turnout," said parade co-founder Larry Dinneen, who donned his 
favorite green hat for the event. "It's a good feeling. We started it just for 
enjoyment. It's worked out real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the thousands of people who lined Main Street, some looked as if they 
belonged in the parade rather than watching it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Glen Watson wore a green suit and faux red beard and touted 
himself as the only leprechaun there. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to get into the spirit," he said. Watson has donned his St. Patrick's 
Day costume for the parade the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Orick canvassed the parade route selling green T-shirts with a 
caricature of O'Brien on the back. Only half an hour after the parade started, 
Orick said she had sold nearly 70 shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone wants to have one because it's so special this year," she 
said.

 Oxnard resident Frank Tom was an eager customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that man with the picture on there paid the price, and I think he 
deserves this," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of spectators from the San Fernando Valley wore headbands with tiny 
green pinwheels on top that spun rapidly when the wind picked up. This was the 
sixth year the Valley residents trekked to Ventura for the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all from earthquake country -- anything to get out of the area," said 
Julie Wolf. "A lot of us are Irish. The Irish do love a party." 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of this year's parade were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Services: First place, district attorney; second place, Ventura Fire 
Department/City Council.

COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE DIVIDED ON IMPACT OF '3 STRIKES' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beyond the promise of safer streets and the threat of overloaded courts, 
Ventura County law enforcement officials say the new "three strikes" law aimed 
at career felons carries a load of question marks. 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors were weighing the first "three strikes" cases last week, 
officials disagreed over whether the law -- meant to imprison repeat felons for 
25 years to life -- will reduce crime, hobble the courts or truly deliver 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 But all agreed on this: The law will achieve its main goal of getting some 
violent criminals off the street, but it will take time for its side effects to 
become clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The first effects will be felt on the street, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law could be put to good use in Santa Paula to take chronically violent 
gang members off the street, Police Chief Walt Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have people that are walking around that have absolutely no 
compunction about killing someone, they just have to be removed," Adair said. 
"People that rape and rob and maim other people just have to be removed from 
society, since they have proven they have no intention of rehabilitating their 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt said the law will not deter ruthless 
criminals still on the street from hurting people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt agreed that some people "need to be locked up forever." But the law is 
mistargeted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 'three strikes and you're out' works extremely well on individuals 
like you and me, where we've got something to lose. We fear going to prison," 
Hurtt said. "But I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on 
individuals that are not in the ballgame. . . . You're spending money on 
individuals that are already lost to society." 
</P>
<P>
 The $21-billion estimated cost of building new prisons to house "three 
strikes" convicts for life would be better spent on schools, crime prevention, 
drug intervention and mental health care, Hurtt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like continuing to pour money into a bankrupt business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also will affect how accused felons are prosecuted and defended. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said his office is already reviewing cases to 
be prosecuted under the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, my job is to make it work," said Bradbury, who had lobbied 
against the law in favor of a narrower version known as the Rainey Bill, 
preferred by many prosecutors and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bill signed last week by Gov. Pete Wilson allows juvenile crimes to 
count as strikes, the Rainey Bill would not. The Rainey Bill would trigger a 
life sentence only if the third crime were also a serious and violent felony. 
Under the new law signed by Wilson, any felony can be considered a third strike 
if the first two were violent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The California District Attorneys Assn. is preparing a set of suggested 
guidelines for prosecutors on how and when to apply the new law, Bradbury said. 
Otherwise, prosecutors in various jurisdictions might use the law differently, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we'll get some unanimity in our approach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury and Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee are weighing whether to 
use the law against Preston A. Shelton, 36, of Oxnard, the first Ventura County 
resident with at least two felonies to be arrested for a third since the law 
was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton, a parolee twice convicted of armed robbery, was arrested on suspicion 
of cultivating seven marijuana plants -- a felony -- just hours after the law 
took effect last Monday, McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 This arrest may not be the kind of clear-cut case the law was designed for, 
McGee said, but it was the first to fall under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law required us to consider this case," he said. "It would not be the 
case we would necessarily choose if we had the luxury of choosing . . . but 
it's the case that circumstances have presented us with and it's the one we 
have to prosecute first." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said Preston may have many more felonies on his record, but prosecutors 
are still researching it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said his office will try to use the "three strikes" law fairly, 
meaning that prosecutors might choose not to apply it, say, in the case of a 
two-time felon who commits a third, nonviolent felony after 15 or 20 years of 
obeying the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman predicted that the law could 
create "terrible injustices." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are genuinely aggrieved over crime, as they should be," Clayman said. 
"And selfish politicians are glomming onto this fear and whipping it up in the 
most demagogic way they can do it without a proper analysis of all the proper 
arguments and debate. And these (cases) are going to get stampeded through." 
</P>
<P>
 It also will cause a greater number of trials as accused felons choose to 
fight their charges rather than plead guilty, as the majority of defendants 
have in the past, Clayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bradbury brushed aside the specter of gridlocked courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar predictions of doom failed to gel after the passage of previous 
get-tough measures, such as Proposition 115 and Bradbury's own policy against 
plea bargaining in felony cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may initially see an increase in trials, but it will return to an 
acceptable level very quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, court officials said they already are bracing for the possibility 
of a case overload, and might have to assign some civil court judges to hear 
criminal trials, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how carefully all of this was analyzed," said Presiding Superior 
Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson. "The cost we're going to see is in terms of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Judicial Council's office has said Ventura County's courts already 
are short three Superior Court judges and two Municipal Court judges, 
considering the size of its caseload, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really gets to me in terms of planning is it was only a year and a half 
ago the Legislature told us to go on the fast-track system for civil trials," 
Johnson said, referring to the requirement that civil suits be tried or settled 
within a year of filing. "Now a year and a half later they could well have 
doubled our criminal load." 
</P>
<P>
 The greater number of cases will be falling on the back of a court system 
already struggling with change. The Municipal and Superior Court support 
systems have already merged and some judges are already being cross-assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, judges are preparing to switch assignments if the "three strikes" 
caseload demands it, said Presiding Municipal Court Judge John R. Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains a big unknown -- we don't know how many more cases are going to be 
going to trial," Smiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not one of the doomsayers," he added. "All I'm saying at this point is if 
there is a significant impact, the impact's going to be on the other 
participants in the criminal justice system -- the sheriff, the California 
Department of Corrections and the judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Larry Carpenter predicted the law might help decrease the jail 
population when third-time felons who might have served one-year sentences 
there are sent away to state prison instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, he said, is whether it is the fairest approach to putting career 
criminals out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Three strikes and you're out' is a great concept," but it should be applied 
carefully only to third-time violent offenders, said Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone early in their life has a couple of convictions and then gets it 
right and goes on for 15 or 20 years living a good life and then writes a bad 
check at the department store, they ought not be locked up for the rest of 
their life," said Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the irony of a law enforcement officer worried about overly harsh 
penalties, he said: "It almost sounds like those of us in the business have 
become social workers, and the politicians on the outside have become 
law-and-order nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said he, too, backs the Rainey Bill, which could get to the 
governor's desk in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the Rainey Bill is signed, superseding the current law, it could 
in turn be superseded by a "three strikes" voter initiative that seems headed 
for the ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure, circulated by a Fresno photographer, Mike Reynolds, whose 
daughter was killed by a repeat felon, mirrors the law Wilson signed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say it will be many years before the long-range effects of "three 
strikes" become clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the estimated $21-billion prison construction tab, the Judicial 
Council estimated that the additional recurring cost in courts could top $250 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will add cost to the prison level," Bradbury conceded. "But what we 
quickly forget is it costs $21,000 to $27,000 a year to incarcerate someone in 
the penitentiary. And conservatively estimated, that person would cost society 
$187,000 in crimes," he said, citing figures from the state Office of Criminal 
Justice Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard's Chief Hurtt pointed out that incarceration is still an expensive 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to a representative of the Boy Scouts," he said. "They told me 
they can serve 8,000 kids in a Boy Scout program, where it takes a similar 
amount of money to lock up three people for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talk about crime and quality of life on our streets . . . we need to 
weed out the extremes on both ends and come up with something that's sensible 
and workable that's going to provide a positive impact on our quality of life," 
Hurtt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, lawyers and probation officers are already reconsidering 
strategies for accused third-time felons or even first- or second-timers who 
are headed for court, said Cal Remington, deputy director of the county 
Corrections Services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have someone who has a prior serious felony and now they've committed 
another one, those attorneys are going to be less apt to plead their clients 
out," Remington said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 And whether convicted felons heed the law once out of prison, they will get 
ample warning about the consequences of re-offending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Remington added, "If you have someone who is given probation and has two 
serious felonies, I think certainly the probation office is going to make it 
clear to the person that the stakes are extremely high."

ELECTIONS / ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 35; AGE AN ISSUE AS TWO RIVALS ARGUE OVER 
EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a 20-year age difference between them, the two candidates competing for 
the Democratic nomination in the 35th Assembly District have different ways of 
measuring experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not just relate to people's concerns and fears; I have lived them," 
candidate Mindy Lorenz declares in a campaign flyer distributed to voters 
throughout the district, which covers Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and most of 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz, 47, goes on in the flyer to explain how she went from being a single 
mother living on food stamps to earning a doctoral degree and a job as an art 
history teacher at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experiences proved to me that I have the strength, determination and 
commitment to accomplish tough goals," said Lorenz, who ran unsuccessfully for 
Congress in 1992 as a Green Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, Bob Ream, Lorenz's Democratic rival, is among the youngest candidates 
running for the state Assembly this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Ream, for whom the word young translates as "energetic," is quick to 
point out that he has more experience working in government than his 
challenger. He has served as an aide to state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) 
since graduating with top honors from Santa Barbara's Westmont College in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job has been trying to find solutions to people's problems in the 
community for the last five years," he said. "And I've been effective in doing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure with Hart, Ream said, he initiated legislation to provide 
emergency tax breaks for Santa Barbara residents who lost their homes in the 
1990 Painted Cave fire. He also takes credit for getting much of Hart's 
district included in a government-financed earthquake preparedness program. 
</P>
<P>
 While respectful of Lorenz's personal history, Ream said "all those life 
experiences don't necessarily translate into effective legislative leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to change something, you have to understand how government 
works," he said. "If I go to Sacramento, I can hit the ground running." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lorenz said it is not enough to simply understand the mechanics of 
government. She said it is more important to have "a depth of experience that 
leads to mature judgment, and I think Bob comes up short in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob went to an ultra-conservative school on a baseball scholarship, then 
directly to work for Gary Hart," said Lorenz, who has 20 years experience in 
education. "I'm not sure he's ever had a real job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ream fired back: "I've done five years of work in the job I'm running for. I 
can't think of a better job to have." 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates will square off in the June 7 primary election. Each is 
hoping to snap up the Democratic nomination for the Assembly seat being vacated 
by Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), who is a candidate for Hart's Senate post. 
Hart is retiring from public office. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the primary will face Republican opponent Brooks Firestone in 
the November general election. The Santa Barbara County winery owner is 
uncontested in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the issues, the two Democratic candidates agree on the need for more jobs, 
less crime and improvements in public education. They also pledge a commitment 
to protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The question voters in June will have to decide is who is the most viable 
candidate to challenge Firestone, 57, a former Assembly candidate who has 
already amassed more than $160,000 in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's too early to call," said Mary Rose, a Democratic political 
consultant in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35th Assembly seat is considered important because it has long been a 
Democratic stronghold, she said, even though Republicans have significantly 
narrowed the lead Democrats have held in voter registration in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lorenz and Ream both have their strong points, Rose said each also 
has obstacles to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's endorsement of Ream can open many doors in terms of support and money, 
"but Bob has to be a credible candidate in his own right," she said. "He has to 
get across that he's not just a 27-year-old former aide to Gary Hart. He has to 
develop his own identity." 
</P>
<P>
 While Lorenz starts out with greater name recognition, "it's not necessarily 
positive," Rose said, referring to Lorenz's previous bid for Congress as a 
candidate of the environmentally concerned Green Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are some (Democratic) party players that are concerned about 
where her loyalties lie in terms of her overall politics," Rose said. "It's 
much easier to apply that radical label given her past history. It makes her an 
easier target in the general election. I think it's a liability." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said she decided to switch parties because she had become 
"disillusioned with the ineffectiveness of the Green Party" when it came to 
actually shaping public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she considers her experience in the Green Party an asset, not a 
liability. She said it helped her to mature as a candidate. She also played a 
key role in collecting 100,000 signatures to place the Greens on the state 
party ballot the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said her past political experience has made her "a tremendous 
organizer. I know how to build organizations and coalitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters agree that her Green Party affiliation will not hurt her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Democrat," said Margaret Ely, a member of the Santa Paula City Council. 
"But I think the era of rigid party politics is behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz's political background aside, Ely said she believed voters will be 
impressed with the candidate's ability to overcome her own personal struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been a single mother who has worked her way up," Ely said. "I 
personally think that right now with some of the issues we are facing that we 
need someone who has been tested." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ream's supporters said his government work experience and close ties to 
Democratic Party leaders like Hart will give him the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sympathies are more with someone who has long been involved in the 
Democratic Party, rather than someone who has been a candidate for a fringe 
party," said Hart, who is co-chairman of Ream's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said he does not believe Ream's age will be a major factor in the 
campaign, noting that O'Connell was 30 when he was first elected to the 
Assembly in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think history has shown that you can be young and get elected in this 
district," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is also expected to play an important role in the election. Each of the 
candidates said they will need to raise between $300,000 and $500,000 to win 
the Assembly race. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Ream has raised more than $40,000 and has about $6,000 cash on hand. 
Lorenz reported raising $29,000 as of Dec. 31, and began the year with $5,000 
in her campaign treasury. However, she recently held a fund-raiser in Ojai that 
she estimates garnered more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates will be filing campaign finance statements within the next two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the two are busy walking precincts and meeting with various 
organizations and neighborhood groups. Lorenz has hired a San Luis Obispo 
consultant to assist in her campaign. Ream's sister Anne, who has a marketing 
background, has signed on as his campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few weeks, voters can expect to hear a lot more from both 
candidates about experience, leadership and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the advantage because people know me," Lorenz said. "Thirteen thousand 
people voted for me in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a matter of who wants it more," Ream countered. "I want it more 
than anybody else."

YOUTHS BRAINSTORM FOR REAL SOLUTIONS TO TOUGH PROBLEMS; THINK TANK: DELEGATES 
MAKE PROPOSALS TO COMBAT RACISM, DRUGS. THEY ALSO HAVE HARSH WORDS FOR TEEN 
CENTER, THE RESULT OF AN EARLIER STUDENT ENDEAVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with the slippery problems of racism and substance abuse, about 100 high 
school students formed a teen-age think tank Saturday in Thousand Oaks to work 
out some concrete solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the Conejo Future Foundation's 10th annual Youth Congress at 
Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks pleased the event's coordinators, but 
also left them a little surprised when delegates dumped criticism on the work 
of an earlier youth congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The students from east Ventura County and western Los Angeles County high 
schools made solid proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 They called for improved anti-drug education, safe and fun youth hangouts and 
better cultural education, along with a regional panel of students who could 
plan special events to divert youths from substance abuse or air racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But the delegates also slammed the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, proposed several 
years ago by another youth congress, calling it underused, boring and 
condescending. What's more, they said, it is staffed by too many adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more adults than kids there sometimes," said Roshi Pejhan, 16, an 
Agoura High School student who presented results of the group sessions to the 
whole congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of having so many adult supervisors -- people felt like they were 
observed too much and it was almost like being at home -- maybe there could be 
kids supervising as chaperons," she said. "People would be more comfortable 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Redonna Donatto, the chief adult adviser to the congress, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Teen Center is a concept that came out of the congress a few years ago, 
and it's being damned today because it's not doing what it was set out to do," 
she said. "We need to look at it and say, 'We created it, it needs to be 
better.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Thousand Oaks businesses and educational groups, the annual Youth 
Congress puts tough questions to student delegates from Thousand Oaks High 
School, Westlake High School, Newbury Park High School, Conejo Valley High 
School, La Reina High School, Agoura High School and Calabasas High School. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, as always, the students heard lectures by experts on the topics of 
the day -- drug and alcohol abuse and racism -- then broke into groups of eight 
or 10 to brainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Substance abuse "is a problem in the schools, it's a problem in the work 
force," Detective Gary Spencer of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
narcotics unit told the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The solution is fairly simple," Spencer said. "It's just a matter of taking a 
little piece of the community and saying, 'We'll stop it here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In groups, the students said one solution already in place, the Thousand Oaks 
Teen Center, needs an overhaul -- maybe even an overhaul with changing themes 
to keep the teen-agers' interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a joke," said Brian Gantzer, 16, of Conejo Valley High School in 
Newbury Park. "Kids at my school say it's just a bunch of yuppies who go to 
play pool and basketball, it's not a place to hang out. . . . You're being 
watched there, like you're at home with your parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Local coffeehouses are more popular hangouts for youths, who use them to 
socialize without drinking or taking drugs, the group agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Drug education such as the DARE program also needs an overhaul, several 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with some drug education today is it all says, 'This is bad, and 
this is bad, and this is bad,' and then when you try it and it's fun, nobody 
listens anymore," Jennifer Prehn, 18, of Thousand Oaks High School told her 
group. "You have to tell them, 'Yeah, it's fun at first, but it ruins your 
life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The DARE anti-drug program works, but it should be rewritten and continued 
past freshman year in high school to drive home the lessons it teaches, Joanna 
Dransfeldt, 17, of La Reina High School in Thousand Oaks told the entire 
congress at the session's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structure needs to be changed," said Joanna, one of the student 
coordinators of the congress. "It's been going on so long it's getting old. 
They need to find new and different ways to present the information." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the subject of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ric Easton, a spokesman for the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, told the 
congress, "The first lesson in teaching tolerance is the fact that all of us 
are prejudiced." 
</P>
<P>
 Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan Resistance are easily 
identified, but more subtle forms of prejudice find their way into people's 
lives, he said. Easton then posed a question for the congress: "How do you get 
people to comply with anti-racism tolerance programs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Broken into groups, students called on their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said a racially tense rivalry between two Westlake High School students 
might have led to the shooting last month of three students by a group of Asian 
American youths who reportedly announced "We're the Asian Mafia" before firing 
into a crowd in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the problem is there was some racial tension involved between the 
people there and they didn't know how to solve it," said Ben Bartos, 18, of 
Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said schools teach world history and European history, but nearly 
nothing on African American history and Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance is one of the main problems, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of little kids around my neighborhood, like sixth-graders," said 
Dave Edler, 16, of Thousand Oaks High School. "I don't know if they're 
prejudiced, but sometimes they're just sitting there, totally blurting out 
these racist slurs. I ask them, 'Why are you talking about this?' and they say, 
'I don't know.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Yuan, 17, of Westlake High School told the whole congress afterward, 
"There needs to be a strong emphasis on multicultural education. They should 
not only talk about different countries, but tie it into how these cultures 
have helped this country grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleen Ralph, 18, of Thousand Oaks High School told the group that many 
delegates want area student councils to get more involved in combatting racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some congress delegates suggested that an area student council be set up to 
handle such issues, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others recommended that the region's schools get together once a year to send 
letters and petitions to Congress and the news media, urging them to talk about 
positive interracial relations as well as racial tension, Coleen said. 
</P>
<P>
 She concluded, "We have to emphasize what it's like to be discriminated 
against." 
</P>
<P>
 As the congress ended and student coordinators made plans to meet Tuesday and 
work on putting some of these ideas into action, one adult onlooker marveled at 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are so much more sophisticated than they were when I was teaching 
school" in the 1970s, said Carolyn Kopp, chairwoman of the Conejo Future 
Foundation's board of trustees. "These kids are sharp, they're committed, 
they're good and they always deliver."

PRO-AUTO GROUP REVS UP TO OPPOSE URBAN RAIL PLAN; TRANSPORTATION: FACTION SAYS 
PROPOSED $2-BILLION IRVINE-TO-FULLERTON COMMUTER TRAIN SYSTEM WON'T WORK, AND 
PREFERS THAT MONEY GOES TO HIGHWAYS. OCTA WILL HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING MONDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Some freeway commuters dream of boarding a sleek, futuristic vehicle much like 
Disneyland's monorail. But that vision of high-tech trains sliding past crammed 
roads holds no promise for Jack Mallinckrodt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallinckrodt wants more streets, more ramps, more freeways. He wants to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A semi-retired radio electronics engineer, Mallinckrodt will be joined by a 
cadre of county residents at Monday's Orange County Transportation Authority 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Most will be from Drivers for Highway Safety, a vocal, pro-auto group. Their 
goal: ensuring that a proposed $2-billion urban rail line that might link 
Fullerton with Irvine never leaves the computer terminal, let alone the train 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallinckrodt and other critics of the proposed 28-mile rail line are expected 
to dominate the informal public hearing, which is the public's first open 
invitation to comment on the rail plan since the passage of Measure M in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure targeted $340 million for urban rail, leaving officials to 
figure out how to raise the remaining cash and where to run the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallinckrodt, who concedes that the federal government always allocates huge 
sums for mass transit, adds: "I realize that a dollar you can get from the feds 
is not the same as a dollar you can't get. But I think it's time to say maybe 
we shouldn't accept this federal money at all, if it has to be used for 
something that doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an alternative to buses that provides transit for people who can't 
afford an automobile," Mallinckrodt says of urban rail service. "But neither 
one does anything significant anywhere for congestion relief. . . . A small 
fraction of what they're proposing to spend on rail would pay for all the 
(highway) transportation we need." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some supporters of rail transit will speak, OCTA officials 
confidently predict. One of them is Dan Winton, a member of the Industrial 
League of Orange County, which has generally supported rail plans in the past, 
as long as studies show they attract riders and are only part of a broad mix of 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support urban rail if the numbers prove out, and if it's done in 
conjunction with other modes of transportation," says Winton, a business and 
real estate attorney who chairs the Industrial League's traffic committee. "We 
don't see urban rail as the solution to all of our problems. . . . Basically, 
we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Winton adds: "Until the automobile pays its fair share, not only of congestion 
costs but also of air-pollution costs, you're not going to get a lot of people 
to use mass transit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Winton probably will be outnumbered at Monday's session, officials say, 
because rail critics are stronger in their beliefs and tend to act on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA board won't vote on whether to go after federal funding and conduct a 
thorough study of all transit alternatives -- including more buses -- in the 
Fullerton-Irvine corridor until April 11. In the meantime, OCTA will release 
results of a countywide public opinion survey. 
</P>
<P>
 If OCTA ultimately votes to move ahead, the earliest passengers could board a 
monorail or other high-tech rail system would be the year 2002, officials 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the actual decision to build is still a year or more away, both 
critics and advocates of the proposed rail system view the current debate as a 
turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, transit officials have been telling us we need rail, and they've 
got the public believing it," Mallinckrodt said. "It's sort of a 
self-fulfilling prophecy . . . and this is the last chance to avoid going over 
the falls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mallinckrodt is among those who will argue Monday that urban rail is a 
boondoggle. For example, a recent study by professors at USC showed that Los 
Angeles County's Blue Line light rail system has taken some automobiles off the 
road, but at a steep cost -- $37,000 per year for each vehicle removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Governments could pay people a lot less in cash to junk their older, polluting 
cars, and buses are more cost-effective, most transportation experts and 
economists agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But rail advocates cite these arguments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Even though bus service is already scheduled to be improved somewhat under 
Measure M before intracounty, urban rail is ready, buses have an 
insurmountable, negative image and voters won't raise taxes in the future to 
help fund a massive bus network. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buses get stuck in the same traffic as cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rail helps reduce the rate at which regional traffic congestion grows. 
</P>
<P>
 And all of this, rail backers say, is necessary to keep Southern California 
from stagnating economically and environmentally, compared to other regions 
that may already have good mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 These arguments predate the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, federal clean-air regulations overlay the whole debate. Federal 
policy views new roads as creating more congestion and smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Not rail. 
</P>
<P>
 On a regional basis, federal agencies require rail and bus projects to offset 
or balance the addition of new freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the billions of dollars spent on Los Angeles transit projects 
allow Orange County to keep improving its freeways, says Mark Pisano, executive 
director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, the regional planning 
authority. Orange is one of six counties in SCAG. 
</P>
<P>
 What really matters, says Monte Ward, a key OCTA staffer, is consumer choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "People generally don't relate to construction or operating costs," Ward 
observes. "They will look at rail and ask themselves, 'Is it something I can 
use?' and 'Does it go where I need to go?' And if they can answer those 
questions with a 'Yes' for themselves or somebody they know, then I think there 
will be public support." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the jury is still out," he added.

MISSION VIEJO PUTS ON THE GREEN; PARADE: THE 25TH ANNUAL ST. PATRICK'S DAY 
CELEBRATION SATURDAY MARKS THE HOLIDAY A TAD EARLY.

<P>
 Here in Mission Viejo, they parade and party early -- and enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade organizer estimated that 10,000 people lined Marguerite Parkway on 
Saturday for this community's 25th annual St. Patrick's Day Parade -- five days 
before the March 17 holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedecked in green, people arrived by car, truck, golf cart, bicycle and 
in-line skates for the parade on a warm, blustery day near Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, there was a grand time to be had, said Rochelle Bond, a 17-year-old 
Santa Margarita High School senior who is this year's Miss Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone loves a parade. They are just so much fun," said Bond, who rode 
along the mile-and-a-quarter parade route waving to the crowd as bagpipes 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 Irishman Michael Timothy Brennan, bestowed with the honorary title of Lord 
Mayor of Orange County, agreed. Cane in hand, a key to the city around his neck 
and sporting an Irish cap, Brennan marched and mingled among the line of 
floats, bands, vintage cars and drill teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great tradition," said a smiling Brennan, 34, a resident of Lake 
Forest. "My family has been a part of this parade since its beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, the parade was launched by a group of friends and 
members of the Mission Viejo Country Club, including Brennan's father, Bob, Lee 
and Bob Ramsey, and club manager Tom Mitchell. They invited the Marine Corps 
band from El Toro, gathered up a line of golf carts from the club, and 
"everything just took off," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by a U.S. Marine Corps color guard, the 111 parade entrants made their way 
from Olympiad Road to Alicia Parkway. Participating were Mission Viejo Mayor 
Susan Withrow and the City Council, a Mission Viejo Chamber of Commerce float, 
various Girl Scout and Brownie troops, Shriners from Anaheim's El Bekal Temple, 
and people costumed as leprechauns and clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Joe Elisalda of Santa Ana. Painted as Smoothie the Clown, Elisalda, 46, 
volunteered for his second St. Patrick's Day parade in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps everybody happy and makes them smile," said Elisalda, who works for 
the county parks department. "That's good for them and good for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 A line of vintage Ford Mustangs motored by, courtesy of the Saddleback Mustang 
Assn., a group of car buffs who volunteer for public events, said Jack and Bea 
Dudley of Laguna Beach, who cruised along in their 1966 convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just like to show our car off," Bea Dudley said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Cox of Irvine brought her two daughters, Jenny, 13, and Mary Beth, 10, 
and her niece, 5-year-old Laura Benington of Mission Viejo. Cox, a second-grade 
teacher at Mission Viejo's Philip J. Reilly Elementary School, brought the 
family members to march in a group for the Friends of the Mission Viejo 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to support the community and the library -- and reading," Cox said. 
"I'm surprised at how big an event this is."

INVESTIGATORS SEEK ENGINE COVER AFTER WESTSIDE PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal investigators are searching for a plane part that may have contributed 
to a Friday night crash near Santa Monica Airport that killed one man and 
injured another. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-seat Piper 28 had apparently experienced engine trouble after takeoff 
and later crashed into an unoccupied Westside home.The pilot of the 
single-engine plane has said that the plane's cowling, which is similar to a 
car hood, came loose and blocked his vision, causing him to lose control, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old pilot was in fair condition Saturday at UCLA Medical Center 
with a broken leg and second-degree burns, a hospital spokesman said. The 
Federal Aviation Administration declined to identify the pilot, and the name of 
the passenger who died was not available.  
</P>
<P>
 The pilot was not a student, as reported earlier, but holds a commercial pilot 
certificate and was flying his private plane, said Wayne Pollack, of the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
 An FAA spokeswoman said the missing cowling is believed to be a brown, 
half-moon-shaped piece, probably about three feet wide if intact. Anyone who 
finds it is asked to contact the FAA at (213) 772-5711 or the NTSB at 
310-297-1041.

MAN SHOT, INJURED IN ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE

<P>
 A 26-year-old man was shot and critically wounded by a Los Angeles police 
officer Saturday after he pointed a loaded revolver at the officer, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried F. Trinidad, who was shot once in the shoulder, was taken to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, said Lt. John Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinidad was in critical condition late Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 3:40 p.m. near Haskell Avenue and Stagg Street 
when two Metro Division officers noticed two men standing at the back gate of 
Easton Aluminum, Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the men apparently saw the officers and fled, police said. Trinidad, 
who is employed at the company, stayed behind and pointed a gun at one of the 
officers. Trinidad then ran into a lunchroom, where he surrendered to officers, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer T. D. Surette, 36, a nine-year veteran of the LAPD, fired the shot 
that wounded Trinidad. The officer was not hurt, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police at first identified Trinidad as a suspected gang member, but later said 
they were unsure whether the wounded man belongs to a gang. JEANNETTE REGALADO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; DISTRICT ANNOUNCES STAFF RESTRUCTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fillmore school officials announced a major administrative restructuring last 
week, shortly after the state released the results of a new test that ranked 
the district's students among the lowest in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, we are calling ourselves to action," Assistant Supt.Mario 
Contini said. Contini will take over as the district's top administrator this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuffle, effective July 1, will elevate Piru Elementary School Principal 
Jane Kampbell to assistant superintendent. Marsha Porter, principal at Sespe 
Elementary School, will take over Kampbell's job. Susan Dollar, now a teacher 
at Sespe, will become the Sespe principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Contini said he chose Kampbell as his second-in-command, rather than an 
outsider, because of the excellent job she had done at Piru. In last spring's 
statewide exams, Piru fourth-graders achieved some of the highest scores in the 
district on the reading test and even surpassed statewide averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter will move to Piru, he said, to provide continuity and allow the school 
to continue its improvements. CONSTANCE SOMMER

RED CROSS TEEN VOLUNTEERS MAKE MOST OF DISASTER; PREPAREDNESS: 60 YOUTHS, SOME 
OF WHOM SERVED DURING RECENT EMERGENCIES, HONED THEIR SKILLS AT TUSTIN HIGH 
DRILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seventeen-year-old Maggie Long rushed around the Tustin High School gymnasium 
Saturday morning, overseeing teen-agers setting up 50 green and blue cots, 
organizing first aid, and helping to calm distressed "refugees." 
</P>
<P>
 But Long, a Red Cross youth volunteer, wasn't responding to a real-life 
calamity. Instead, she was practicing the role of a shelter manager in the 
aftermath of a mock 6.5 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The "victims" she was helping were actually other Red Cross youth volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't simulate it perfectly, but when we do this they'll at least have a 
vague idea of what happens," said Peggy-Sue Ellis, the director of the Youth in 
Emergency Services section of the Orange County chapter of the Red Cross.  
</P>
<P>
 The teens playing the roles of pregnant, deaf and amnesiac survivors, as well 
as those acting as shelter workers, got a taste of disaster chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 60 teen-agers who participated in Saturday's drill had used 
earlier training in actual catastrophes.  
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old sophomore at Corona del Mar High School, Long helped set up the 
shelter at her campus during last fall's Laguna Beach wildfire. And she put in 
several 12-hour days in January watching children and monitoring activities in 
a San Fernando Valley earthquake shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got our shelter training just two days before the fire," said Long, who is 
the vice president of her school's Red Cross Club. "When I worked during the 
fire, people had money to find places to live. But in the earthquake, it was 
really sad. The earthquake took everything they had." 
</P>
<P>
 Other county Red Cross chapters have teen-agers who are trained as disaster 
volunteers, but only Orange County has a separate section organized just for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,700 county teen-agers have become volunteers by joining Red Cross 
clubs at their schools, where they were taught cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
and how to stay calm during a campus emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The teens are expected to know how to set up a shelter in their school's 
gymnasium, call adult Red Cross volunteers and get more supplies. But they are 
also called upon in larger, communitywide emergencies such as the Laguna fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just administering bandages," Hughes said as she oversaw 
Saturday's drill. "It's also self-esteem building. . . . They learn listening 
skills, how to take charge and how to delegate." 
</P>
<P>
 Some teen-agers created a computer database listing which youth volunteers 
speak a second language in addition to English. Their foresight made it easy to 
find Spanish-speaking student volunteers to translate for some San Fernando 
Valley quake victims who spoke only Spanish. Others speak Korean, Mandarin and 
Polish. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids who are bilingual and don't speak English in their homes 
have always felt looked down upon," Ellis said. "But when I call them up and 
say, 'You're the one person I need right now,' that makes them feel empowered."

 Ventura police are looking for a teen-ager who stabbed an 18-year-old Domino's 
Pizza employee at the restaurant on East Thompson Boulevard, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Savaglio was working at Domino's Friday night when a youth, described 
as a 15- to 17-year-old white male with brown hair, and several of his friends 
entered the restaurant and confronted Savaglio about a recent arrest of one of 
their friends, Officer Kelly Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fight broke out, and Savaglio was stabbed in the abdomen, Dean said. The 
assailants fled before officers arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 Savaglio was taken to Community Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and 
released Friday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Savaglio told Ventura police officers that he did not know the youth who 
attacked him, but could identify him. He told officers the teen-ager drove away 
in a late-model white car. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 The Ventura County Fire Department is investigating a suspected arson fire 
that burned down a large wooden barn alongside the Ventura River near Ojai on 
Saturday, a department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire that ignited about 2:30 p.m. destroyed the three-story structure at 2 
Puesta Del Sol, causing $75,000 in damage, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors reported seeing smoke and then large flames whipped by the strong 
afternoon winds. As ash from the fire dropped from the sky, a few of those 
living in the area took the precaution of watering down areas around their 
homes, according to the fire official. 
</P>
<P>
 Three engines responded to the blaze, but firefighters were unable to save the 
building, the spokeswoman said. The damage estimate includes $25,000 in farm 
equipment. No one was injured in the fire. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BOARD OKS TOUGHER 9TH-GRADE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District Board has tentatively approved a new 
policy to get tough with ninth-graders who earn less than a C average in the 
first semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said last week that they agree with the proposal put forward by 
a team of top district officials as a way to curb the high failure rate among 
first-year students at the district's six high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's tremendous," Trustee Fred Judy said of the new plan. Under the 
proposal, ninth-grade students who fail to earn at least a C average in their 
first semester would be taken out of their regular courses and put into smaller 
classes, where they would be held to rigorous standards of behavior and 
academic performance. Officials hope to put the program in place this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also addresses overall academic performance in the district by 
setting specific standards for all teachers, administrators, students, parents 
and community members to meet in helping students to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said that the key to improving student performance at the high 
schools is to focus on the ninth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first semester of this school year, 38% of the 1,134 freshmen at Oxnard 
district's high schools had a grade-point average of either D or F. And each 
year, about one-fifth of the students in freshman classes are repeating the 
grade. MAIA DAVIS

OVERTURNED DECISIONS FRUSTRATE PLANNERS; GOVERNMENT: THEY SAY THEY ARE STILL A 
KEY LINK. THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL ATTRIBUTES REVERSALS TO FISCAL AND 
POLITICAL CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It appeared, at first, to be a stinging defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 After a marathon session last month, the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission 
ruled that Amgen officials could not proceed with a proposed expansion unless 
they drastically altered their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as Amgen project manager Ed Bjurstrom headed out of the meeting at 3 
a.m., he said he was not fazed by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission has reached its conclusions, but our feeling is that 
the City Council will see this differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjurstrom's confidence was not unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again over the past two years, the Thousand Oaks City Council has 
shoved aside Planning Commission rulings, attributing reversals to financial 
and political concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The barrage of turnabouts, including a recent council ruling in favor of Amgen 
and a vote against a wetlands protection ordinance, has frustrated 
commissioners and led some council members to question the need for the 
planning board to review every project. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the situation in Moorpark two years ago, where planning 
commissioners actually proposed disbanding because their rulings were so rarely 
upheld, Thousand Oaks commissioners say they remain an important link in the 
government process. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 1993, more than a dozen Thousand Oaks Planning Commission 
rulings -- about two-thirds of those heard by both bodies -- have been reversed 
by the council, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
 The reversals included nearly all of the most hotly debated planning decisions 
-- an auto mall sign, a proposed day-care ordinance, Raznick and Cohan 
developments, mobile carwashes, a Texaco carwash, the proposed wetlands 
ordinance and the Amgen project. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several explanations why the commission's decisions have been 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of both groups agree that the dispute stems in large part from the two 
boards' differing roles. The Planning Commission's task is to look in detail at 
projects, while the council looks at broader issues, including the financial 
impacts of development. 
</P>
<P>
 But several commissioners said they have grown increasingly concerned that 
politics is strangling the process at the council level, pushing developer 
needs ahead of the expressed will of the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, they say, is ignoring a 1989 attitude survey which shows that an 
overwhelming majority of Thousand Oaks residents support the preservation of 
open space and oppose development. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I see is politics getting in the way of sound planning," Commissioner 
Linda Parks said. "At the Planning Commission we're talking about one thing -- 
the highest and best use of the land. We're not talking about how much money 
the land will make for the city or for the developer." 
</P>
<P>
 The claim that developers have a grip on the council has been a regular 
complaint of Mayor Elois Zeanah, who several times has fought unsuccessfully to 
uphold commission rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 When the wetlands ordinance failed in the council, Zeanah accused her 
colleagues of caving to the influence of developers. Council members Alex 
Fiore, Frank Schillo and Judy Lazar all dismissed the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Lazar said they did not take campaign money from developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore also objected to the charge and said of Zeanah's voting record: "If you 
vote no on everything like (she and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski) have, you 
would have no city." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the city's business and development lobby, in fact, have argued 
that it is the commission that should be blamed for injecting politics into the 
process. They say a politically tainted Planning Commission has forced them to 
appeal the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a number of times when the commission has just ignored the 
codes and we have no choice but to turn to the council," said Neal Scribner, an 
architect involved in a number of local projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scribner said in one case he had a building rejected by the commission because 
it had three floors, even though it met the code restriction for height. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just decided that 35 feet meant two floors, even though that wasn't in 
the books," Scribner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local developers have become frustrated with the commission because they 
believe it is not ruling strictly on the codes, said Steve Rubenstein, 
executive director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very costly to have to appeal the commission rulings, but a number of 
them have felt they had to," Rubenstein said. "At this point, a lot of people 
feel this procedure is really mixed up." 
</P>
<P>
 To address the problems, both Fiore and Schillo have said they would support 
curtailing the role of the commission on big cases, where the council normally 
is deeply involved in the process anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the larger cases like with Amgen, I'm not sure why we're sending it to the 
Planning Commission," Schillo said. "We just end up getting hit over the head 
by the public who thinks the Planning Commission is the last word on what's 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 But planning commissioners strongly disagreed with that assessment, saying the 
input of the commission is invaluable because of the detail with which they 
review projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at a lot of the small details that might be missed by the staff or 
the council," Parks said. "I really feel strongly that we play a crucial role." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said she believed the split between the council and the commission stems 
in large part from the conflicting votes of Councilwoman Judy Lazar and her 
appointed commissioner, Marilyn Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Parity between the two bodies is often anticipated because each member of the 
council selects a commissioner. But Carpenter and Lazar, more than the other 
pairs, have been voting in opposite directions.  
</P>
<P>
 While Carpenter has voted consistently to curb development, Lazar has several 
times provided the critical vote needed to overturn the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Judy Lazar has changed since she chose (Carpenter) and I think a lot 
of people see that," Parks said. "The evidence is there -- she's consistently 
voting against her own commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said she wished the two bodies were "more often in sync" and said 
she believed planning decisions were "sometimes overridden by economic 
pressures," but she would not comment on the apparent split with Lazar. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar attributed the split to a simple difference of opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "My relationship with Marilyn Carpenter has not changed one bit since I 
appointed her," Lazar said. "She has tremendous experience and I respect her, I 
just don't always agree with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Carpenter: "I don't think that means one of us is wrong. None of the 
issues we are dealing with are black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar, instead, said the ability for the council to weigh economic and social 
factors has led to some discrepancies. It is a sentiment echoed by several 
commissioners, including Chairman Irving Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be confusing to the public, and frankly, it is sometimes confusing to 
us that the commission and the council are bumping into each other the way they 
are," Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in many ways the reason we rule differently is because our 
responsibilities are different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has the latitude to veer away from codes and the General Plan to 
accommodate projects that were not envisioned when restrictions were written 
into the books. 
</P>
<P>
 And, added Commissioner Mervyn Kopp, the council can take into consideration a 
project's financial impacts, while the commission has to ignore economic 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it ludicrous that we don't have an economic or business element to the 
General Plan," Kopp said. "If we did, we might be able to take that into 
account on a project like Amgen, but for now, we have to pretend it's not a 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said such an addition to the General Plan is in the works, and if the 
commission is able to consider such issues, it may find more parity with the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible remedy to the current situation, in which the Planning 
Commission and council are sending out different messages to the city, involves 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Simi Valley Planning Commissioner Michael Piper said that a similar 
conflict was resolved in his city when the two bodies sat down together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had problems like that periodically, and it has always helped us to sit 
down with the council and get a better understanding of their philosophy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having the council sit down with the commission and give some direction is a 
very useful way of breaking the cycle of reversals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman said he feels there is enough communication between the two bodies 
now. He said the commission needs to stick to its job the way it has been doing 
it in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the procedure appears overly complicated, but if you look at the way 
we've been able to boil down the issues for the council, you would see that 
what we're doing makes sense," Wasserman said. "We may continue to butt heads, 
but that doesn't mean the process is failing."

OFFICIALS HOPE CHUTE WILL TAKE THE FEAR OUT OF RESCUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If jumping into a firefighter's net or climbing down a ladder frightens you, 
the local fire station now has a less-menacing alternative -- scooting down an 
elasticized, body-hugging chute. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by a desire to help the earthquake-ravaged area, an anonymous 
benefactor from Kansas City, Kan., has donated a $25,000 chute to the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department's Fire Station 73, on San Fernando Road at 15th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this could save lives," Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson said. 
"If I'm up there and I have to jump onto a little net, I'm not sure I'd do it. 
But this is something that takes the fear away. It's so easy to go down, you 
feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The gift makes the county the only fire department in the state to have such a 
device, according to Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), who helped 
make arrangements for the donation from the manufacturer of the chute, EVAC 
Systems, Inc. of Prairie Village, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that rescuers have to think about is how a (disaster 
victim) is going to react to being on a ladder," said Battalion Chief Larry 
Rohrer. "If they are afraid, it brings a risk not only to themselves, but also 
to the rescuer." 
</P>
<P>
 While it takes three to four minutes for a person to descend a ladder, the 
chute can evacuate eight to 10 people per minute, Rohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a demonstration Saturday afternoon, firefighters used a mechanized ladder 
to hoist the silver sock-like chute to the edge of a three-story office 
building at 25129 The Old Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, demonstrators scooted down the chute and emerged smiling at the bottom. 
In the end, almost no one could resist taking a turn. McKeon did it. Pederson's 
14-year-old grandson did it. A Times photographer did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the demonstrators took the plunge, an emergency worker and Ken Hubbell, 
chief executive officer of EVAC Systems, made sure the end of the tube was 
twisted, to break thrill-seekers' fall in case they shot through too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference, McKeon reminded journalists of the makeshift efforts to 
evacuate victims of the Northridge Meadows apartment collapse from second- and 
third-story units. People had thrown fire hoses to victims for them to shinny 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would make it much easier, without the risk," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-foot-long chute is made of a space-age, reflective fabric called 
GENTEX-1015, which Hubbell said is fire- and heat-resistant up to temperatures 
of 1,800 degrees. The inner sleeve has an elasticized panel sewn in, which 
grips evacuees' bodies while they are sliding through the tube.

ARTIST WILL LEAVE A TOUCH OF NATURE AT TRAIN STATION; DESIGN: VIQUI MCCASLIN IS 
CHOSEN TO ENHANCE SOLEDAD CANYON ROAD TRANSIT CENTER WITH HER $50,000 PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Train stations and busy public buildings may not seem likely canvasses for 
depicting scenes of nature, but for artist Viqui McCaslin they are perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently selected McCaslin's work from among that of dozens 
of local artists to enhance the Santa Clarita Transit Center on Soledad Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Her design calls for covering two concrete arches at the station with terra 
cotta slabs picturing frolicking antelope amid images of ancient Indian 
feathers. Next to the archways will be a "diminishing watering hole" surrounded 
by the footprints of various wildlife once plentiful in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the creatures that are still out there in the chaparral," McCaslin 
said, referring to the brush-covered hillsides near the Saugus station. "What 
I'm trying to do is to maintain the connection between man and his 
environment."  
</P>
<P>
 McCaslin, a Yaqui Indian, expects to begin work on the project by the end of 
this month and plans to finish sometime this summer. She has worked as an 
artist for 30 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I inherited the family pottery tools," she said, referring to those handed 
down by her grandmother, a Membre Indian. "I feel a very special connection 
through the tools." 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old former archeologist said she draws heavily on her academic and 
work experience as well as her ancestry, in all of her art.  
</P>
<P>
 "I try to make all of my experiences explicable through it," she said. "That's 
my approach." 
</P>
<P>
 The $50,000 project is funded by the city and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority's Art for Rail Transit program, which is funding similar projects at 
nearly a dozen sites throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being pleasing to the eye, McCaslin's work has an unexpected 
educational value, said Alan Nakagawa, who oversees station art projects for 
the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "A train station is not necessarily the kind of place you'd expect to find 
this kind of information," Nakagawa said. "This is the kind of stuff you might 
expect to see in a museum."  
</P>
<P>
 This will not be the first time a public place has served as a canvas for 
McCaslin. Her public portfolio includes a 5,000-square-foot floor mural in 
Santa Barbara's public works building, and other murals in Metrolink stations 
along the recently opened Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of artists make monuments to themselves," she said, explaining her 
penchant for public art. "But I'm a public artist. I've got a message for 
everyone."

MOORPARK HIGH SCHOOL PLACES 6TH IN SUPER QUIZ; EDUCATION: TEAM MEMBERS ARE 
HAPPY WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE STATE ACADEMIC DECATHLON EVENT IN STOCKTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Moorpark High School finished sixth in the State Academic Decathlon's Super 
Quiz on Saturday, leaving the team members pleased with their performance, but 
hoping for higher marks in the competition's other nine events.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did good and I'm happy, " said Moorpark Coach Larry Jones. "It didn't 
matter what they scored, I'm proud of their effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz is the last -- and most pressured -- of the competition's 10 
events. Students demonstrate their mastery of the chosen subject by answering 
10 oral questions, each worth 100 points. Scores are publicly displayed after 
each question. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified, represented by Woodland Hills' Taft High School, and Los 
Angeles County, represented by Torrance's West High School, tied for first 
place in the quiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Second place was taken by Laguna Hills High School, representing Orange 
County, and Bella Vista High School, of Sacramento County. Casa Grande High, of 
Sonoma County, came in third. 
</P>
<P>
 Final scores in the other nine events will be announced at an award's banquet 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's quiz topic, "The Documents of Freedom," tested students' knowledge 
of excerpts from historical documents, including the Magna Carta, the 
Declaration of Independence, Frederick Douglass' Address to the Massachusetts 
Anti-Slavery Society, and the Camp David Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 While their teammates, parents and friends looked on, three sets of three 
students from each of the 43 teams were given seven seconds to choose the 
correct answer to multiple-choice questions asking what penal code Gandhi was 
prosecuted under, the attitude of the Mayflower Compact colonists toward King 
James and why the preamble of the United Nations Charter says people should 
unite in strength and live in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The decathlon began Friday, with the students taking written tests in math, 
fine arts, economics, science, literature and social studies. After a short 
break Friday night for the traditional social, in which the students exchange 
tokens symbolizing their home region, the teen-agers were back to their work 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Super Quiz, the students wrote a 60-minute essay, gave a 
four-minute prepared speech, a two-minute impromptu speech and underwent a 
seven-minute interview with a panel of judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the competition, Jones said he was somewhat disheartened both by 
the kind of advantage afforded to some teams and by what he and other coaches 
have called unusually difficult tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were asking square roots and not letting them use calculators," Jones 
said at the competition's Friday night ice cream social. "It's discouraging. 
They've worked so hard and then they get questions they couldn't answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The team -- the first group to ever represent the high school at the state 
level -- drove to Stockton in a van Thursday, only to discover that several of 
the heavily favored teams flew into town early in the week to assure extra 
practice time. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, in between events, the team sprawled out in the hotel room of 
Jonathan Buxton, 17, and Jordan Sickman, 18. One group played poker -- 
seven-card stud -- to let off steam. Katie Krzyzewski, 17, gleefully announced 
that the Ventura County team was planning to host a statewide pillow fight 
after the day's events were over. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least they're having a good time," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for the Moorpark team were Beth Wershba, Nimesh Narayan, Krista 
Wipff, Jason Gray, Minerva Partida and Lisa Reid, all seniors. Alternate team 
members were Bryan Gauger and Jennifer Malella. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been awesome," Beth said. "The fact that you spend all this time 
studying and can still come up here and have fun, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 The winning team will go on to represent California at the U.S. Academic 
Decathlon in Newark, N.J., in April.

PRISON TOWN LOCKED INTO ROLE AS HOME TO NATION'S TOUGHEST FELONS; COLORADO: 
FLORENCE CAMPAIGNED FOR THE FEDERAL COMPLEX, WHICH INCLUDES A MAXIMUM-SECURITY 
SECTION THAT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COMMUNITY IS MAKING CRIME PAY.

<P>
 Crime may not pay, but having criminals as neighbors has certainly helped the 
residents of Florence pay some bills. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to prisons, many communities develop the "nimby" syndrome (not 
in my back yard). 
</P>
<P>
 Not Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 A new prison complex helped the town buy a new water system. It helped restore 
the Rialto Theatre, and it helped residents build a new golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt crime pays," said Darrell Lindsey, executive director of the 
Florence Chamber of Commerce. "Florence is on the map big-time." 
</P>
<P>
 The town's fortunes rose when the federal government announced it was trying 
to find a home for a $168.5-million prison complex to house some of the 
nation's toughest criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of this southern Colorado community of 3,450 raised more than 
$130,000, bought the land and staked their claim. The federal government liked 
the arrangement and built prisons to accommodate more than 2,300 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the complex is a new maximum-security federal penitentiary still 
under construction. It will house 484 criminals, described by the government as 
the "most difficult inmates to manage." It will replace the penitentiary at 
Marion, Ill. Before that, Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay housed the nation's 
worst inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the inmates at Marion have a history of murder, and a fourth of 
them have a history of prison murder. Only 3% have no history of escape, 
assault or murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex also includes a 500-bed minimum-security federal prison camp, 
which opened in July; an 818-bed medium-security prison that opened in January 
and is already over capacity, and a 1,024-bed, high-security penitentiary 
scheduled to open early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the inmates in the medium-security prison are serving time for 
drug and liquor violations, 14% for robbery, and 10% for arms, explosives and 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
 For many residents, it was a marriage made in heaven. The area already is home 
to eight of the state Department of Corrections' 16 prisons, and 3,320 of the 
Colorado system's 7,416 beds. But most of them are located closer to Canon City 
to the north, a rival for prison commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new federal prison, Florence residents say they've now overtaken 
Canon City as the state prison capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been as big a success as we would have liked, but it's better than 
we hoped for," says Bob Wood, editor of the weekly Florence Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 County sales tax revenues have risen 11.2%, compared with 1987, and city sales 
tax revenues are up 16.7%. More than 60 new homes are being built, at prices 
ranging from $75,000 to $115,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city also acquired its second traffic light, and it's tough to find 
parking, especially on payday. The city even recorded its first gang fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence City Manager Ken Bruch predicted it will take about five years for 
the full impact of the new prison to hit the community. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials toured a similar federal facility in Sheridan, Ore., and hoped 
to learn from that community's experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruch said the biggest mistake Florence has made so far is failing to lure 
home builders. As a result, nearby Canon City, Pueblo and even Colorado 
Springs, 50 miles to the northeast, reaped many of the benefits of the new 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison hired 170 local workers and transferred 160 from around the nation. 
Of those, 177 located in Fremont County, 86 in Pueblo County, and 67 in El Paso 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we made a mistake, it was in not getting housing construction started 
sooner," Bruch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager said the town won't repeat one mistake it made earlier this 
century, relying for jobs on the coal and oil industries, which went bust in 
the early 1900s and again in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coal mining went downhill because of environmental problems, and oil fields 
don't last forever," Bruch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prisons are more stable. Prisons have been here for more than 100 years, and 
I guess they'll always be here." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than 300 minimum-security inmates have moved into the prison 
camp. The facility's new medium-security prison is bursting at the seams with 
more than 1,140 inmates, and looks more like a college campus than a prison. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 inmates work in the prison's furniture factory, making office 
chairs for government agencies. Inmates earn up to $1.15 an hour, and receive a 
credit card that can be used in the prison commissary to purchase such items as 
tennis shoes and jogging shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility has two staff physicians, two dentists and eight physicians' 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week, inmates can get all the soft drinks they want and graze the 
fruit bar and salad bar. Staff members get the same food as the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates also can obtain government grants to pay for college courses in 
business management. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards carry no guns inside the fence to reduce tensions with inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The college campus atmosphere is not the image we'd like to foster," said 
Julie W. Alba, executive assistant of the Federal Correctional Institution. 
But, she added, "For a medium-security facility, it works better to have a 
physical structure more open. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image looks nice, but it's hard to get the flavor of what it means to 
spend 10 years here."

OFFICIALS BACK PUBLIC GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials will ask supervisors on Tuesday to invite proposals from golf 
course developers to build an 18-hole public course at Camarillo Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The course would be built on 327 acres of vacant land that the county targeted 
for a community park when it acquired the land in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county cannot afford to build the park facilities, in part because 
voters in 1990 rejected a statewide bond that would have provided $1 million 
for the facilities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the General Services Agency commissioned a study to determine whether 
a public golf course is feasible on the site, situated between the Camarillo 
Springs subdivision and Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis found that more than 65,000 Ventura County golfers play 1.2 
million rounds of golf each year. Another 300,000 rounds are played by 
out-of-town golfers, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study showed demographic and economic support for the development of 
eight additional public golf courses in the county," recreation manager Blake 
Boyle wrote in his report to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle said the agency has received numerous inquiries from golf development 
companies interested in building a golf course at Camarillo Regional Park, or 
elsewhere in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public golf course development is viewed as an excellent investment 
opportunity in Southern California, even in this period of prolonged 
recession," Boyle said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local team won the championship in an age-group swimming meet last month in 
Arizona, where 25 teams from Arizona, California and Nevada competed. 
</P>
<P>
 Six swimmers from the Southern California Aquatics Assn. of Tustin won medals 
in the Lost Dutchman invitational swimming championship held at Arizona State 
University's swim stadium Feb. 18 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Utsumi captured the gold in the boys 13- to 14-year-old bracket to lead 
the Tustin team to the overall championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of Utsumi's teammates won a silver, and one received a bronze. Fifty-five 
swimmers represented the team, which is also the Orange County champion. The 
silver medalists were Cory Tague, Robert Arroyo, Maikhanh Nguyen and Jarrod 
Cruzat. Chris Meyer won a bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great team effort," said Everett Uchiyama, the team's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which has 150 members, works out at the Foothill and Tustin high 
school pools. There are 115 members from Tustin and Santa Ana. The rest are 
from around the county, Uchiyama said. BERT ELJERA

OXNARD ACCOUNTANT ACCUSED OF HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard accountant has been named in a $3-million lawsuit alleging that he 
sexually harassed and assaulted an employee for six months until she was forced 
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint against David M. Daggett also alleges that he continued to 
sexually harass Connie Ornelas by phone at her next job after she had stopped 
working for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Daggett said Ornelas was a disgruntled former employee and he denied ever 
assaulting or harassing the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a total shock to me," he said. "It's outlandish. I'm totally 
befuddled about how an individual who was a very good employee could get so 
upset over leaving my employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ornelas and her husband, Steve Ornelas, filed the suit last week in Ventura 
County Superior Court, asking a judge to award them $1.5 million in general 
damages and another $1.5 million in punitive damages. It also seeks court 
costs, legal fees and other damages. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, Ornelas worked for Daggett between May, 1989, and 
September, 1993, when she finally was forced to quit. The alleged harassment 
did not begin until March, 1993, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daggett repeatedly "engaged in a course of conduct attempting to sexually 
seduce his female employees," according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 It also contends that Daggett at one point picked up Ornelas and ran with her 
down a hall into his office. On another occasion, the suit said, Daggett pulled 
the woman onto his lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Steve Pell, who represents the woman and her husband, could not be 
reached for comment.

ORANGE TENTATIVELY OKS TERM-LIMITS PLAN; POLITICS: CITY WANTS TO JOIN LAGUNA 
NIGUEL IN URGING LEGISLATORS TO GRANT GENERAL-LAW CITIES THE POWER TO RESTRICT 
LENGTH OF SERVICE FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange is poised to become the county's second city to call for legislation 
that would allow general law cities to establish term limits for their city 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, only cities with charters can legally set term limits. Voters 
in such chartered cities as Santa Ana and Anaheim have approved term limits for 
their councils. So-called general law cities, usually smaller in population, do 
not have the authority to enact term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange wants to join Laguna Niguel in pressuring state legislators to grant 
general law cities the power to impose term limits on council members. Laguna 
Niguel passed a term-limits measure in February. On a 5-0 vote Tuesday, the 
Orange City Council tentatively approved a similar resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Councilman Mike Spurgeon, a staunch advocate of term limits, said 
council members should be restricted to two terms of four years, while a mayor 
should be held to three two-year terms. According to the proposal, a person 
could serve on the City Council, and also as mayor, before being ineligible to 
run again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That gives somebody 14 years to do what they want to do if they plan it 
right," said Spurgeon, who introduced the matter Tuesday afternoon. "If they 
can't do it in that time, there are plenty of other people waiting to do it 
with fresh perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, in a non-binding "advisory" election, 86% of Orange voters cast 
ballots to establish term limits on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the advisory election, Orange voters continue to reelect their 
city officials beyond what proposed term limits would allow. Mayor Gene Beyer 
has served 2 1/2 terms as a council member and, most recently, two terms as 
mayor. Fred Barrera has been on the council since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurgeon said that because of the election results, he feels a moral 
obligation to step down when his two terms on the council are up -- regardless 
of whether a term limit law has been passed. Spurgeon was appointed to the 
council in 1990 and was elected to the body in 1992.

L.A. COMMUNITIES VIE FOR $100 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING; DEVELOPMENT: THE 
LOCAL EMPOWERMENT ZONE WILL INCLUDE ONLY A FRACTION OF THE CITY'S IMPOVERISHED 
AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A multimillion-dollar federal empowerment zone that would promote economic 
development in Los Angeles will likely be carved into several portions, and 
communities across the city are already jockeying for their piece. 
</P>
<P>
 With its combination of $100 million for social programs and tax incentives 
for businesses in poor areas, the empowerment zone will be the most significant 
federal community-development program in more than 20 years. Although the 
economic effects could be diluted, council members and other city officials 
have said the zone will likely be broken into three pieces, which is permitted 
under federal regulations so long as half the census tracts have poverty rates 
of 35% or more and the total population does not exceed 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how it is carved up, the 20-square-mile zone will still exclude an 
overwhelming majority of the eligible areas covering 80 square miles in Los 
Angeles. And as a May 15 deadline approaches for the City Council to prepare a 
draft report on which communities will benefit, the battles among competing 
interests have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it won't get too ugly," said Reynold Blight, director of state 
enterprise zone programs for the city's Community Development Department.  
</P>
<P>
 A preview of the competing neighborhood interests came during a March 3 
council hearing, when groups from Watts to Boyle Heights and from Wilmington to 
Pacoima argued to be part of the zone. The hearing was held in advance of a 
Community Development Department report expected to be given this week to the 
council. That report will recommend the areas to be included in the city's 
application to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which must 
be turned in by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all fighting for this piece of pie, and I don't know if there is enough 
money to satisfy us all," said Richard Marshall, a member of the Community 
Advisory Council to the 9th Council District in South-Central. He was among 
about 120 people at the hearing of the council's Community and Economic 
Development Committee and the Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, 
which will recommend zone locations to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been neglected worse than any of these other poverty areas in the 
city," Marshall told council members, arguing for a zone along Central Avenue 
from 5th Street to Slauson Avenue. "I feel we deserve special consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 But the same argument is being made by advocates of a zone on the Eastside, 
who say the only infrastructure development in their area has been the 
construction of freeways that have broken up the neighborhoods of Boyle 
Heights, El Sereno and Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're lobbying for our future," said Frank Villalobos, president of Barrio 
Planners Inc., one of 19 community groups representing the Eastside at the 
March 3 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 groups presented an economic study identifying a five-square-mile area 
with 33,000 residents for consideration as part of the zone. Villalobos said 
the area includes the industrial section of Boyle Heights and runs along the 
Los Angeles River near several freeways and railroad lines, which makes it well 
suited for economic development. The area is also part of a state enterprise 
zone, which provides state tax breaks to businesses within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The same argument is being made by the Los Angeles Community Empowerment 
Collaborative, a coalition of more than 40 community and business organizations 
near USC that formed in November to push for inclusion in the federal program. 
The group wants a portion of the empowerment zone to overlap the city's 
four-square-mile Central City state enterprise zone near USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report submitted to the council, Central City advocates say their area's 
per capita income of $5,407 is the lowest of the city's five state enterprise 
zones and cite the area's proximity to the university and its existing 
industrial and transportation infrastructure as major advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our area has strong economic development potential and many community-based 
organizations," said Ezekiel Mobley, executive director of the Central City 
South Assn. of Commerce and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the problem, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has said 
it wants to file a joint application with the city, possibly for the 
Watts-Willowbrook or Florence-Firestone areas bordering the two jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal empowerment zone program, the city would be allowed to spend 
the $100 million for programs ranging from child care to job training. Also, 
businesses in the zone will be eligible to receive a host of tax incentives.

VIGILANTE'S BASE AT SHOP INVESTIGATED; VAN NUYS: MARY LOU HOLTE HAS USED A 
DOUGHNUT BUSINESS AS HEADQUARTERS FOR FIGHTING CRIME. NOW LOS ANGELES POLICE 
ARE CALLING IT A PUBLIC NUISANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based in a doughnut shop in a crime-plagued Van Nuys neighborhood, Mary Lou 
Holte has been acclaimed by Barbara Walters, Larry King and the Wall Street 
Journal as a force for good, a citizen crime-buster who stands up to street 
thieves and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holte now finds that the Los Angeles Police Department has called the shop 
a magnet for crime, branded it a public nuisance and asked that its operations 
be sharply restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of police and neighbors, a city zoning official recently 
decided to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Holte, who does not work at the shop but has made it her base of operations 
for street patrols for five years, said rivals are trying to "blow me away from 
the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we just take Mary Lou and shoot her down?" Holte said. "They're 
trying to do this just to get me away." 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing personal, said police Capt. James McMurray. Police have pursued 
similar action against dozens of businesses, and McMurray said the primary 
concern remains the presence of suspected criminals and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She talks to them," said McMurray, who commands the Van Nuys station. "It's 
like she's gathering intelligence, but it's certainly not like she's driving 
them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop provides "the same haven for the street people that are preying on 
the citizens of the neighborhood," McMurray said. "If a prostitute sees a cop 
coming, she runs in and buys a cup of coffee and a doughnut. That makes it kind 
of hard to remove them from the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighbors filed complaints about the Sepulveda Boulevard shop, 
Orville's Originals, along with California Coin Laundry, located in the same 
mini-mall. McMurray said he wanted zoning officials to implement the same 
restrictions that were imposed against a convenience market in the shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the city forced the convenience store to cut back its 24-hour 
schedule to 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays, closing at midnight on 
Sundays. The store also was forced to hire a security guard for the night 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The request has also puzzled Ulysses Contedor, the owner of the doughnut shop 
for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prostitutes come into my store for doughnuts, coffee, but never do their job 
here," he said. "For me, this place is as safe as any place in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Contedor also blamed Holte. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not good for me," Contedor said of Holte. "Before she came here, I had 
no problems. The city did not say, 'I want to cut the hours at your store.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holte, 45, says she began her crusade against street crime after she was 
nearly raped while walking home from Valley College. When she is not walking 
Sepulveda with her flashlight and note pad in search of possible criminal 
activity, Holte keeps an eye out for trouble from the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 She reports the license plates of suspected criminals, confronts those she 
suspects of illegal activity and occasionally calls police for help from the 
doughnut shop. She has made one citizen's arrest there. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Holte, who is on disability, has been hailed in the national media 
for her crime-fighting exploits. Barbara Walters lauded her as a "fantastic . . 
. one-woman vigilance team" on ABC's "20/20" and the Wall Street Journal called 
her the "Vigilante of Van Nuys."  
</P>
<P>
 She was featured on the nationally syndicated "Jerry Springer Show" in 
Chicago, has done numerous radio interviews and received the Doberman Award 
from a lock manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media made Mary Lou," Contedor said. "She comes in, but she doesn't have 
any power." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Holte says. She claims to have talked several prostitutes out of their 
line of work. She also said that she works extensively with local police in 
reporting suspicious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have definitely helped the police clean up a lot of the crime," Holte said. 
"When I go into the doughnut shop, they clear out. (The criminals) know 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray acknowledges that Holte has occasionally been a valuable tipster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Holte said McMurray is "biased" because of her criticisms of the 
police in the media and that complaining neighbors are "jealous" of her recent 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, she says, is that the alcohol sales in the mini-mall still lure 
undesirables. At the same time, police are unresponsive to her calls, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot tell you how many times we have called the police and they have not 
showed up," Holte said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holte's crime-fighting calls for help may come back to haunt her. 
Associate Zoning Administrator Horace Tramel said he will investigate the 
number of calls for help from the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume of police response is an indication of the problem," Tramel said. 
"That's one of the things we use in determining where to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Holte says she does not plan to go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is going to intimidate me and nobody is going to control me and I'm 
not going to stop what I'm doing," she said. "You don't get the awards and you 
don't get the national attention if you've done something wrong."

ROBERTI RECALL IS A GUN-CONTROL VENDETTA; TAB TO PUNISH THE SENATOR MAY REACH 
$1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the start, it has been painfully obvious that the goal of the effort to 
recall Sen. David A. Roberti from office was to punish him for his longstanding 
and sensible support of tighter gun control laws. The April 12 referendum on 
Roberti is a political vendetta that will cost cash-strapped Los Angeles County 
(and its taxpayers) between $800,000 and $1 million to conduct. It is all the 
more ridiculous because Roberti is set to leave office anyway, in December, 
because of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle plan for any bona fide recall election effort involves providing as 
many good reasons as possible for voting elected representatives out of office 
before their terms expire. The vengeful, wasteful, gun lobby-inspired effort to 
oust Roberti seems to have missed that point entirely. Purposefully or 
inadvertently, Roberti's foes have provided some of the best arguments for 
defeating their recall attempt. They have also generated great fodder for the 
kind of gun control legislation Roberti has fought so hard for, and for the 
almost total ban on private gun ownership supported by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was the $12,500 in guns stolen from the Van Nuys apartment of a 
recall backer last month. "It really makes me a little nervous," said William 
A. Dominguez after the break-in, in which burglars escaped with seven rifles, 
including three semiautomatics, four pistols and four shotguns. "I'm not a 
paranoid type, but I actually have a feeling it (the burglary) was politically 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 We've got some news. According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & 
Firearms, there are five main ways that armed career criminals obtain their 
weapons. The second most common way is through criminal acts, such as 
burglaries. Care to guess what the most common method is? It's from 
off-the-street sales through the black market. Many of those sales involve 
stolen weapons that had first been legally acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the guns that fall into the hands of juveniles are found at home, 
tucked away in supposedly safe places by parents or siblings. One juvenile last 
year found a ready supply of handguns in the glove compartments of the cars he 
broke into. Those weapons had been purchased as collector's items or for home- 
or self-defense. They wound up being used for something else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the Roberti recall backers came up with an incredibly stupid idea from a 
public relations vantage point: raising money for the recall effort by -- you 
guessed it -- raffling off more guns. Among the top prizes was a copycat 
semiautomatic assault rifle, a virtual twin of one of 67 weapons singled out in 
the legislative ban on such military-style firearms that Roberti co-sponsored 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The raffle brought attention to the fact that gun manufacturers have skirted 
the ban by changing model numbers or slightly altering a design. One such 
copycat was used in July by Gian Luigi Ferri to kill eight people in a San 
Francisco office tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the effort to obtain state Republican Party support for the Roberti 
recall ought to raise some eyebrows. It brought attention to the fact that some 
of the state's most prominent Republicans want nothing to do with the recall, 
or think of it as a potential waste of resources. Gov. Pete Wilson, for 
example, praised Roberti for his help in passing the state budget and steered a 
wide berth around the recall. "We have a shortage of funds," said state Sen. 
Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), "and should be putting our money into races where we have 
a better chance of winning." And this from Republican political consultant Paul 
Clarke: "Why should the party waste its time on a recall?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even recall leader Russ Howard admits that the raffle idea "came at a bad 
time." We'll go one further. The recall itself is a badly timed and very lousy 
idea, one that should be soundly defeated at the polls.

FAVORING THE 'FLIP' SIDE OF CRIME FIGHTING; SHOP OWNER HAS A TIRELESS APPROACH 
TO RIDDING AREA OF PROSTITUTION, DRUGS AND TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent weeks, we have lamented the case of feuding Neighborhood Watch 
groups whose members were unable to find common ground against the real foes: 
prostitution and drug crimes along Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys. That 
includes one gadfly whose increasingly annoying efforts are apparently causing 
problems for one of the businesses she is supposedly trying to assist. 
</P>
<P>
 As a counterweight, we are pleased to note the efforts of one Philip (Flip) 
Smith, tire shop owner and rather tireless (sorry) founder of the Sepulveda 
Boulevard Business Watch. Los Angeles Police Department officials say that 
Smith and his organization have done more than most to fight crime and urban 
decay in that part of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 While some establishments -- most recently five local hotels -- have had to be 
ordered by city officials to help thwart crime, Smith's group has persuaded 
businesses to voluntarily improve lighting and security measures. When it was 
apparent that prostitutes and drug dealers were using pay telephones to ply 
their trade, Smith was responsible for the move to reprogram those telephones 
so they could not receive incoming calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Smith's group worked with a homeowners association and the 
Sepulveda Boulevard-area Neighborhood Watch to draft petitions to send to local 
and state politicians. The petitions urged lawmakers to come up with measures 
to fight prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's work last year included getting local businesses to clean up 
trash-strewn median strips on the boulevard. "The city can't afford to take 
care of the medians," Smith said. And there was Smith, last August, trumpeting 
the need for businesses to inspect themselves for -- you guessed it -- 
potential earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly, Smith stresses the need for citizens to work together with 
police to fight crime. Perhaps others will begin to listen to him.

MISSING THE POINT ON WATER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The "point that seems to be missed" about the two-tiered DWP water rates in 
your editorial "Clear Thinking About Water" (March 6) is that residents with 
large properties in the Valley should not be overcharged for keeping their 
grounds beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be like charging Lancaster and Santa Clarita residents who commute 
to Los Angeles $3 per gallon of gas just because they drive farther to work, 
then giving the $4-million surplus to the oil companies! What's fair about 
that?

THE TIMES IGNORES THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Latinos of Los Angeles finally came out to the streets to protest the 
way some conservatives and liberals alike are attacking with racial fury the 
immigrants of this frontier land. The Valley Edition of the Los Angeles Times 
did not report this event. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration, which took place on a sunny Feb. 26, was organized by 
Proposition One Coalition, a network of political, religious and community 
organizations which have the common objective of reforming the current 
immigration law and stopping anti-immigrant hysteria of this recessionary time. 
</P>
<P>
 Aztecs, Mayans, Mexicans, Central and South Americans showed something 
distinctly different from previous demonstrations. The symbols, the political 
language, were more audacious and aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 To ignore this demonstration creates the perception that the editorial policy 
of the Los Angeles Times coalesces with that of those who attempt to reinforce 
the political and social invisibility of the immigrant community. 
</P>
<P>
 The undocumented and documented immigrants (and this technical difference is 
irrelevant in terms of human rights) were in this demonstration with their real 
faces, real names, surrounded by real families and real children. They were 
there to deny their invisibility to all those who wanted to listen. The Times 
ignored them.

QUAKE CONFUSION SHOWS NEED TO LEARN ENGLISH

our ancestors' languages and practice their religions and traditions, it is our 
duty to learn to communicate in the tongue of our adopted country.

 After the earthquake, many people desperately needed help only to be thwarted 
by their lack of ability to speak and understand English. This was compounded 
by the severe shortage of interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 Please learn English before the next disaster.

DON'T FORGET ABOUT SHERMAN OAKS; COMMUNITY'S LOSSES, AND REASONS BEHIND THEM, 
MUST BECOME LESSONS LEARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many San Fernando Valley residents and workers are fed up with quake 
sightseers and gawkers. Not Sandy Turner, marketing director at the 
still-closed Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall. "I try to get as many people as 
possible to drive around here," Turner says, "I don't think that people realize 
how severe the damage was in Sherman Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake's images are recalled, folks obviously think of Northridge, and 
of Reseda, the two communities closest to the epicenter. They even think of 
Santa Monica. Using the I-to-XII Mercalli scale that records seismic shaking, 
however, one finds that Sherman Oaks registered a IX, just as high as 
epicentral Northridge and Reseda, and comparable to San Francisco in 1906 (VII 
and greater) and New Madrid, Missouri in 1811-12 (VII and greater). 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks was devastated, according to homeowner association president 
Richard Close. Jeff Brain, past president of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of 
Commerce, has looked at monetary damage tallies that dwarf the combined amounts 
of Studio City, Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills. Fifth District City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky says that the monetary damage in Sherman Oaks is 
greater than in Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 We note this as a reminder to all of those involved in the Gargantuan 
earthquake relief process: When you think of communities in need, mention 
Sherman Oaks in the same breath as the more well-known sites of devastation in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the rebuilding effort might also beware of a reason for the 
severity of the quake toll. One part of the Valley subject to liquefaction, and 
more severe damage, because of soil conditions starts at Balboa Boulevard and 
runs, largely unbroken, east along Ventura Boulevard all the way to Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard. The area's preference for soft-story construction, in which a 
building's first floor serves as its parking garage, should also be 
reconsidered in light of the earthquake. Sherman Oaks' losses, and the reasons 
behind them, must now become part of the lessons learned from that temblor 
named for Northridge.

REMEMBERING A TEACHER WHO TAUGHT ABOUT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was saddened to learn that my most memorable and inspiring junior high 
school teacher passed away in February. 
</P>
<P>
 During my stint at Portola Junior High School (1962 through 1965), Wilbur 
Hanson nurtured the school's senior council with invaluable lessons in 
leadership and life, lessons which have guided many of us to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Mr. Hanson was consulted when the 1963 yearbook staff conceived its 
"Recipe for Success": "One cup of courage, one chunk of enthusiasm, one 
half-pint ambition, one heaping tablespoon of honesty, one half-cup of 
knowledge and a pinch of personality. Blend knowledge and ambition together. 
Add courage and honesty. Melt a chunk of enthusiasm and combine all ingredients 
together. Add a pinch of personality and mix well. Pour into a nine-inch pan of 
destiny and bake for a lifetime. Check progress at intervals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Parthenians of Portola have lost their inspirational mentor. Goodby, Mr. 
Hanson.

BEILENSON BACKERS MAKE THEIR POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 * I appreciate The Times' giving so much publicity to Richard Sybert, the most 
likely challenger of Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). And now you 
report that the Cable News Network has joined the fight against Beilenson as 
well (Political Briefing, March 4).Good! 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson is dangerous in that he is not controlled by any special interests 
and will not accept funds from political action committees. If he keeps winning 
elections to Congress with no obligation to anyone other than his constituents 
and his conscience, it could set a dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the only one from California in either house of Congress to behave in 
this un-American manner. Lets get rid of him before other politicians think 
they can be elected without special-interest money.

 I find the buying of an election both offensive and an abuse of our unique

ANTONOVICH DOESN'T BACK HIS TRANSIT REBUTTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * County Supervisor Michael Antonovich claims that my Feb. 6 letter 
criticizing his monorail proposal contained several glaring misstatements. 
However, his Feb. 27 rebuttal fails to indicate what these misstatements were. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote: "Your reader incorrectly states that monorails are used exclusively 
as transportation to airports or through amusement parks. . . . In Orlando, 
Fla., a monorail serves more than 150,000 people daily. In Japan, more than 
211,000 . . . " The Orlando system is in Disney World (and was not operating 
the entire week I visited last). The Japanese system is an airport feeder. 
</P>
<P>
 I was perfectly aware of the intense community opposition to a surface line. 
However, as I pointed out, the legitimate concerns of the surface-line 
opponents have been successfully mitigated in other West Coast cities. It won't 
be easy, due to the mishandling of the issue over the years, however it is 
possible to build a line that will enhance the community it serves. Since we 
are talking between $1 billion to $1.5 billion in savings, the hard work needed 
to satisfy community concerns is worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 What really amazes me is why a fiscal conservative like Supervisor Antonovich 
supports such an expensive transit option that we simply cannot afford.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; PLATFORM; TEST'S GOOD MARKS; * SCORES ON THE NEW CALIFORNIA 
LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM TEST WERE RELEASED LAST WEEK. IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR 
FOR THE TEST, WHICH HAS MANY OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS RATHER THAN MULTIPLE-CHOICE 
QUESTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IRENE SMERIGAN is principal of Sylmar Elementary School. She told The Times:  
</P>
<P>
 I like the test. I really do, even though my children did not do particularly 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 It reflects a new trend in education which schools have started to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 I do think it came too soon. We got caught in the crawling stage and the 
scores said, "Aha -- they can't walk." 
</P>
<P>
 What is good about the new test is that it will get the children to think 
rather than just regurgitate facts that a machine will read. 
</P>
<P>
 It definitely puts children whose first language is not English at a 
disadvantage, which is about 40% of my pupils. First of all, this test was 
designed for someone who always used English and was taught in English. For a 
child who was just learning English, they gave him a real big obstacle to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Second of all, we try to work on kids' self-esteem and get them to take risks 
and be independent thinkers. Taking the test is overwhelming to them. It makes 
great verbal demands on them, and it's frustrating and demeaning because they 
know they are not doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the math test puts kids with limited English proficiency at a 
disadvantage. The math problems are all word problems. I'm sure there are 
children here that have very analytical minds and can work any problem you can 
put in front of them. However, they have a difficult time when they are asked 
to write out how they reached the solution. Answering the question requires 
writing, identifying key concepts, sequencing of materials and paragraph 
development. This is different from math computation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, I do like the concept of the test. Businesses want high 
school graduates who can enter the world prepared. Our students are going to 
have to be able to problem-solve, to think logically and put their thoughts in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 I do think something should be done to eliminate the disadvantage to pupils 
with limited English proficiency. The district is going to pilot a Spanish 
version. They will test it in certain schools, although we don't know which 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem more reasonable to give the CLAS test in Spanish to the students 
with limited English proficiency who are in Spanish bilingual programs. The 
others I would test in English. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad part is that these numbers seem to diminish all the hard work that 
goes on here. When scores come out, everyone runs for the hills. The numbers 
always show the public schools are dismal. But I have teachers who work very 
hard. I have children who are focused and want to learn. I have parents who are 
really involved in their child's learning. 
</P>

 HENRY GRADILLAS is principal of Birmingham High School in Van Nuys and a 
former principal at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. He told The 
Times:  
</P>
<P>
 The new California Learning Assessment System test will have a positive impact 
on how we teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when the UC system increased its standards? That put an onus on the 
schools to teach differently. This will have that kind of effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a state-mandated test at Garfield several years ago, Bill Honig, the 
state superintendent of public instruction, announced that there would be a 
financial reward for improvement. I figured we could make some money, so we 
worked very hard on test-taking. My own kid went to a school that showed him 
how to prepare for the SAT. We did the same thing at Garfield, and I said 
anybody who missed the test would take it on Saturday. The kids suddenly became 
very interested, and our school made $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At Birmingham we'll give practice tests in the CLAS format. I don't mean 
"teaching to the test." I do mean teaching the skills necessary for survival, 
and if a test comes along that tests how well you're teaching those skills, I'm 
all for it. I think this test is moving in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 It measures certain skills in reading, so the students have to work on 
analyzing what they've read. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the mathematics questions call for at least a year of algebra and a 
semester of geometry. It was given to 10th-graders, many of which had not taken 
these courses. Once the kids take those courses, they will have the skills they 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 I see some problems with the test, but the No. 1 problem is that it's a new 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Our kids come from so many parts of the world that many of their skills are 
not what they should be for their age and grade. Students who are not native 
English speakers can find the vocabulary difficult. They often have not had 
instruction in their own countries, much less this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The CAP test was more question-and-answer. This test relies on insight and 
coming up with an answer instead of all multiple choice. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose there may be some overemphasis on test scores. But what other 
measure can you use? How else can you know if a kid knows something, except by 
testing? I think this test is telling us, "You'd better change your teaching 
techniques." I think hooray -- it's about time. If we don't do well, let's 
don't blame the test -- we'd better get on the ball.

BACKHANDED COMPLIMENTS TO THE IRISH; IN A TYPICAL CELEBRATION OF RIDICULE, A 
ST. PATRICK'S DAY CARD READS: "WHAT DO YOU CALL AN IRISHMAN ON ST. PATTY'S 
DAY?" ANSWER: "A CAB." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By JOHN R. CARROLL, John R. Carroll is a free-lance writer who lives in Van 
Nuys.

<TEXT>
<P>
 African Americans have February dedicated as Black History Month. Gays and 
lesbians have June as their month of pride. The Chinese and Koreans have entire 
sections of the city dedicated to their history and culture. And here in Los 
Angeles, what do the Irish get? 
</P>
<P>
 Shamrock shakes at McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Patrick's Day is once more upon us. And this means that most of the 
population, whether they even know who Dennis Day is, will be participating in 
the "wearing o' the green," talking about the wee people and trying to drink as 
much Irish coffee as humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
 All the bars on Ventura Boulevard will become Irish pubs for the night as 
everyone gathers around the bar to sing "Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral" and wear 
ridiculous green derbies and bow ties. Television stations will drag out "Darby 
O'Gill and the Little People," "The Quiet Man" and any movie starring Pat 
O'Brien or Maureen O'Hara, showing those happy Irish people reeling and 
drinking with nary a problem that can't be solved by a pint of Guinness. 
</P>
<P>
 Corned beef and cabbage will be served at Mexican restaurants, and Japanese 
businessmen will sport buttons proclaiming them "Honorary Irishman." No one 
seems a bit concerned that the closest most of these people have come to the 
Emerald Isle is showering with Irish Spring soap. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the cries for political correctness and multiculturalism today, it 
seems odd that every March 17 Americans love to perpetuate the Irish stereotype 
and strive to get as drunk as Paddy's pig, jump up and down in a clumsy "jig" 
and go around bleating, "Top o' the morning to ya" in their best Barry 
Fitzgerald brogue. Rather than recall the vast historical and cultural 
advancements of the Irish, everyone seems intent on having the biggest hangover 
on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the Irish's own self-deprecating humor, there isn't a lot of time 
dedicated to remembering the potato famine and the Easter rebellion that caused 
so many of our ancestors to seek a new life in America. There is little 
recollection of the Irish ghettos that sprang up or the discrimination in the 
days of "Irish Need Not Apply" signs or even of the fight for independence that 
continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And while the grand literary contributions the Irish have made, from Swift to 
Shaw to Yeats to Joyce, are downplayed, you can bet everyone down at Ireland's 
32 knows the words to "Who Threw the Overalls in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish, while being celebrated on St. Patrick's Day, often seem ridiculed 
at the same time. A typical greeting card reads: "What do you call an Irishman 
on St. Patty's Day?" Answer: "A cab." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the reactions of other nationalities if, for example, on Martin Luther 
King Day, McDonald's made McChittlins and McHamhocks. Or if on Cinco de Mayo, 
Anglos wore sombreros and feigned Speedy Gonzales accents. Or if during Chinese 
New Year, everyone wore coolie hats and drank plum wine until passing out. 
</P>
<P>
 Society has done away with the Frito Bandito, Sambo's restaurants and Charlie 
Chan, yet many children are introduced to the Irish via the stereotypical 
leprechaun hawking Lucky Charms cereal with a phony brogue as lilting as 
fingernails on a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask an Irishman if all this political incorrectness bothers him, and 
chances are he'll laugh at the idea of a socially acceptable St. Pat's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it is the Irish's sense of humor that has helped us get through our 
own rich and somewhat troubled past. We're the first to laugh at ourselves 
(although "Divil a man to say a word agin me") and the last to take offense at 
ignorance. Sometimes, political correctness has to take a back seat to a good 
hooley. St. Pat's is the one day when the entire world wants to be Irish, and 
it's hard to refuse a compliment like that. 
</P>
<P>
 We Irish are fiercely proud of our contribution to society and anxious for all 
to appreciate our advances. But while we are the first to raise our glasses in 
cheer and our voices in song, we can only hope that perhaps this will be the 
year people will remember and appreciate the Irish for more than just green 
beer, the Blarney stone or a children's breakfast cereal that is "magically 
delicious."

VALLEY COMMENTARY; THERE'S NO AGE LIMIT TO DISASTER PREPAREDNESS; SENIORS 
SHOULD HOOK UP WITH MULTIPURPOSE CENTERS, WHICH OFFER COUNSELING, MEDICAL CARE, 
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND MORE DURING DISASTERS.

By MARILYN GREEN FRIED, Marilyn Green Fried is acting executive director of 
Organization for the Needs of the Elderly in Van Nuys.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jan. 17's earthquake devastated much of the San Fernando Valley, taking a 
heavy physical and emotional toll. The elderly were especially hard hit and 
must take action now to prepare for the future. The elderly and the earthquake 
</P>
<P>
 A large percentage of senior citizens are widowed and live alone. The 
earthquake frightened them, making many of them feel alone, vulnerable and 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many could not move furniture, which had moved or fallen across exits. They 
found it difficult to clean up. They felt inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had not stocked up on water and quick-fix meals. Some did not eat for 
several days and fainted while waiting in line for disaster assistance. Some 
became confused because of hunger and thirst. 
</P>
<P>
 Vital medications were ruined or lost. The consequences ranged from feeling 
weak to medical crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens with mental impairments had difficulty understanding what was 
happening and became anxious or agitated. Spouses and children were often 
frustrated with the burden of their own fears and responsibilities. Many 
seniors who didn't know their neighbors and weren't affiliated with a senior 
center were "invisible." Some needed help and no one knew it. What is available 
to help the elderly? 
</P>
<P>
 Multipurpose senior centers, largely funded by the city's Department of Aging, 
are there to help. 
</P>
<P>
 For the healthy, mobile senior they offer counseling and rap groups. The 
elderly can get help in dealing with depression, feelings of inadequacy, 
anxiety and fear caused by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members answer questions and direct seniors to the places where they can 
receive assistance. Help is available with filling out disaster-aid forms. Tax 
preparation and legal consultation are also offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenings for blood pressure, breast and prostate cancer, diabetes, glaucoma 
and cholesterol are available. Organization for the Needs of the Elderly has a 
Health Fair Expo scheduled for next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot, nutritious lunches are served at the centers and satellite sites 
throughout the Valley on weekdays. It is important that seniors not withdraw 
and become isolated. The centers offer a meeting place where they can gather, 
socialize and take classes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the frail homebound elderly, the centers offer case-management services. A 
case manager visits the senior in his home, assesses the person's needs and 
tries to fill them, directly or through referral. 
</P>
<P>
 Available services include hot lunches (drivers can often spot changes in 
people's conditions), household chores, help with bathing and grocery shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers make weekly visits to the homebound, often one of the few human 
contacts all week. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors who live alone can request a daily reassurance call from the Careline. 
</P>
<P>
 For the senior who is a victim of dementia, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, stroke 
or depression, there are adult day-care centers such as the ONE-sponsored Mark 
Taper Intergenerational Center. They help to eliminate premature 
institutionalization and provide respite for the care giver. 
</P>
<P>
 When the impaired senior can no longer remain at home, these centers refer 
people to retirement homes, board and care centers and nursing homes. Preparing 
for the future 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors should affiliate with a senior center -- become visible. 
</P>
<P>
 They should get to know their neighbors, who will provide valuable assistance 
in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency response systems can be provided for homebound seniors through the 
center's case management services. One system provides a necklace with a button 
that activates a device attached to the telephone, calling two predetermined 
people to alert them to an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Senior Service & Resource Center in Reseda provides a "vial of 
life" to each of its members. The senior fills out a form with emergency and 
medical information, places it in a plastic vial in the refrigerator and 
attaches a sticker to the outside of the refrigerator telling paramedics it is 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors should keep a three-day supply of medications in their purse or 
pocket. And they should store a three-day supply of water, preferably in small, 
easy-to-lift containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone, seniors should clear their homes of clutter. Store food that 
doesn't require refrigeration, heating or preparation. Don't forget a can 
opener. Have first-aid supplies, plastic bags for lining the toilet; keep a 
flashlight, battery-powered radio and shoes next to the bed. Keep important 
papers together. Have childproof latches installed on kitchen cabinets and 
heavy furniture bolted to the wall.

L.A. CONFERENCE AIMS TO HELP CURB RISING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; CRIME: THE THEME OF 
THE LARGE-SCALE MEETING WAS TO INCREASE COORDINATION WITHIN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While public debate over street crime reaches a fever pitch, the biggest 
threat to women's safety in fact lies at home: 75% of women murdered are killed 
by their husbands or lovers, participants in a conference on domestic violence 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 And as "three strikes and you're out" goes into effect against repeat felons, 
the fact remains that some women are assaulted dozens of times by a domestic 
partner before the justice system gets involved, said Barbara Hart, an attorney 
and victims' rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, poor coordination among police and prosecutors too often lets the 
perpetrator off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 450 police officers, social workers, judges, doctors and victims' 
advocates jammed the Police Academy gymnasium for Los Angeles' first 
large-scale conference on domestic violence, which was conceived by 
psychiatrist Marjorie Braude and co-sponsored by her husband, Councilman Marvin 
Braude, and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the conference was how to increase coordination within the 
justice system to stop family batterers, and participants both criticized the 
lack of a stronger response to domestic violence and praised ongoing efforts to 
control abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Swamped by increasing domestic violence in the city, the LAPD is beefing up 
its response to assaults and murders among family members and working closely 
with victim advocacy groups that assist with investigations and violence 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said that domestic violence constitutes 40% of police calls 
in many areas of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence is a threat not only to its direct victims, but to the 
police who spend so much of their time dealing with it. Volatile family 
disputes are the deadliest assignments for police officers, accounting for 40% 
of police deaths nationwide last year, according to the National Assn. of 
Chiefs of Police. 
</P>
<P>
 When rookie Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton was fatally shot last month in 
Northridge, she was responding to a domestic violence call.  
</P>
<P>
 And violence in the home contributes to violence throughout society, 
participants said. They noted that most of the inmates crowding California 
jails have either been victims of battering in the home or grew up in an 
atmosphere of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 There has often been inadequate coordination of police and prosecutors, 
leading to batterers evading conviction, conference participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to increase the successful prosecution of domestic violence, the 
Police Department last September launched a pilot program in its Southwest 
Division that dedicated seven detectives to domestic violence cases and 
increased coordination with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, a case usually bounced through several assistant city attorneys 
or assistant district attorneys before it was prosecuted. The program will be 
implemented departmentwide in a few weeks, Cmdr. John White said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program started in San Diego in 1992 has helped reduce domestic 
violence homicides by more than 50%, said San Diego Police Sgt. Anne O'Dell. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to increased communication with prosecutors, police are 
increasingly relying on private groups to help out with investigations and 
assistance to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pilot program in the Southwest Division, officers take the victims of 
domestic violence and their children to an organization called the Jenesse 
Center or to one of the shelters in its referral network. The center also makes 
available vouchers so battered women can stay in motels if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The division also provides the names and phone numbers of victims of domestic 
violence so the Jenesse Center can make follow-up calls, since batterers rarely 
strike just once. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Harbor area, a group called Rainbow Services has a similar 
program of working closely with police. Last weekend the police and Rainbow 
Services started dispatching teams of Rainbow volunteers who go to the site of 
an arrest within 20 minutes to assist the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams said more coordination is needed 
among all service agencies. "When we have to arrest someone or take someone to 
the hospital, it means other parts of the system have failed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart rejected a notion that she said is held by many judges and others, that 
if a battered woman would only leave the abusive relationship she would be 
safe. "At the time she leaves (her husband or lover) she may be at greatest 
risk of being killed," because the jealous partner cannot stand to lose control 
of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, women in Los Angeles often have nowhere to go once they decide to 
leave home. Assistant Dist. Atty. Audrey Collins said "It is a myth that there 
are safe places for women to run to" in Los Angeles. There are only 250 beds 
for battered women and their children, nowhere near enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Both police officers and victims' advocates at the conference complained of a 
lack of financial resources for efforts against domestic violence. Dr. Braude 
said that the city has set up a $10,000 domestic violence trust fund and is 
seeking corporate donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Uses for the money might include cameras and cellular phones to help both 
police investigations and private advocacy programs.

FEAR COMES TO SMALL TOWN AFTER MAN DISAPPEARS; MYSTERY: RANCHER LARRY KUHN, 
KNOWN IN THREE POINTS FOR HIS GENEROSITY, VANISHED IN SEPTEMBER, THE DAY HE WAS 
TO LEAVE ON GAMBLING TRIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Larry Kuhn, for 40 years a rancher in this isolated mountain town, loved to 
wash down a good day's work with a few beers and tell war stories about his 
days in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days Kuhn's favorite bar stool sits empty, and people in this 
community about 20 miles east of Gorman spend much of their time talking about 
what could have happened to him. The 83-year-old rancher hasn't been seen since 
Sept. 26, the Sunday he was supposed to leave for a two-day gambling trip to 
Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 His disappearance has spooked this community of 150 people, prompting some to 
fret about big city problems invading a place that is little more than a dot on 
the map. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never locked our doors before this happened," said Suzie Gardner, standing 
up to smoke a cigarette after a hearty breakfast at Nancy's Up The Road Cafe, 
the only business in Three Points. "These days, we're all locking our doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband Ralph, wearing a cowboy hat and boots, chimed in, "I don't care if 
they (police) stop me, I've started carrying a side arm since that happened." 
Cafe owner Nancy Green, a round-faced woman with bright blue eyes, said she too 
had purchased a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Affectionately dubbed the "Commander" because it was his naval ranking, Kuhn 
was reported missing Sept. 29 when he failed to return from Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives Lynn Reeder and Woodrow West, who are investigating Kuhn's 
disappearance for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, talk about the 
case too. "We think he's dead," Reeder said. "We think his body is buried 
somewhere out in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't hold much hope of finding a body. "Even the quake didn't make 
him rise to the surface," Reeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last slaying anyone can remember anywhere near these parts was almost 11 
years ago, when a 16-year-old inmate escaped from a county probation camp and 
killed a local rancher in Lake Hughes, a town about 10 miles to the east. But 
that was different, folks say. The culprit was an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit here, if there is one, could be local. "We had a murder here," 
said Merlin Pinnell, who helps run Nancy's, to no one in particular one 
afternoon. "Could have been one of our own. Hmmm." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kuhn was a popular man in Three Points, a generous man who often picked 
up hitchhikers and lent a hand to folks down on their luck. "He was the kind of 
guy that, even though he didn't know you, he'd give you something to do," said 
a former employee. Even if Kuhn really didn't need any work done on the ranch, 
friends and family say, he would hire someone anyway just to give them a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But in January, 1993, Kuhn really needed help and took out a newspaper ad 
asking for caretakers to run the ranch, which became too much of a chore after 
his wife of 54 years, Fran, became ill. 
</P>
<P>
 He hired James and Linda Keck, a married couple who had moved to California 
from Kentucky. Nearly a year later, sheriff's deputies would announce that they 
had arrested the Kecks on suspicion of murder in the old man's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair was released Dec. 4 and the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office declined to file any charges, citing lack of evidence, not to mention 
the lack of a body. Reeder considers the case open and says the Kecks remain 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their arrest, the Kecks were a barely noticeable addition to Three 
Points, located a few miles below the southern edge of Kern County, in the 
mountains overlooking the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were described by local residents as quiet people who never engaged 
in small talk and kept to themselves. They rarely visited the cafe, and Jeff 
Jones, Kuhn's hired hand, said they showed no interest in establishing a 
friendship with him or neighbors. In fact, Jones recalls, Linda Keck, who is 25 
years younger than her 71-year-old spouse, hardly ever left the ranch and spent 
most of her time inside Kuhn's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and investigators say James Keck is a slightly built man who 
suffered from Parkinson's disease, which caused his hands to shake 
uncontrollably at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's weak and doesn't walk very well," said Laurie Keck, his daughter-in-law, 
of Barstow. "He's had heart attacks in the past, and sometimes his hands shake 
so badly he can hardly hold silverware." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife Linda is a wide-shouldered woman who, despite her California 
upbringing, spoke with a thick Southern accent. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was another side to them that people in Three Points didn't see, 
according to investigators and family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spoke to me of loving to play craps," said Laurie Keck. "I also know that 
he went to Atlantic City several times and she said that they both loved to 
gamble." Dixie Clifton, of Erlanger, Ky., where the Kecks lived for about two 
years, remembers several trips the couple took to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 And like most gamblers, the couple often asked relatives for loans, said 
Laurie Keck. The couple borrowed money from relatives on several occasions -- 
including Laurie Keck's family -- and she told investigators that Kuhn had 
loaned them money at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had worked for Kuhn a few months when Kuhn placed his wife in a 
convalescent home in late May. Shortly after her death on June 23, say friends 
and authorities, his life began to unravel with small, seemingly insignificant 
things that grew bigger with each incident. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nancy Green tells it, Kuhn walked into her cafe one sunny morning last 
summer confused and angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy, what do you see?" Kuhn said as he opened his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing, Commander," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right, and I had a whole bunch of money in there earlier today," he 
told her. 
</P>
<P>
 First, relatively small amounts of money were missing, and when Green and 
others at the cafe tried to warn Kuhn about befriending strangers and picking 
up hitchhikers, he shrugged off their concerns, saying, "Oh, you worry too 
much," Green recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn was mentally alert and maintained immaculate business records, said 
Reeder. For instance, Kuhn took and filed meticulous notes about conversations 
he had with auto mechanics. John Kuhn of Prescott, Ariz., said his father had 
been like that all his life, a habit developed from a regimented and 
well-ordered military career that began when he was graduated from the Naval 
Academy in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of his penchant for order, investigators cannot find any of Kuhn's 
financial records dating from July until his disappearance, Reeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of last summer, strange things seemed to happen that would 
separate Kuhn from his cash. On one occasion, Jones remembers Kuhn finding his 
wallet up in a tree in the front yard. It was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 On another, Kuhn pulled out what he believed was a $20 bill at Nancy's only to 
find that it was a $1 bill with the ends of a $20 bill taped on the corners. He 
showed the bill to everyone there. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said another distinct departure from Kuhn's traditional way of 
doing things was a postdated check for $3,000 made out to the Kecks -- a loan 
the Kecks claim that Kuhn made to them to help them purchase a new truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives called such a check out of character. "My father never postdated a 
check in his life, and when me or my brother borrowed money from him, he made 
us sign a contract and pay interest," John Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn never publicly confronted the Kecks about the losses, but once walked 
into a crowded Nancy's and accused Jones, the hired hand, of stealing his 
money. Jones denied it. And then three weeks before his disappearance, his son 
says, Kuhn canceled all of his credit and bank cards and had new cards issued. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kuhn disappeared, investigators discovered that about $8,000 in 
automatic teller withdrawals and questionable checks had been drawn against 
Kuhn's account, leaving him with a negative balance of about $900 by late 
September, the month he vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder soon launched a search at the Kuhn ranch, but the dogs and deputies 
turned up nothing. A few weeks later investigators found Kuhn's car, a 1987 
Pontiac Bonneville, abandoned in the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Kecks were arrested and released, they left Three Points in 
mid-December. The last anyone heard from them was a phone call received by 
Laurie's husband, John Keck, placed from Las Vegas a few days before Christmas. 
They needed money, he said, because their trailer had been destroyed in a 
traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 John Keck refused and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 Life's just not the same in Three Points these days. People sadly reminisce 
about the Commander, and the rustic decor at Nancy's includes a poster asking 
for information on his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Life has certainly changed for Jones, who was interviewed by deputies and is 
not considered a suspect in Kuhn's disappearance. Even so, he was eighty-sixed 
from Nancy's some time ago, a cruel fate in Three Points, and now claims he's 
been blacklisted and is having trouble finding work. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jones spends time in the Quonset hut at the Kuhn ranch and says he has one 
friend who lives nearby. Green says Jones is not welcome at her cafe because of 
his behavior, but Jones says simply, "She never did like me." 
</P>
<P>
 So why not leave? "I like it here," said the 42-year-old ranch hand. "And I 
really have no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ken and Connie Stanley, residents of Three Points for 33 years, and 
neighbor Dave Rozum, Kuhn's eerie disappearance is a dramatic shift from the 
days in the 1960s when the Kuhns operated a summer 4-H camp at the ranch, which 
was then a sprawling 200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't expect it out here," said Connie Stanley. "I don't feel as 
safe as I did when we first moved here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there really any likely place?" asked her husband, Ken, referring to the 
random nature of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Gerald Newbold, whose patrol area from the Gorman substation 
includes Three Points, also has noticed the change in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that they're spooked -- almost like a superstitious kind of spooking," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, people here just want the investigation to end, however it turns 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants it to go away because it's driving people crazy," said Green, 
the cafe owner. "People here are looking at each other going 'Hmmmmmmmmm.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the folks at Nancy's still hoist a beer in the air and raise 
a toast to Kuhn, one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think that he's in Panama sitting on the beach sipping a mai tai 
and laughing it up," said Pauline Metcalfe, 63, as she sipped down a 10-ounce 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's where he is, but I hope that's where he is."

MATER DEI IS LEFT CRYING FOUL PLAY; DIVISION I: LATE CALL AGAINST MONARCHS 
HURTS MOMENTUM. CRENSHAW ADVANCES TO STATE TITLE GAME FOR SECOND YEAR IN ROW 
WITH 71-67 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mater Dei had a chance to budge that immovable object called the Los Angeles 
Crenshaw boys' basketball team. The moment was there, and then it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Cougars came on strong down the stretch, pulling out a 71-67 
victory Saturday at Anaheim Arena. Once again, it will be Crenshaw playing in 
the State Division I championship game. Once again, it could have been Mater 
Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs lost to the Cougars, 63-61, in the regional final last season 
when Miles Simon missed a jumper with 10 seconds left and Kristaan Johnson made 
a buzzer-beating layup. This time around, the Monarchs made the basket, but it 
was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of it again was Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay McKnight sank a three-point field goal that appeared to tie the score, 
69-69, with 1 minute 21 seconds left. But Johnson hit the floor a second before 
McKnight shot, and officials called Mike Karich for an illegal screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a foul," Johnson said. "I wanted to get the foul so I flopped. I 
exaggerated a little bit to get the ref's attention. He called it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson then sank one of two free throws to give Crenshaw a 70-66 lead. The 
play seemed to take the air out of Mater Dei. The Monarchs missed three field 
goals, three of four free throws and turned the ball over twice in the final 
1:21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that should have been a five-point play," Monarch Coach Gary 
McKnight said. "I thought the three-pointer should have counted and we should 
have been shooting free throws." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw Coach Willie West saw a different version. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a foul," he said. "I just didn't know if they would call 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave West his fourth victory over Mater Dei in the State playoffs. 
The Cougars, who have won five State titles in 10 years, have beaten the 
Monarchs three times in the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, Mater Dei (33-1) was suppose to have the upper hand. 
Although they returned only one starter, the Monarchs had won 33 consecutive 
games, some by ridiculously lopsided margins, and came in ranked second in the 
nation by USA Today. Crenshaw was ranked fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei rolled through the playoffs behind the 1-2 punch of Simon and Schea 
Cotton. Both struggled Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, who was averaging 21 points, scored 12 against a Crenshaw defense that 
ran two defenders at him most of the night. He made only four of 12 shots and 
was one of six on three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 He went scoreless in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted him to shoot off the dribble," West said. "We didn't want him to 
stand there and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, a 6-foot-5 freshman, got off to a good start. He had 11 points by 
halftime, including a reverse dunk that brought the large Monarch crowd to its 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cotton scored only five points in the second half, as he usually found 
Tremaine Fowlkes in his path. Fowlkes blocked two of Cotton's shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton fouled out with 2:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of Cotton's shots in the first half were uncontested," West said. "We 
got on him tighter so he wouldn't get those again." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Cotton and Simon laboring, the Monarchs chased the Cougars down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Jackson scored six of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, including a 
layup that pulled Mater Dei to within one, 65-64, with five minutes left. But 
the Monarchs couldn't get over the hump. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon had a chance to tie the score with less than three minutes left. He 
stole a pass and dribbled one-on-one with Tommie Davis. Simon spun left in the 
lane, but missed the layup. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (28-2) relied almost solely on Johnson in the fourth quarter. He 
scored eight of his 27 points in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was a problem all evening, as he used his 6-5, 240-pound body to 
out-muscle the Monarchs inside. He finished with nine rebounds, seven of which 
were offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really hurt us on the offensive boards," McKnight said. "I thought we 
handled their press well, but the offensive rebounding killed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw had 12 offensive rebounds in the first half and led, 40-37, at 
halftime. The Monarchs were forced into a 2-3 zone, as they tried to use 
numbers to counter Crenshaw's size. The Cougars start five players 6-5 or 
taller.

ANTEATERS SNUFFLE WAY INTO CONFERENCE FINAL; BASKETBALL: 10TH-SEEDED UC IRVINE 
BEATS PACIFIC, 82-78, AND WILL PLAY FOR BIG WEST TITLE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The impossible dream is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine, the only 10th-seeded team in the Big West's 15-year history to win 
a game in the conference tournament, is one victory from earning a part in the 
Really Big Show. The Anteaters, their high-top Cinderella slippers still firmly 
laced to their feet, beat Pacific, 82-78, in the semifinals Saturday night in 
front of 8,959 in the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Today at 12:30 p.m., they meet New Mexico State -- an 82-64 winner over Nevada 
Las Vegas in the other semifinal -- for a berth in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (10-19) won its third game in a row for the the first time in Rod 
Baker's three-season tenure as head coach, and once again it was the play of 
senior point guard Lloyd Mumford that guided the Anteaters to victory. His 
regular-season performances varied from spectacular to out of control to just 
plain ragged, but he has been nothing short of inspired during Irvine's 
three-day Las Vegas fling. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pacific (17-14) closed to within five points with four minutes to play, 
Mumford responded with two three-point plays -- a steal and layup and free 
throw and an acrobatic baseline bank shot and free throw -- to put Irvine ahead 
by 11. When the Tigers made a couple of three-pointers down the stretch, 
Mumford controlled the ball, drew the fouls and made six of eight free throws 
in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford, who finished with a game-high 29 points and seven assists, might have 
been tired, but he clearly wasn't running on empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little fatigued, but I was focused," he said. "The game was right 
there in your hands and you want to close your fist around it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters have shown the commitment and concentration that was so 
obviously absent from their regular-season follies, but that's all history, 
according to Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching some films with my assistants, and they were yelling about 
mistakes we were making two months ago," Baker said. "I don't give a damn about 
two months ago. I wish we were 19-10 instead of 10-19, but that's all gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, I'd trade every win we had all year for these three right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters are living for the moment, and having to play four games in a 
row doesn't seem to intimidate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel good," center DeForrest Boyer said. "I think we're all pretty 
pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Coach Bob Thomason believes Irvine's chances today are at least 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're one of the few teams who can afford to play four games because they 
have enough athletes and depth," he said. "And they're playing with a lot more 
poise than they did earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were giving up those big runs to everyone, but their offense is keeping 
them out of those situations and their defense is more conservative now." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine came into the tournament last in the conference in field-goal 
percentage defense (48%). In the three tournament games, they've allowed 
opponents to shot only 36% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second night in a row, the Anteaters played a lot of zone defense, and 
for the second night in a row, an outside shooter had an explosive first half. 
Friday night, Utah State's Corwin Woodard had 24 points, and Saturday, 
Pacific's Adam Peterson made five of seven three-pointers for 17 first-half 
points. But as they did against Woodard, the Anteaters were able to make the 
defensive adjustments to stop Peterson. He made one free throw after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's three-point specialist Chris Brown was held scoreless by the Tigers' 
box-and-one zone in the first half, but he got a few looks at the basket and 
made four of seven three-pointers in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 52-52, when Brown and Todd Whitehead buried consecutive 
three-pointers, and when Brown hit another three with 5:35 remaining, the 
Anteaters were up by seven, 66-59. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteater offense, which sputtered and choked through much of the regular 
season, was a fine-tuned engine in the second half. They shot 63% from the 
floor, 56% from three-point range and 77% from the free-throw line after the 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "With numbers like that in the second half, you better win a basketball game," 
Baker said. "I think for the first time all year, we're really dictating the 
tempo. We've decided when we would run and when we would wait and set it up."

BREA-OLINDA EASILY ADVANCES TO FINALS; BASKETBALL: LADYCATS EARN SIXTH 
CONSECUTIVE REGIONAL TITLE WITH 67-39 VICTORY OVER NEWPORT HARBOR. ERICKSON HAS 
14 POINTS, 14 ASSISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The question was directed to Newport Harbor Coach Shannon Jakosky: How many 
games would it take to get in the ballpark against Brea-Olinda? 
</P>
<P>
 "Three or four more games," she responded. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just to make it close. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor got its second chance in a week to take on the nation's 
second-ranked team, and again Brea-Olinda showed why it is one of the best high 
school teams in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats scored a 67-39 victory over Newport Harbor in the Southern 
California Division III Regional girls' final Saturday at Anaheim Arena. The 
28-point margin of victory is the smallest they have had in seven playoff 
games. When Brea-Olinda defeated Newport Harbor a week earlier in the Southern 
Section championship game, it won by 30 points, 70-40. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sends Brea (32-0) to the State championship game for the sixth 
consecutive year. The Ladycats are vying for a state-record tying fourth 
consecutive State title, set by San Diego Point Loma (1983-87). 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Brea-Olinda's 53rd consecutive victory, Jakosky tried to 
put all that Ladycat talent into perspective: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty obvious that any team that has a penetrating point guard 
that can pass well can be successful if they simultaneously have good outside 
shooters. Their inside game is about as tough as you're going to see at the 
high school level and I bet that Brea-Olinda team could probably do some damage 
on some Division II and definitely Division III (college) school -- and 
probably run them out of the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep their poise, they work hard. They don't try to overpress," Jakosky 
said. "They try to beat you on the half-court defense and half-court offense. 
They're just solid all the way through, and if you make any mistakes, they're 
going to capitalize on all of them. To put it in perspective, they're all great 
basketball players and they have a great coaching staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The penetrating point guard is Nicole Erickson, who had 14 assists and scored 
14 points, including eight in the first quarter as Brea-Olinda built a 14-6 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (24-8) trailed, 17-2, after one quarter in the first meeting as 
Brea-Olinda scored 13 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Tina Bowman's basket in the paint cut Brea-Olinda's lead to 8-6 
with 2 minutes 54 seconds left in the first quarter. Then Brea-Olinda scored 11 
consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson scored the first four of the streak, and forward Sarah Beckley scored 
three of the last five. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckley finished with a game-high 17 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center Colleen Hudson scored 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 A 9-2 run at the end of the second quarter made it 33-15 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so unselfish," Jakosky said. "Erickson is a great passer. I felt we 
did a pretty good job of containing her, but she would get in and we would have 
players come to help as they needed to and Nicole would always find the open 
person. I was applauding her several times on some of her outstanding passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda will play San Jose Archbishop Mitty, a 58-57 winner over Novato 
Saturday in Oakland. Coach John Hattrup, who coached the Mission Viejo girls' 
team to the 1982 Regional Division II championship, likes where his team is at 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're playing well as a group," he said. "Up until tonight, Lee 
(Moulin) has been shooting well. Kiyoko (Miller) has played as well as she's 
played all year today. Nicole got her shooting back Thursday night and the big 
kids are playing really well. Jennifer (Saari) gives us a really good spark off 
the bench, not only in terms of ballhandling to get Nicole more into the 
offense, but she can shoot the three, she can penetrate and be a complete 
player. I think we're playing really well right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Saari, a freshman, scored nine points and had three steals in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulin was 0 for 5 from the floor, but was a little dogged from a bout with 
the flu. She had five rebounds (second only to Beckley) to help give the 
Ladycats a 38-26 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, which turned in a much more complete performance than the 
first meeting, got 10 points apiece from Genevieve Evarts and Melissa Schutz.

GRETZKY, KINGS GET NO CLOSER TO THEIR GOALS; HOCKEY: HE HASN'T SCORED SINCE 
MARCH 2 IN PURSUIT OF HOWE'S RECORD. SABRES RALLY FOR 5-3 VICTORY.

 The Kings, for once, weren't their own worst enemies on Saturday night against 
the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
 They put in a spirited effort after getting yelled at by owner Bruce McNall in 
the hallway between periods on Wednesday and by Coach Barry Melrose in a heated 
team meeting afterward. Several players heard McNall wondering loudly why they 
weren't hitting anyone and stating they were certainly getting paid enough 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm clouds seemed to leave the Forum by Saturday, however, and there was 
good news before the game started: The San Jose Sharks lost to the Calgary 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest problem isn't the Sharks or the Mighty Ducks. It's the 
calendar -- 16 games remaining in the season -- and the Kings squandered a 
valuable chance to make up some ground in the race for the final playoff spot 
in the Western Conference, blowing a two-goal lead and losing to the Sabres, 
5-3, before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit between the Kings and a playoff spot remained at nine points. A 
week ago, it was five points. The Kings (22-36-10) have won once in their last 
14 games, going 1-9-4, and are winless in their last eight home games (0-6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 What helped decide this one was a lapse by King goaltender Kelly Hrudey, who 
appeared to be stunned by Alexander Mogilny's one-timer at 6:55 of the third 
period. Dale Hawerchuk set up Mogilny with a behind-the-back drop pass in the 
right circle. Mogilny launched the shot from above the dot in the right circle, 
beating Hrudey between the pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be satisfied with a good effort," Hrudey said. "If we were the ones 
who had a nine-point lead, that would be different. But now, it's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Mogilny's goal, his 28th of the season, gave the Sabres a 4-2 lead. The Kings 
cut the deficit to 4-3 with John Druce's second goal of the game, on the power 
play, at 8:55. But the Sabres put it away with empty-netter by Yuri Khmylev 
with 1:21 remaining. It was his second goal of the night. Mogilny had three 
points on one goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a lot of chances against L.A.," Buffalo Coach John Muckler said. "I 
don't think we had as many three-on-twos and two-on-ones in any game as we had 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Melrose: "I asked one thing of the guys tonight, I asked for effort -- 
and I got effort. As a coach, that's all you can ask for." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wayne Gretzky, still three goals away from tying Gordie Howe's 
all-time record of 801, was held without a goal for the fourth consecutive 
game. But unlike his previous three games, Gretzky had a handful of scoring 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 His best chance came early in the game, at 6:04, when his 30-footer beat 
Dominik Hasek cleanly but hit the post. Gretzky had three shots on goal, 
including two in the second period. Gretzky has not scored since March 2 at 
Hartford and he is pointless in three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Buffalo rebounded in the second period and it took consecutive shots 
in a span of 1:16 by the Sabres to puncture the Kings' newfound confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabres, trailing by 2-0 after the first period on goals by Druce and Luc 
Robitaille, erased the deficit with goals on their 13th and 14th shots. At 
2:19, right wing Donald Audette tucked a backhander past Hrudey, and Buffalo 
tied it on Khmylev's breakaway at 3:35. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the Wayne Gretzky watch were his parents, Walter and Phyllis, who were 
sitting rinkside Saturday. . . . The scratches were defenseman Tim Watters and 
forwards Dave Taylor, Tony Granato and Phil Crowe. Granato, finishing a 15-game 
suspension, will return to action against Ottawa on Tuesday.

UCLA SINKS INTO THE PIT AS OREGON COMES BACK; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BRUINS GET 
ONLY ONE BASKET IN THE FINAL 1:38 AND WASTE CHANCE FOR PAC-10 TITLE. DAMAGE 
WILL BE DETERMINED BY NCAA SEEDINGS TODAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Bring on the new season, that NCAA tournament thing, the UCLA Bruins said 
Saturday. They probably said this because the old season had become such a 
royal pain in the jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a battered bunch of Bruins who will find out today where they will play 
in the tournament, which can't be any tougher than the way they closed out the 
Pacific 10 Conference season. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-place Oregon scored eight points in the last 90 seconds, including a 
winning rebound basket by 6-foot-8 center Zach Sellers with five seconds left 
that beat UCLA, 80-79, before 7,630 at McArthur Court. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sellers' only basket of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had one more chance, but Tyus Edney missed a three-pointer at the 
buzzer. Edney, closely guarded by Darryl Parker, thought he was fouled. Bruin 
Coach Jim Harrick was sure he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not hard to call; it's easy," he said. "It's not a judgment call; it's 
a guts call, or lack of. It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon Coach Jerry Green said he didn't see it and Parker said he didn't do 
it, but Edney said he really was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bad day," Edney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins will find out today how bad it was when the NCAA tournament 
seedings are announced. UCLA finished 21-6, lost six of its last 13 after a 
14-0 start and missed a chance to share the Pac-10 title with Arizona, which 
was upset at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, getting beat by a team that was 9-17 and in the midst of a 
four-game losing streak probably had no consequences at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver, who led the Bruins with 30 points, said to bring on the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I feel I can take anything," he said. "Losing to SC, then losing 
to Oregon by one point for the championship, you just reach the point where the 
only way to go is up." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the direction UCLA seemed to be heading midway through the second half, 
when Harrick made a key defensive switch and put Tarver on Kenya Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney wasn't up to checking Wilkins and clearly was slowed by the aftereffects 
of the muscle spasms in his back that forced him out of Friday's practice. 
Edney made only one of 13 shots, but Tarver carried the load. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tarver's breakaway layup with 8:38 to go that gave UCLA a 73-68 lead 
after the Bruins had trailed by eight five minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tarver's basket was just about the end of the line for UCLA. The Bruins 
managed only one field goal in the last 1:38, a dunk by George Zidek with 63 
seconds remaining that put UCLA in front, 79-75. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins didn't score again. Orlando Williams made a three-pointer, then Ed 
O'Bannon turned the ball over when he stepped out of bounds as he drove the 
baseline with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon called time out, trailing by 79-78. Wilkins took off down the lane, 
shot and missed, but Sellers got the rebound and scored from two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 As UCLA scrambled back, all that was left was for Edney to try his 
three-pointer in traffic from the left side. When it didn't go, Oregon fans 
flooded the court they call the Pit and carried the Ducks off on their 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the somber UCLA locker room, Ed O'Bannon said he didn't really want to 
think about whether Edney was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who cares?" he said. "We lost." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a particularly fine day for either of the O'Bannons. Ed was three 
for 12 and had six turnovers in 31 minutes. Charles played only 27 minutes and 
sat out most of the second half when Harrick chose to go with Cameron Dollar to 
work alongside Tarver and Edney, who played all but seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyus Edney played his worst game since he's been at UCLA," Harrick said. "But 
he was hurting, maybe I shouldn't have played him so much." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had their moments, but they were brief. What's clear is that UCLA 
still is struggling with its offense after 27 games. UCLA wound up with 20 
turnovers and missed 23 of 32 shots in the second half, including 10 of its 
last 11 after Tarver's basket and the 73-68 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just frittered it away," Harrick said. "It was a joke. We should have won 
by 10 or 15. We gave it away. This is just sickening." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon didn't feel much better. He said he isn't sure how the Bruins will 
react, but he didn't sound too confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time will tell, the tournament is a new beginning, but this can easily carry 
over," he said. "But we start 0-0, same as everybody. We just got to go out 
wherever we are and play."

PROUD ALEMANY FALLS TO WOODBRIDGE, 46-41; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: INDIANS, WHO 
OVERCAME OBSTACLES THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, FALTER IN STATE REGIONAL FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alemany High Coach Melissa Hearlihy stood beside her crying players and spoke 
calmly about the end of Destiny's Season. 
</P>
<P>
 After 31 games over three months, her Indians had finally been stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The distraction of Hearlihy giving birth to her first child during the season 
couldn't do it. A school-closing earthquake couldn't do it. Losing guard Kathy 
Brown to a knee injury couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine Woodbridge -- and Alemany foul trouble -- did what fate couldn't. 
The Warriors beat the Indians, 46-41, in the Division II Southern Regional 
State final. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, I'm very emotional and I cry over the least little thing," Hearlihy 
said in the Anaheim Arena pressroom. "Now I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused, perhaps considering the season in which she and her players had 
endured so much. Her starters sat beside her, staring at the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears welled in Hearlihy's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take that back," she said. And she smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have accomplished so much it's hard to be upset. They've always gave 
everything they had. When you're coaching, that's all you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (30-1), which won the Southern Section Division II-A championship, 
also badly wanted to win the Southern Regional final and advance to the 
Division II state championship game Friday in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Hearlihy said, "If we lose one game between here and the state 
final, it's like we've fallen short." 
</P>
<P>
 They came tantalizingly close to their goal, but after taking a 41-39 lead 
with 2 minutes 40 seconds remaining, the Indians could do nothing right. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Carly Funicello, saddled with four fouls, could only watch as 
Woodbridge center Angela Burgess tied the score with 2:24 left on a rebound 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian guard Kelly McKay fouled out less than 30 seconds later, and with its 
steadiest player gone, the Alemany offense faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest deflation was Kelly's fifth foul," Hearlihy said. "She 
does so many quiet things for our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany turned the ball over on two ensuing possessions, but still trailed 
only 44-41 with 18.8 seconds left. Senior guard Lori Shigematsu had been fouled 
and stood at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shigematsu, a reserve who scored nine points and played a solid game, 
missed both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Alemany's last gasp. Woodbridge (32-0), the Southern Section II-AA 
champion, soon stood celebrating at midcourt, thinking of its matchup with 
Sacramento El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians sat glumly on their bench, clutching congratulatory roses and 
second-place medals before trudging to the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told us that no team was going to beat us, that only we could beat 
ourselves," said junior forward Samantha Rigley, who was held to six points. 
"And that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello, a sophomore, sat glumly next to the team's lone senior starter, 
Zevette Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 The two of them were Alemany's only true baseline players. They warmed up 
together before every game, usually clowning around during a routine passing 
drill, throwing the ball behind their backs, through their legs, around their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 They would laugh until a coach scolded them to do the drill correctly. Then 
they would exchange mischievous smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday they wore frowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all had an excellent season," Funicello said. "And everyone is 
telling me it's OK, that I have two more years left." 
</P>
<P>
 She took a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not myself that I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really bad for them," she said, her voice quivering as she looked at 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 She began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had tried harder."  
</P>
<P>
 Her voice broke off, and she and Mitchell hugged each other and sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 There was silence for a few moments until a reporter said, "Congratulations on 
a great season."

MARADONA: SOCCER'S UNPREDICTABLE LEGEND; PERSONALITY: 
RAGS-TO-RICHES-TO-RAGS-TO-RICHES LEGEND HAS SWEPT THROUGH ASIA, EUROPE, AFRICA 
AND AUSTRALIA. IN CATHOLIC SOUTH AMERICA, HE'S MORE POPULAR THAN THE POPE. IT 
IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT MARADONA IS AS WELL-KNOWN WORLD-WIDE AS MICHAEL 
JORDAN.

 It is the plastic cup they want, the one that just touched the lips of Diego 
Armando Maradona. "Diego, Diego, the cup!" the kids scream from the stands of 
the old soccer stadium. Maradona is taking the first water break of his first 
public workout of 1994, his first step toward playing the World Cup this summer 
in the United States. He looks happy today. He signs autographs, smiles for the 
cameras and jokes with the 300 or so fans that have come to see him. He takes a 
drink of water, leans across the stadium moat and softly lofts his Pepsi cup 
underhand into the waiting arms of a smiling 9-year-old girl named Nadal 
Gilotti, who then runs up the stands and sits in a bleacher, mesmerized by the 
trophy she clutches with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona's rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches legend has swept through Asia, 
Europe, Africa and Australia. In Catholic South America, he's more popular than 
the Pope. It is no exaggeration to say that Maradona is as well-known 
world-wide as Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Often tempestuous, sometimes unpredictable and always outspoken, Maradona is 
nobody's example of the ideal sports ambassador. His resume includes a 15-month 
suspension from the sport and a subsequent arrest for using cocaine. He 
routinely criticizes his country's president and FIFA (Federation 
Internationale de Football Assn.), soccer's international governing body. His 
penchant for talking about his friend Fidel Castro has earned him death threats 
from Cuban Americans in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 15 years, Maradona's life has been just about as private as 
Michael Jordan's or Michael Jackson's-and like the famous Michaels, at times 
Maradona seems incapable of avoiding controversy. Last month, for example, 
reporters shouting questions outside his home were met with a hail of pellets 
from an air rifle fired from inside his house. Injured reporters filed suit 
against Maradona and charges are pending. Maradona, without addressing who 
fired the gun, said the reporters repeatedly refused to stop screaming out 
questions and they were upsetting his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 The following night, he and his family fled their home, hiding in the back of 
a pickup truck, only to be discovered days later by two reporters at a secluded 
seaside resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike soccer's other great legend, the now-retired Pele, Maradona never 
played in the United States, and until now, he has avoided the English-language 
media for most of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 But he agreed to a rare talk a few days before the air gun incident over a cup 
of espresso in a crowded hotel. He did it, he said, "for the American kids, who 
really love the sport, even if the adults haven't warmed up to it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the interview was over, he had touched on his unbridled passion for 
Argentina and the sport that made him famous; his hopes for the upcoming World 
Cup, which he said will be his last hurrah; his regrets over his past drug use, 
and his love-hate relationship with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Americans, their freedom, the way they live, even though they may not 
be as fun-loving as I'd like them to be," he said. "And what I don't like about 
the United States is that perhaps they try too hard to dominate the rest of the 
world and solve everybody's problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody needs to tell Maradona that soccer is not a major U.S. sport. During a 
recent vacation in the Dominican Republic, he came across a group of families 
from New York. The kids, he said, immediately recognized him. "They wanted 
their moms to take their picture with me. A lady in green came up with a camera 
and asked me, "Who are you?' and I said, "Joe Montana.' The woman said, "Great, 
I'm getting a picture of Joe Montana.' Her kid turned red; he was really 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona knows U.S. sports fans like lots of scoring-the one thing soccer 
lacks. So what's so great about a 1-0 or 2-1 game? 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic Johnson doesn't need to score to gain my admiration," he replies. 
"Magic wins my admiration with his great no-look passes, even if the ball 
doesn't end up in the basket. So that's the beauty of the game. You don't need 
to score to be creative and entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 A prolific scorer by soccer standards, Maradona is best known for his 
all-around game: his precision passes, his dribbles and fakes, his ability to 
attract a crowd of players and then find the open teammate streaking toward the 
opponent's goal. He is, in sum, the closest thing to a Wayne Gretzky on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 At 33, Maradona has lost a few steps but has adapted by becoming more 
assist-minded. At 5 feet 5 and about 165 pounds, he most resembles Emmitt Smith 
or Barry Sanders, and, like the football stars, he exploits his low center of 
gravity and uses quick bursts of speed to avoid defenders' tackles. Like all 
the great ones, he's won everything, at every level of the sport-including the 
1986 World Cup in Mexico City, where he delivered what many regard as the best 
individual performance in Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, the son of laborers, grew up in poverty in the streets of Villa 
Fiorito, one of Buenos Aires' roughest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10, he became a minor celebrity when television cameras discovered him 
putting on ball-control exhibitions at halftimes of professional games. For 15 
minutes, the ball would touch his feet, knees, chest, head, thighs and heels, 
but never hit the ground. After his performance, awe-struck crowds would boo 
the returning professional players. He turned professional at 15 and became an 
overnight success, making the national team only eight games into the season. 
Later that year, he suffered his first major disappointment when he was left 
out in the final cut of the Argentine team that went on to win the 1978 World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Vindication would come a year later when he would lead Argentina to victory in 
the Junior World Cup in Japan. By then, he was being called "The White Pele." 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer gave me everything," said Maradona. "It gave me the chance to do what 
I like, have fun, get paid a lot and make happy the people I love. Every 
morning that I get up, I should light a candle to the soccer ball." 
</P>
<P>
 As Maradona spoke, a half-dozen reporters sat a few tables away, drinking beer 
and munching green olives. Another 30 or so hotel guests and local business 
people sat around the other tables, filling the room. Everybody pretended to 
ignore the most famous living Argentine. It was a measure of their respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview took place in the Hotel Riviera Palace, the pride of downtown 
Rosario, a depressed industrial city of 1 million about 100 miles north of 
Buenos Aires. Maradona, a multimillionaire, chose to live in this busy 
eight-story building with motel-sized rooms during the past soccer season. His 
wife and two daughters stayed home in Buenos Aires, where the girls attend 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point I thought about living in the United States. I talked about it 
with my wife," Maradona said. He especially liked that the United States is one 
of the few countries where he's not instantly recognized. "But the thing is, I 
love to be in my country, among my people." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was 18, Maradona had won the Argentine championship, and his 
transfer to the higher-paid European leagues seemed inevitable. He was sold to 
the Spanish team Barcelona in 1982 for a then-record $8 million, but before he 
could start playing in Spain, he would have to help defend Argentina's world 
title in World Cup Spain '82. It was not to be Maradona's tournament. 
Distracted by the Falklands War, the Argentine team went down quietly in the 
second round and its star player's luster seemed to fade. 
</P>
<P>
 His two years in Spain were marred by a bout of hepatitis and a fractured 
ankle that sidelined him for several months. In between, he managed to lead 
Barcelona to the 1983 Spanish Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, he was transferred to Napoli of the Italian league, host to the 
world's best-paid soccer players. In his six years there, Maradona turned a 
perennial loser from one of Italy's poorest regions into a dynasty, winning a 
total of five Italian and European tournaments. For that, he became a hero of 
the Italian working class and was rewarded with an endorsement portfolio that 
rivaled Michael Jordan's. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kid from Villa Fiorito proved to be ill-prepared for life in the 
fishbowl. Everywhere he went, he was mobbed by fans. Italian newspapers 
reported rumors that he was taking drugs and was friendly with the Mafia. He 
was hit with a paternity suit. He partied at discos and gained weight. His play 
on the field suffered. Off the field, in the social event of 1989 in Argentina, 
he went home and married his high school sweetheart, Claudia Villafane, with 
whom he already had two daughters. But for staging such a lavish gathering-he 
chartered a plane to bring his friends from Italy and rented a boxing hall for 
the reception-he was criticized in newspapers all over the world for his 
flamboyant ways. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Argentines were concerned, all was forgiven when he captained the 
national team to an unexpected second-place finish in the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona considers eliminating host Italy in the semifinals that year the most 
important day of his career. As he recalled that game at the hotel bar, the 
skin on his arms broke out in goose bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," he said, "the allure of your flag is the most beautiful itch you will 
ever feel. When (Italian fans) tore up our flag in front of the hotel window 
before the Italy game, I can't explain what was going on inside me." He paused. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaned forward, raised his eyebrows, and said in a grave, slow monotone: "I 
wanted to beat them. I wanted to leave them out of their own World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Nursing a torn muscle ("I shouldn't have even played in that game"), Maradona 
went on to assist on the game-tying goal and score the game-winning penalty 
kick. Afterward, he said, he rushed back to the hotel to kiss the new flag that 
hung from his window. 
</P>
<P>
 His bitterness toward Italy would grow in the ensuing months. He fought with 
Napoli team officials. News accounts linked him to a prostitution ring. In 10 
years, the bright-eyed extrovert had become a hardened shell. 
</P>
<P>
 In April 1991, he tested positive for cocaine after an Italian league game and 
FIFA slapped him with a world-wide, 15-month suspension. He reached his lowest 
point a month later when he was arrested in a Buenos Aires apartment after a 
cocaine binge. It was a Marion Barry-style sting operation, complete with a 
beautiful female undercover agent and an army of photographers and television 
camera crews recording the moment he was led into a patrol car handcuffed and 
glassy-eyed. For weeks, the bust was the biggest story in Argentina. One the 
day after the sting, President Carlos Menem stripped Maradona of his sports 
ambassadorship and called him "a sick child." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Maradona seems remorseful when he says, "I (messed) up and paid 
for it." But, in the next breath he adds, "I know I was set up. But you know 
what? They did me a great favor because they tried to kill me and instead they 
put me on the side of the people. The corrupt, the powerful never go to jail in 
this country and they never will." A few days after the arrest, Maradona was 
freed on bail and he entered a court-ordered drug treatment program, which he 
completed last year. Through it all, Argentine soccer fans stayed loyal to 
their idol. Everywhere Argentine teams played, the crowds erupted in a 
spontaneous chant: "Ole, Ole, Ole Oleeee, Dieeegoo, Dieeegoo!" When the soccer 
suspension ended, he signed with the Spanish team Seville. But in an 
up-and-down season, he only showed flashes of the vintage Maradona. For the 
most part he looked like an old, overweight player headed toward retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Argentine national team was doing fine without him. After the 
1990 World Cup, it went on a 33-game undefeated streak, a run that included two 
South American championships. Nobody seemed to care when Maradona announced his 
retirement last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Argentina suffered the most humiliating defeat in its storied 
history: a 5-0 embarrassment to Colombia in Buenos Aires last September that 
left the team on the brink of elimination from World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried a lot that day-a lot," recalled Maradona, who watched the game from 
the stands. "It was like they were touching my flag. My dad came into my 
bedroom, my wife, my daughters, and they couldn't make me stop crying. I tried 
to explain to my girls that their father had given blood, ankle, knee, guts, 
everything to that jersey that had lost 5-0 that day, and that I needed to come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after the Colombia disaster, Argentina had to weather a two-game 
home-and-away series with Australia for the final berth in the World Cup 
finals, and Maradona was ready. He had gone on a diet and lost 30 pounds. To 
hone his soccer skills, he signed up with the Rosario-based Newell's Old Boys 
team of the Argentine first Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona's debut with Newell's last October was a national event, televised 
live. He was introduced a half hour before the sold-out game, walking onto the 
spotlighted turf with his two daughters amid thunderous cheers from 35,000 
fans. When it was over, Maradona had scored the game-winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is skin," said Maradona. "It's giving the people that happiness they 
never get from the government, or from the empty promises politicians have been 
making for years. Soccer never lied to the Argentine. When we couldn't win, we 
didn't. And when we did win, we all celebrated together." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Australia, Maradona's presence on the field seemed enough to 
kick-start the Argentine team. The rugged Australians played tough but were 
overmatched. Argentina qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his uneven history, Argentine soccer fans were naturally curious about 
whether Maradona would show up for his first preseason practice with Newell's 
Jan. 12 after a month-long layoff. Is he in shape? Are his drug problems behind 
him? Are his injuries healed? Is he ready to lead Argentina to another World 
Cup victory? Millions of people wanted to know. That's why some two dozen 
reporters showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona looked trim, muscular and cleanshaven. His black, curly hair was 
tightly fashioned in a preppy haircut that exposed his trademark left earring. 
He wore shorts, a T-shirt and a pair of cheap sneakers. There were no bandages 
or braces protecting his injury-ravaged body. He jogged without a limp. But 
Maradona's presence at World Cup '94 is far from guaranteed. In the latest of 
his famous mood swings, Maradona quit Newell's on the eve of a preseason game. 
So nobody, not even Maradona, can predict his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably retire after the World Cup-if my heart lets me," he said. 
"Sometimes it's hard to give it all up. After the Australia game, I wanted to 
be the last guy to leave the stadium. I wanted to turn off the lights and walk 
out with the last fan." 
</P>
<P>
 After hanging up his cleats, Maradona said he hopes to someday coach the 
national team, but for the most part he would like to teach soccer to the 
Argentine children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to start a university to teach kids the game-without stealing from 
them. Not like some washed up player who retires without a penny and then tells 
kids, "Give me a thousand dollars and I'll teach you to play just like me.' 
There are certain things you can't teach. I'll just say come on over and play. 
Come and play and I won't steal from you."

HORSE RACING / FLORIDA DERBY; HOLY BULL IS GIVEN A 5 3/4-LENGTH BREATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Bull Inthe Heather won the Florida Derby, then ran eighth in the 
Kentucky Derby. He hasn't won since that victory at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull -- no relation to Bull Inthe Heather -- looks more like the genuine 
article. His 5 3/4-length victory Saturday in the $500,000 Florida Derby was 
one of the most convincing in the 43-year history of the stake, making 
owner-trainer Jimmy Croll's colt the new early favorite for the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday's race, the 74-year-old trainer said that Holy Bull wouldn't 
be a Kentucky Derby candidate until he showed that he belonged in a 1 1/4-mile 
race. The Florida Derby was one-eighth of a mile shorter than the Kentucky 
Derby distance, but Holy Bull gave no signs of stopping, opening up a 
comfortable lead and outfinishing 13 others to reach the wire in 1:47 2/5, 
fastest time for the race since Alydar's 1:47 in 1978. The only bigger winning 
margin in the Florida Derby was Plugged Nickle's six-length victory in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin, expected to make a serious run at Holy Bull through the stretch, 
was no match and finished fourth, beaten by almost seven lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a strong suspicion that no one would go out there and run with Holy 
Bull early," said Jerry Bailey, who rode Go For Gin. "But even if somebody did, 
I don't think that anybody would have beaten him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ride The Rails finished second, a nose in front of Halo's Image. After Go For 
Gin in fourth place came Amathos, Rocky's Halo, Robannier, Crary, Dramatic 
Gold, Lahint, Fabulous Frolic, Lynn's Notebook, Mr. Angel and Line Dance. Holy 
Bull, ridden by Mike Smith, was the favorite until late in the betting, then 
paid $7.40 as the second choice with the entry of Go For Gin and Crary going 
off as the 2-1 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull's sixth victory in seven starts increased his earnings to $680,760. 
In his only defeat, a last-place finish in the Fountain of Youth Stakes here 
three weeks ago, Croll said the colt had a breathing problem. Croll made some 
minor adjustments with Holy Bull's noseband, bit and tongue tie for Saturday's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull is a son of Great Above out of Sharon Brown, an Al Hattab mare. That 
breeding was supposed to produce a good grass horse, but Holy Bull started 
winning on dirt, and everybody forgot about the breeding objective. Owner 
Rachel Carpenter, suffering from lung cancer, was 78 when she died last August, 
several hours before Holy Bull made a winning debut in a maiden race at 
Monmouth Park. Carpenter, who had raced horses with Croll for 37 years, left 
Holy Bull and seven other horses to Croll. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a wonderful lady," Croll said Saturday. "I'm not saying that just 
because she left me the horses. She stayed on top of her horses, but she got 
superstitious and never saw any of the many stakes races that we won together." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he runs in the Kentucky Derby on May 7, Holy Bull will have to clear 
one more hurdle, the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland on April 16. Nick Zito, who 
trains Go For Gin and Crary, had planed to split up his horses, running Go For 
Gin in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and Crary in the Blue Grass, but now he's 
planning to run both in the Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Bull's a quality horse," Zito said. "If you throw out the Fountain of 
Youth for the reason Jimmy Croll said, he's really undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, ridden by Mike Smith, set the fractions of 22 2/5, 46 and 1:10. 
"This was the real Holy Bull," said Smith, who rode two others stakes winners 
on the card. "He could have gone an extra eighth of a mile today with no 
problem. We didn't steal this race. He ran in race-horse time. He just put 
those others away." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a bad No. 13 post, Bailey was able to break Go For Gin sharply and had 
him in good position, in fifth place, in the first turn. Halo's Image and Ride 
The Rails did what little chasing there was of Holy Bull in the early part of 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse started running going down the backside," Bailey said. "But they 
were going too fast in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The mile was run in a fast 1:34 4/5. Smith never used his whip through the 
stretch. Once, with about a sixteenth of a mile left, he looked back to see if 
there were any challengers. There was no one in sight. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Florida Derby horses carried 122 pounds. . . . Sandwiching Mike 
Smith's Florida Derby victory were winning rides aboard For All Seasons in the 
Safely Kept and Paradise Creek in the Fort Lauderdale Handicap. . . . Chris 
McCarron, who rode Lahint in the Florida Derby, won the Swale Stakes for 
3-year-olds with Arrival Time, a 25-1 shot. Arrival Time, not highly regarded 
by the Dogwood Stables before Saturday, will continue prepping for the Kentucky 
Derby at Turfway Park or Keeneland. . . . Fraise, winner of last year's Pan 
American Handicap, is favored in the $300,000 Gulfstream race today, with Smith 
riding. . . . The crowd Saturday at Gulfstream was 28,662, and it bet $5.2 
million, but with more than 650 off-track outlets nationally, the overall 
handle was $23.3 million, a record for Florida Derby day.

U.S. CALLS ON DEFENSE TO TIE SOUTH KOREA; SOCCER: AMERICANS APPEAR MORE 
ORGANIZED AND CONFIDENT AFTER A STRONG DEFENSIVE EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever tinkering, cajoling or group encounter sessions it took to organize 
the defense of the U.S. national soccer team paid off. While not erasing the 
memory of the lost weekend at Miami last month, Saturday night's 1-1 tie 
against South Korea may have helped the U.S. defense regain its confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone was the scrambling into position that marked the last two U.S. outings, a 
1-1 tie against Bolivia and a 3-1 loss to Sweden. Those games were worse even 
than their scores suggest, and equally demoralizing. The true damage was to the 
psyche of the defensive players who were adjusting to a new alignment and the 
return of Marcelo Balboa at sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. defense even scored, but it also put one in for South Korea. Defender 
Desmond Armstrong scored the own goal, giving South Korea the lead in the first 
half, and Balboa scored after a free kick in the second half, as the U.S. team 
continued to capitalize on set plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, at Cal State Fullerton, was played before a sellout crowd of 10,319. 
Soccer officials said fans were turned away at the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 They missed a physical and hard-fought game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we were pretty solid," Armstrong said. "There was more communication 
out there, we all knew our positions. This will help our confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong looked more comfortable having been moved to right back, his natural 
position. Alexi Lalas played at center back, the position he played in college. 
Balboa played sweeper and Paul Caliguri started the game on the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 The back four were mostly successful in blunting South Korea's speed, but the 
Koreans were nothing if not determined. When the United Sates clogged the 
midfield, South Korea attacked on the flanks with precision. Goalkeeper Brad 
Friedel was active and made a handful of spectacular saves. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little he could do about the first goal, which came in the 32nd 
minute. The United States lost possession in midfield and South Korea's Kim Pan 
Keun's chip shot glanced off Lalas' head and onto Armstrong's. He headed the 
ball back and it floated over Friedel's outstretched arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's instinct," Armstrong said of his attempt to clear the ball. "The Korean 
player was on my back. If I didn't hit it, he's clearly open." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa scored in the 64th minute during a scramble in front of the net. Hugo 
Perez centered the ball on a corner kick and Thomas Dooley was among the U.S. 
players who leaped to head it. The ball banged to the ground and up to Balboa's 
chest. He controlled it and sharply snapped it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is gaining a deserved reputation for being dangerous on set 
plays. Lalas, in particular, is assigned to take part in free kicks. The chaos 
after the free kick in Saturday night's game illustrated the opportunity the 
situations present. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perfectly executed debacle," Lalas said, laughing at the idea the play was 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit everybody it was supposed to hit. I don't care how it gets there as 
long as it gets there. The idea is to put yourself in a position to be 
dangerous. You never know what will happen."

GANT WINS; FEMALE DRIVER SAYS FOE WAS OUT TO GET HER IN TURN 
</P>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Gant 54, who plans to retire this year, beat Larry Pearson by 2.08 
seconds Saturday in the Busch Light 300 Grand National stock car race at 
Atlanta Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant, who won his 21st Grand National, had an average speed of 127.649 m.p.h., 
breaking the race record of 124.412 set in 1992 by Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 The race also featured a controversy over a first-lap accident involving 
Shawna Robinson, the first woman to win a Grand National pole. It occurred when 
Mike Wallace drove under Robinson and fellow front-row starter Joe Nemechek, 
making it a three-wide battle going into the third turn. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some bumping and Robinson wound up banging into Nemechek, and the 
two slid into the wall as Wallace took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some things said before (the race) about what was going to happen 
on the first lap, and I don't think that showed a lot of class," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemechek said of Wallace: "He was totally wrong in what he did. He should be 
penalized right there and then and kicked out of the race. He told a lot of 
people before this race started that he was going to take some air off her 
spoiler and get her loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who denied any wrongdoing, finished 11th. Robinson finished 36th; 
Nemechek was last.

KIDS DEPEND ON NCAA SELECTION PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED RODGERS, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the time they are little, they see themselves playing in the tournament. 
They are celebrating on the shoulders of a teammate, cutting down the net. You 
know the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 But what starts as a dream later drives their choice of college and motivates 
their play. The players who are hungry for their moment in the NCAA Tournament 
are the faces that bring humanity to the faceless NCAA. And that's why the 
selection process better be right. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with kids' lives," says Tom Butters, who is the athletic 
director at Duke and the man in charge of that selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is time to make up an injustice to coaches or programs, there is 
not for the players. They get four years -- if that -- and are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to filling out the bracket, the force that drives the people on 
the selection committee is not the seeding, but the selection. "You can play 
your way out of a bad seed, but you can't play your way into the tournament," 
Butters says. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's focus is to be fair to the teams on the bubble, that the right 
ones are selected, that the right faces reflect the joy of making the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Curley is one of the faces of players on the bubble. He has never played 
in the tournament, and he is out of time. A senior at Boston College, he will 
be sweating the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Curley has dreamed of playing in the tournament "since middle school." A high 
school All-American -- 6-foot-9 even then, he led his team to the state title 
-- he could have gone to a perennial tournament team. But he went to his 
hometown team, Boston College, and committed himself to the long struggle to 
turn around a program that had fallen to the bottom of a very tough conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "My freshman year, we were 1-16 in the league," Curley says. "We knew it would 
get better, but it took longer than I thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
 Curley plays with the desperation of a collegian out of time. He has driven 
Boston College down the stretch. His duel with UConn's Donyell Marshall on Feb. 
9 is the stuff of legend, one superb player matching another in a game decided 
in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked about it all year," Curley says of playing in the tournament. 
"We wanted to do something to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Brown also knows. He, too, is out of time, but it is a time he wasn't 
sure he would ever have. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is a 5-foot-7 senior at New Mexico. "I always dreamed of playing in the 
March Madness," he says, "but at my size, it was a dream. But the dream is that 
if you play good enough, you can still hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has always had to prove himself. He led Albuquerque High to the state 
title, but still had to prove himself. He went to New Mexico Junior College for 
two years, was his district's player of the year, but "New Mexico was as close 
as I could get" to playing for a powerhouse program. New Mexico wanted him to 
redshirt, but four games into the season, Brown was sent out as a reserve. In 
one night he proved he should start. And he has started every game since. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico made the tournament last year but was blown out by George 
Washington, 82-68. New Mexico can win the Western Athletic Conference's 
automatic berth. But if it doesn't, it, like Boston College, will be on the 
bubble, dependent on the expertise and judgment of Butters and the selection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection committee draws on a computer rating program. Though the final 
bracket is almost a direct reflection of the ratings, Butters says they are 
just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we never get to the point where everything is so systematic that we 
can't use our judgment," he says. "There are things the computer can't tell 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries, the atmosphere and setting of games, results on the road and in 
conference are factors, Butters says. What else? "Everything else," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA gives automatic berths to the champions of 30 conferences. The other 
34 spots are up for grabs. "Everyone knows the first 25, 26 of those teams," 
Butters says. "Most of our time is spent on the final spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are teams on the bubble: 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech twice beat North Carolina, each time when the Tar Heels were No. 
1. "Beating North Carolina twice has given us a lot of hope because a month ago 
people said we were definitely out," Coach Bobby Cremins says. Tech helped 
itself by not only playing a difficult schedule, but by beating Temple, 
Vanderbilt, Georgia and St. John's. "Why would anyone schedule tough 
non-conference games if they don't mean anything?" Cremins says. "I think the 
NCAA will really look at the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington looked like a team of swell-headed underachievers at 
midseason, and Coach Mike Jarvis was accused of wasting some big (Yinka Dare) 
talent. People laughed when Jarvis said GW was ready for a "10-game winning 
streak." But GW went 8-2 and upset UMass. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin started the season 11-0, beating Stanford and Ohio State. Then the 
losses started -- eight in the next 12 games. Just when they seemed out of it, 
the Badgers beat Michigan. They close with games against Iowa and at Indiana. 
"We can analyze this, we can analyze that," Coach Stu Jackson says. "But you've 
got to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said he knew his team needed to finish strong, 
then they lost four of their next five before winning the last two.. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State went 10-1, then lost its first three Pac-10 games. It won 
five of six, then lost three of four. The Pac-10 does not have a conference 
tournament, but Washington State has games that will seem like they are in a 
tournament -- they close at home against Stanford and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia beat North Carolina, but lost by 41 to UConn (at home), by 36 to 
Florida State, and to Old Dominion and Stanford. They have to do what Georgia 
Tech did last year and upset their way to the ACC Tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt won the SEC title and made the Sweet 16 last year, and Eddie Fogler 
was named coach of the year. He left, Jan van Breda Kolff came in -- and 
Vanderbilt has disappointed, despite having Billy McCaffrey. Vanderbilt needs 
to overcome defensive problems to win the SEC bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M once controlled the Southwest Conference, but lost at Southern 
Methodist and to Baylor. Now the Aggies need to win the SWC Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa, was bumped from the Missouri Valley Tournament. The MVC has one 
automatic berth. Coach Tubby Smith says Tulsa can "play with just about anybody 
in the country." Tulsa took Arkansas to overtime and played Oklahoma State 
tough, but lost each game. 
</P>
<P>
 Coppin State scheduled and played tough games on the road against Kansas 
State, Virginia, Missouri, Oklahoma and Boston College, but will probably need 
to win the Mid-Eastern Athletic's automatic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 College of Charleston is not eligible for the Trans America's automatic berth 
-- it is too recent a member -- but is the best team. It has beaten South 
Carolina and Alabama. 
</P>

 Texas Pan American, in Coach Mark Adams' second season, has eclipsed the 
school's win total for the past three seasons (seven, zero and two) to become 
one of the country's best turnaround stories. It won't survive to get the Sun 
Belt's automatic berth, but will survive to lobby for a reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane's longest winning streak is four, and the Metro Conference has a low 
power rating. But if the Green Wave can make the Metro tournament final (hello, 
Louisville), Tulane will put itself on the bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State's victory over Arkansas on January 19 looks better and 
better as Arkansas keeps winning. The school's best victory since 1962, it may 
vault them into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans expects to win the Sun Belt tournament and automatic berth. But if 
it doesn't, it will lobby that it beat George Washington and Southern and its 
losses include powers Arizona and Purdue.

MORNING BRIEFING: THESE FANS ARE READY TO RUMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not everyone in Southern California is worried about Quakes. Some, in fact, 
are looking forward to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Houser of Ontario is one of them. He waited more than 24 hours at the 
Epicenter in Rancho Cucamonga for the Quakes' ticket office to open so he could 
be the first to purchase seats for the California League baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It said in the Quakes' advertisement in the paper that the early bird gets 
the worm, so here I am," Houser said. "I came early because we wanted the best 
tickets in the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Quakes: The Rancho Cucamonga team sold 12,000 single-game tickets the day 
they went on sale. Opening day is April 7 against the High Desert Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which three teams have played in each of the last 10 NCAA 
basketball tournaments? 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger, for sure: Headline in the New York Daily News when the Dodgers' Darryl 
Strawberry had alleged problems with the IRS: IS STRAW A TAX DODGER? 
</P>
<P>
 Not an MVP type: Ricky Pierce of the Seattle SuperSonics has a $2.1-million 
salary, but he must wonder about how much he helps the team. In the 11 games he 
has sat out this season, Seattle is 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing times: Participation in high school sports went up for girls and down 
for boys last year, according to a survey of the National Federation of State 
High School Assns. There were 56,688 more girls playing sports than in 1992 and 
13,464 fewer boys. However, boys still have the most participants, 3.4 million 
to 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Up, up and up: Michael Jordan is having his problems becoming a major league 
baseball player, but the Chicago Bulls' legend hasn't lost his sense of humor. 
After going back to the fence on a fly ball only to watch it go out of the 
park, Jordan said: "If I had on the right shoes, I would've caught it." 
</P>
<P>
 Science fun: The PBS series "Newton's Apple" is a family science program. When 
the producers did a show entitled "Gyroscopic Inertia," they called on the 
Harlem Globetrotters, who showed the physics of spinning a basketball and how 
it relates to -- get this -- a synoscope. Billy Rae Hobley spun a physics book 
on his finger and he and Curley Boo Johnson dribbled a ball through a group of 
spinning tops. What would Abe Saperstein think about that? 
</P>
<P>
 The TV eye: Four times this season UC Santa Barbara has been assessed 
technical fouls when the Gaucho fans threw tortillas on the court. On all four 
occasions, the game was televised by ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Duke, North Carolina and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 Local rule: At the Kampula Golf Club in Uganda, golfers are allowed relief 
from hippopotamus footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Add rules: Closer to home, at the Glen Canyon course in Arizona, a rule reads: 
"If your ball lands within a club's length of a rattlesnake, you are allowed to 
move the ball." No thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: John Andretti, who is planning to race in the Indianapolis 500 and 
the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte on the same day, on what he would do if he won 
at Indy: "If I win the Indianapolis 500, they can interview me in Charlotte."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / BIG WEST CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT; IRVINE STILL ALIVE AFTER 
UPSET NO. 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The impossible dream is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine, the only 10th-seeded team in the 15-year history of the Big West to 
win a game in the conference tournament, is one victory away from earning a 
part in the NCAA tournament. The Anteaters, their high-top Cinderella slippers 
still firmly laced to their feet, defeated Pacific, 82-78, in the semifinals 
Saturday night before 8,959 in the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 They will play top-seeded New Mexico State, an 82-64 winner over Nevada Las 
Vegas, in the final today at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (10-19) has won three games in a row for the the first time in Rod 
Baker's three-season tenure as coach and once again it was the play of senior 
point guard Lloyd Mumford that guided the Anteaters to victory. His 
regular-season performances varied from spectacular to out of control to just 
plain ragged, but he has been nothing short of inspired during Irvine's 
three-day Las Vegas fling. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pacific (17-14) closed to within five points with four minutes to play, 
Mumford responded with a pair of three-point plays -- a steal, layup and free 
throw and an acrobatic baseline bank shot and free throw -- to put Irvine ahead 
by 11. When the Tigers made a couple of three-point shots down the stretch, 
Mumford controlled the ball, drew the fouls and made six of eight foul shots in 
the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford, who finished with a game-high 29 points and seven assists, may have 
been tired, but he clearly wasn't running on empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little fatigued, but I was focused," he said. "The game was right 
there in your hands and you want to close your fist around it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Anteaters have shown the commitment and concentration that was so 
obviously absent from their regular-season follies. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine came into the tournament last in the conference in field-goal 
percentage defense (48%). But in three tournament games, their opponents have 
made only 36% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's three-point specialist Chris Brown was held scoreless by the Tigers' 
box-and-one defense in the first half, but he made four of seven three-pointers 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State 82, Nevada Las Vegas 64 -- The Aggies went on a 32-3 tear 
late in the second half to overcome a nine-point halftime deficit and will be 
making their third consecutive appearance in the tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Aggies (22-7), who swept the Runnin' Rebels (15-13) during the 
regular season, were led by James Dockery, who scored 23 points, 13 in the 
second half.

NORTH CAROLINA PRESENTS SMITH WITH 800TH, BEATING WAKE FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a little longer than usual for North Carolina Coach Dean Smith to get 
victory No. 800. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked Tar Heels (26-6) narrowly avoided a Saturday of upsets with 
an 86-84 overtime victory over Wake Forest (20-11) in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference semifinals to advance to a championship game today against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said it was merely another victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was after No. 26 and now we're after No. 27. One at a time," he said after 
becoming the third coach to reach the 800 milestone. Kentucky's Adolph Rupp 
leads the group with 876 victories, followed by Clarence (Big House) Gaines, 
who won 828 at Winston Salem State. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 33rd season at North Carolina, Smith got his 800th on a day when six of 
the top eight teams in The Associated Press poll lost. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina wasn't ensured of victory until Jerry Stackhouse scored on a 
driving layup with 5.3 seconds to play. Stackhouse said there was no question 
what was going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was going to the basket if I got it," he said. "I wasn't going to 
try to take a little jump shot or anything. I was definitely going to the 
basket."

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; INQUIRING MINDS WILL LOVE THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's all there in this week's National Enquirer: "Rush Limbaugh's Secret 
Bride-to-Be' . . . "Tonya: Her Life in Photos' . . . "The Evil Spy Who Betrayed 
America Was Really a Henpecked Wimp." 
</P>
<P>
 And the one that caught our eye: "Brooke Shields and Andre Agassi: 'We're So 
Much in Love.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, reports the Enquirer, the Zen Master and the seldom-seen-on-the-screen 
actress are an item. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre and Brooke are boyfriend and girlfriend," Phillip Agassi, older brother 
of the former Wimbledon champion and manager of Agassi Enterprises, said from 
Las Vegas. In the article, Andre is quoted as saying, "I'm in love with Brooke. 
She's very special -- and she's added a lot to my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Babbles Brooke, "Andre Agassi is the love of my life! We're so much in love -- 
and I hope this feeling goes on forever!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shields, who is five years older than the 23-year-old Agassi, said that their 
romance began with a fax, that they see each other every couple of weeks, love 
to go to movies and eat at Wendy's and have been dating for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this goes well," she said, "I'd like to be married by the time I'm 30, 
then have two or three children." 
</P>
<P>
 After she had foot surgery recently, Shields said, Agassi jetted to her side 
when she had a severe reaction to medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I vomited constantly," she said. "Andre held my head when I was sick and 
carried me back and forth to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it romantic? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Eye, eye, eye: After losing to Pete Sampras in the semifinals of the Newsweek 
Champions Cup at Indian Wells, Stefan Edberg was kept on the court to receive a 
"nicest eyes" award from a tournament sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of sportsmanship awards," Edberg said, "but this is a new one 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, best buns? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Last roundup: Only two months into her final year of singles competition, 
Martina Navratilova, 37, was asked to defend her decision to leave the WTA Tour 
after winning a tournament in Paris last month for her 167th title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my mental state questioned by some people," she said. "They said, 'Are 
you crazy? Rumor has it that you've really lost it in the head.' I said, 'What 
are you talking about?' Started to get really defensive. I was told that I was 
crazy for quitting because I am at the top and playing really well. But this 
doesn't change my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am quite happy with my decision and my mother thinks I am going to change 
my mind, but she has been wrong about (me) being a vegetarian, also, so it is 
not the first time that my mother could be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In putting together a schedule for her final year, Navratilova said she 
included almost all of her favorite stops, including the Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles Aug. 8-14 at Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds have been fantastic the last couple of years," she said of the 
Southland stop. "They just really go overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I said last year, I felt in my earlier years of my career I was 
underappreciated. I hit great shots and people were like, 'Oh, just an average 
shot,' and somehow I am hitting an average shot and I am getting standing 
ovations now. I just walk on the court and people go crazy . . . and I 
certainly get that kind of reception in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Won't it be difficult to walk away from that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, sure, but, you know, I have had enough," she said. "I mean, enough of a 
good thing already. I have had such a great ride, made so many friends, had 
such great opportunities and experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel like it is going to be this big part of my life that is cut away 
because those memories will always be there. And I am walking away on my own, 
not because I am forced to by body or mind or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am walking away because I am ready for the rest of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just wondering: As he prepared to serve during a match against Petr Korda in 
the Newsweek Champions Cup, Todd Martin heard a spectator call out from the 
stands, "We're all with you, Todd." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the point, Martin returned to the baseline, looked up and asked: 
"Are you still with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Never say never: Pete Sampras says the most imposing obstacle in his pursuit 
of a Grand Slam will be the French Open. His victory at Kitzbuhel, Austria, in 
1992 was the only one of his 23 titles that was won on clay and he has not 
advanced beyond the quarterfinals at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a bit vulnerable on the clay," said Sampras, who has won the sport's 
other three majors -- the U.S. Open, Wimbledon and the Australian Open. "I feel 
like when I play guys on clay, they've got a pretty good chance. They're not 
really intimidated by me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel like I'm a bit behind the Couriers and Brugueras on the clay, 
and that's maybe going to take some more time. I realize I need to get a great 
draw and be playing the best tennis of my career because it's going to be the 
biggest challenge for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, 22, doubts that anyone can win all four majors in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as realistically winning the Grand Slam, I think it's -- I don't want 
to say impossible, but it's going to be a hell of an effort," he said. "When 
(Rod) Laver won it (in 1969), he won three of the Slams on grass, which is 
probably his best surface. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, the French is going to be the biggest hurdle for me. But to 
win all four in the same year is pretty much impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is that all? Said Thomas Muster, asked what he would have to do to become 
competitive with Sampras after his fifth consecutive lopsided loss against the 
world's No. 1 player: "Be born again, be taller and get long arms." Tennis 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 India named its team for a first-round Davis Cup match against the United 
States March 25-27 at New Delhi -- Leander Paes, Zeeshan Ali, Gaurav Natekar 
and Asif Ismail. Only Paes, ranked 330th in the world, and Ali, ranked 481st, 
are expected to play against the U.S. team of Jim Courier, Todd Martin, Patrick 
McEnroe and Richey Reneberg. The winner will play Belgium or the Netherlands in 
the quarterfinals July 15-17 in Europe. . . . In its first year under Captain 
Tom Gullikson, the U.S. team might have to play all its matches on the road. 
"We're calling it Gulli's Travels," a U.S. Tennis Assn. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cold Warrior: Aaron Krickstein, a surprise semifinalist in the Newsweek 
Champions Cup, upset 12th-seeded Alexander Volkov in the quarterfinals, 
improving his record against Russian players to 13-0. . . . The Women's Tennis 
Council postponed discussion of a special seeding for Monica Seles after the 
former No. 1 player announced that she would be sidelined from the WTA tour for 
"an indefinite period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Contemporary Art's second "MOCA on Court" tennis tournament 
April 30 and May 1, 6, 7 and 8 will benefit MOCA's education and community 
outreach programs. Details: (310) 454-1383. . . . Senior players from around 
the world will compete in the Phoenix Challenge/Love 50 tennis tournament April

POWELL'S SHOT GIVES USC A WINNING FINISH; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TROJANS BEAT 
OREGON STATE IN FINAL SECONDS, 69-68. FOURTH VICTORY IN A ROW IS EXPECTED TO 
EARN THEM AN NIT BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With USC trailing Oregon State by a point and only eight seconds to play, 
Trojan senior Damaine Powell decided that it was up to him to determine the 
outcome of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like do or die," said Powell, whose only previous shot was blocked in 
the first half. "No one was open and all I saw was everyone standing around 
looking at me." 
</P>
<P>
 With USC Coach George Raveling's first two options in Burt Harris and Mark 
Boyd closely covered, Powell made a 10-foot jump shot with 2.6 seconds left to 
put the Trojans ahead, 69-68. 
</P>
<P>
 USC then had to survive two desperation plays by Oregon State to gain its 
fourth consecutive victory and a probable National Invitation Tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shot felt good as soon as I let it go, but man, I was so nervous," said 
Powell, who had attempted only 62 shots all season and had missed a last-second 
shot in a three-point loss at South Florida early in the season. "It took a 
quick second for me to realize I had made it, because I just couldn't believe 
that it went in." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's heroics appeared to be short-lived only seconds later, thanks to a 
Gill Coliseum timekeeper who hesitated to start the clock, giving Oregon 
State's Brent Barry time to make a three-point basket at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short discussion at the center of the court, officials ruled that the 
final 1.4 seconds would be replayed. Boyd stripped the ball from Oregon State's 
Stephane Brown at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 After defeating UCLA, California, Arizona State and Oregon in four of its last 
five games, USC struggled for 40 minutes against a determined Oregon State 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who finished 16-11 overall and 9-9 in the Pacific 10 Conference, 
trailed for most of the game thanks to Barry, who tied a career-high with 31 
points to go with 10 rebounds and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry helped the Beavers to a fast start with 11 points and two assists in the 
first nine minutes as Oregon State took a 19-11 lead. With starting guard 
Brandon Martin sidelined because of a foot injury, USC had problems scoring 
throughout the first half, which ended with the Beavers leading, 39-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State (6-21, 2-16) took a 54-44 lead on a three-point basket by Barry 
with 11:32 to play. That's when USC began to take advantage of its strength 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 In a five-minute span, USC outscored Oregon State, 14-2, to take a 58-56 lead 
that was capped off by an acrobatic three-point play by freshman Stais Boseman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans opened a 67-62 lead with 2:47 left before Brown and Barry combined 
for six consecutive points to set up Powell's game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an extra special win for us because we had to play without Martin 
and did not get much scoring from Lorenzo Orr for much of the game," Raveling 
said. "But we kept our poise and hung around until Boyd and Orr took over down 
the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd made a career-high 13 of 16 free throws and finished with 21 points and 
nine rebounds. Orr had 12 points, five rebounds and two blocked shots. USC 
outrebounded Oregon State, 41-30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told us that there wasn't any way they could stick with us inside," 
Boyd said. "So we just kept pounding and pounding it in there." 
</P>
<P>
 USC will now have to wait until the NIT announces its 32-team field this 
afternoon. Last season, the Trojans advanced to the quarterfinals before losing 
to Minnesota, the eventual champion.

<P>
 On the day Arizona State saluted its seniors, sophomore forward Ron Riley 
stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley scored a career-high points 27 points Saturday to lead Arizona State to 
a 94-87 victory over No. 7 Arizona at Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, which ended an eight-game winning streak, Arizona (25-5, 
14-4) won the Pac-10 championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, who made nine of 14 shots, said the team dedicated the game to its 
seniors: Stevin Smith, Dwayne Fontana and Robert Conlisk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, because it is their last time," Riley said. "We knew we had to 
play hard. We told them that we had to do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State trailed only once in the second half in improving to 15-12 
overall and 10-8 in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can consider this a complete game except for the first two 
minutes when a couple of easy shots didn't fall," Arizona State Coach Bill 
Frieder said. "We knew the kids were focused and ready to go. We just didn't 
know if they were good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State 94, No. 16 California 82 -- Eddie Hill made seven three-point 
shots and scored 27 points at Pullman, Wash., to boost the Cougars' hopes for 
an NCAA tournament bid. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cal (22-7, 13-5), the loss ended hopes for a Pac-10 title. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State (20-10, 10-8) pulled ahead with a 21-11 run early in the 
second half and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford 76, Washington 61 -- Andy Poppink and Brent Williams combined for 38 
points and 20 rebounds at Seattle as Stanford (17-10, 10-8) kept alive its 
hopes for a postseason bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (5-22, 3-15) got 19 points from Maurice Woods.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; TITLE-CLINCHING VICTORY DOESN'T THRILL MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The USC women's basketball team won the Pacific 10 Conference championship and 
completed a 23-3 regular season Saturday, but it wasn't enough to make 
first-year Coach Cheryl Miller happy. 
</P>
<P>
 She stormed out of USC's Lyon Center meeting room after reading the riot act 
to her players, bolting out the door and through the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Her team had played barely well enough to defeat Oregon State, 69-64, in a 
game that included a flood of ballhandling errors, defensive lapses and 32% 
shooting by the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had a 10-point lead with nine seconds to play, but Oregon State's Amy 
Ellis threw in a 15-foot jump shot and then, following a Trojan turnover, made 
a three-pointer with two seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 USC then celebrated briefly its championship, which broke a string of five in 
a row by Stanford, before Miller confronted her players inside the meeting 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 "She left . . . she wasn't pleased with how they played," associate head coach 
Fred Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said assistant Frank Scott: "Cheryl wasn't happy at how they finished off the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State's aggressive, attacking zone defense kept USC from building a 
commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
 USC trailed at halftime, 38-34, but opened a 48-42 lead in the second half and 
never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie, in her final game at the Lyon Center, had 18 points, 16 rebounds, 
two assists, two steals and two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems just like another game right now, but I guess the championship will 
sink in later," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans finished with a 16-2 Pac-10 record, a game ahead of Stanford. 
Oregon State is 17-10, 9-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon 76, UCLA 68 -- Sara Wilson scored 18 points to lead the Ducks, who 
overcame a three-point halftime deficit at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Amy Jalewalia scored 16 points to lead UCLA, which ended the 
season with a 15-12 record, 10-8 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon finished at 19-8, 13-5.

AUTO RACING; QUALIFYING WOES LIKELY TO GET WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last weekend's qualifying at Richmond International Raceway has some in NASCAR 
circles sweating. 
</P>
<P>
 After two rounds of time trials, nine teams -- six of them with full-season 
sponsorship -- had to go home. And that was after three teams were added to the 
back of the field as provisional starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the fields at short tracks like Richmond are smaller -- generally 32 
or 34 starters -- but that fact doesn't soothe a sponsor like STP or Camel, 
which spends millions of dollars on a team and doesn't like missing races. 
</P>
<P>
 Camel was able to move its decals over to the non-sponsored team of Bobby 
Allison for Sunday's race, but STP simply went home with Richard Petty's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are likely to get worse, even at the big tracks with starting fields of 
generally 40 cars, because more and more teams are coming up with big-dollar 
sponsors as NASCAR's top series continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 And even the little teams are getting better. The recent record spread in 
qualifying at Rockingham, just two-thirds of a second between first and 40th, 
shows how big a problem this could become. If even one of the top teams is just 
a tick off, it could wind up with its sponsor-covered transporter on the way 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 NASCAR is aware of the problem. One solution may be to paint in more pit boxes 
at the short tracks and start more cars. But sponsors may have to get used to 
the idea that their team could miss a few races during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 EIGHT OF NASCAR'S 31 Winston Cup races take place on tracks shorter than one 
mile. Just thinking about that makes Rusty Wallace smile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eight 1993 short track events, Wallace won five times and finished 
second in the other three. Just to assure people that nothing has changed, 
despite his switchover from Pontiac to Ford over the winter, Wallace finished 
second, behind Ernie Irvan, last Sunday at Richmond in the first of the 1994 
short track events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right on schedule," said Buddy Parrott, crew chief for Wallace's Penske 
Racing South team. "We haven't even tested a short track yet, but we've got one 
(test) coming up at Martinsville, and we're taking three cars and three 
different motor combinations up there. We're ready to defend ourselves on the 
short tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Wallace, who won two weeks ago at Rockingham after crashing in the 
season-opener at Daytona, also runs strong at the longer tracks. He certainly 
will be among the favorites Sunday on Atlanta Motor Speedway's 1.522-mile oval, 
where he won the season-ending race in November. 
</P>
<P>
 RICKY RUDD, who started his own team last season, knows the frustrations of 
being a car owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week at Richmond, Rudd chose to stand on a disappointing first-round lap 
and barely held on to make the field, starting 34th in what was to be a 34-car 
field before a trio of provisional starters were added. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Rudd did not have a provisional available, because his new team does not 
have car-owner points from last season, one more fast car in second round 
qualifying and he would have missed his first start since Jan. 11, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's going to be like this every week, this team is for sale," Rudd said. 
"I can't take much of this." 
</P>
<P>
 But, after finishing eighth at Daytona and 11th at Rockingham, Rudd was 18th 
at Richmond, and provisionals based on the current season's car-owner points 
begin following Sunday's race at Atlanta. He was 11th in points following 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have have to go another race or two with top-10s and we won't have to 
worry about this when our car-owner's points count," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 THERE WERE A LOT of damp eyes after Ernie Irvan drove into Victory Lane last 
Sunday at Richmond, the same place where the late Davey Allison put the same 
team on the victory stand the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final win for Allison, who died July 13 after a helicopter crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry McReynolds, crew chief for Allison and now for Irvan, said, "I still 
think about him every day that goes by, every race that goes by. Ernie Knows 
it, and he wants (Davey) to be a team member forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we won the 125 (at Daytona), Martinsville, Charlotte -- this doesn't 
feel any different than it did then. It's always good to get that first win (of 
the season) out of the way, as tough as it's getting." 
</P>
<P>
 DALE EARNHARDT, hoping to make a real run at a record-tying seventh Winston 
Cup championship, has gotten off to a decent start, finishing seventh, seventh 
and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into Sunday's race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, the defending series champ 
trails leader Ernie Irvan by just 53 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But Earnhardt, who has faded from contention near the end of each of the first 
three events this season, would love to get that first victory of 1994 under 
his belt, and Atlanta's 1.522-mile oval is a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt leads all active drivers with six victories at AMS, and he has 21 
top-10 finishes in 31 career starts. That includes 19 top-five finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three-time series champion Darrell Waltrip has more top 10s at the 
Atlanta track, with 27 in 43 starts.

NBA ROUNDUP; LUCAS GETS RESPECT, SPURS GET VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman found himself ignored on the San Antonio bench, which apparently 
earned Coach John Lucas some respect and didn't slow the Spurs in a 109-98 
victory at Houston that put them back in first place in the NBA Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman's absence from the floor might have saved the officials some problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been ejected from two consecutive games -- including one Friday at San 
Antonio -- because of technical fouls, then missed the plane to Houston for the 
Saturday game. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived just before game time, only to be told by Lucas that he would not 
be playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman said when Lucas told him he was being benched, he told the coach: "If 
you do that, you better stick to that if I'm going to respect you." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas did, even though Rodman tried to get into the game in the third quarter, 
holding up a towel on which he had scribbled with a marker in big letters: "I'm 
sorry. Can I play! Please." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas said he did not see the towel and laughed about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help but love him," he said of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just missed the plane, that's all," Rodman said. "I took another plane. But 
we have no problem. This team showed tonight that anybody could step up. They 
have a lot of character. There'll be no problem with Lucas. I'll still be the 
same person." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs got 40 points and 16 rebounds from David Robinson and 23 points from 
Negele Knight in the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was Houston's fourth in seven games. Hakeem Olajuwon led the Rockets 
with 27 points and 18 rebounds but played much of the game in foul trouble. 
Vernon Maxwell added 23 for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was marked by five technical fouls -- three against Houston and two 
against the Spurs. Lucas also complained to game officials that the Rockets' 
Maxwell, who picked up one of the technicals, had spit at least twice at the 
Spur bench in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 117, Charlotte 92 -- Derrick Coleman scored 20 points and the Nets 
opened some more distance between themselves and the Hornets for the final 
Eastern Conference playoff spot at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Johnson, who returned to the Hornets' lineup Friday night after missing 
31 games because of a back injury, had eight points in 16 minutes, playing only 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 96, Cleveland 86 -- The Knicks held their opponent below 90 points 
for the sixth consecutive game, a team record in the shot-clock era, and got 29 
points from Patrick Ewing in beating the Cavaliers, who were without starters 
Brad Daugherty and Mark Price, at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 111, Sacramento 94 -- Scottie Pippen scored 20 points and the Bulls 
used a 15-4 run to start the fourth quarter in beating the Kings at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls capped their decisive fourth-quarter run at 7:14 when the Kings were 
called for consecutive technical fouls on Randy Brown, Coach Garry St. Jean and 
Lionel Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 104, Milwaukee 97 -- Reggie Miller scored 23 points and became the 
fourth player in NBA history to hit 800 three-pointers as the Pacers won at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 104, Detroit 92 -- Danny Manning scored 18 of his 24 points in the 
second half as the Hawks won at Auburn Hills, Mich., and prevented the Pistons 
from winning three in a row for the first time since Nov. 17-21.

MANSELL AGAIN THE FAVORITE TO WIN THE INDY-CAR SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first act of what is expected to be a real drama in the 1994 Indy-car PPG 
Cup series will be played out March 20 in Australia -- half a world away from 
most of its fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Englishman Nigel Mansell, who brought his 1992 Formula one championship with 
him last season as he took the American-based Indy-car series by storm, winning 
five races and the title as a rookie, will again be the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a new Lola chassis and a new generation Ford-Cosworth V8 engine, as 
well as considerably more experience racing on this side of the ocean than 
going into 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely more comfortable," Mansell said. "This year we know the 
tracks, we know the cities, we know the hotels. Most importantly, we know the 
people. It makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 But the 16-race championship isn't expected to be a cakewalk for the man who 
opened his Indy-car career by winning the opener on the streets of Surfers 
Paradise, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Back after a year of trying to fit in among the glitterati of Formula One is 
1991 series champion Michael Andretti, driving for Chip Ganassi's team, 
expected to be the leading contender among the teams racing the new Reynard 
chassis. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Mario Andretti, Mansell's Newman-Haas Racing teammate, had a 
disappointing and sometimes embarrassing season in Formula One, although he 
scored points in three races and made the post-race podium with a third-place 
finish at Italy late in the year. And, at age 31, Andretti already has 27 
Indy-car victories and a reputation for being as aggressive and single-minded 
as Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Andretti, who did more than 2,500 miles of testing over the 
winter, said, "I'm really encouraged. Everywhere we've tested, we've been right 
there with the best times. I feel very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm right where I was in terms of driving before I left Indy cars at the end 
of 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 The Penske Racing team will be even stronger than last season, when Emerson 
Fittipaldi won his second Indianapolis 500 and was runner-up in the season 
points, and 25-year-old Paul Tracy blossomed into a star with five wins and a 
third-place finish in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr., just 31 and already with 19 career victories, including the 1992 
Indianapolis 500 and the 1990 series championship, is the newest Penske driver. 
</P>
<P>
 That all-star trio will have new Penske race cars with equally new Ilmor 
Engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see right from the first test what makes the Penske team so great," 
Unser said. "They have the best of the everything, and their preparation is 
tremendous. I can't wait for the season to get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Bobby Rahal, a three-time series champion whose Rahal-Hogan team 
is expected to get a big boost from engine produced by American Honda, a 
newcomer to the open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tier of drivers capable of winning in any given race, if not 
challenging for the title, includes Mario Andretti, ending his all-star career 
with one last season before retirement; former Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendyk, 
Raul Boesel; Scott Goodyear; Teo Fabi; and 25-year-old Robby Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's top rookie is expected to be 26-year-old Scott Sharp, a two-time 
SCCA Trans-Am champion who finished 22nd in October at Monterey, Calif., in 
only his Indy-car start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fantastic thing about the Indy-car series is that so many teams are 
capable of winning on any weekend," Mansell said. "Anyone can buy the same 
basic chassis and run the same engine, and then it's the responsibility of the 
teams and drivers to do the best job they can." 
</P>
<P>
 The North American portion has races at Phoenix on April 10 and in Long Beach, 
Calif., on April 17 setting the stage for the Indianapolis 500 in May.

10 ARE SULLIVAN AWARD FINALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HERMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Ward, the Heisman Trophy winner from Florida State, is a finalist for 
an award he knows almost nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward quarterbacked the Seminoles to the 1993 national championship and is one 
of 10 finalists for the Amateur Athletic Union's Sullivan Award, presented 
annually since 1930 to the nation's outstanding amateur athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will be announced Monday night at the Indiana Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The only football players who won the Sullivan, dominated historically by 
track and field athletes and swimmers, were Army teammates Doc Blanchard in 
1945 and Arnold Tucker in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very honored, just like with everything," said Ward, who admitted he 
never heard of the Sullivan Award until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know the history and background," he said. "I guess it would 
be right up there with it (the Heisman). But I'm not a guy who worries about 
awards. I'm more to winning national championships than individual awards." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, also the Walter Camp player of the year, passed for more than 3,000 
yards and 27 touchdowns and led the Seminoles to their first championship with 
an 18-16 victory over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The other finalists for the Sullivan are Bruce Baumgartner in wrestling; Brian 
Boitano, figure skating; Gail Devers, track and field; Bobby Hurley, 
basketball; Dan Jansen, speedskating; Shannon Miller, gymnastics; Dan O'Brien, 
track and field; Sheryl Swoopes, basketball; and Jenny Thompson, swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumgartner, 33, the oldest of the 10, also was a finalist in 1986 and 1992 
and won his fourth world championship last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the finalists except Boitano and O'Brien are expected to attend the 
award dinner. Last year's winner, speedskater Bonnie Blair, will present the 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting by more than 2,000 people, including members of the AAU, the U.S. 
Olympic Committee, past Sullivan winners and selected news media, was for 
accomplishments in 1993 and was completed before Jansen's Olympic gold medal at 
Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just good to be with all the people who are finalists. You can't beat 
that," Ward said. "The Lord blessed me, and I'm honored to be a part of this. 
This is a national amateur award. It would be good if I win, but if I don't, 
I'm not going to worry about it. . . . I'm not going to feel like I'm not a 
winner if I don't win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, also a guard for the Florida State basketball team, said he hasn't 
decided which sport he will try to play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully I'll be drafted (by an NFL team), if the Lord's willing," he said. 
"But I've always enjoyed playing basketball as much as football. That's nothing 
new. It's something I've always loved to to." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Sullivan Award winner was golfer Bobby Jones. Other winners in 
recent years included Carl Lewis, Mary Decker, Edwin Moses, Joan 
Benoit-Samuelson, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Florence Griffith Joyner and Mike 
Powell in track and field; Greg Louganis in diving; Jim Abbott in baseball; 
Janet Evans in swimming; and John Smith in wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Track and field has had 36 Sullivan winners and swimming 12. No other sport 
has provided more than two winners.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux is still not completely fit and he won't play for the Pittsburgh 
Penguins today at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because he played Saturday against the New York Rangers, who probably 
wish he would choose different days off. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited because of his back problems and playing only his 13th game in the 
Penguins' 68th, Lemieux scored two goals and had two assists in a 6-2 victory 
over the Rangers in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a little bit better, but I'm not 100% yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being outshot, 17-0, in the first 10 minutes, Pittsburgh scored five 
goals on 10 shots to take charge against the team that leads the NHL in points 
with 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Philadelphia 4 -- Vincent Damphousse flipped the puck over the 
back of the net and it hit the Flyers' Dave Tippett and rolled in for a goal 
with 1:16 left in the third quarter to give the Canadiens a tie at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 2, Boston 1 -- Goaltender Chris Terreri stretched his unbeaten 
streak to nine games and ended John Casey's at 14 by stopping 33 shots as the 
Devils beat the Bruins at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory extended the Devils' unbeaten streak to eight games (6-0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 2, Dallas 2 -- Mike Modano reached the 40-goal mark for the first 
time in his career, scoring with 9:42 to play as the Stars tied at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 Modano offset a two-goal performance by the Whalers' Geoff Sanderson, who 
raised his team-leading total to 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 2, San Jose 0 -- Mike Vernon made 16 saves and German Titov and Gary 
Roberts each scored a goal as the Flames won at home with only 20 shots to 
increase their Pacific Division lead over Vancouver to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 4, Washington 3 -- Mats Sundin's power-play goal midway through the 
third period broke a tie and gave the Nordiques a victory that deprived Capital 
goalie Don Beaupre of his 250th victory in his fifth try at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 3, Winnipeg 1 -- Dave Andreychuk set a Maple Leaf record for a left 
wing with his 49th goal at Toronto, and they beat the Jets for their third 
victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, St. Louis 5 -- Steve Thomas scored his second goal of 
the game with 3:07 to play to give the Islanders a tie at St. Louis, where 
newly acquired Peter Stastny and Petr Nedved each scored their first goals for 
the Blues.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; PETCHEY DEFEATED BY AGASSI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, still trying to rebound from a dismal year that included wrist 
surgery and a breakup with his coach, defeated Britain's Mark Petchey, 6-2, 
4-6, 6-4, in his opening match at the Lipton Championships on Saturday at Key 
Biscayne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a nightmare year for me," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He skipped the Australian Open in January while recuperating from surgery, won 
at Scottsdale, Ariz., last month and then was eliminated in the second round at 
Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 "My game is coming along at an incredible pace right now," Agassi said. "I 
feel great about where I am. There's no question in my mind that I'm going to 
get better and better every match I play." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Stefan Edberg, No. 3 Sergi Brugera, No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic and No. 6 
Michael Chang also won their opening matches. 
</P>
<P>
 MaliVai Washington, a finalist last year, was eliminated by Jared Palmer, 6-3, 
7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing in women's play were top-seeded Steffi Graf, No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez 
Vicario and No. 3 Gabriela Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez withdrew before her match because of illness. 
No. 11 Helena Sukova lost, 6-3, 6-4, to Radka Zrubakova of Slovakia, ranked 
142nd in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi will next play Boris Becker, a 3-6, 6-4, 6-0 winner over Nicklas Kulti 
of Sweden. Becker is coached by Nick Bollettieri, who ended a longtime 
relationship with Agassi last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be weird seeing Nick in another box. In some ways, it'll feel good," 
said Agassi, ranked 31st in the world. "I lost a lot of respect for him, and 
it's going to take time for me to get over that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lars Rehmann of Germany and Sweden's Magnus Larsson advanced to the final of 
the Zaragoza Open in Spain. Larsson, seeded fourth, defeated countryman Anders 
Jarryd, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, and the unseeded Rehmann, ranked No. 310 in the world, 
defeated Tomas Nydahl of Sweden, 7-5, 6-4.

<P>
 Brandel Chamblee patiently played his way through a gusty 30-m.p.h. wind and 
established a two-stroke lead against more experienced contenders Saturday in 
the third round of the Honda Classic at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamblee, who shared the lead through the first two rounds, shot a 
one-over-par 72 as he sought his first victory in an erratic, five-season 
career on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 His 54-hole total was six-under 207 going into today's final round. Davis Love 
III shot a 70 and was second at 209. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lietzke, who had a 74, was tied for third at 210 with two-time U.S. Open 
winner Curtis Strange, Nick Price and Australia's Craig Parry, who played about 
an hour in front of the other contenders and got his 69 before the winds 
reached full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 John Daly, coming off a four-month suspension, was at 212 after a 73. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus extended his lead to three strokes in the Vantage at The Dominion 
PGA Seniors in San Antonio, shooting a five-under-par 67 in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Albus, who tied for 18th in the tournament last year, was at 135. He led by 
one stroke Friday after a 68. 
</P>
<P>
 George Archer and Gibby Gilbert were at 138. Gilbert had eight birdies, tying 
Albus and Australian Graham Marsh for the round's best score of 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay Brewer won his second consecutive title in the Vantage Classics, played by 
golfers over 60. He parred the extra hole to win a playoff with Orville Moody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Andrews was having a bad round at Ping-Welch's Championship in Tucson 
until she rescued her lead with an eagle on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews had three consecutive bogeys at the midpoint, but her eagle three on 
the 458-yard 18th hole -- her third eagle in as many rounds -- helped her to a 
three-under-par 69 and a three-shot lead over Brandie Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews is at 13-under 203. 
</P>
<P>
 First-day leader Michelle Estill shot her way back into contention with a 68, 
landing in third at 207.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; GAUCHOS' CRINE HANGS IN, BEATS CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback's Dennis Crine allowed seven hits and pitched around six errors as 
the host Gauchos beat Cypress, 4-2, in an Orange Empire Conference baseball 
game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first complete game of the season for Crine (3-2), a sophomore 
right-hander. Cypress (16-5, 4-2) scored single runs in the second and third, 
but Crine was in control after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Crine retired 15 of the final 17. He would have got the last nine in a row 
except for a one-out error in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted this one badly," Saddleback Coach Jack Hodges said. "He just got a 
little bit stronger in the middle innings." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Wilkes had an RBI double and Sam Voita an RBI single as the Gauchos 
(9-5-1, 4-2) scored twice in the fifth to take a 3-2 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Voita had doubled and scored on single by Wes Brasher to start the fourth for 
Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 David Trentine had an RBI single in the second, and Jason Hodges had a 
sacrifice fly in the third for Cypress' runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 13, Rancho Santiago 10 -- Rancho Santiago's Brandon Hoalton suffered 
his first collegiate loss after winning 17 in a row. Fullerton (9-8-1, 3-3) 
built a 10-0 lead after four innings behind Chad Smith's three-run home run. 
Steve Escobar had a double, triple and three RBIs, and Erickson Dumaual went 
four for four and scored three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 7, Golden West 2 -- Dustin Martin had two hits, including a triple, 
for Golden West (7-10, 1-5). Teammate Rob Prince had two hits and an RBI. 
Riverside (16-2, 6-0) remained unbeaten in the conference, and pitcher Jeff 
Barker improved to 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Golden West softball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 12, Golden West 11 -- Renee Taylor scored the game-winning run 
in the sixth inning with a shot down the left field line for Rancho Santiago 
(10-8). Taylor finished three for four with two doubles, two runs scored and 
four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Boston was four for four with a run-scored and an RBI for Golden West 
(3-10), which was eliminated from the tournament with the loss. Play continues 
today. STEVE KRESAL

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; ONE OF FOUR CUBS' SHORTSTOPS, DUNSTON SAYS HE'S THE 
ONLY ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The depth chart on Manager Tom Trebelhorn's office wall at the Chicago Cubs' 
spring stadium lists four shortstops. 
</P>
<P>
 Two, Jose Vizcaino and Rey Sanchez, have done most of the playing for the Cubs 
during the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 A third, Jose Hernandez, is an insurance policy late of the Texas and 
Cleveland organizations, still young enough at 24 to generate interest among 
scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth name is that of Shawon Dunston, who had a herniated disc removed 
from his back on May 13, 1992, and hasn't played regularly since the previous 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, he may be ready to become more than a name on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't four shortstops," Dunston said the other day. "I'm the only one. 
I know I can play. I know I can be the best again." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Cubs are hoping, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a phenomenal talent," Trebelhorn said. "If he's healthy, 
he'll be the opening-day shortstop, and right now he's ahead of the timetable I 
had for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy where he is, but knowledgeable it can change quickly. He 
seems to have total freedom, but how will it respond when we get back to the 
cold in April?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston played 18 games before the surgery in 1992 and seven games last 
September. It has taken two years for him to feel he is prepared to play at his 
previous level.  
</P>
<P>
 He knew, he said, that when Darryl Strawberry tried to come back from a 
similar operation after only a half year of therapy last year it wouldn't work. 
And, indeed, Strawberry gave up after 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a learning experience," Dunston said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I do want to play, but I'm prepared to walk away. I won't make a fool of 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd miss the game, but my role as a parent is worth more than the money and 
more than the game. 
</P>
<P>
 'I believe I'm a better person now and can be a better player because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston suspects he injured his back lifting daughter Whitnie from a car seat. 
He was playing in pain even in 1991, he said, but neither the back nor the game 
will get in the way of his responsibilities as a father. 
</P>
<P>
 At his home in Fremont, Calif., during the winter, Dunston said he would get 
up at 4 a.m. to do three hours of therapy -- swimming, stretching and weights 
-- so that he could be done in time to drive Whitnie and daughter Jasmine to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended PTA meetings and romped with 18-month-old Shawon Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough," Dunston said of the long recovery. "Some days you feel you 
can do anything in the world, the next day nothing. If I have my health, they 
can take the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston signed a four-year, $12-million contract before the '92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to sleep, knowing if I have to retire I'll be able to take care of 
my family, but the Cubs have been great to me and I want to come back and repay 
them, show my appreciation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston, 31, and the Cubs believe he is through the worst. He homered in his 
first exhibition at-bat, beat out a pair of infield grounders the other day and 
has been playing consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 His potential return obviously strengthens the Cubs' depth and bargaining 
position. Both Vizcaino, a former Dodger who batted .287 in 151 games last 
year, and Sanchez would become valuable commodities.  
</P>
<P>
 Of Vizcaino, a switch-hitter who can play three infield positions and the 
outfield, Trebelhorn said, "He may be the best in baseball for what he brings 
to a club. His versatility becomes a terrific asset (f Dunston is playing 
regularly) I can't make the world perfect for everybody, but my job will be to 
see that they all stay ready." 
</P>
<P>
 He nodded at the chart on the wall and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a former teacher in the Portland school system, Trebelhorn was asked what 
lessons he had learned managing the Milwaukee Brewers for six seasons. He was 
25 games over .500 in that stint but his authority often was tested by players 
who thought he was too soft and had two sets of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't keep everybody happy, you can't do it all yourself and I have to 
make sure everybody understands what I'm doing," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tendency for my mind to get ahead of my mouth, so I have to slow it 
down a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 In the long-suffering world of the Cubs, Trebelhorn succeeded Jim Lefebvre, 
despite pleas by Ryne Sandberg, Mark Grace and others to retain Lefebvre for 
the sake of continuity.  
</P>
<P>
 Every Cub manager inherits hefty historical baggage, but Trebelhorn, the 44th 
manager, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with the 43 who preceded me or the decades that preceded 
me. We've changed coaches, personnel, uniforms and divisions. It's part of the 
business, but I think we're comfortable and I think we're together on what 
we're trying to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to rebuild the mind set here. We have a good club. I want it to go 
out expecting to win. I don't want it hoping to win, but expecting to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy to say, harder to do. Still, the Cubs finished over .500 for only the 
third time since 1972 last season, despite the loss of free agents Greg Maddux 
and Andre Dawson, an injury that sidelined Sandberg for two months, the 
inability of former Dodger Mike Morgan (10-15) to fill Maddux's No. 1 berth in 
the rotation, an outfield that didn't need the Wrigley Field wind to have 
trouble catching balls and soap opera bickering between Lefebvre and General 
Manager Larry Himes. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Save Lefebvre" push by Grace and Sandberg might have contributed to 20 
wins in the last 28 games, but it didn't save Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
 Trebelhorn must fight the perception that he helped undermine Lefebvre during 
two years as a Cub coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't grow in stature over the winter when he provided fodder for Chicago 
columnists and comedians with his response to a question on the psychological 
test Himes required of managerial candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The question: "If you were a tree, what kind of a tree would you be?" 
Trebelhorn's answer: "A Cubs tree." 
</P>
<P>
 An oak or redwood, something perceived as hearty and strong, might have been 
the more suitable response, not a tree that wilts every summer. Nevertheless, 
Trebelhorn got the nod over Tony Muser, now on his coaching staff and viewed as 
a powerhouse successor if Trebelhorn and the Cubs stumble out of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, trying to build that expectation of winning, Trebelhorn said 
the following is essential for the Cubs to contend in the National League's 
Central division: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The blossoming of career minor leaguer Karl Rhodes as a major league center 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The bona fide arrival of Yorba Linda's Steve Trachsel as the No. 4 starter 
and a successful search for the No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The physical soundness of an infield that could be baseball's best: Grace, 
Sandberg, Dunston, Steve Buechele and Rick Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former commissioner Fay Vincent displayed the extent of his bitterness at 
being forced from office in his 40-page book proposal that reduces Vincent to 
name calling and sheds the stately and literate image he and the late Bart 
Giamatti espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 In his attack on the owners, Vincent described Peter O'Malley of the Dodgers 
as a "nitwit and bigot" and said that Jackie Autry of the Angels was 
"mean-spirited and not bright." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley refused comment. Autry would only say she was disappointed. So were 
many who thought Vincent got a bad deal but expected him to keep it on a higher 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The decision by Senate majority leader George Mitchell (D-Maine) not to 
seek reelection moves him to the forefront of commissioner candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is everything, and Mitchell would not be available until the fall, when 
the owners will have a better grasp on the status of labor talks and could be 
ready to appoint a commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While shredding the Major League Scouting Bureau in a cost-cutting move and 
reducing the umpire developmental fund by $1 million, owners have also rewarded 
interim commissioner Bud Selig with a $1 million salary-bonus, showing they 
have their priorities in order as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hallelulah! The Michael Jordan circus is thought to be heading into its 
final week. A decision by the Chicago White Sox is expected no later than 
Sunday. The Jordan experiment spits on all those scouts who spend hours 
tracking college and high school players with far more baseball talent than 
Jordan but never even get the rookie league chance Jordan is receiving at the 
major league level. Jordan got his chance simply because he was outstanding in 
another sport and Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who also owns the Bulls, wanted to 
show his gratitude. Back to basics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The glow of spring doesn't hide the fact that Angel Manager Buck Rodgers 
faces a complex task in keeping both Bo Jackson and Chili Davis happy and in 
the lineup. The Angels would like to move Davis for pitching help, but almost 
every American League club has its designated hitter. In the meantime, as the 
bombardment continues against a series of rotation candidates, the Angels hope 
to accelerate the progress of southpaw Brian Anderson, their No. 1 draft choice 
of last June, with the possibility he could open the season as the No. 4 or 5 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The theory was that Asians were too small and too frail to do more than 
pitch with finesse, not strong enough to pitch in the majors with consistent 
success. So much for stereotypes. The Dodgers' Chan Ho Park of Korea and the 
Seattle Mariners' teen-ager, Makoto Suzuki of Japan, are lighting up spring 
speed guns and may be the two hardest throwers in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Their promise is certain to accelerate global scouting -- already reaching 
into Europe, Australia, South America and the Caribbean -- as a means of 
replenishing the talent pool. Have a Havana? Scouts can't wait for that door to 
open.

<P>
 San Diego Lincoln Prep led for most of the game and withstood a late rally to 
defeat Verbum Dei, 94-93, and win the Southern Regional Division IV boys' 
basketball championship Saturday night at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Johnson made the second of two free throws with 15 seconds to play, 
breaking a 93-93 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei opted not to use its one remaining timeout and tried to run a fast 
break, but Andre Larry's shot was blocked by Mark Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Prep's Deshawn Degrate grabbed the ball and threw it to the other end 
of the court as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford had a game-high 32 points and 19 rebounds for Lincoln Prep (24-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Miller led Verbum Dei (26-3) with 29 points and 11 rebounds. Teammate 
Jamal Cobbs scored 24 points. DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Pacifica 60, University of San Diego High 55 -- Pacifica (30-1) 
rallied from an 11-point halftime deficit and Chris Vlasic made both ends of 
four consecutive one-and-ones in the final 1:08 at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic, Jon Surface, and Erik Maurer each scored 15 points for Pacifica, which 
forced nine turnovers in the third quarter and took a 44-42 lead into the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica made only one shot in the fourth quarter, but made all 14 of its free

 After Clint Cummings, who scored 16 points for USDHS, made one of two free

their next three shots and didn't score again until Josh Merrill made a 30-foot 
shot at the buzzer.

 Merrill, a 6-foot-9 forward who has signed with Pepperdine, scored 10 of his 
17 points in the first quarter as the Dons took a 14-6 lead.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / DIVISION II SOUTHERN REGIONAL; BRUIN-TO-BE HENDERSON LEADS 
EAST BAKERSFIELD

<P>
 The defense changed. The momentum changed. The lead changed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one constant was J.R. Henderson, who led East Bakersfield to its first 
Southern Regional Division II Championship with an 80-65 victory over 
top-seeded Inglewood on Saturday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Blades (28-4) advance to the Division II State final Friday 
night at the Oakland Coliseum Arena against Roseville Oakmont (31-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, a 6-foot-9 senior who has signed with UCLA, scored a game-high 32 
points on 11-of-18 shooting and also had 13 rebounds and four blocked shots. 
His quickness and strength inside were too much for Inglewood, which double- 
and triple-teamed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to push him out," said Inglewood Coach Patrick Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 But even outside, Henderson frustrated the Sentinels by making two of three 
three-point shots. He also made all eight of his free throws, including six in 
the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to score, get some respect, and then get the ball to my 
teammates," Henderson said. "If they hit them, we win." 
</P>
<P>
 Five Blades scored in double figures, including Chris Clayton, who scored 17 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the first half, not even Henderson could control the hot shooting and 
speedy pace of the Sentinels, who led at halftime, 38-31, after leading by as 
many as 11 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood senior point guard Sam Turks scored 14 of his team-high 23 points in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But beginning the third quarter, the Blades switched from a man-to-man defense 
to a 1-2-2 zone that stymied the Sentinels. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I tried to penetrate, they'd have a lot of help and it forced me to pass," 
Turks said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Turks' dunk gave the Sentinels a 47-43 lead with 2:45 left in the third 
quarter, Inglewood went six minutes without a basket. Finally, Turks made a 
jumper with 4:45 to play, but East Bakersfield had gone on a 17-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood pulled to within 69-62 with 1:53 to play, but got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key was to get back on their fast break," said Blade Coach Joe Dominguez. 
"We stopped their transition and we controlled their tempo." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense also managed to slow Inglewood junior Paul Pierce, who scored only 
five of his 21 points in the last 11 minutes.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / DIVISION I REGIONAL; LYNWOOD GETS SHOT AT REPEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<P>
 Lynwood High's Timicha Kirby scored 17 of her game-high 29 points in the 
second half as the second-ranked Knights blew past Fresno Clovis West, 62-51, 
to advance to the Division I State final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Regional final was close until late in the third quarter. But 
then, defending Division I State champion Lynwood (32-1), pulled away to win 
for the 61st time in 62 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always compare it to a boxing match," Lynwood Coach Ellis Barfield said. 
"Two opponents feel each other out. Then once you know what you have, you go to 
your strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood's strength: Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11 senior forward scored 10 points in the final 1:40 of the third 
quarter to give Lynwood a 40-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby hit two three-pointers during the stretch, including a 35-footer at the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as our team is concerned, we move the ball around so much on offense," 
Barfield said, "and I don't think people give Timicha enough credit for being 
able to find her shot. She really attacks the basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby created her own openings, making running jump shots, NBA-range 
three-pointers, and rebound layups. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kirby: "In the second half, I knew I had to step up and take the open 
shots. I had kind of taken myself out of the game in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby and the Knights were taken out of their normal pressure defense in the 
first half, when they were whistled for 16 fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we were handcuffed in the first half," Barfield said. "We had to back 
off a little." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynwood wasn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never a time when we feel like we're in a hole and we're going to 
lose," forward Tawana Grimes said. "We just say, 'Come on, guys, let's play 
defense.' We have so much confidence in each other." 
</P>
<P>
 With good reason. Lynwood forced nine turnovers by Clovis West (27-2) in the 
second half, compared to only three in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Eagle forward Paige Bevie scored a team-high 17 points. Adrian Williams 
added 12 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lynwood, Kirby had nine rebounds and made 11 of 23 shots. Knight forward 
Monique Matthews added 10 points and Grimes had eight points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood will play Atherton Sacred Heart in Saturday's championship at the 
Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kirby of the Knights' return to Oakland: "It feels spectacular."

 Irvine Woodbridge High took a giant step toward a Division II State 
championship by defeating previously unbeaten Mission Hills Alemany, 46-41, at 
Anaheim Arena on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (32-0) scored the last seven points of the State Southern 
Regional final, holding the Indians (30-1) scoreless over the final 2 minutes 
40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge will face Sacramento El Camino in the State championship game next 
Friday in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Oenning made a jump shot with 1:25 remaining to give Woodbridge a 44-41 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go to your best shooter down the stretch," Coach Eric Bangs said. "That 
was the clutch shot. That was big." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge center Angela Burgess scored a game-high 12 points and had seven 
offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany was led by center Carly Funicello's 12 points and eight rebounds. 
DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 67, Newport Harbor 39 -- The nation's second-ranked team had no 
problem advancing to the State Division III championship. 
</P>

 The 28-point margin was the closest game the Ladycats had in seven playoff 
victories. They have won 53 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea (32-0) won the Southern Section III-AA title a week earlier with a 70-40 
victory over Newport Harbor (24-8) and did nothing different this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Erickson scored 14 points and had 14 assists for the Ladycats. 
</P>

and also grabbed 12 rebounds to lead St. Bernard to its second consecutive 
Division IV Southern Regional victory before 1,347 at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard got in early foul trouble and Santa Ynez (26-6) took a 21-18 
halftime lead, sparked by 10 points by Sherry Bjorklund. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott scored 14 points in the third quarter, when St. Bernard (27-4) 
outscored Santa Ynez, 20-14, to take a 38-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Marte Alexander scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter to open up 
a 10-point lead for St. Bernard. DIVISION V 
</P>
<P>
 El Cajon Christian 53, La Jolla The Bishop's 48 -- Alisha Nater, a 6-foot-2 
junior forward, scored 17 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Theresa Kain added 
16 points to lead Christian (28-4) to its second consecutive Southern Regional 
title.

PADILLA STOPS FOE IN FOURTH ROUND; BOXING: JUNIOR-WELTERWEIGHT IMPROVES TO 
20-1-1 WITH 13TH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For five years, between boxing careers, Zack Padilla toiled in the real world. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He operated a shovel. He worked on loading docks. He pushed paint brushes. He 
nailed roofs together. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, before 2,347 at the Olympic Auditorium, Padilla relied on past 
work experience to defeat Dwayne Swift in a junior-welterweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla (20-1-1), scored a technical knockout over Swift (41-16) in the fourth 
round, shortly after Padilla knocked him down with a left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Padilla's 13th consecutive victory since ending his five-year 
retirement in 1991. Next for Padilla is an April match in the Netherlands 
against an opponent to be determined. And after that, there might be an August 
match against World Boxing Council welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker.  
</P>
<P>
 Padilla said afterward that Swift eventually fell to an old sucker play.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was going hard to his body, trying to get him to lower his bands to block 
me, then I was going to go up to his chin," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happened . . . but I really hurt him with a right hand to the 
stomach just before I took him out." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first fight of the year for Padilla, 30, who fought five times in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to fight a lot more often," he said. "When I sit around and get bored, 
I eat too much. I get out of shape. I'm still trying to get over Christmas and 
New Year's -- people handing me food all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to some Saturday that Padilla didn't have the snap on his punches he 
normally does, and he acknowledged that he's been in better shape. 
</P>
<P>
 He started off in uncharacteristic fashion, jabbing and boxing Swift for maybe 
half of the first round. But after he stung Swift with a straight right hand 
and a left hook, Swift backed up.  
</P>
<P>
 Swift rocked Padilla with 15 seconds to go in the first with a right, but 
Padilla was never in serious difficulty.  
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second, Swift was holding on. But when he fought back, Padilla 
suddenly had crispness and snap to his punches. 
</P>
<P>
 By the third, Swift was lying on the ropes, covering up. Padilla was landing 
short, close-range right uppercuts at will.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Swift: "He threw a lot of punches and he wore me out. I had no trouble 
hitting him, but I didn't expect him to throw that many punches."

SAILING; MAHANEY KEEPS LAW IN CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's Cup aspirant Kevin Mahaney of Bangor, Me., brought Britain's Chris 
Law back to the pack with a one-second victory in the 30th Congressional Cup at 
Long Beach Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Law has a 12-3 record going into his last three races today against San 
Diego's Peter Isler (11-4), defending champion Rod Davis (10-5) and Roy Heiner 
of the Netherlands (8-7).He would have had the title all but locked up if 
Mahaney (10-5) hadn't nipped him by a foot or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Law, sailing aggressively despite a two-race lead in the event, drew five 
penalties in losing two of his three races Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Against Mahaney, he survived sailing's version of three knockdowns -- 
270-degree penalty turns for fouling Mahaney -- to lead by a boat length with 
100 yards to go. Then Mahaney jibed away toward the left end of the finish 
line, accelerated on a puff of wind and got his bow in front at the gun.  
</P>
<P>
 At the first leeward mark, Law's spinnaker brushed Mahaney's rigging -- foul 
No. 1. Then, in doing his penalty turn, he forced Mahaney to alter course -- 
foul No. 2 -- and, finally, halfway up the next beat, he inched back in front 
but drew foul No. 3 for tacking too closely on top on Mahaney. RICH ROBERTS

DONALD DEALS WILLIAMS A BLOW; BOXING: FORMER OLYMPIAN WINS MAJORITY DECISION 
OVER LONG BEACH FIGHTER IN MEETING OF UNBEATEN HEAVYWEIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Donald took a nimble leap up the ladder Saturday, and Jeremy Williams 
slid back down. 
</P>
<P>
 In a showdown of undefeated heavyweights who had far more at stake than 
Williams' World Boxing Council Continental Americas belt, Donald won a majority 
decision over Long Beach's Williams before an estimated 3,500 at the MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 The taller, heavier (227-210), cagier Donald pummeled Williams from the 
outside with left-right combinations and prevented Williams from charging 
inside with a long left jab. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald, a 1992 U.S. Olympian, improved to 13-0. And, more important than any 
minor belt, the 27-year-old Donald moved himself into position to vie for a 
more significant title -- possibly against World Boxing Organization 
title-holder Michael Bentt, who will fight Henry Hide this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for bigger and better things after this," said Donald, who won 
easily on two of the judges' cards. One judge, Carol Castellano, called it a 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss for Williams, meanwhile, dashes his immediate hopes of jumping into 
the division's elite. ABC, which made him the feature of its first boxing 
broadcast since last June, had tentative plans to show Williams in a series of 
fights building toward a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do some examination to deal with what's best to rectify what 
happened," said Bill Cayton, Williams' manager. "Obviously, all the plans we 
had have been changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 21, started quickly, pressuring Donald hard in the first round, but 
Donald assumed control 20 seconds into the second with a sharp right hand to 
Williams' chin that rocked him backward. Donald never was in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 With the hard-hitting Williams reduced to awkward tactics that rarely produced 
any damage, Donald piled up points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11th, Williams, who has a history of reeling when hit squarely on the 
chin, was staggered by a left-right combination that ended any chance of a late 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 12th, Donald was doing his Ali shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fought a skilled fight," Williams said. "The guy's taller, you've got to 
go inside, but his jab was better than mine today. He wouldn't let me inside -- 
which was very smart to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (15-1) acknowledged that Donald controlled him, but said that he will 
not disappear from the heavyweight scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "By no means does it mean I'm out of the picture," he said. "I just have to 
take a step back. I still have a long career ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 On the undercard, heavyweight Shannon Briggs went to 17-0 with a technical 
knockout of Jimmy Ellis (20-5-1) at 35 seconds of the first round. Also, 
Alexander Zolkin (17-2) won a unanimous heavyweight decision over Frankie 
Swindell (28-12-1).

DEFENSE HELPS PACIFICA COME BACK AGAIN; DIVISION III: VICTORY OVER UNIVERSITY 
OF SAN DIEGO HIGH, 60-55, PUTS MARINERS IN STATE FINAL FOR FIRST TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After sleepwalking through the first half Saturday, Pacifica's pressure 
defense woke up with a vengeance, helping the Mariners to a 60-55 victory over 
University of San Diego High in the Southern California Regional Division III 
boys' basketball final at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by 11 points at halftime, the Mariners' defense forced nine 
third-quarter turnovers, and Chris Vlasic made eight free throws in the final 1 
minute 8 seconds to lead Pacifica to the come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica rallied from a 20-point deficit Thursday to defeat San Diego St. 
Augustine in the semifinals. Saturday, Vlasic, Jon Surface and Erik Maurer each 
scored 15 points, and Ramon Alliman had 13 to lead the Mariners (30-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica advanced to the school's first State final next Saturday at the 
Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every coach, every player, has a dream to get to Oakland," Pacifica Coach Bob 
Becker said. "We're living our dreams now." 
</P>
<P>
 But the game started as a nightmare for Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer was playing on a sprained ankle and Vlasic, the team's leading scorer, 
had the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 And the entire team looked sick early, committing 13 first-half turnovers as 
USDHS sliced through Pacifica's press. The Dons had 10 layups in the first half 
and pounded the offensive boards to outrebound Pacifica, 41-20, for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Merrill, a 6-foot-9 forward who has signed with Pepperdine, finished with 
17 points and six rebounds, and Clint Cummings, who had 16 points and eight 
rebounds, helped the Dons handle Pacifica's pressure flawlessly . . . for a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica opened the second half with one of their trademark blitzes, and 
Vlasic's three-pointer from the left wing with 5 1/2 minutes remaining in the 
third quarter capped an 8-0 run to cut the Dons' lead to 35-32. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't take care of the ball in the second half," USDHS Coach Jim Tomey 
said. "Pacifica relentlessly stuck with their defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Alliman made one of the game's biggest plays with 2:54 remaining in the 
third quarter. He took possession of the ball in the post, spun to his left and 
scored while drawing Merrill's fourth foul. Alliman's free throw tied the 
score, 39-39, and sent Merrill to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica's perimeter defense continued to hound the Dons, forcing turnovers on 
the next three possessions. When USDHS went inside, Pacifica center Shane 
Miller, who had six blocked shots, was usually there to greet the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller couldn't stop Merrill, who returned midway through the fourth 
quarter and gave USDHS its last lead, 51-50, scoring on a layup with 2:54 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliman answered with a basket on a drive with 2:12 left to play, and Cummings 
made one of two free throws for USDHS to tie it, 52-52 with 2:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Vlasic made his clutch free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 After Merrill missed a dunk with 1:30 remaining, Vlasic was fouled in the 
post, then made both ends of a one-and-one with 1:08 to play. He made both ends 
of three one-and-ones in the final 29.5 seconds to push the lead to 60-52. 
</P>
<P>
 "USDHS is a great team," Becker said. "They won 28 games, and they really put 
pressure on you. If you don't have a point guard, you're dead. It's over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, we have Dean Vergara, who's as good as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 And right now, the Mariners are playing their best.

VENTURA STOPPED 2ND STRAIGHT YEAR; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NO. 1-RANKED PIRATES 
FOILED AGAIN, THIS TIME BY LONG BEACH CITY, 63-61, IN STATE CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was no hiding the monumental disappointment on the faces of the Ventura 
College basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
 This time they were not going to even try, not like they did last year. This 
one was the Big Hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive time, the Pirates were stunned in the title game of 
the state championships, this one in a 63-61 loss to Long Beach City before 
3,800 at the UC Irvine Bren Events Center on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Sharif Metoyer sank a layup on a dribble drive with 1 minute 44 seconds 
remaining to give Long Beach (32-6) the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura did not score thereafter and Steve Amar missed two free throws with 
five seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like (Buffalo Bills) Coach Marv Levy," Ventura Coach Philip Mathews 
said. "We'll keep trying. We'll be back next year." 
</P>
<P>
 How long the Pirates (36-3), who were ranked No. 1 in the state throughout the 
season, can continue to deal with the heartache of reaching the final, only to 
go home with second-place medals, remains to be seen. The loss was particularly 
hard for the eight sophomores on the squad, including forward Brandon Jessie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years in a row," Jessie said. "We worked so hard to get here. To lose it, 
it kills us. . . . I'll probably break down when I get home tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, who was named to the all-tournament team with teammate Michael Tate, 
finished with a game-high 24 points. He had an opportunity to put the Pirates 
ahead after Metoyer's basket, but missed a long three-point attempt with 21 
seconds left on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling to catch up with the Vikings all night, Ventura finally 
managed to move ahead, 57-53, with 5:54 to go on a basket by Amar. But Long 
Beach rallied and Jessie tied the score, 61-61, with a left-handed layup at the 
2:05 mark before Metoyer struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I faked it (the play) to the left, then I drove into my man and he bumped 
into his own man, and I had clear sailing to the basket," Metoyer said of the 
winning basket.  
</P>
<P>
 They were his only two points of the second half in a four-point outing.

WINDMILLER THROWS NO-HITTER, IVIE DRIVES IN 7 AS CSUN SWEEPS MISSOURI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They had survived the earthquake and escaped the despair one block west of 
their campus that much of the world had viewed on television. But the Cal State 
Northridge softball team is surrounded by a crippled campus and grim reminders. 
</P>
<P>
 Portable classrooms now span the length of Matador Diamond's outfield, sitting 
glumly several feet beyond the fence. Several yards to the south is a 
once-grand concrete parking structure, folded and sagging like wet clay. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN softball players have embraced this adversity. Playing at home on 
Saturday for the first time this season, the Matadors draped a sign on the 
fence in center field: "Welcome to the Epicenter." 
</P>
<P>
 A little bit of humor. And then a little bit of fun. Northridge, ranked sixth 
in the country in the NCAA coaches' poll, routed No. 20 Missouri, 8-1 and 12-0, 
in a nonconference doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Ivie, celebrating the biggest day of her career, keyed the opening-game 
victory with a grand slam that ricocheted off one of the temporary bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I told them not to put them there," a smiling Ivie said. "They don't 
know what kind of hitters we have on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Windmiller pitched the second no-hitter of her career in the second game 
and struck out 13 -- a career high for seven innings. Seven weeks earlier, 
Windmiller and Northridge third baseman Shannon Jones were fleeing their 
first-story home at the Northridge Meadows Apartments one block from the 
campus. Sixteen of their neighbors died after the earthquake caused the first 
story to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win," said Windmiller (6-1), refusing to admit that the no-hitter 
meant anything more. "It was exciting to play at home. I love playing at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently. Windmiller, a senior who had a perfect game against South Carolina 
exactly one year earlier, threw 87 pitches, 67 of them strikes. Windmiller 
walked one and another batter reached on an error. She was ahead in the count 
to 19 of the 23 batters she faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (14-2) scored six runs in the fifth after Jen Fleming and Beth 
Calcante opened with back-to-back doubles off the fence, and Windmiller cruised 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, senior first-baseman Ivie was four for four, scored three 
times and drove in a career-high five runs in support of Kathy Blake (5-1), who 
gave up an unearned run and preserved an earned-run average of 0.00. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri (7-4) never retired Ivie. She reached base seven consecutive times, 
had five hits and seven RBIs in the two games. CSUN led, 4-0, when Ivie lined 
Kacey Marshall's first pitch over the left-field fence in the sixth inning. It 
was gone before Ivie could get out of the batter's box, making a booming sound 
when it hit the portable classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 It was music to the ears of the Matadors.

PEP TALK HELPS WOODBRIDGE HANG TOUGH, BEAT ALEMANY; DIVISION II: COACH BANGS 
INSPIRES BURGESS AND HER TEAMMATES TO COME BACK FOR 46-41 VICTORY AND TRIP TO 
STATE TITLE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Time was short, so Eric Bangs spoke quickly -- but with purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangs, the Woodbridge High girls' basketball coach, knelt in front of junior 
center Angela Burgess during the third quarter and encouraged her to stay 
inspired despite the Warriors' poor play during the Southern California 
Regional Division II final. Things were not going smoothly for the Warriors, 
and Bangs knew how much worse the situation would become if Burgess let down. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Woodbridge, Bangs' impromptu pep talk was the charge Burgess 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Burgess' strong, consistent play near the basket, top-seeded Woodbridge 
defeated No. 2-seeded Mission Hills Alemany, 46-41, Saturday at Anaheim Arena 
to claim the regional division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Undefeated Woodbridge (32-0), which also won the Southern Section Division 
II-AA title, will play Northern California Regional Division II champion 
Sacramento El Camino (35-0) for the State title at 6:15 p.m. Friday night at 
Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful 6-foot-4 Burgess is a big reason Woodbridge, playing in the State 
tournament final for the first time, is making travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess made six of 11 shots and had a team-high 12 points, but she was at her 
best rebounding. Burgess grabbed eight missed shots -- including seven of her 
team's 18 offensive rebounds. Her presence helped the Warriors dominate the 
Indians, 36-22, in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat her down and talked to her because I saw her getting a little 
frustrated," Bangs said. "Her defense and rebounding were keys, so I needed her 
to stay focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to give her a little shot in the arm and tell her, 'Go for it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy: "(Burgess) controlling the boards was 
definitely a key factor. Both teams were missing shots, but the difference was 
she was grabbing theirs and putting them back in (the basket)." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Alemany looked like the team in control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (30-1), who won the Southern Section Division II-A championship, 
outscored the Warriors, 13-10, to lead, 35-32, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge had problems attempting shots during the quarter because of 
Alemany's fierce half-court, man-to-man defense. And when Woodbridge was able 
to shoot, Bangs was not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense was really struggling for a while -- especially in the third 
quarter," Bangs said. "We weren't shooting the way we normally do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shots just didn't look the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge shot only 40.8% for the game compared to 45.2% for Alemany, but 
Burgess would not let the game get away from Woodbridge in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 She scored six points during the quarter and had five rebounds and one blocked 
shot. What's more, after Bangs' talk, Burgess picked up her intensity on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I was successful," Burgess said. "Coach told me what I had to do and I 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bangs: "I think she could have easily stopped playing hard in the third 
quarter because of the problems we were having. But you have to give her a lot 
of credit because she kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors made their move with 2 minutes 58 seconds remaining, when 
sophomore forward Melanie Pearson (11 points, five rebounds) made a 
three-pointer to tie the score, 39-39. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore center Carly Funicello (12 points, eight rebounds) made a shot in 
the lane over Burgess with 2:42 left to give Alemany its final lead, 41-39. 
Moreover, the points were the last Alemany would score as Woodbridge got tough 
on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess made a shot over Funicello with 2:25 left to tie the score, 41-41. 
</P>
<P>
 After freshman guard Erin Stovall (nine points) made one of two free throws to 
give Woodbridge a 42-41 lead, senior guard Jamie Oenning (eight points, five 
assists, four steals) made a 15-foot jump shot on the baseline with 1:25 to 
play to put Woodbridge ahead, 44-41. Pearson sealed the victory and closed the 
game's scoring with two free throws with 17 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real easy to be united when you're undefeated, but it's real tough not 
to point fingers and blame people when things are going bad like they were in 
the third quarter," Bangs said. "But we stayed together and we got through it 
like we've been able to get through a lot of things -- together."

VARGAS, WHITAKER BOX TO U.S. AMATEUR TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two area boxers won title bouts in the U.S. Amateur Boxing championships 
Saturday in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Vargas of Oxnard won the 132-pound title by outpointing Terrence 
Cauthen of Philadelphia, 34-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Whitaker of Northridge was the winner in the over 201-pound division by 
outpointing Robert Geer of San Jose, 20-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, 16, making his first appearance at the championships, was the youngest 
fighter in the final round. "To win an open tournament in your first try, I 
feel so great," said Vargas, who backed up Cauthen with rights to the head and 
knocked him down in the second round. "I could have stayed in the juniors, but 
I wanted to be with the big boys so I can try to get to the 1996 Olympics."

PREP VOLLEYBALL ORANGE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS; EL TORO CAPS SERIES OF UPSETS WITH 
VICTORY OVER OILERS, TITLE

 El Toro made Huntington Beach the last in a series of upsets that marked the 
Division I Orange County Championships, sweeping the county's second-ranked 
team, 15-5, 15-6, in the final Saturday at Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Huntington Beach surprised No. 1 Dana Hills with a thrilling comeback 
in the semifinals to win, 13-15, 15-10, 16-14. After winning the first game, 
Dana Hills took an 8-7 lead in the second. But the Oilers went on a 7-2 scoring 
run and moved the match into the speed-scored third game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills held the lead most of the game, taking a 14-12 lead, but Huntington 
Beach eked out four points to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the first round of playoffs had unexpected endings. Laguna Beach, which 
handed El Toro its only loss of the season, fell to Esperanza. The Aztecs then 
lost to Newport Harbor in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro reached the final with a resounding 15-11, 15-10 victory over No. 5 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game of the championship, the Chargers scored five consecutive 
points to take a 6-1 lead, then went on scoring runs of four and five points to 
take the game. El Toro made one hitting error in each game; Huntington Beach 
made seven in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro served well, hit from all over the court and dug ball after ball. Its 
only weakness was an inconsistent block. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers could not muster an attack in the second game, scoring only seven 
kills to the Chargers' 14, while El Toro pounded away at Huntington Beach's 
defense. Ryan Mariano ended the match with a kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano, a swing-hitter who led both teams with 11 kills, was named to the 
all-tournament team, as was teammate Jeremy Beck. Setter Todd Steinert was 
named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named to the all-tournament team were Oilers Mike Grave and Jeremy Bart, 
Dana Hills' Neil Hewko and Mitch McCoy of Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro Coach Mike Jagd, who left the Chargers after the girls' 1991 season to 
coach in Colorado, said the amount of talent he has witnessed since his return 
is phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've coached in this area for 15 years, and I've never seen so many good 
boys' volleyball teams," Jagd said. "This place is just loaded. The South Coast 
League alone has three teams that could conceivably win the State championship: 
Dana Hills, San Clemente and us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like winning, but I really enjoy competing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship of Division II: 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel 2, Mater Dei 1 -- Phillip Schildts of Calvary Chapel was named 
the tournament MVP after leading Calvary Chapel to a 15-8, 12-15, 15-12 victory 
over Mater Dei at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles defeated Whittier Christian, 15-8, 15-0, in one semifinal and Mater 
Dei defeated Foothill, 15-12, 16-14, in the other.

<P>
 Bobby Sprain threw a two-hitter, and Pete Zamora homered for the third 
consecutive game as Capistrano Valley shut out Mater Dei, 2-0, for the 
championship of the Newport Elks baseball tournament Saturday at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprain (1-0) pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the first inning and 
dominated the rest of the way in a matchup of two clubs expected to contend for 
the South Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
 He limited the Monarchs (2-1-1) to one hit during the final six innings and 
retired 10 of the last 11 batters as Capistrano Valley (4-0), ranked fifth in 
Southern Section Division I, prevented Mater Dei from repeating as tournament 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win many ballgames if you just get two hits," Mater Dei Coach Bob 
Ickes said. "We just didn't swing the bats. We made 11 outs on popups." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei starter Matt Treanor (0-1) was effective early before giving up the 
game-winning homer to Zamora in the third. With two outs, after Treanor hit 
Gabe Payne with a pitch, Zamora hit a fastball out over the right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprain kept the Cougars in command from there. After a walk, a single and a 
hit batter in the first, Sprain allowed two baserunners in the final five 
innings, giving up a single in the fourth and a walk in the fifth. He struck 
out three and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 5, Tustin 4 -- Greg Smith drove in the winning run for Esperanza 
(3-1) in the bottom of the seventh with two outs to capture third place. Smith 
was two for three with two runs batted in. Jason Webb went three for four, with 
two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation championship game: 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar 6, Trabuco Hills 1 -- Kevin Stuart threw a four-hitter with six 
strikeouts and Jim Huston had three RBIs for Corona del Mar (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In first round of the Redlands Calvary Chapel tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands Calvary Chapel 4, Liberty Christian 3 -- Greg Rule struck out 10 and 
walked one for Liberty Christian (2-2), which loaded the bases in the top of 
the seventh but was unable to score. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game of the Duarte tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos 6, Duarte 9 -- Jose Castro (1-0) struck out seven in five 
scoreless innings and Brett Osterode drove in four runs on two doubles for 
Rancho Alamitos (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra 6-11, Valencia 1-9 -- Jeremy Payne picked up saves in both games and 
Ken Huff had five hits, including two doubles and five RBIs for La Habra (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Troy 10-2, Santa Margarita 3-1 -- Brad Downing had three hits, including a 
home run, and three RBIs in the first game and Rick Parmenter threw a 
one-hitter, striking out nine in the second for Troy. FORREST LEE

PREP TRACK ROUNDUP; FOOTHILL'S BAIN POLE VAULTS 14-6 AT BREA INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Foothill senior John Bain finally got the breakthrough he was looking for in 
the pole vault at the Brea-Olinda Invitational track and field meet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the periphery of being one of the county's finest vaulters all last season, 
Bain connected on a lifetime and season county-best 14 feet 6 inches to win the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally I'm getting to the point here I need to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bain, who narrowly missed three tries at 15-0, added: "I just want to get that 
15-footer out of the way now so I can go on toward 16 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bain was one of three Knights to win individual events, following in the 
footsteps of teammates Ethan Taub and Tony Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Taub, the defending county champion in the 400 meters, edged Cypress senior 
Jimmy Hutsell in the featured 400, 49.1 seconds to 49.3, breaking the meet 
record he set a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Taub also anchored the winning 800 relay but strained a hamstring while 
anchoring the 400 relay. The senior is expected to be sidelined two weeks and 
hinted that his sprint relay days are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, a Times Orange County first-team selection last season, won the 110 
high hurdles, in 14.8, off his county-leading 14.4 earlier in the week. He also 
brought home the Knight shuttle hurdle relay, which won in 1:02.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress sprinter Greg Cleave held off a late-charging Don Oliver of Foothill 
to win the 100; both were timed in 11.2. Cleave also ran legs on the winning 
400 (44.6) and sprint medley (1:37.4) relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Corona del Mar junior Tracy Clark ran away from the pack with one lap 
remaining to win the girls' 1,600 in 5:26.2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foothill junior Tara Oettinger ran 12.4 to win the girls' 100, then chased 
down Corona del Mar in the 800 relay to help the Knights win the event. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Amigos' Spring Trammell posted one of the county's farthest throws in 
the girls' discus, winning the event in 114-11.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Brea-Olinda senior Carl Daucher won the boys' 1,600 in 4:34.2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cypress junior Jeremy Becker won the boys' triple jump with a seasonal best 
of 44-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Irvine Invitational track and field meet: 
</P>
<P>
 Young, Caulkins star -- Gary Young of Woodbridge and Carrie Caulkins of 
Esperanza were named athletes of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Young won the 100 and 200 in wind-aided times of 10.8 and 21.8 seconds and ran 
on the winning 400 relay (44.5), which held off Saddleback (44.8). 
</P>
<P>
 The two schools also ran 1-2 in the 1,600 relay, with Woodbridge hanging on 
3:29.7 to 3:30.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Caulkins won the girls' 1,600 (5:17.8) and 3,200 (11:52) and also ran a leg on 
the winning 1,600 relay (4:09.5). Meisha Wilson-Duval of Woodbridge was another 
double individual winner in the 100 (12.5) and 200 (26.2) and also ran on the 
winning 400 relay (51.0). 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's Kristy Kierulff won the high jump at 5-9, an inch under her best.

 The Woodbridge boys' swimming team walked away with the Southern California 
Relays title Saturday night, and its 200 backstroke relay team broke a Southern 
Section record at Belmont Plaza Pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Just edging second-place Marina, Woodbridge secured the team victory in the 
last event, the 200 medley relay.The victory, in 1 minute 40.34 seconds, gave 
the Warriors a 222 points. Marina finished with 206, and defending champion El 
Toro was third with 182. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola led for three-fourths of the race. But the Woodbridge team of Yan 
Gendlin (backstroke), Tunch Doker (breaststroke), Justin Steinhauser 
(butterfly) and Dawson Hughes (freestyle) came back to win it behind Hughe's 
anchor split of 21.24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina had led by two points heading into the final event. 
</P>
<P>
 The backstroke relay was timed in 1:38.74, more than a second faster than the 
previous section record, 1:39.88, set by Mission Viejo in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 With a fast leadoff swim of 23.53, Derya Buyukuncu put Woodbridge ahead by a 
body length, and strong swims by Andrew Lazenby, Gendlin and Hughes allowed 
them to hold onto the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we had a good chance for the record," Lazenby said. "The whole team 
came together, and we all pulled together for this on." 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep inside, I knew these guys could do it," Woodbridge Coach Dan Gaines 
said. "We have some awesome swimmers, and they were so close in the 
preliminaries."

SANTA ANITA; SIR HUTCH GETS FIRST VICTORY IN A STAKES, THE POTRERO GRANDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helped by the hot, dry conditions that sped up the Santa Anita main track and 
aided front-runners all day, Sir Hutch became a stakes winner for the first 
time with a one-length victory over favored Concept Win in the 6 1/2-furlong, 
$106,100 Potrero Grande Handicap Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchased for $200,000 by Bob Baffert, the most the trainer has ever spent for 
a yearling, Sir Hutch won for the third time in eight starts and gave jockey 
Pat Valenzuela his second stakes victory of the 58-day-old meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a field reduced to five after the scratch of Bengal Bay, Sir Hutch, the 
fourth longest shot in the field at 7-2, drew clear immediately, opened up 
three lengths after a 43 4/5 half-mile and still led by two after a 1:07 4/5 
six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told all my assistants today, if he's going to be a Breeders' Cup horse, he 
better beat this field," Baffert said. "If he doesn't, I'm going to be totally 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never trained up to a race like he did today. He's learning how to run. 
I could have run him (in a softer spot), but when a horse is doing that well, 
why waste it? I'd rather take a shot in a $100,000 race and get to talk to you 
guys afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Concept Win, who started from the rail, finished a neck in front of Furiously 
as the 7-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish I could have traded post positions (with Sir Hutch)," said 
Concept Win's jockey, Gary Stevens. "I had to drive him from the beginning, 
couldn't get him out and he wouldn't run more than three-quarters speed behind 
those other horses." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The appeal of the disqualification of The Wicked North in the Santa Anita 
Handicap, originally scheduled to be heard Saturday, has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing Philip Hersh, The Wicked North's owner, and trainer 
David Bernstein requested a continuance and it was granted by the California 
Horse Racing Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ward, one of the three stewards at Santa Anita, said the appeal probably 
will be heard the week of April 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, unbeaten in three starts, is the 4-5 favorite in the $200,000 Santa 
Anita Oaks today. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of the Grade I Las Virgenes three weeks ago, the 3-year-old Seattle 
Slew filly might have only four opponents in the 1 1/16-mile Oaks. Lakeway's 
stablemate, Beautiful Gem, perfect in two starts, probably will be scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux will again be aboard the favorite, who worked six furlongs in 
a bullet 1:12 2/5 last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancy 'N Fabulous, a maiden who has been second in consecutive stakes, is the 
3-1 second choice. Alex Solis will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The other entrants are Tulgey Wood, Dianes Halo and Flying In The Lane, who 
will try two turns for the first time after winning two of three sprints. Horse

 IT'S RELATIVE: You don't have to be an Einstein to do the math on this one: 
Monday would have been Albert Einstein's 115th birthday. Few would know that 
better than former San Diego Zoo researcher Arden Bercovitz. He's made a 
mini-career out of portraying Einstein at area business conferences. Tuesday 
he's at the Hyatt Regency Irvine, at an international conference for clients of 
Monitoring Automation Systems, a computer software company in Irvine. . . . 
Says a company spokesman: "It would be interesting to see what Einstein would 
think of today's world."

 DUKE IT OUT: If you've never watched public TV's "Washington Week in Review," 
it's the political talk show where the panelists do not shout and interrupt 
each other. Its low-key, longtime moderator, Paul Duke, retired from the show 
last week. But it's still a big part of his life. Duke will host a 
"re-creation" of the show Monday at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach, along 
with other regulars from the show. Nearly 200 guests who paid $100 each will 
attend. Proceeds go to the Laguna Museum of Art.

 NOVEL ADVICE: Pat Teal of Fullerton proves that literary agents need not be 
based in Manhattan to be successful (E1). Teal, who sells more than 100 books a 
year, is always willing to take on new writers. . . . She says she will take a 
look at works-in-progress, but she won't try selling a novel unless it's 
completed. Says Teal: "Some people write the best first three chapters in the 
world and they never finish a book."

 CLOTHES CALL: Renzi Custom Gallery, the men's custom clothier in Newport 
Beach, had so many callers seeking clothing tips that the owners set up a hot 
line, 800-WE-CLOTHE, to give out such help. . . . "Most people want to know 
what colors they can wear together, or how heavy a fabric for special 
occasions," says spokesman Edward Goebel. But one surprise they hadn't 
expected, he adds: "Most of the calls are from women, not men. They want to 
make sure their boyfriends or husbands are properly dressed."

GAY RELATIONSHIPS ALSO SUBJECT TO 'BATTERED PERSON'S SYNDROME'; VIOLENCE: 
PROVING THE PRIOR ABUSE CAN BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE POLICE USUALLY ARE NOT CALLED. 
JURISTS AND LAWS OFTEN ARE UNSYMPATHETIC.

 The quarrel began at a bar and continued when John Wigglesworth III and 
Kenneth Smith returned home after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigglesworth pushed Smith into an aquarium and Smith stabbed him. Wigglesworth 
crawled across the street -- Smith followed, and stood by crying as a neighbor 
tried to plug three stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't understand. He's my lover. Please tell me that he's OK. Please, 
please say yes," Smith pleaded as he watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigglesworth died after a lovers' quarrel, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's lawyer, John Mitchell Jr., said except for its fatal conclusion, the 
incident was not unusual. The two had been together for a year, and early on 
Wigglesworth had started beating his client, Mitchell said -- a couple of times 
a month, in bars and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 This was to be Smith's defense -- the "battered person's syndrome." Usually it 
is applied to women or sometimes children who have been pressed to violence in 
response to the violence they suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 But rarely has it been used as a defense in a case involving a gay couple. One 
reason is that courts have refused to hear it; another is that gays who have 
been battered rarely go to authorities, so they have little evidence of the 
abuse that led them to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people . . . don't trust discussing an issue so volatile with a 
heterosexual who might not respect their relationship to begin with," said 
Robin Kane, a spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, however, did have a record of abuse he could cite: Mitchell said there 
were battery charges pending against Wigglesworth at the time of the killing 
for an incident where Smith's ribs were bruised. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Kanawha County Circuit Judge John Hey ruled that he would not 
allow Smith to claim he was a victim of battered person's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the state accepted the defense in 1987 for a woman who killed her 
husband, "there's no precedent in West Virginia for using that defense in the 
case of homosexuals," Hey said during the August hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was given five years' 
probation and credit for the year he served in home confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts' opposition does not surprise gay-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the law as using our relationships only as weapons, as justification, 
in the hands of our murderers far more often than we see the law taking our 
relationships seriously in order to protect us," said Evan Wolfson of the 
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which supports gay causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Foreman, executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian 
Anti-Violence Project, said homosexuals who report spousal abuse face slim odds 
that their abusers will be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 cases of battery among homosexual partners are reported to his 
organization every year, but only about three make it to court, he said. In the 
three most recent cases, two of the accused batterers were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, an Ohio appellate court ruled the state's domestic violence laws must 
cover homosexuals. But experts are unaware of similar rulings elsewhere, and 
some states' laws explicitly exclude gay and lesbian couples. 
</P>
<P>
 In this kind of a hostile environment, it is little wonder that battered 
person's syndrome is nearly unheard of in cases involving homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Bricker, now a federal judge's clerk in New Haven, Conn., said the 
first time a woman used the defense in connection with her female lover's death 
was in West Palm Beach, Fla., in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Green was convicted of fatally shooting her lover, but the judge gave 
her the minimum prison term, sympathizing with her claim that she acted in 
self-defense after years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relationship among humans," Circuit Judge Tom Waddell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in a very different kind of case, Peter Schneider said he was 
driven to kill his male boss, Dennis Waymire, after being sexually assaulted 
repeatedly. Schneider is heterosexual and Waymire was bisexual, Schneider's 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court in Yakima, Wash., ruled that Schneider was a victim of battered 
person's syndrome and sentenced him to 21 months in prison for manslaughter, 10 
months less than the standard sentence for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you view the deliberation and planning that went into the killing of 
Dennis Waymire, it has to be done through the prism of the battered person 
syndrome," the judge said at sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Mones, a Santa Monica, Calif., lawyer and an expert on battered person's 
syndrome, was one of Schneider's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We argued equal protection. If you have battered woman's syndrome, why should 
it be limited by gender if one can show that the same dynamics are there for 
men as well?" Mones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really at issue is not the sexual orientation, but the intimate 
relationship and the power dynamics," said Charles Patrick Ewing, an associate 
professor of law and psychology at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that it's not valid simply because two people were members of the same 
sex strikes me as untenable," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said gay men face double discrimination in the courts "on the theory that a 
man certainly wouldn't find himself in that kind of situation where he was 
trapped and couldn't escape from his abuser." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kane of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force acknowledged that the gay 
community has only recently begun to address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past five years there has been an increase in visibility in this issue 
. . . so people can feel safe stepping forward," she said.

WEST AFRICAN DRUMS HAVE BEAT ON MEDIA COMPETITION; COMMUNICATIONS: LEARNING TO 
DECIPHER THE SOUND OF THE ANCIENT INSTRUMENTS IS BECOMING A LOST ART. BUT 
EFFORTS TO RESTORE IT HAVE BEGUN.

 An airplane is a canoe that flies like a bird. 
</P>
<P>
 An airplane that crashes in the United States is a canoe that flies like a 
bird that has fallen out of the sky in the land of the white man behind the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient talking drums of West Africa, in their own stylized and often 
allegorical lingo, bring modern news to the people far more quickly and 
colorfully than the talking heads on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombarded by modern media, however, fewer young people are able to decipher 
the sophisticated beats bouncing from village to village. 
</P>
<P>
 Georges Niangoran-Bouah, a National Institute of Arts anthropologist and the 
Ivory Coast's leading drumologist, is heading a crusade to make "drumspeak" 
mandatory study in elementary school before the art is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to teach the drum in the schools," he said. "We've already 
started at the university." 
</P>
<P>
 The talking drums produce modulated tones that evoke a spoken language and are 
part of the rich legacy of the Akan people throughout West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ghana, the state radio news always begins with a dramatic cadence of thumps 
that mean, "Listen up, Ghana!" or, "And now, the news." 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn, hours before people tune into the news on their radios and 
televisions, villagers already have been filled in about the farm reports, 
deaths, weddings, births and other news. 
</P>
<P>
 The language sometimes does somersaults to reflect modern times. If a Western 
medical relief group is coming to a village to vaccinate children, the drums 
announce: 
</P>
<P>
 "The white healers will come on the morrow. Gather the children under the 
banyan tree to keep them well." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of reach, the drums saturate more markets than cellular phones. A 
drummer can send his message over a 25-mile radius, where other drummers pick 
it up and pass it along. 
</P>
<P>
 In a couple of hours, a message can be catapulted across the Ivory Coast and 
through neighboring Ghana, borne along by the numerous tribes that make up the 
Akan people. 
</P>
<P>
 The drummers got one of their longest workouts when President Felix 
Houphouet-Boigny, who ruled Ivory Coast for 33 years and was an Akan chief, 
died on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Niangoran-Bouah was called home from Switzerland, where he was living, to 
preside over the elaborate drum lexicon during the two-month mourning period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great elephant has lost its teeth," was the first announcement the drums 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 The beat went on until the president was buried Feb. 7. Each day the drums 
recounted his deeds with a variety of colorful introductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leopard has lost his spots. The baobab (tree) has crashed down." 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the day of his funeral did the drums stop beating around the bush: 
"There is death in the house. There is great sorrow in this house." 
</P>
<P>
 French colonizers and Christian missionaries made periodic attempts to silence 
the drums, which they considered sacrilegious, sort of a timpani for the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of drums were burned, but the language endured. 
</P>
<P>
 Niangoran-Bouah believes Ivorians voyaged across the Atlantic to the Americas 
centuries ago because of an ancient phrase, "The people on the other side of 
the ocean . . . have plumes on their heads and tails for hair." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who could that be but Indian Americans?" said Niangoran-Bouah, who has 
written three books on Akan culture and is compiling a talking-drum dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The drums were silent on one of civilization's biggest news stories -- when 
Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think it was important," said Niangoran-Bouah.

SEOUL BUS DRIVERS TAKE LIFE IN SLOW LANE; JOB ACTION: NICKNAMED "STREET 
VILLAINS," THEY BACK UP THEIR DEMAND FOR HIGHER WAGES BY STICKING TO THE LETTER 
OF THE LAW IN THE TRAFFIC-CLOGGED STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bus drivers in the South Korean capital are taking desperate measures to back 
up their demand for higher wages: They are obeying the highway code. 
</P>
<P>
 Long nicknamed "street villains" by nerve-jangled commuters, they have 
suddenly taken to following the letter of the law as they ply their trade 
through the traffic-clogged streets of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses are stopping only at designated zones, their drivers give way to 
oncoming traffic at intersections and obey red lights, to the amazement of 
travelers accustomed to their cavalier treatment of the law and of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is part of a novel campaign by the bus drivers' union to press its claim 
for higher wages. It has pledged to work to the rules of the road, and thus 
fall well behind on timetables, until drivers get their increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But their new attitude to driving may outlive the go-slow campaign. Commuters, 
it seems, value their safety above the speed of reaching their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to abide by the law even after our wages struggle is over," 
said Lee Chang-kun, head of the Seoul bus drivers' union planning division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a great response from the public and the management should 
realize by now that driving illegally will not generate more revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive-to-rule is a welcome development for the city's tourism officials, 
whose surveys of visitors from overseas highlight traffic chaos and rude taxi 
drivers as the worst aspects of visiting South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the danger of using public transport was thrown into the spotlight 
when a bus crashed off an elevated section of highway in Seoul onto a highway 
below. Several passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most alarming incident in the treasury of horror stories that every 
bus passenger can relate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about how fast I get there; I care about getting there in one 
piece," said a Seoul woman whose husband was injured last year in a bus 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes me twice as long these days to get to work, but at least I feel 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Bus schedules in Seoul were devised before the age of affluence, which has 
flooded 1.76 million vehicles onto city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Public transport drivers have therefore been forced to flout traffic rules to 
keep to unrealistic timetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories abound of buses bypassing lines of waiting passengers to catch up to 
their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 It is nothing unusual to see passengers scurrying across lanes of moving 
traffic to reach a bus that has stopped in the fast lane to save the time of 
pulling in to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses regularly fail to stop for red lights and pedestrian crossings, and 
small cars are jostled out of the way by the public service juggernauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hordes of traffic police work at busy junctions during the rush hour, watching 
for the slightest traffic violation by private cars. But they turn a blind eye 
to monstrous breaches of the rules by bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 If public bus drivers like their new image of law-abiding road-users, what of 
the private bus companies, already unpopular with commuters after a hefty 16% 
increase in fares at the beginning of the year? 
</P>
<P>
 A change in timetables to accommodate law-abiding drivers would force them to 
increase bus frequencies and hit them with a financial burden they say they 
cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if you could observe the law and at the same time run a bus 
company," said an official at the Kaebong bus company, one of the city's 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not sure you could do that in the streets of Seoul."

LONG IN DENIAL, NIGERIA FACES UP TO AIDS; AFRICA: PEOPLE NOW ARE OPENLY TALKING 
ABOUT THE EPIDEMIC. FRIGHTENING STATISTICS ARE COMING TO LIGHT ON ITS SCOURGE 
IN THE CONTINENT'S MOST POPULATED NATION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many years after the United States and Europe woke up to the deadly spread of 
AIDS, Nigerians denied the disease was also killing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, people are openly talking about AIDS, and frightening statistics are 
coming to light on the scourge in Africa's most populated nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nigerian epidemic was not identified until 1986," said Dr. Abiola 
Tilley-Gyado, national coordinator of the AIDS control campaign in the West 
African country. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1986, we have in terms of full-blown AIDS about 971 reported cases from 
all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that is far from the real situation in a country of 88.5 million 
where most diseases are underreported. 
</P>
<P>
 Underreporting is greater in the case of AIDS, because of its relative novelty 
and the stigma attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilley-Gyado's unit has carried out several kinds of surveys across the 
country and the conclusions are worrying. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the results are computed among the sexually active group, that is those 
aged 15 and above, we come to the conclusion that there must be at least 
650,000 HIV-infected people in the country," Tilley-Gyado said. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, which destroys the body's immune system and 
leaves an infected person defenseless against other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 It has no cure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some native medicine men claim they can cure it with herbal concoctions. "We 
have asked such people to come forward and to treat a person actually tested 
and found to have AIDS, but so far they haven't," Tilley-Gyado said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where one man can have several wives and as many mistresses, 
casual sex has been identified as the main means by which AIDS is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 One survey of prostitutes showed 18% of those tested in some of Nigeria's 30 
states were HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some states, if you have two commercial sex workers standing side by side, 
one will be HIV positive," said Tilley-Gyado. 
</P>
<P>
 After grudgingly acknowledging AIDS was not just a foreign disease, Nigeria 
launched a massive campaign in 1991 to control its spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Each state now has a coordinator and all the 589 local government areas have 
units dealing with AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the campaign, many people are now inclined to attribute the death 
of someone who suddenly begins to lose weight to AIDS rather than to evil 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently a young university lecturer died in northern Nigeria and the hospital 
would not disclose the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends immediately concluded it was AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy had many girlfriends and just started wasting away," one said. 
"Everyone suspected he had AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 Television and radio are frequently carrying jingles warning against behavior 
that can lead to contracting the disease. "AIDS kills; avoid unprotected 
pleasures," one jingle says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tilley-Gyado insists her campaign aims to promote change in people's 
sexual attitudes rather than condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are promoting chastity before marriage (and) intra-marital fidelity, which 
are age-old values of our society," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she acknowledged that sales of condoms are booming in Nigeria and said 
this means Nigerians may be unable to change their sexual attitudes but want to 
protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign governments are helping fight the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain has helped establish two screening centers in every state, and the 
United States has earmarked $15 million for an AIDS program in Nigeria.

kah-LASH-nik-OFF -- s nap and click into place like a fresh magazine of 
high-velocity ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, still cherub-cheeked if silver-haired at 74, was 
almost a boy himself, age 23, when he began designing the assault rifle they 
eventually dubbed the AK-47 -- "Avtomat Kalashnikova 1947." 
</P>
<P>
 If, as Mao said, power grows from the barrel of a gun, this was the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 In 40 years as the standard issue for Soviet-bloc forces, as the weapon of 
choice for guerrillas from 'Nam to Nicaragua, as the everyday tool of 
terrorists, perhaps 50 million copies of the "AK," its descendants and clones 
have been produced in almost a dozen countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rugged, dependable, cheap and 600-rounds-a-minute lethal, the no-frills 
Kalashnikov is history's most widely distributed piece of killing machinery, 
the curve of its "banana" clip familiar to generations of TV news viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 And over the years it has done great damage, a toll that weighs on its 
creator. 
</P>
<P>
 This Siberian peasant's son has told friends, for instance, that he sometimes 
wishes he had become an agricultural engineer instead of a weapon designer. 
Last year, he said publicly he wanted to establish a "fund for gunshot 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the fund in an interview, he was interrupted by Elena, his 
daughter and traveling companion. That impractical idea was "a mistake," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalashnikov, offering no further explanation, moved on to another concern, his 
longtime hometown, Izhevsk, a city of a half-million people in the highlands 
west of the Ural Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Izhevsk was a major Soviet arms-manufacturing center, a "closed city" where 
Kalashnikov's design team worked over the years to improve the AK-47 for the 
giant Izhmash defense enterprise. Now, he said, "these are very bad times." 
</P>
<P>
 "In our region, everyone was in the military business. Now that there's not 
such a demand, people are losing their jobs at Izhmash. It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalashnikov feels the pinch himself, not having been showered with royalties 
like U.S. gun designers. "But the government was never against giving me 
medals," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-pressed local arms plants have hit on a Western-style marketing 
inspiration, capitalizing on the great designer's name by forming something 
called "The Kalashnikov Joint Stock Co." The shareholders are all old state 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from Izhevsk, an Izhmash deputy director, Alexander 
G. Likhachev, explained that the new company is gearing up for an export push. 
He threw in a pitch for Kalashnikov rifles: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're highly reliable and have a long service life. . . . They are better 
than, say, similar American products." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kalashnikov himself seems out of the corporate loop. He thought his 
namesake company had never gotten off the ground. Then again, he acknowledged 
with a laugh, he has no head for business. "I'm just a designer." 
</P>
<P>
 It's evidence of the confusion that reigns as Russians try to reorganize their 
post-Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The looser times at least have set the old designer loose to see the world, 
including America, where he was interviewed while attending a recent gun show 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really kept him prisoner all those years," said American friend and host 
Berge Boghossian, an arms dealer who calls Kalashnikov "the sweetest man on 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from his shell means facing questions, however, about sharing 
responsibility for a violent world. And that means retelling the story of the 
AK-47's origins: 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, tank commander Kalashnikov was wounded in a battle with Russia's 
German invaders. In the hospital, other wounded men complained of their army's 
deficit in infantry weapons -- ancient bolt-action rifles versus the Germans' 
modern firearms. Sgt. Kalashnikov, a clever mechanic, decided to spend his 
recuperation building a machine pistol like the Germans'. 
</P>
<P>
 His pistol was never put into service, but it established him as a weapons 
maker. In 1943 he competed with other designers on Russia's first assault rifle 
-- a weapon firing light rounds at a rapid rate, and also capable of 
single-round semiautomatic fire. When they dragged the Kalashnikov weapon 
through swamp water and it still fired, he was on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral of the AK-47 story: "I built it to protect my country." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Kalashnikov still designs weapons, but only hunting rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to work on any more military things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Has he sworn off man-killing devices? 
</P>
<P>
 The cheerful old father of famous guns hesitated and smiled. "No," he said. 
"It's just that, into the next century, nothing is going to be made better than 
my rifle anyway."

STILL BROKE, MICHIGAN SCHOOL FIGHTS TO STAY OPEN; EDUCATION: KALKASKA SAYS IT 
WILL MUDDLE THROUGH UNTIL JUNE 3 THIS TERM, BUT FACES A $500,000 DEFICIT 
DESPITE CANCELING BUS SERVICE AND CHARGING STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS. 
OTHER STATE SCHOOLS FACE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. TUESDAY, VOTERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER 
TO RAISE TAXES.

<P>
 Driving 10-year-old Kim to school before continuing on to work has become 
second nature for Irene Beltnick. She's been doing it since September, when 
Kalkaska schools cut bus service to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Kim home each afternoon can be trickier, but they manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just takes a little more planning and forethought," Beltnick said with a 
resigned smile as her daughter bounced from the car outside Birch Street 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle continues in Kalkaska, the small factory town and retirement 
haven in northern Michigan that lost its anonymity a year ago when school 
closed 10 weeks early. 
</P>
<P>
 With money running out and irate taxpayers refusing to give more, officials 
chose a shortened calendar over the deep program cuts necessary to operate a 
full 180-day year. On March 24, students began "summer vacation" with snow on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, voters twice have shot down attempts to raise property taxes. But 
officials of the 2,100-student district say this time they will muddle through 
until the scheduled closing June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board last fall reluctantly accepted cuts it previously had 
rejected -- eliminating bus service, cutting nearly 50 jobs, slashing the 
athletics budget and charging players $50 per sport. A number of other Michigan 
districts have done likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this year's $8.6-million budget is $500,000 in the hole because of 
state aid cuts and rising costs, Kalkaska Supt. Doyle Disbrow said. There will 
be a $300,000 deficit next year even if the spending cuts remain and a salary 
freeze continues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortening the year by more than 20% made Kalkaska a symbol of money problems 
afflicting the nation's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It awakened people even more than they had been previously to the seriousness 
of the problem," said Bob Chase, vice president of the National Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers' group supported Kalkaska's early closure. Critics in the 
Legislature and Gov. John Engler's administration said it was unnecessary and 
accused the school administration of mismanagement. Forbes magazine labeled the 
move "a union-orchestrated stunt" aimed at blackmailing taxpayers with children 
as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 But even critics acknowledge it may have been the final straw leading to the 
Legislature's abrupt decision last summer to dump the property tax as the chief 
source of education funding in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The move ended a 20-year stalemate over fixing a system that produced 
increasingly wide funding gaps among the state's school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd have muddled right along, doing nothing, if we hadn't acted," said Rik 
Ponstein, head of the Kalkaska teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Michigan voters must choose a new funding system. 
</P>
<P>
 A statewide referendum will be held Tuesday on Proposal A, which would boost 
the sales tax from 4% to 6%. It would retain a token tax on residences and a 
bigger levy on business property and would triple the cigarette tax to 75 cents 
a pack. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal loses, the Legislature has approved a fallback plan to raise 
the state income tax from 4.6% to 6%, levy some property taxes and increase 
taxes on cigarettes and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kalkaska, the coming vote has generated little of the passion stirred by 
local property tax campaigns. Few seem convinced that Proposal A or the 
fallback plan would solve their schools' money woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't come anywhere close," Disbrow said. He predicted Kalkaska and 
dozens of other districts would not have enough money next year to continue 
their current programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Addonizio, state assistant school superintendent, said many districts 
might consider their funding inadequate under the new system. But he said it 
will boost state education spending from $9.6 billion to $10.2 billion next 
year while other programs will be lucky to avoid cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposal A and the fallback plan promise each district a minimum grant of 
$4,200 per pupil next year, rising to $5,000 within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalkaska spends about $3,800 per pupil now, so next year's total figures to be 
about 10% higher. The average district's increase will be around 5.2%, 
Addonizio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalkaska's boost may seem generous, Disbrow said. But he contends it still 
won't buy a quality program because the district is so far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody would say they'll be on easy street," Addonizio said. "But they're 
getting a bigger per-pupil revenue increase than most districts around the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Kalkaskans say they've learned to make the best of things. 
When school ended prematurely, some parents tutored children in a church 
basement. When the buses were grounded, they formed car pools. When the band 
needed new uniforms, they held a beef-stew dinner to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get the impression this is a little hick place that can't take care of 
itself," said Alan Belt, father of two students. "We've really pulled 
together."

TOWN MAY SHOOT DOWN GUN OWNERSHIP LAW; PENNSYLVANIA: SOME FRANKLINTOWN 
RESIDENTS BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO GET RID OF MANDATORY WEAPONS ORDINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Concerned about guns? Take heart: This town's law says you must own one. 
</P>
<P>
 Some townsfolk believe it's time to get rid of the 12-year-old mandatory-gun 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a bunch of gun-toting rednecks," said Councilman Leon Rudy, who is 
seeking to repeal the law. "I'm tired of being known as the town with the 
unusual gun ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law was never meant to be strictly enforced, opponents say it 
gives this south-central Pennsylvania town of 400 a bad image. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the ordinance was designed to prevent gun control. They know 
their ordinance could be overridden but want to keep it on the books to make a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you have to over-dramatize things to get the point across," said 
Councilman Richard Blouch, who was council president when the measure was 
adopted in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gun owners are up in arms over the federal Brady law, which took effect 
Feb. 28. It requires a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases to allow 
time for background checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franklintown ordinance requires each household head to maintain a firearm 
and ammunition. Exempted are convicts and residents who have a physical 
disability or oppose firearms on religious grounds. The law does not specify 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Donna Finch, who served seven years in the military, refuses to own 
what she considers a dangerous weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm breaking the law because I don't have a gun," she said. "I would 
like to see the gun law go. It's making us look like idiots." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was modeled after one passed in 1982 in Kennesaw, Ga., which 
also is not enforced. Both ordinances were prompted by a handgun ban in Morton 
Grove, Ill., and legal scholars say they may pass muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might think this is a very bad idea, but a lot of very, very bad ideas 
are constitutional," said Stanford Levinson, a constitutional law professor at 
the University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 He compared the law to ordinances that require fire alarms and smoke detectors 
in the name of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll Township Police Chief James Fishel, whose police force serves 
Franklintown, said the gun law had no apparent effect on crime. He could 
provide no figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklintown has had no murders in recent years. Occasional burglaries, 
domestic disputes and rapes generally do not involve firearms, Fishel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Wilson, current council president, doubts any resident feels pressured 
to buy a gun. He says citizens can always claim religious objection. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 14 people interviewed, nine said they owned guns, three said they didn't 
and two refused to say. Gun owners said they had firearms long before the law 
was passed or before they moved to town -- mostly for hunting, target shooting 
or protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy said he wants the law abolished so officials can focus on more important 
matters -- such as buying a new snowplow and creating a park. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, he said, is "a distraction. It will just keep coming up year 
after year." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters say they will fight to keep the law, which staves off what they 
believe is the aim of gun-control advocates -- an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't give in to these people," Mayor Robert Wolfe said. "Eventually, 
we'll lose our right to bear arms."

HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY PROVES TO BE A MAGNET FOR LOW-SKILL JOB-SEEKERS; NEW YORK: 
HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES HAVE REPLACED FACTORIES AND THE DOCKS AS MAJOR 
EMPLOYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MALCOLM GLADWELL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When word got out in late December that Brookdale Hospital was hiring 300 
people for its new nursing home, the line formed at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare mothers, immigrants, out-of-work laborers and jobless high-school 
graduates from the struggling surrounding neighborhoods of Flatbush and 
Brownsville gathered outside in the cold. People driving by saw the commotion, 
parked their cars and joined the line. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, the line of would-be housekeepers, nurse's aides, 
cafeteria staff and technicians stretched 4,500 people long. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, these people would have been employed in one of Brooklyn's 
thousands of small factories or in the bustling dockyards of Gowanus Bay. But 
now the factories have moved south, and the docks are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The only industry still hiring in these parts -- and in inner-city 
neighborhoods like them across the country -- is health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side to soaring health-care costs is that hospitals and nursing homes 
have become a growth industry in older cities, in many cases the only remaining 
source of stable, often unionized jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960 health care ranked ninth among New York City's employers. Today it is 
first and growing. In just the last 15 years a federal program to provide home 
health care to the elderly poor has resulted in the creation of nearly 70,000 
new jobs in New York, many of them filled by immigrant women entering the work 
force for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical economic role played by the health-care industry in places like 
New York City is a wild card in the ongoing debate over health-care reform, a 
fact that may frustrate any attempt to restructure or curtail spending. That's 
because what to the White House and the corporate boardrooms is a system out of 
control is to the inner city a jobs program -- and a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever one might say about how efficient or fair health-care spending has 
been, it's been a godsend for New York City," said Mathew Drennan, an economist 
at New York University. "It employs a whole lot of low-income, low-skilled 
people whose traditional sources of employment have disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 Today in Manhattan, among the tenements of Washington Heights, the biggest 
employer is Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. The biggest employer in Harlem is 
Harlem Hospital. The biggest employer in the South Bronx is Bronx-Lebanon 
Hospital. And here in Brooklyn there are 6,800 employees at King's County 
Hospital down the road, 4,500 on staff at Brookdale -- and no place else even 
comes close. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, during the last three years, the city's health-care industry hired 
30,000 new people, a 12% increase, while the non-health portion of the private 
sector shrank by 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take our cars down to the gas station. We use local contractors when we 
buy light bulbs. We try to keep our money in the community," said Brookdale 
President Frank Maddalena. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care's extraordinary role in poorer communities arises out of an often 
overlooked facet of modern medicine: that for all of the attention given to the 
role of high-technology gadgetry and drugs, caring for people's health remains 
a business dependent overwhelmingly on cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the automobile industry about 25 cents of every dollar goes directly to 
wages. In health care the number is closer to 70 cents, most of it going to the 
paychecks of lower-level support staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Private, nonprofit Brookdale, for example, employs 500 doctors and 900 
registered nurses. But they are far exceeded by the number of unskilled and 
semi-skilled jobs at the hospital: 480 nurses' aides -- high-school graduates 
with a three-month training course -- 322 technical staff, 1,500 housekeepers, 
janitors, clerks and general-support staff, and another 743 other assorted 
skilled and semi-skilled employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The garment workers' union used to be considered the point of entry into 
American society," said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital 
Assn. "People from other countries would come to New York, and that's where 
they would get a job. Today it's health care." 
</P>
<P>
 "An unskilled worker who lands a (unionized) job in an institution in New York 
starts with $400-a-week salary, a health-care plan with no deductibles, 
dental-patient care, life insurance, pension fund, child care, mentoring of 
youth, after-school programs, housing programs, summer-camp programs, 
scholarship programs and legal programs," said Dennis Rivera, president of 
Local 1199 of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Workers. "You tell 
me where you can find another (entry-level) job today with all those benefits. 
They don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Spending money on health care, according to many economists, is not 
necessarily the best way to create entry-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanswered question, however, is whether other types of job-growth 
programs would be as effective in channeling money directly into disadvantaged 
neighborhoods as health-care spending has been.

OVERTIME FUELS TRUCKER'S RECOVERY; ECONOMY: JOHN HARRINGTON LOST HIS JOB 2 1/2 
YEARS AGO. NOW, HE HAS ANOTHER ONE, AND HIS PROSPECTS ARE LOOKING UP. BUT HE 
STILL LIVES FROM CHECK TO CHECK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When John Harrington hears the pundits crowing about the booming economy, he 
can offer proof, too. It's right there in his paycheck, summed up in one word: 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Five extra hours, maybe 10 a week, if he's lucky. An extra day's pay won't 
make his family rich, but it's a notch up their security ladder -- and that's 
good enough for the veteran truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything looked dismal three, four years ago," Harrington said. "Now, I'm 
more optimistic. I read the newspapers and see all the positive things. If 
people are buying and spending money, then I'm working. That's the bottom 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been that way very long. About 2 1/2 years ago, the trucking company 
Harrington had worked for since he was 18 closed -- just two months after he 
and his wife, Ellen, bought a new house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard to get ahead," Harrington said, explaining why they had bought 
the home. "You couldn't wait for everything to be perfect. You had to take a 
chance. Then what we thought could happen, happened." 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was a domino-like procession of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months without a job. Savings depleted. Two mortgages to meet, one from 
their former house. And a new worry: health insurance. Harrington's 
mother-in-law made the $250 monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, he said, 'I'll be working in a month,"' Ellen Harrington recalled. 
"One month went by. Then another. And another. I thought the economy must be 
really bad. Everything is not going to be as easy as I thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was determined to stay in trucking even though deregulation during 
the '80s had bankrupted companies and forced thousands onto the unemployment 
rolls. At age 43, he had 20 years invested in a Teamsters pension and wasn't 
about to change professions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was locked in," he said. "It's almost stupid to walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington eventually found temporary work at Carolina Freight Carriers Corp.; 
he was hired full time in February, 1993. He said he earns more than $15 an 
hour, still short of union scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's slightly more than his previous salary, the cost of living has 
soared and the Harringtons, like many other blue-collar workers across America, 
feel as if they're running in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're making progress, it's minimal," said the ruddy-faced, mustachioed 
Harrington. "But who is progressing? I just don't know. . . . We're just 
breaking even." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harringtons and their two daughters, 16 and 10, live modestly in a 
ranch-style home on the city's South Side -- a Democratic, blue-collar bastion 
-- about a mile from Comiskey Park, home to the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Harrington works part time as a secretary and travel agent to make ends 
meet. Their money disappears fast: $100 a week for their 16-year-old's Catholic 
school tuition; $100 a week for gas and lunch for her husband. Then, the 
mortgage, food, clothes and heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent from two tenants who live in their former home, a building with two 
apartments, helps out. Still, it's a scrimp-and-save world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep thinking we're going to have extra money," Ellen Harrington said. 
"But without any savings . . . we live from check to check. It seems like we're 
starting all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington has begun putting aside $20 from each check to build new savings, 
and he hopes his new job will restore the family's sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 But they've postponed big purchases. Harrington drives a 1983 Ford pickup 
truck; his wife has a 1978 Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington is bracing for contract talks this spring, hoping there won't be 
concessions. But he's not expecting a raise either. 
</P>
<P>

 "I think the company is going to be around for a while," he said. "If they

<P>
 Police have taken at least 2,700 people into custody as "a precautionary 
measure" on the anniversary of bombings that killed 257 people, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 12, 1993, Bombay was rocked by 13 bomb explosions. Police blame the 
blasts on Muslim radicals taking revenge for the demolition of a mosque by 
Hindu zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those detained in the past 10 days are considered habitual offenders 
by police. They have not been formally charged but are being kept in police 
lockups.

DESPITE FROZEN FIELDS, FARMERS KEEP BUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBERT GREENE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only plows at work shoot rooster tails of snow off the township roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmsteads on the quarter sections stand out like wooded islands on a vast 
frozen lake and more than two feet of snow hide the black soil of the Red River 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldwork doesn't start until mid-April, if the weather cooperates. But forget 
the jokes about farmers who spend cold months in Phoenix playing pinochle. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter might be the time to ease up a little, take some vacation or have an 
extra cup of coffee at the grain elevator. But for most of the people who grow 
crops here in Cass County and the rest of Middle America, winter is still a 
time of hard work -- planning the next season's crops, bargaining over lease 
agreements, fixing old equipment and figuring out what the newest edicts from 
Washington will mean for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the snow is viewed in terms of what kind of flooding it will cause when 
it melts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time since you could lay off in the wintertime and make it," 
said Tom Sinner, 65, who with his brother and two sons grows seeds that other 
farmers will be planting in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others in the flood-stricken Midwest, the Sinners have been cleaning 
grain like crazy. The wet 1993 season caused a wheat scab that shriveled many 
kernels. For the wheat to bring any kind of price, it has to weigh close to 60 
pounds a bushel. So, gravity machines have been sifting out the lightweight 
kernels. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Peterson, in nearby Harwood, turned grain cleaning into a winter job. "We 
were running 24 hours a day till just about Christmas," said Peterson, 35. 
"Now, we're trying to run from 6 a.m. to about midnight." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Greg Schulz farm in Davenport, the hired men were putting together 
Peterson's new grain drill, a 50-foot-wide rig that will plant the spring 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
 This time of year, farmers become mechanics. The odor of welding fills huge, 
heated buildings that house tractors, combines, sprayers, grain drills, trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to farm equipment, some assembly is always required. And every 
farmer has a notion of how to improve what the factory did. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone has a side job, from selling farm equipment to hauling 
sunflower husks to Fargo to be burned to heat schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pay my taxes," said James Martin, 54, explaining why he stepped outside to 
auger a truckload of soybeans from his bins. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also time for the mental work of farming, done in banks, county extension 
offices and in the farm offices usually made from converted bunkhouses or as an 
afterthought to one of the outbuildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my Mexican labor in Texas, calling about W-2s," said Joe Nelson, 32, 
hanging up the phone, worrying about his own tax return as well. Property taxes 
just came due and the federal deadline is March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 That's also the date farmers can start trekking to the local Agriculture 
Department field office in West Fargo to sign up for farm programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seminars on changes in crop insurance, fuel standards and pesticide safety 
turn small towns into one-day campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could go to a meeting every day of the week if you wanted," said Nelson, 
who has a plumbing and insulation business on the side, does Farm Bureau work 
and sits on the board of the cooperative elevator in Prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Gary, 54, a state senator, complains that "it takes 30% of a man 
to take care of the government paperwork." There go December, January, February 
and March, if that formula applies. 
</P>
<P>
 An unseasonably warm day turns many a grower's fancy to tractors, said Perry 
Rust, 35, a farmer and equipment dealer in Harwood. "As the melt increases, the 
quotes increase, and the sales increase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rust's brother, Dale, 40, sells seed when he's not farming. "You can actually 
go home at a decent time," he said, explaining the chief attraction of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 He also plans a second ski trip before it's back to dawn-to-dusk farm work. 
"We'll end up burning a week and a half of winter on fun things," he said.

ITALIAN ARCHEOLOGIST DIGS HIS SCUBA GEAR; TREASURE: GOVERNMENT STRUGGLES TO 
SAVE RICH UNDERWATER SITES FROM PLUNDERERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many an underworld figure in Italy has ended up in a watery grave, so when 
Luigi Robusto, an off-duty police officer, spied a foot sticking out of the 
bottom of the Adriatic, he figured he had found the latest corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Robusto, who dives as a hobby, made one of the most fabulous finds in 
the last few decades of Italian archeology -- a bearded head, two arms and a 
left foot believed to be parts of 4th-Century BC Greek bronze statues. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for archeology, the diver was a member of the carabinieri , the 
paramilitary police corps that patrols Italy's 5,000 miles of seacoast. It's on 
alert for looters of ancient artifacts as well as drug smugglers and illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The bronzes, discovered in 1992 off the coast of Brindisi, are under 
restoration for display in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But for countless other treasures of the deep, it's finders keepers. 
</P>
<P>
 With high-tech expeditions plumbing the seas from Central America to the South 
Pacific for sunken treasure -- quests for the Titanic and Spanish galleons are 
some recent examples -- archeologists are racing against time to save sites 
from plunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating their crusade is little recognition for underwater archeology as 
a discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Underwater archeology is still considered a side branch of archeological 
research," complained one expert, Werner Johannowsky, writing in Italy's first 
journal of undersea archeology, which made its debut this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, a cubbyhole of sorts was carved out by the Culture Ministry 
for an office for underwater archeology. Claudio Mocchegiani Carpano, an 
archeologist and diver who runs it, relies heavily on volunteers, the coast 
guard and carabinieri to protect and retrieve ancient treasures, most of which 
are found by chance. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all that much different from how things were in 1972, when a scuba 
diver off the coast of Calabria fished out Italy's most celebrated undersea 
find, the stunningly handsome Riace Bronzes, a pair of life-size warriors, 
nearly half a ton apiece and possibly the work of the 5th-Century BC master 
Greek sculptor Phidias. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, we worked underwater on our own free time," recalled 
Mocchegiani Carpano in his office near the Tiber, whose polluted waters he 
regularly searches for ancient Roman ships and cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 To get an idea of what straits underwater archeologists work in, imagine 
leaving the job of unearthing the equivalent of a Hadrian's Villa, the popular 
tourist site on the outskirts of Rome, in the hands of amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how the "excavation" off Capri of a sumptuous villa of 1st-Century 
Emperor Tiberius is being carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from Archeoclub, a nationwide group of archeology lovers, work 
every summer to reveal a little more of the baths, swimming pools and fish 
ponds that delighted the emperor and his entourage. Because the island off 
Naples is in an earthquake-prone area, the villa slowly sunk below sea level 
over the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capri was never (systematically) studied underwater," said the leader of the 
project, Orlando Pandolfi, an engineer and Archeoclub official. "Before we 
came, there were looters and, only very sporadically, professional 
archeologists." 
</P>
<P>
 When archeologists have to leave an underwater site, they sometimes cover it 
with cement or a metal grid. 
</P>
<P>
 Pandolfi hopes someday at Capri there will be glass-bottom boats for tourists 
and marked trails for divers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italy has probably the most interesting seas in the world because for 
centuries all the trade routes passed by," said Pandolfi. "There are thousands 
of shipwrecks and lots of submerged cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Work underwater -- by volunteers or by the state -- moves slowly because of 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just like working on terra firma, "only you don't excavate with a pick ax 
and it costs 10 times as much," Mocchegiani Carpano said. With a minuscule 
budget, his dream of having staff archeologists, photographers and sketchers 
who know how to dive isn't about to come true soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Digging out sunken wrecks has helped tell more about commerce, construction 
techniques and even what were the latest fads in household decorating -- many 
Roman wrecks were filled with Greek antiquities to fill that empty niche or two 
in the atrium in some patrician house.

POLICE CLEARED IN FATAL BEATING ON TAPE; MASSACHUSETTS: JUDGE CITES EXCESSIVE 
FORCE BUT FINDS NO CRIMINAL WRONGDOING. HE TERMS THE SUSPECT VIOLENT AND 
IRRATIONAL. THE FAMILY VOWS TO SUE. 
</P>

 Comparisons to the Rodney King case are inevitable: White police officers are 
accused of using excessive force in arresting a dark-skinned man; they say he 
was fighting them. Part of the arrest is videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
 But the differences are also compelling. The arrest of Cristino Hernandez, a 
38-year-old Salvadoran immigrant, prompted no national outcry and no charges 
against the two arresting officers. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Hernandez video lacks the jolting images of the King tape, it 
depicts more severe injuries: King recovered, Hernandez died 10 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 "King was able to live and tell about his brutal beating and Hernandez was 
not," said Hector Pineiro, attorney for Hernandez's family. 
</P>
<P>
 After an inquest, a judge blamed excessive force by police for the death, but 
found no criminal wrongdoing. Hernandez himself was violent and irrational, 
Superior Court Judge Patrick Fox concluded in his December report. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Edward Gardella said that the officers, who had been on paid 
leave, would be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 The case isn't over. A federal investigation continues and Hernandez's family 
plans a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "All sorts of legal minds will review for hours what decision the officer had 
to make in a split second," said Joseph Monahan III, the attorney for Officer 
David Reidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Reidy and Officer Christopher McInnes, both 5 1/2-year veterans, didn't know 
Hernandez before July 6, a warm morning in this central Massachusetts city of 
170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who emigrated in 1989, was "a person who never bothered no one," 
said his sister, Noelia Chafoya. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were previous run-ins with police. He had been arrested for 
kidnaping and assaulting a police officer, and had been committed to 
Bridgewater State Hospital, where he was described as "psychotic, incoherent, 
regressive and lacking in behavioral control." 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, police received their second call in two days that Hernandez was 
harassing his neighbors. Reidy and McInnes responded. They didn't arrest 
Hernandez, although they said he pretended to shoot them with a toy pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after they left, they were called back. 
</P>
<P>
 Reidy found Hernandez outside his home, carrying a golf bag. Reidy said 
Hernandez hit him with a hollow plastic tube and ran inside. 
</P>
<P>
 What ensued is in dispute. The officers said Hernandez was wild and 
incoherent. They said he kicked them in their groins and was unfazed when Reidy 
fired pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez's mother, Elisa Quintanilla, and sister, Paula Rolon, who 
witnessed -- and videotaped -- part of the arrest, said police beat Hernandez, 
who didn't fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4 1/2-minute videotape begins after the scuffle moved outside. It shows 
Reidy, 6-foot-2 and 225 pounds, kneeling on the back of Hernandez, who was 
5-foot-4 and weighed 145 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 As Reidy lifts Hernandez's cuffed hands upright behind his back, McInnes sits 
on Hernandez's kicking legs and cuffs them. Off camera, Hernandez's sisters and 
mother cough and yell. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time into the video, Hernandez stops moving. Reidy appears dazed and is 
spitting. About 90 seconds later the camera changes angles, and Reidy is seen 
pushing Hernandez's hands backward above Hernandez's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something happens to him, you guys are going to jail," one of the women says. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics called to the scene couldn't find a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez never regained consciousness and died of a brain injury due to a 
lack of oxygen, the state medical examiner's office said. Worcester County 
Dist. Atty. John Conte ordered an inquest. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent internal police investigation concluded that the officers used 
reasonable force and that other factors could have killed Hernandez. 
Investigators said the pathologist's findings were based largely on the 
videotape, which "takes what it shows out of context." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Pineiro said the internal investigation demonstrates "contempt of 
undeniable facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Gardella defended the report but acknowledged that some may remain 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very unfortunate part to all this is anything we say seems very, very 
defensive, very protective," he said.

 The three portals of Notre Dame cathedral will get a state-of-the-art 
face-lift starting this week using the latest laser technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleaning is the first major restoration of Notre Dame's main doors since 
the mid-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the laser beams will dislodge particles of dirt built up since the 
13th Century without damaging the remaining vestiges of color still visible in 
the sculpted folds of the saints' clothes.

EXTENDED CHILL BLOCKS MAPLE SYRUP FLOW; NEW ENGLAND: PRODUCERS HAVE THEIR GEAR 
READY TO CATCH THE SAP BUT THE SPRING THAW HAS YET TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No prudent New Englander would put much stock in the sight of a few chilly 
robins that probably got blown off course during the last blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sure sign of spring up here is the rattle of buckets and the sweet 
smell of maple sap on the boil. 
</P>
<P>
 But January passed without a thaw. February has given way to March and more 
snow. And New England's maple bush is silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This winter has been a nightmare," said Tom McCrumm, president of the 
Massachusetts Maple Producers Assn. "I stopped looking at the thermometer 
because it always reads 10 below and you can't get out into the woods even on 
snow shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sugarers need temperatures above freezing in the daytime to get the sap 
flowing in the trees and below freezing at night to keep the maples from 
budding. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, cold and a string of late spring storms kept the maples from 
thawing until April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it warmed up fast and the season, which normally lasts for a month or so, 
was over in little more than a weeklong gush that kept sugarers on the run from 
Maine to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short and sweet," said McCrumm. "But I don't want to go through that ever 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the closest McCrumm has come to sugaring is loading his taps and 
tubing into the back of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman came up to me and said she was just glad to see me out with my tanks 
and tubing, because that meant that spring would really come someday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sap isn't running. I haven't tapped a tree yet," said Alvin Warner, owner 
of Shultz Farm in Hamden, Conn. Southern New England sugarers are usually 
collecting sap by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maine, it's still too early to even think about spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylene Cooper of Cooper's Maple Products in Windham said the really good runs 
don't start until the middle of March, "unless we get lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar makers in New Hampshire say their tubing is hung and the wood supply is 
in, but they need some cooperation from the weather before they can fire up 
evaporators to boil the sap down into syrup, said Gail McWilliams, a 
spokeswoman for the state agriculture department. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McCrumm was looking ahead, and the future wasn't entirely rosy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday, we will look around and wonder where all the snow went so fast. It 
will happen. Spring will come and before long the black flies will be back."

 The broadcast quoted an unnamed foreign ministry official as telling a U.S.

"unjustifiable" and would not be helpful for relations between the two

NEW VISIONARIES GAMBLE BUNDLE ON RIVERBOAT CASINOS; MISSISSIPPI: NEW PADDLE 
WHEELERS OFFER TRULY FLOATING CRAP GAMES ACCOMPANIED BY CALLIOPE STEAM 
WHISTLES.

 "Steamboating's dead," former pilot Mark Twain decreed in 1882 when he 
returned to the river after an absence of 21 years -- this time as a passenger 
aboard the Gold Dust. He saw only a handful of other packets chugging down to 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the words of the cable he sent 15 years later to the Associated Press 
about reports of his own demise, the celebrated author's obituary for 
riverboats was "greatly exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than a century later, shipyards all over south Louisiana, along the 
Mississippi Gulf Coast and as far north as Elgin, Ill., are raising ornamented 
smokestacks, hanging paddle wheels and affixing curlicue railings and 
gingerbread pilothouses on boats being launched at a frantic pace to 
accommodate the roll of the dice more than the roll of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 In Louisiana alone, 31 riverboats are either under construction or have been 
delivered in the last year as a result of legalized riverboat gambling along 
the mighty Mississippi and its tributaries. Gaming experts predict 90 or more 
will be afloat before the century is out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest boom in riverboat building since right after the Civil 
War," said Larry Hairston, senior vice president of Service Marine, watching a 
huge crane lift the twin smokestacks onto the purple and gold trimmed 
Shreveport Rose at the sprawling boatyard along the Atchafalaya River in Morgan 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delivering eight boats a week, working two 10-hour shifts six days a 
week. We got six under way here now. Boats we built or converted are in 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois. Indiana will be next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had quite a few inquiries from overseas. The latest was from the 
People's Republic of China for a 300-foot stern-wheeler on the Yangtze. Donald 
Trump has been here a couple of times looking around. The Donald has an 
application in for a boat at the foot of Canal Street in New Orleans and 
another in Gary, Ind." 
</P>
<P>
 But gambling is not the sole reason why all of a sudden there is a demand for 
calliope players, frosted-glass etchers, experts in the hydraulics of paddle 
wheel buckets and other rare artisans who have been in decline since the J. M. 
White in 1878 was deemed the epitome of elegance afloat. She dazzled the river 
trade with monogrammed linen napery, walnut- and rosewood-paneled staterooms 
boasting double beds instead of bunks, two bridal suites and brass spittoons 
every six feet along her hurricane deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a mile or so up the river at McDermott's yard, known worldwide for its 
offshore oil platforms, shipwrights are adding deck upon deck to the all-steel 
hull of the American Queen, the largest overnight passenger vessel to be built 
in an American yard since the liner United States in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there's a boat," conceded Hairston in almost reverential awe. "She 
carries a price tag of upwards of $60 million, while ours go for between $12 
million and $16 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the J. M. White, but almost a third again as long, the 412-foot 
American Queen is a genuine steamboat. Two steam engines taken from the steam 
dredge Kennedy, circa 1930, turn her 60-ton paddle wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Victorian decor features gilt mirrors, marble-top tables and overstuffed 
chairs in staterooms opening onto promenade decks and a grand saloon including 
a theater with private boxes modeled after a 19th-Century opera house in a 
small river town. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide staircase under a stained-glass skylight sweeps down to a dining saloon 
lit by chandeliers, each in Twain's words "an April shower of glittering glass 
drops." Cap'n Mary's Parlor, re-creating the "no cussin' or swearin' " ladies 
lounge of the steamboat Gothic era will have "carpets soft as mush" to meet 
Twain's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be some amenities Mark Twain never dreamed of," said Tom Carman, a 
naval architect and vice president of the Delta Queen Steamboat Co., which has 
scheduled the newcomer to join her "pure steamboat" sisters, the Delta Queen 
and the Mississippi Queen, in plying the Mississippi and Ohio early next year. 
"Like elevators, a swimming pool, telephones and climate controls in every 
stateroom, and an exercise room for the physically obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Norton, project manager for the American Queen, admits that "ole Horace 
Bixby, who taught Mark Twain the art of piloting, would be horrified to find a 
'no smoking' sign in the dining saloon." He confides that some on the design 
team are pushing for spittoons in the Boiler Room bar overlooking the paddle 
wheel, the last hurrah for the traditional men's bar where ladies now will be 
invited to light up a cheroot. 
</P>
<P>
 Steamboat purists tend to look down on the gambling boats, which are powered 
by diesel electric engines, as a lesser marine species. But Roland Benoit of 
Thibodaux, the section boss in Mill Building No. 2 where the American Queen is 
taking form, is "grateful so many of my Cajun buddies got their jobs back in 
yards up and down U.S. 90 after being laid off when the oil industry went bust 
in 1982." 
</P>
<P>
 Managing Editor Ted McManus of the Morgan City Daily Review credits riverboat 
building with "stabilizing our economy. When the bottom fell out of the oil 
business, even the shrimp boats were tied up three deep along Front Street. 
Unemployment was in the 12% to 13% range. Now it's down below 7%." 
</P>
<P>
 In Louisiana shipyards alone, Hairston figures, "there are now roughly 5,000 
people working directly on riverboats. That's not counting the steel, 
furnishings and gambling equipment made elsewhere. All that fancy fretwork and 
gingerbread trim is fabricated in fireproof metals at the mill by 
computer-controlled cutting heads. We develop our designs from pictures of 
famous boats like the Eclipse, the Robert E. Lee and the Mary Houston and feed 
them onto computer tapes." 
</P>
<P>
 "From the Texas border to Mobile," he added, "this part of the Gulf Coast is 
the biggest shipbuilding area in the country, accounting for something like 80% 
of all output. Of course that doesn't approach the build-up in World War II, 
when Higgins shipyard in New Orleans employed 28,000 and turned out on an 
average two PT boats a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Four-striper Johnny Doyle, enthroned on the tall pilot's chair in the 
riverboat Star Casino on Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans, observes that "it's 
hard to find a yard anywhere about that's not building a riverboat." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle finds himself in the unusual position of having at his fingertips sonar, 
radar, bow thrusters and all the latest navigation devices, along with a full 
crew of mates, engineers, oilers and able-bodied seamen aboard a brand-new boat 
that hasn't gone anywhere in the last couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks after she was delivered in late October from the Bender shipyard 
in nearby Braithewaite, the "biggest vessel this lake has ever seen," as Doyle 
calls her, suddenly halted her paddle wheel but kept the roulette wheels 
spinning. Divers had located a large obstruction on the lake bottom that sonar 
failed to detect. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-gambling forces in Louisiana charged that the Star Casino's operators 
were deliberately trying to circumvent state laws requiring her to cruise every 
three hours. It was pointed out that Twain at the wheel of the City of Memphis 
more than a century ago was able to navigate around hidden reefs, invisible 
stumps, creeping sandbars, sunken wrecks, floating islands and "sawyers," 
submerged trees that bobbed up, with the technical aid of only a wheel, a 
whistle, a speaking tube "to cuss out the engineer" and the sounder's tremolo 
call of "no-o-o bottom" or "mark twain" (two fathoms) as he heaved a lead 
weight on a line to gauge the river's depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacle down under turned out to be sunken treasure for the tax 
collector. In its first month of operation, the casino handed over checks for 
$1 million to the state and $250,000 each to the city and district levee board 
in taxes and boarding fees. But even while docked, the Star must periodically 
hustle the 1,200 gambling patrons out on deck in life jackets to meet Coast 
Guard abandon-ship regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the outside, she's pure riverboat, on the inside pure Las Vegas," said 
chief operating officer Keith Wallace. At night, the boat's magenta and gold 
neon lights can be seen for miles along the lakefront. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Lawrence Keeton, the leathery-faced master of the Mississippi Queen, 
growls that the garishly lighted gambling boats "have destroyed the charm and 
quiet of the river at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Below Memphis, you used to cruise past dark stretches of woods and clumps of 
tall trees along both banks. Now along that peaceful stretch, the sky is 
stabbed with arc lights like a Hollywood premiere and the banks glow like a 
little city with those neon lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeton further complains that the Mississippi Queen, which has no gaming 
aboard "except for that never-ending bridge game in the card room," lost her 
"landing place at Natchez and had to move to the Louisiana side of the river to 
make way for the gambling boats. At Vicksburg we were pushed farther up river." 
</P>
<P>
 The riverboat operators sent steamboat traditionalists farther round the bend 
by dispatching free buses to pick up passengers who otherwise might have 
browsed through the antebellum mansions. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, where the law doesn't require the dockside 
gambling facilities even to resemble riverboats, huge boxlike casinos on barges 
-- the largest longer than two football fields -- along with a pair of 
riverboats have elbowed out the shrimp fleet from prime beach locations. 
</P>
<P>
 All casino boats must be seaworthy enough to be pushed by tugs to a safe 
harbor if a hurricane approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Hurricane Andrew hit," recalls advertising manager Cathey Riemann of the 
President Casino, an authentic riverboat built at the LeeVac yard in Jennings, 
La., "we had trouble coaxing the patrons away from the slot machines so we 
could hurry the boat from Biloxi into a backwater of the Intercoastal Canal." 
</P>
<P>
 The romance of building 19th-Century riverboats enthralls shipyard workers 
accustomed to turning out oil rigs, service craft and double-skinned oil 
tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's the most fun they've had in years," said Service Marine's 
Hairston. "On their days off they bring the kids down to the yard for a picnic 
near the boat. On vacation they drive up to St. Louis and Joliet so they can 
tell the other tourists they hung the paddle wheel on that there boat." 
</P>
<P>
 In the peak steamboat era just after the Civil War, when 3,000 riverboats 
annually called at St. Louis, the faster, more maneuverable side-wheelers far 
outnumbered stern-wheelers. Now the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paddle wheels on each side take away space from gaming positions," Hairston 
said. "Even those starboard side windows you see on the Shreveport Rose aren't 
real. They're assembled from a fiberglass kit. The owners don't want patrons 
distracted from the slot machines or blackjack tables by the scenery." 
</P>
<P>
 That's authentic Americana. In Twain's era, passengers often couldn't see the 
river for the cotton bales piled as high as the top Texas deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditions have not been scheduled yet for a virtuoso on the world's biggest 
calliope now under construction for the American Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good calliope player is harder to find than a good pilot," Capt. Bill Menke 
of the Golden Rod told river historian Ben Lucien Burman. "You need the fingers 
of a blacksmith to handle the steam pressure on that keyboard. And you must 
never play 'Home Sweet Home,' which according to river superstition brings 
worse luck than having a gray mare and a preacher on board." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the greats at pumping out "real river music," Menke cited Crazy Frank 
Dumaine, Nelly Donnigan and band leader Fate Marabel on the Dixie Belle who in 
1919 recruited teen-age trumpeter Louis Armstrong to make the run up to St. 
Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the bagpipe, the calliope is not everyone's cup of culture. What has been 
called "an aggravation of eight to 40 steam whistles" can be heard 10 to 12 
miles away. Inventor J. C. Stoddard of Worcester, Mass., received the first 
patent "for an apparatus producing music by steam" on Oct. 9, 1855. Before the 
year was out Worcester passed an ordinance banning calliope playing within 
municipal limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I've heard enough," confessed Capt. Keeton on the Mississippi Queen, "I 
got a switch up in the pilot house that cuts the infernal thing off. I can 
always claim it drowns out communication with the pilot on the walkie-talkie." 
</P>
<P>
 Even steamboat purists sometimes have impure thoughts.

WHITE OFFICER WINS $200,000 IN FAILURE TO GAIN PROMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury has awarded a police officer $200,000, ruling that the city 
refused to promote him because he is white. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had argued that Officer Joseph Paskvan was denied promotion to 
sergeant in 1988 because he displayed questionable judgment. He shot nine 
people, all minorities, during his first 12 years on the force. Two of them 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Paskvan contended he wasn't promoted because of his race. He scored third on 
the sergeant's exam, and was the only one of the top 50 test-takers not 
promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer said he would ask a federal judge to order the city to promote Paskvan.

HIDDEN OLD-GROWTH FOREST IN GEORGIA PROVIDES INTRIGUING GLIMPSE OF 16TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT MINOR, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The secret preserve that contains some of the Southeast's last remaining 
old-growth forest is silent except for the occasional twittering of birds and 
the rustling of wind through gnarled pine boughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the Wade Tract, the 200-acre forest is one of only a handful of sites 
in the Southeast that has remained virtually unchanged since at least the early 
1500s, when Spaniard Hernando DeSoto explored the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this site and perhaps two or three others that begin to approach it 
in quality, we have no way to assess how far our managed lands have diverted" 
from their natural state, said Sharon Hermann, a plant biologist at the Tall 
Timbers Research Station, which manages the preserve. "This is the site that 
probably comes closest to approximating what DeSoto saw." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wade Tract has about 400 plant species, including wiregrass, small oaks 
and 350-year-old longleaf pine trees. It is a home for about 60 species of 
mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds, including quail and endangered red 
cockaded woodpeckers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists from Tall Timbers, a privately funded research group near 
Tallahassee, Fla., are learning about the plants and animals that lived in 
old-growth forests. They also are studying the effects of forest fires, an 
essential element of the ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge gained at the preserve could be used to restore public and private 
lands to a more natural state and to create future land-management guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 When Europeans began colonizing North America in the 1600s, there were an 
estimated 60 million to 70 million acres of longleaf pines in the coastal 
plain, which stretches from the Carolinas to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, because of logging, farming and urbanization, only about 2,000 acres 
of old growth -- about three square miles -- survive, said Todd Engstrom, a 
Tall Timbers ornithologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the most endangered ecosystems in the Southeastern United 
States," Engstrom said. "This is one of the few places where it is still in a 
relatively natural state and we can study it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tract is located near Thomasville, a southwest Georgia town surrounded by 
plantations. Many of the private estates are quail-hunting preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact location of the Wade Tract is a closely guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 150 people visit the site a year, most of whom are scientists or 
forest managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall Timbers is essentially a prairie with wiregrass and pines. It needs 
periodic fires to keep the turkey oak and runner oak from turning it into a 
hardwood forest, said Leonard Brennan, Tall Timbers' research director. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees are randomly spaced on the hilly land with lots of sunny, open 
spaces for grasses, flowers and wild legumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the pines, many about 80 feet tall and three feet in diameter at the 
trunk, have red-heart disease, a fungal disease that softens the heartwood. Red 
cockaded woodpeckers need such trees to bore their cavities and make nests. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest fires can occur naturally from lightning, but fires are not left to 
chance at the tract. Portions are set ablaze every May and June to mimic 
natural conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall Timbers has a 99-year agreement with the owner, a New England attorney, 
to keep the preserve in a natural state. Researchers cannot move downed trees 
or remove plants for study. The agreement began in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to develop a forest-management plan that can be used in state and 
national forests and in wildlife refuges. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Wade Tract's 13,000 longleaf pines, including seedlings, are marked 
with metal tags and their coordinates are plotted on a map. All other plants 
with stems larger than 1 1/2 inches are also plotted on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to know, and what the Wade Tract provides better than just about 
any other place, is how the forest changes over time and how the species 
interact with each other and with fire," Hermann said. "The Wade Tract has not 
only the old trees, but also the ground cover and the timing of the fire."

BASEBALL; WARD'S INJURY MAY END UP HELPING BLUE JAYS THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER SCHMUCK, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toronto Blue Jays Manager Cito Gaston may be forced to start the season with 
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre as his closer. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. The shoulder soreness that has sidelined closer Duane Ward this 
spring may force the Blue Jays to rearrange their pitching staff and use their 
fourth starter as the closer for the first few weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be almost impossible for (Ward) to be ready," Gaston said last week. 
"I can't rule it out completely, but I'm certainly not counting on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward is scheduled to start throwing -- not pitching, just throwing -- on 
Wednesday, so it looks like the Blue Jays will need a fill-in for at least the 
first two or three weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the Stottlemyre scenario viable, however, the Blue Jays are going to 
have to make good on their attempt to add another front-line starting pitcher. 
General manager Pat Gillick has confirmed that the club is making a run at New 
York Mets starter Bret Saberhagen, and there also is interest in the Houston 
Astros' Greg Swindell and Pete Harnisch, and the Minnesota Twins' Kevin Tapani. 
</P>
<P>
 Other American League East contenders would figure to benefit from the switch 
in the short term. Who wouldn't prefer to face Stottlemyre over one of the most 
feared relievers in the game? But the long-term impact might not be so 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury to Ward actually could deal a serious blow to the Orioles' chances 
of overtaking the Blue Jays this year, since it may force a previously 
reluctant Gillick to give up the young talent necessary to upgrade the starting 
rotation. Ward eventually will return to the closer role and the Blue Jays will 
be a much stronger team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles might be better off wishing Ward a speedy recovery and taking on 
the Blue Jays as configured. 
</P>
<P>
 Stottlemyre has resisted previous suggestions that he might be a more 
effective major-league pitcher working out of the bullpen, but Gaston claims 
that the 28-year-old right-hander is ready and willing to move into short 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Todd can do it," Gaston said. "He's a team player. I talked with him 
about it on the golf course and he said he's OK with it. It's the kind of job 
you have to want to do. If you don't accept it, it won't get done right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dodgers import Chan Ho Park, the South Korean pitcher who received $1.2 
million to play American baseball, was impressive in his exhibition debut 
against the New York Mets last week, but it was his unusual on-field behavior 
that made him the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Before stepping to the plate for his first at-bat, he honored Korean baseball 
tradition by bowing respectfully to the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty hot day today and the umpires are working hard for the 
players," Park said through his interpreter. "We are taught in Korea to respect 
the elders. I was thanking him for all his effort and for being there for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Park is fast becoming a media event, in much the same way that a 20-year-old 
phenom named Fernando Valenzuela arrived on the scene in 1980 -- endearing 
innocence, interpreter and all. The Dodgers can only wish him the same kind of 
success that made Valenzuela a household word. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there is the perception that submariner Todd Frohwirth and newly acquired 
sidearmer Mark Eichhorn are in competition for a place in the Orioles' bullpen, 
it hasn't kept them from becoming pretty good friends. Eichhorn even took time 
recently to help Frohwirth work through some mechanical problems on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how it is up here (in the major leagues)," Frohwirth said. "When I 
came up with the Phillies, Kent Tekulve always talked to me and helped me. And 
if anybody needs help from me -- if there is anyone out there who thinks I am 
knowledgeable -- I'll help them." 
</P>
<P>
 The competition factor is there, but Frohwirth said it isn't a major factor 
because both pitchers know that they will be in the major leagues this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we're against each other," Frohwirth said. "We want each other 
to do well. If we end up on the same team, that's up to the Orioles. If we 
don't end up on the same team, I think we'll end up in the major leagues 
somewhere, because we are both major-league pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
 There are definite similarities between Eichhorn and Frohwirth, right down to 
their identical 2.99 career ERAs, but they agree that their pitching styles are 
not nearly as comparable as most people think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we're completely different," Frohwirth said. "He comes over the 
ball, I'm behind the ball. He stands on the right side of the rubber, I'm left. 
His slider goes down. Mine goes up. There is definitely a contrast. I don't 
know what's going to happen, but I think it would be better to keep both of us 
if you're going with six pitchers." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros knows the value of a good education. He was 
nine classes short of his bachelors degree in economics when he left UCLA in 
1988 to sign with the Dodgers, but kept at it each winter until he earned his 
degree this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing like a diploma to increase your earning potential. Karros recently 
signed a three-year contract worth $6.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I graduated from UCLA and got the biggest raise of my life," he said. 
"Really, I got the raise for graduating from Lasorda University." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Oakland Athletics were hoping to take advantage of realignment to 
return to respectability in the four-team American League West, they were dealt 
a serious blow last week when first baseman Mark McGwire went down with a 
severe back strain. 
</P>
<P>
 McGwire, who played in only 27 games last year because of a heel injury, had 
come to camp in great shape, but now figures to need the rest of spring 
training just to get back up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's had hoped that his return to health, coupled with the re-acquisition 
of Rickey Henderson, would make it possible for them to get back in contention. 
That's still possible, since there is no overpowering team in the American 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Rangers general manager Tom Grieve went out on a limb last week and 
promised that his team would win the American League West title, but don't make 
any postseason reservations just yet. The Rangers have the best talent in the 
division, but they also have two key players -- Will Clark and Jose Canseco -- 
who could run into physical problems and leave the club running second or third 
against a mediocre field. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieve isn't prone to making rash predictions, but he may have little to lose 
with this one. For the front office that made the Canseco trade and the 
Clark/Rafael Palmeiro switch, this could be a must-win situation anyway.

 As Securities and Exchange Commission chairman in the late 1980s, David S. 
Ruder demanded tougher laws and harsh penalties for penny stock brokers who 
fleeced small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 So a few jaws dropped at the SEC when Ruder -- now a part-time law professor 
and a partner in Chicago's Baker & McKenzie law firm -- disclosed last year 
that he had a new client: Chatfield Dean, reputedly one of the nation's biggest 
penny stock firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The top executives of the Englewood, Colo., company had learned their trade at 
the most notorious penny stock brokerage of all, the now-defunct Blinder 
Robinson. At Chatfield Dean, they were accused of letting the firm manipulate 
share prices of the low-cost, little-supervised securities, and of allowing it 
to overcharge customers by as much as 180% above the true market price for 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that the firm had turned over a new leaf, Ruder negotiated settlements 
this winter with the SEC and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. The 
agreements imposed relatively mild penalties -- penalties that allow Chatfield 
Dean to remain in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the concept of rehabilitation for people," Ruder explained. "I 
thought, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to go from being a leader in knocking out 
penny stock firms and now be a leader in producing a firm that was honest and 
reliable?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In representing the kinds of firms he once helped prosecute, Ruder is by no 
means alone. Life is lucrative these days for Wall Street's former top cops 
who, following a time-honored path, often come to represent the firms they once 
probed. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal prosecutors, SEC lawyers and other regulators who just a few years 
ago seemed on a moral crusade against lawless greed nearly all have left 
government for private practice, where they represent alleged inside traders, 
accused crooks and large brokerage firms charged with cheating thousands of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "So many of my friends had gone before me," said John Carroll, who led the 
federal prosecution of Michael Milken. Carroll is now a partner at New York's 
Rogers & Wells, where his clients include a Prudential Securities executive who 
is a potential target of a federal criminal investigation, as well as other 
individuals and companies under investigation by the Justice Department and the 
SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (my friends) said, 'We're happy doing what one does on this side,' " 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolving door between government and the regulated is hardly new. 
Colonels and commanders leave the military to join defense firms. Members of 
Congress become Washington lobbyists. Law school graduates traditionally have 
spent a few years as prosecutors to gain the experience needed to become highly 
paid defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the recent wave of brokerage scandals -- from the Salomon Bros. 
Treasury bond debacle to Prudential to a rash of penny stock cases -- never 
before has there been such heavy demand from securities firms for legal 
representation by former top regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Prudential. The firm has faced numerous civil and criminal 
investigations as well as massive civil lawsuits as a result of its failed 
limited partnerships, which raised $8 billion from investors in the 1980s. To 
try to minimize the damage to the firm, it hired a list of lawyers that reads 
like a Who's Who of former top regulators: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gary Lynch, the SEC enforcement chief from 1985 to 1989, negotiated for 
Prudential a recent settlement of fraud charges with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 * Helping him was Arthur F. Mathews, another former senior SEC enforcement 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Until recently, Prudential's lead defense lawyer in the pending federal 
criminal investigation was Robert B. Fiske Jr., formerly the U.S. attorney in 
Manhattan. While Fiske serves as the special counsel in the inquiry into 
President Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater affair, another partner in 
his firm -- Scott Muller, a onetime assistant U.S. attorney in New York -- has 
taken his place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudential also hired former state securities commissioners, including F. 
Daniel Bell III of North Carolina, to negotiate its settlements with individual 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 John P. Murray, a Prudential Securities executive vice president, makes no 
secret of the fact that the brokerage chose former regulators as its lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you want is people with expertise in a particular area," Murray said. 
"If you have people like Gary (Lynch) who are familiar with how the SEC works 
and the kinds of expectations the SEC has on certain issues, that's really an 
asset." 
</P>
<P>
 When regulators step down, federal ethics rules ban them for one year from 
representing clients before their former agencies. Also, they usually may not 
represent clients in the specific cases they handled for the government. Other 
than those limitations, ethics rules impose few restrictions on former 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 While ex-regulators may be complying strictly with the canons of ethics, 
several of the nation's leading legal ethics experts say the stampede to 
white-collar defense work raises questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Are Wall Street malefactors who prey on small investors getting off easy 
because they are able to tap into the old boys' network of the regulatory 
establishment? Does zealous representation by some former regulators enable 
dishonest firms to remain in business as they continue defrauding investors? Do 
some former regulators in effect sell government secrets? 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows the answers for certain; everyone involved insists his or her 
integrity is intact, adding that the American legal system works best with 
vigorous, experienced advocates on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a book on legal ethics, Hofstra University law professor Monroe H. 
Freedman notes that because of the revolving door, "the federal regulators and 
the law firms that battle them are, to a great extent, the same people." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman, in an interview, said this leads to favored treatment for companies 
that hire prestigious government alumni. They also gain access to privileged 
information -- knowledge of case files, for instance, and of the circumstances 
under which an agency is likely to bring suit or settle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts a premium on putting up for private sale to a particular law firm or 
client what should either be confidential information or should be available to 
the public generally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all regulators who leave for private practice go into corporate and 
other white-collar defense work; in interviews, six recent alumni of the SEC or 
U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan could not name a single former regulator 
who hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction is obvious. An SEC staff lawyer in Washington with a decade of 
experience earns about $70,000 a year, according to an SEC spokesman. Profits 
per partner at the country's top 50 law firms ranged from $370,000 to $1.4 
million, according to a 1993 survey by the American Lawyer newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers -- not least the former regulators themselves -- argue that this 
is a blessing, not an evil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe 100% in the revolving door," said Ira Lee Sorkin, who has been 
through it several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in private practice in Manhattan, Sorkin has been vigorously defending 
Stratton Oakmont, a Long Island penny stock firm charged with making wildly 
false claims about the small companies whose stock it brought to market and 
with manipulating the stocks' prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 23 years, Sorkin has moved in and out of federal government 
service -- working as an SEC enforcement lawyer and deputy chief of the U.S. 
attorney's criminal division in Manhattan, then going into private practice for 
some years before returning to government service from 1984-86 as the SEC's New 
York regional administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorkin and others argue that service on both sides gives lawyers vital 
perspective: It keeps prosecutors from being overzealous and provides defense 
lawyers with insight into the tactics and thinking of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want somebody to do after serving their country for 15 years?" 
asks Philip A. Feigin, Colorado's securities commissioner. "Become a divorce 
lawyer?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As SEC enforcement chief in the late 1980s, Gary Lynch was to Wall Street what 
Wyatt Earp was to Dodge City. Spearheading an assault on the decade of greed, 
he brought the SEC's successful cases against Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky and 
Dennis Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch then joined the prestigious New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. 
Last fall, he battled for lenient treatment for client Prudential, negotiating 
directly with his former employees at the SEC -- including the man he endorsed 
as his successor as enforcement chief, William McLucas. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, Lynch sidestepped a conflict of interest. As enforcement chief in 
1986, he had brought a case against Prudential Securities, then called 
Prudential-Bache. Without admitting or denying guilt, the firm settled SEC 
charges that it had systematically failed to monitor compliance with securities 
regulations and had taken no action against a group of brokers and branch 
managers who defrauded investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new charges filed last October, the SEC accused Prudential of 
repeatedly violating that settlement. The SEC also charged that Prudential 
knowingly defrauded hundreds of thousands of mainly elderly investors by making 
false claims about the safety of limited partnership investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Lynch would have been barred from representing Prudential in the 
case. But he steered clear of the prohibition on former regulators switching 
sides in specific cases by representing Prudential only on the charges 
involving the limited partnerships. When supervision issues arose in the 
settlement talks, McLucas said, Lynch left the room. Negotiations on those 
alleged violations were handled by Arthur Mathews, a partner with Washington's 
Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, who was a senior SEC enforcement lawyer until 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch declined to be interviewed about his switch to corporate defense or his 
representation of Prudential. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement read over the phone, he said, "I appear before the SEC on 
numerous matters on behalf of numerous clients, and Prudential is one of those 
clients." His work for Prudential, he said, complies with all laws and ethics 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any suggestion to the contrary could only be made by someone who doesn't know 
what he or she is talking about," Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, McLucas said, "If anyone thinks they can buy favorable treatment 
or influence a prosecutorial recommendation of this division, then they don't 
understand how this division operates." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he contends that agency lawyers often fight harder against former SEC 
luminaries. "It's almost like playing tennis," McLucas said. "When people come 
in who you know are good lawyers and are competent, sometimes it raises your 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement Lynch and Mathews negotiated for Prudential was costly. The 
firm must pay a minimum of $371 million in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is substantially less than many state securities regulators and 
investors' lawyers had sought. Investor organizations and many investors' 
lawyers have sharply criticized the settlement, because the penalties are 
smaller than those imposed on Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk bond chief 
Milken in cases in which there were far fewer easily identifiable victims. 
</P>
<P>
 They object, too, that it requires customers to submit proof that they were 
misled by individual Prudential brokers or sales material even after the SEC 
itself concluded there was systemic fraud in the partnership program. The 
settlement provides no punitive damages or attorney fees and is structured so 
that most of it will be tax-deductible for Prudential. 
</P>
<P>
 No one connected with the case has said there is any evidence that Lynch's 
former position with the SEC made a significant difference in the settlement 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But SEC sources and state regulators confirm that the SEC agreed to settle 
well before completing a detailed investigation of the brokerage's mammoth 
limited partnership business. The SEC began looking earnestly into that aspect 
late in the case -- only after extensive publicity about the alleged fraud and 
after state regulators were well into their own probes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This, some state regulators say, is exactly where influence by respected 
former colleagues often plays a role: Overburdened, they make key prosecutorial 
decisions without thorough investigation, relying on the assessment of defense 
lawyers whom the regulators trust. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say this is simply relying on the ex-regulators' credibility. 
But the line between credibility and influence can be hard to distinguish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the staff or the resources -- and I don't think the SEC or the 
NASD or any state has the resources -- to investigate every case that exists 
out there," said John R. Perkins, Missouri's securities commissioner. When an 
ex-colleague-turned-defense-lawyer offers his assurance, Perkins adds, "you 
have a higher level of comfort with what you're being told." 
</P>
<P>
 While few lawyers or ethics experts advocate banning regulators from 
white-collar defense work, many say lawyers ought to weigh the moral 
considerations when they select their clients and the kinds of cases to which 
they devote their professional lives. Even many white-collar defense lawyers 
say they personally would not want to represent a brokerage firm that is 
continuing to commit major fraud, partly out of worry that their vigorous 
representation -- the essence of being a good lawyer -- would enable the firm 
to go on harming investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have a hard time representing people who committed crimes for a 
living," said Bruce Baird, who headed the U.S. attorney's securities fraud unit 
in Manhattan during much of the Drexel and Milken investigations. Baird is now 
a defense lawyer with Covington & Burling in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawyers say they have no qualms at all about such representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, for example, represented Meyer Blinder, head of Blinder Robinson, 
which from 1983 to 1990 fended off move after move by the SEC to shut it down. 
Regulators had accused the firm of duping investors who bought stocks it had 
underwritten. It was also accused of stock price manipulation and deception. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews fought intensely, inventing novel legal strategies that were widely 
credited with allowing Blinder Robinson to continue operating for years. Among 
them: an attempt -- ultimately unsuccessful -- to convince the courts that the 
SEC's enforcement power was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after private lawsuits and other developments forced the firm into 
bankruptcy -- and after Meyer Blinder was indicted on criminal charges -- did 
Blinder Robinson go out of business. (Blinder himself was later convicted.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a tremendous threat to the liberty of our society and our 
citizens if people start to say defense counsel aren't entitled to vigorously 
defend someone," Mathews said. "Unless you have your best professionals keeping 
the government honest in every aspect of litigation and prosecution, then you 
end up having a government of totalitarian leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 As with Blinder Robinson, it had been widely expected that regulators would 
try to shut down Chatfield Dean, or at least permanently ban its principals 
from the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatfield had acquired the branches of another penny stock brokerage, Stuart 
James -- characterized by investigators as "boiler rooms" that used 
high-pressure telephone sales tactics to victimize investors -- and it occupied 
Blinder's old headquarters in Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm had been the subject of two disciplinary proceedings by the NASD in 
1991, as well as multiple actions by state regulators. Principals Sanford D. 
Greenberg and Robert L. Lemon had worked for years at Blinder, where Greenberg 
had been censured by the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
 In charges filed last December, the NASD said Chatfield Dean had overcharged 
customers for stocks, manipulated stock prices and failed to promptly execute 
customers' orders. The SEC filed similar charges last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ruder saved the day, pressing Chatfield's defense that it was no longer a 
penny stock firm and instead had become a mainstream brokerage focused on 
selling mutual funds and other securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD and SEC settlements included fines and restitution payments totaling 
$3.3 million, along with six-month suspensions for Greenberg and Lemon -- with 
each taking turns being suspended so the firm can continue operating. 
</P>
<P>
 A condition of the NASD settlement was that Chatfield continue to employ Ruder 
and his law firm to monitor compliance -- in effect guaranteeing Ruder a client 
for at least the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Assisting him is a Baker & McKenzie partner in Washington -- Daniel Goelzer, a 
former SEC general counsel. FIVE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID RUDER: As Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, called for a 
crackdown on penny stock brokerages. As a private lawyer, negotiated 
settlements this winter imposing mild penalties on penny stock firm Chatfield 
Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 GARY LYNCH: Was the SEC's tough enforcement director in the late 1980's, 
heading probe of Michael Milken. In private practice, negotiated Prudential 
Securities' settlement with the SEC and states over misconduct in sales of 
limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT B. FISKE, JR.: Prosecuted securities scofflaws as U.S. attorney iN 
Manhattan. As a private lawyer, headed Prudential's defense team in a pending 
federal criminal investigation. Now serving as special counsel probing the 
Clintons' conduct in the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 IRA LEE SORKIN: In and out of government service through the years, was the 
SEC's regional administrator in Manhattan in the mid-80's. Again in private 
practice is defending Stratton Oakmont, a Long Island, N.Y., penny stock firm 
charged with stock manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 ARTHUR F. MATHEWS: A senior SEC enforcement official in the 1960's, now a 
prominent Washinton lawyer. Helped Lynch negotiate Prudential settlement and 
represented Meyer Blinder, head of Blinder Robinson, a penny stock firm forced 
out of business by prosecutors' persistence.

BUSINESS PULSE / JOHN BRENNAN; EARTHQUAKE AWAKENS SOME EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BRENNAN, JOHN BRENNAN is director of The Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now we're all too familiar with the psychological and economic havoc 
wrought by January's earthquake. So it's nice to find the occasional piece of 
good news in the wake of the disaster. There's just such a bright spot, 
unearthed by a Times Poll of Los Angeles County conducted the week after the 
big shaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey chronicled the physical and emotional losses suffered by a wide 
range of county residents, but the message wasn't all bad. Amid mostly dismal 
findings, 10% of those responding to the poll said that because of the quake, 
they actually expected to see their family's financial status improve in the 
months to come. Even among those living close to the quake's epicenter, one out 
of 11 said they would be better off. 
</P>
<P>
 That 10% may seem like just a tiny sliver of the pie, but as a proportion of 
all adults in the county, it represents more than 600,000 people. That's 
equivalent to the population of one of the smaller states. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts differ as to the quake's long-term economic effects on the Los Angeles 
area, struggling as it is to emerge from a deep recession. Some see the event 
as a relatively isolated -- even positive -- event; others feel it will have a 
broader, negative impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the quake represents "a net depletion of wealth," said Leslie 
Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics at the California 
Assn. of Realtors. The Times Poll supports that assessment: 23% of those polled 
anticipated financial hardship -- more than twice the percentage who expected 
to gain. Still, said Appleton-Young, "this is not going to derail the recovery. 
It may put it on hold for a quarter or two." 
</P>
<P>
 And, for those roughly 600,000 people represented in the poll, one of 
America's worst natural disasters already seems to have been a blessing in 
disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are the quake beneficiaries? 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows they tend to be younger, middle-income types from all parts of 
the county and of various racial and ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're busier than a bird dog in a brier patch," said Greg Stevens of Long 
Beach, one of a number of poll respondents who agreed to discuss his financial 
position in a follow-up interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, who repairs large commercial doors for Action Door Repair of 
Huntington Park, says he hasn't had time to rest since the quake struck on Jan. 
17. Among his customers are big grocery stores, dance clubs and hospitals, 
which rely for security on the massive, mechanically complex portals he knows 
how to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve, a general contractor from North Hollywood who asked that his last name 
not be used, says he moved from Santa Barbara two years ago "for love." The 
love didn't work out, but the temblor has brought him more work than he can 
handle. He sensed that business was getting better even before the quake, but 
says he has bid on more jobs in the last month than in the previous six. 
</P>
<P>
 Another building tradesman, Greg Baxter of Kagel Canyon, says his customized 
contracting business was prospering before the quake but that the work 
generated by the disaster has been a godsend to many of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contracting in general was dying," said Baxter. Now "there are an insane 
amount of people wanting prices for this and that." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bloch of Van Nuys is a salesman at Levitz furniture in Glendale. The 
firm's Northridge outlet was damaged, but Bloch said business at the Glendale 
store has been excellent as people begin replacing furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three weeks after the quake, it started," Bloch said. "The insurance money 
started coming in, and people are starting to put their lives back in order." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic 
Development Corp., the rebuilding effort could eventually generate 10,000 new 
construction jobs, along with nearly 20,000 positions in the engineering and 
furniture industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Do those benefiting feel at all guilty about post-quake success? 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, yes," said Melinda Teixeira, 20, of La Canada, whose stepfather's 
janitorial business was bolstered by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help but feel a little guilty," added Steve, the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bloch disagreed. Asked if he felt sheepish, he said: "Not at all. It's 
something that happened, and that's the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 He may have other reasons for not feeling any guilt. Despite financial good 
fortune, the poll found, the economic beneficiaries of the quake by no means 
escaped its wrath. Two in five of those economically better off still reported 
at least minor damage to their homes; about the same proportion said they 
suffered psychological trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bloch: "I may be doing a little bit better financially, but emotionally 
-- that's a different story."

EXPANDING POTENTIAL FOR CHAOS; MULTIMEDIA: THE COSTA MESA FIRM, RECENTLY SOLD 
TO A SOFTWARE MAKER, WILL BE ABLE TO PUBLISH ITS OWN VIDEO GAMES AND TAP INTO A 
LARGER DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Orange County millionaires go, Allen Adham and Michael Morhaime are mere 
youngsters. In another circle, the two entrepreneurs are elder statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Adham, 27, and Morhaime, 26, sold their video game development company, Chaos 
Studios Inc., for $6.75 million two weeks ago. Chaos -- now a subsidiary of 
Davidson & Associates, a Torrance-based educational software maker -- has a 
crew of 19 "cool nerds" whose average age is 24 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The mind-set at Chaos is just as young. The company is attuned to Generation 
X, the game-obsessed descendants of the baby boomers. That is how little-known 
Chaos caught the attention of the bigger company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in our company is really passionate about video games," said Adham, 
who did not begin taking a salary -- or a vacation -- until last year. "We are 
all fanatic game players. We are the target market, and that gives us an 
advantage in knowing what is going to sell. I watch cartoons Saturday morning . 
. . because I like them, not just for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 It took only three years for college buddies Adham and Morhaime to turn their 
fanaticism into a multimillion-dollar windfall. Fearful of outgrowing their 
creativity, they went for the deal because they were promised independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also gives both companies more clout in the fast-changing 
multimedia industry, where alliances are announced almost every day as movie 
studios, game publishers and others jockey to build the next creative 
juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real smart move for Davidson to move from education into entertainment 
software," said Michael Wallace, an analyst at investment bank UBS Securities 
in New York. "They bought talent, and the price they paid is a sign of the 
potential. From the Chaos view, they can do their own projects now and get a 
much larger company to distribute them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chaos' roots are in Orange County's video game development network, which is 
much like the network of subcontractors in Southern California that grew up 
around large defense companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of video game publishers known as licensees -- among them are Sunsoft 
Inc. in Cypress, Virgin Interactive Entertainment in Irvine and Interplay 
Productions Inc., also in Irvine -- have emerged in the past five years as 
leading independent game producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those companies, which produce and sell games for the Sega of America and 
Nintendo systems, in turn subcontract much of their development work to another 
tier of players, the cottage industry known as software developers.  
</P>
<P>
 Adham broke into the industry a decade ago by starting at the bottom as a 
programmer working as an independent contractor. He made good money from those 
summer jobs during his high school and college years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the good old days when one or two people could design a game 
themselves," he said. "Back then it was easy. You just had to have the desire. 
It was like taking an idea and writing a book. Now it's more like making a 
movie, requiring seven to eight people with different skills." 
</P>
<P>
 On graduating from UCLA in December, 1990, with a computer science degree, 
Adham received $10,000 from his parents to go to Europe. He used the money 
instead to start a video game company, Silicon & Synapse -- the predecessor of 
Chaos. Morhaime, who also got seed money from his parents, joined Adham. 
Another friend, Frank Pearce, completed the founding trio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allen is a great sales guy," Morhaime said of Adham. "I was working at 
Western Digital designing a little part of a chip, and he did this sales job on 
me for a year to recruit me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1991, they started with contract work for Interplay Productions. 
Adham and his colleagues did technical work, converting Nintendo games to other 
formats such as the Commodore Amiga. They made about $250,000 in their first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're good guys," said Brian Fargo, president of Interplay, which has 150 
employees. "I've known Allen for 12 years, even before I started Interplay, and 
he has always had the right attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The game conversions paid bills and taught Chaos the inner workings of good 
games. The company began to do art, programming, sound and design. It then 
began creating games, including "Lost Vikings," sales of which topped 300,000 
units for Interplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Chaos has a staff of 19, most of them artists and programmers, working on 
11 projects. Adham himself is president as well as human resources manager, 
accountant, programmer and executive game producer.  
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest challenge for me is relinquishing control," Adham said. "I'm a 
perfectionist and a workaholic. I get that from my father, who has a doctorate 
in engineering. I get my street smarts from my mother," a trained entomologist 
who is now a preschool administrator.  
</P>
<P>
 Chaos shows its colors in its Costa Mesa offices. Comic super-heroes and 
fantasy monsters seem to spring from posters plastering the walls. Beards, blue 
jeans, T-shirts and long hair are so common that the place looks more like a 
college campus than a corporation. At lunchtime, the staff plays cards or 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The company game room features a large-screen, Nintendo-equipped television 
across from a candy vending machine. There is at least one computer or video 
game system on every desk. Morhaime has three computers in his office. Spending 
on toys isn't out of control, however: Adham, upon becoming a millionaire, went 
out and bought a Nissan Pathfinder instead of a sports car. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Adham and Morhaime, every employee does several jobs, so they are 
constantly challenged to learn new things. The artists, for example, take turns 
answering the phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the whole company to sit down once a week and brainstorm ideas," Adham 
said, "from a particular game project to the next great platform for the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 From such sessions emerge games like "BlackThorne," a brooding action game 
that combines anachronisms like monsters from medieval fantasy with science 
fiction weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chaos generated $750,000 in revenue from royalties on games that 
generated at least $20 million in sales for the publishing companies. As a 
publisher, Chaos hopes to generate 10 times the revenue it had before. 
</P>
<P>
 To get more recognition and access to better game properties, and to generate 
the much higher revenue associated with game publishing, Chaos sought out a big 
brother that would make it into a publisher itself. Davidson stood out among 
half a dozen suitors because it promised to let Chaos be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be a publisher with multiple development studios that do the 
creative work, sort of like a movie studio," said Robert Davidson, chief 
executive of Davidson & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Davidson, Chaos will add perhaps a dozen employees this year as part of 
an effort to launch more complicated, visually stunning games for the systems 
that will be coming out in the next year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very meticulous about whom we hire," Adham said. "You don't have to be 
young. It's the state of mind. We discriminate only on the basis of video game 
habits."

OPEN-TOE SEASON; MANUFACTURERS SCRAMBLE TO CASH IN ON SANDAL TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's midwinter, and another layer of snow has just fallen on frigid Buffalo, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Pecci, a Franciscan priest, is wearing sandals as he navigates the 
snowdrifts that ring St. Rita and St. Patrick churches. "With socks, sandals 
are warm enough to wear year-round," Pecci says. "Unless it's really cold rain, 
it doesn't matter. And I wear them in the winter as long as the snow is clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are rapidly discovering what the Franciscans have known for ages: 
Sandals can be four-season footwear, sturdy enough to go long distances over 
any terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest names in footwear are scrambling to capitalize on that 
fact. At least 20 manufacturers are now selling sport sandals, tough footwear 
that travels boldly where flimsy flip-flops would never dare to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Footwear manufacturers are pitching sandals as appropriate gear for everything 
from canoeing and sailing to hiking, jogging or simply knocking about. Annual 
U.S. sales of sport sandals, now about $125 million, are expected to hit $400 
million within a few years, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Birkenstock sandals, which reported 1993 sales of $60 million, are 
not considered sport sandals. Birkenstock maintains that its distinctive 
leather footwear is fine for hiking, but most manufacturers agree that the new 
sport sandals, with their synthetic materials, athletic designs and tougher 
soles, are more at home outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of sport sandals started to climb three years ago after 
Carpinteria-based Deckers Outdoor Corp. began to market its Teva Sandals line 
as an alternative to traditional outdoor footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandals strolled into the fashion spotlight just as America's longstanding 
love affair with sneakers was fading. Sales of regular athletic footwear 
declined by 2.4% in 1992, in large part because consumers were switching to 
shoes that are more at home outdoors than in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some market changes had to occur because people were looking for something 
new," says Nancy Larsen, spokeswoman for shoemaker Asics Tiger Corp. The 
company, based in Fountain Valley, sold 60,000 pairs of sport sandals in 1993, 
a 300% increase from 1992, when it entered the category. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outdoorsy look and the sandals craze are a natural progression as people 
look for something more to wear," Larsen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike, Asics and Adidas are counting on the fast-growing outdoor market -- 
which includes sandals -- to balance the sales slowdown in their main shoe 
lines. But they are facing stiff competition from Timberland and other 
entrenched makers of outdoor footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As manufacturers rush to meet changing consumer demands, the lines that 
separate footwear categories are blurring. 
</P>
<P>
 Asics, for example, has developed a high-performance tennis shoe that looks 
like a hiking boot. Shoe manufacturers are also readying "some interesting 
designs that mark the start of an interesting bridge between sandals and 
athletic shoes," Larsen says. 
</P>
<P>
 As established manufacturers and upstarts jockey for position, "everyone will 
come out with every kind of iteration on a shoe and sandal that anyone could 
conceive of," says Gary Jacobson, an analyst with the brokerage Kidder Peabody 
& Co. in New York. "This is just the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the nation's leading sport sandal company is already sticking its toes 
into the shoe market. Deckers this fall will introduce three new Teva models 
that will further blur the distinction: SandalHiker, SandalShoe and SandalBoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nike, Timberland and Rockport have been in the sandal business for (at least) 
three years, and we're still beating them in the marketplace," says Peter Link, 
Deckers vice president. "We're feeling pretty confident in our back yard, and 
now we're going after their back yard a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strong competition, Deckers has kept its dominance of the sandals 
market. The company reported 1993 revenue of $50 million, up from just $5.9 
million in 1990. It also made its first public stock offering last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Deckers' growth is driven by sales of the Teva sandal line, which Grand Canyon 
river guide Mark Thatcher designed to solve a pressing personal problem: what 
to wear on your feet while white-water rafting. Deckers acquired the right to 
manufacture Teva products in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The company controls about half the sport sandal market but is keeping a wary 
eye on Nike. "Everybody has to pay attention to Nike because of their strength, 
size and power," Deckers President Doug Otto said in a recent interview with 
Footwear Plus, a trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike bears watching. It did not introduce its first sport sandal until late 
1992 but has already logged $50 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The sandal market is booming for us," says Keith Peters, a spokesman at the 
company's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters. "Our Air Deshutz is the single 
largest-selling model, and we hope to overtake Teva next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Several footwear manufacturers have also introduced tough waterproof sandals 
that do double duty as boat shoes, giving sailors gripping power combined with 
the comfort of sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fashion rather than function explains some of the sandal boom. 
Designers in New York and Europe are incorporating a wide array of sandals -- 
many to be worn with socks -- in their 1994 lines. College students and the 
coffeehouse set are also wearing sandals, even in cold climates such as 
Buffalo's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're even selling them to kids who'd been wearing Doc Martens," Watson says. 
"We give them a heavy look with lug soles and a nice European-looking upper." 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Rettig, who sells Birkenstocks and other sandals at stores in Dana Point 
and San Juan Capistrano, says sales are being driven by "a generation now in 
its 30s that was raised in tennis shoes . . . and who find it very difficult to 
put on a dress shoe that cramps their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening to the sandal market is really amazing," says Margot Fraser, 
who has marketed German-made Birkenstock footwear for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things started to change two or three years ago, and sandals now have much 
more acceptance," says Fraser, president of Novato, Calif.-based Birkenstock 
Footprint Sandals Inc., whose 1993 sandal sales of $60 million were up from $50 
million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Particularly among men," Fraser says. "They're not afraid anymore to show 
their feet."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: CREDIT-REPORTING REFORM GOES ASTRAY IN 
BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For four years, Michelle Meier pushed for legislation to tighten the rules in 
the credit-reporting industry, which has been accused of ruining reputations by 
failing to correct false and misleading information in some consumer credit 
files. But when the House Banking Committee recently passed a bill designed to 
do just that, Meier reversed herself. She vowed to fight the bill rather than 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meier and Consumers Union, the powerful Washington consumer group that she 
represents, say the bill has changed so drastically as a result of lobbying by 
banking and credit groups that it's "worse than nothing." The bill passed the 
House Banking Committee earlier this month. Next it goes for a vote in the full 
House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of being an improvement, it is a major step backward," Meier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, getting this legislation -- called the Consumer Reporting Reform Act 
of 1994, or HR 1015 -- passed into law was previously one of Consumers Union's 
top priorities for 1994. And even Meier acknowledges that the measure would do 
some positive things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Namely, it would allow consumers to get one free copy of their credit report 
each year. Most credit bureaus charge about $8 to provide you with a copy of 
the report. TRW is the one exception. It gives consumers who request it one 
free copy of their credit report each year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've recently been turned down for credit because of negative information 
in your credit file, all credit-reporting companies are required to provide you 
with a free copy of their report. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, who occasionally use credit reports in hiring decisions, would not 
be able to order an applicant's credit history without getting the applicant's 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would also set a clear time frame for correcting credit-reporting 
errors. Current law says that inaccurate credit information must be 
reinvestigated and corrected in a "reasonable" period. The proposed law would 
require that corrections be made within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other ways, the bill would seriously undermine some current consumer 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, it would make it easier for direct marketers to obtain 
information from your credit file and use it to market their products and 
services. It would also preempt many state laws that are tougher on credit 
abuses, and it would bar states from passing new laws to tighten credit bureau 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse still, it would allow something called "affiliate sharing," in which big 
companies could compile and disseminate credit information on their customers 
to affiliated companies. However, these big companies, which would in effect 
turn themselves into mini credit bureaus, would be exempt from both the 
consumer-oriented provisions in the new law and the consumer protections 
currently provided through the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
</P>
<P>
 You currently have the right to get a copy of your credit report and correct 
any errors in it. If, after reinvestigation, the credit bureau maintains 
negative information in your file because it is believed to be accurate, you 
have the right to add up to a 100-word explanation to your credit report. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these rights apply to retailers in the Consumer Reporting Reform Act 
of 1994, even though the act specifically allows them greater abilities to 
compile and disseminate consumer credit information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that retailers are already setting up their own networks to 
share consumer credit information, and many believe this is the wave of the 
future. Some big companies such as Price Club and Toys R Us maintain consumer 
credit information in their computers. If a customer has bounced a check at one 
of these companies, for example, subsequent checks may be rejected at the cash 
register. 
</P>
<P>
 These systems have proved so effective that some retailers believe that big 
companies will have little need for traditional credit bureaus by the end of 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens now? Many believe the bill -- good parts and bad -- will die. The 
anti-consumer provisions in it were won by hard industry lobbying, but credit 
card issuers, credit bureaus and banks continue to fight the bill. Since it no 
longer has strong support from consumer groups, there is no force pushing it 
forward. How to Protect Your Credit Record 
</P>
<P>
 What should consumers do now that credit-reporting reform appears dead for 
now? Use the rights you have under current law to protect your credit record, 
says Michelle Meier of Consumers Union. Specifically: 
</P>
<P>
 * Check. Request a copy of your credit record at least every other year from 
one or all of the big credit-reporting companies -- TRW, Trans Union and 
Equifax. (They're listed in the Yellow Pages, usually under "credit.") Most 
will require that you request the report in writing, including your name, 
Social Security number, current and past addresses and some other form of 
identification. Many credit-reporting companies charge an $8 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Correct. A study by Consumers Union indicates that nearly half of all 
consumer credit reports have errors either because of merged files, incorrect 
Social Security numbers or confusion over similar names. About 20% of these 
errors are serious enough to damage the consumer's ability to borrow or gain 
employment, Consumers Union officials say. If your report has errors, correct 
them following the instructions on the report provided to you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Verify. When you send back the corrections, ask the company to provide you 
with a corrected copy of your report. If they haven't done so within a month, 
call them and ask about their progress. Be sure to keep copies of all written 
communication with the credit bureau and log dates, times and the gist of phone 
conversations. You may need the information later if the bureau fails to make 
necessary corrections or if inaccurate information "reappears" on your credit 
record, as it too frequently does. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comment. If a dispute is not resolved in your favor, you have the right to 
add up to a 100-word statement to your credit file that essentially says you 
dispute the accuracy of the negative item and why.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CAMPAIGN DEBTS AREN'T DEDUCTIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I ran for Congress two years ago and contributed most of the funds my 
campaign needed. I lost and the campaign was unable to repay the loans I had 
made. Now my accountant says I cannot write off those loans as a bad debt. I 
can't believe it. Are there any circumstances under which campaign loans or 
debts would be deductible? -- D.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: For all intents and purposes, the "loan" you made to your political 
campaign is considered a political contribution. And the IRS makes it clear 
that contributions to political campaigns or groups are not tax-deductible. 
It's really just that simple, our experts say. Previous candidates have tried 
to argue that their campaign expenses should be deductible as a business 
expense since the costs were incurred as part of getting a job. The IRS didn't 
buy that argument. The government's position is that you contributed to a 
political campaign -- it just happened to be your own -- and you are not 
entitled to a deduction for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, there are circumstances under which campaign debts could be 
deductible. For example, if a business sold supplies to a campaign in an 
arm's-length transaction and was not paid, the business would have a bad debt. 
But the transaction must be genuine and capable of withstanding the scrutiny of 
the IRS. Sorry, No Break for Drunk Driving Costs 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last year I was arrested for drunk driving and was required to enroll in a 
special traffic school, as well as pay nearly $1,200 in fines. Is any of this 
tax-deductible? The director of the traffic school thought his program might 
qualify as a medical expense because I was arrested for driving under the 
influence of alcohol, but he wasn't sure. Can you help? -- J.S.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Neither traffic fines nor traffic school fees are deductible. Legitimate 
medical treatment for alcohol or drug abuse can be a deductible medical expense 
if the treatment is prescribed by a physician and is administered by a 
qualified medical professional or program. New Law on Start-Ups Is Not Yet in 
Effect 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In 1985 I invested money in a small computer company some friends started. 
In return I received shares of the company's stock. The company went public in 
1990 and the value of the shares jumped. I sold some of the shares last year 
and am wondering if my profit is considered ordinary capital gains or if there 
is some category of taxation available to people who take huge risks by 
investing in start-up companies. -- G.F.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your profit is considered ordinary capital gain and are subject to 28% 
taxation. However, the tax law passed by Congress last year does offer some of 
the benefits you allude to -- but not until at least 1998. Under the new law, 
stock acquired after Aug. 10, 1993, in certain types of start-up businesses 
(primarily manufacturing) will be treated to a tax break upon its sale if the 
stock is held at least five years. The new law provides that only 50% of the 
gain from the sale of these shares will be subject to capital gains taxes, 
giving the taxpayer an effective tax rate of 14% -- rather than the current 28% 
-- on the profits. Scheduling Your Mortgage Deductions 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: For the past several years, I have rented out my home in Southern 
California. I also rent out a room in my condo in Northern California, where I 
live. I have been declaring mortgage interest deductions for both properties on 
both Schedule A under itemized deductions and on Schedule E for Supplemental 
Income from Rentals. I have never heard anything from the IRS, but a friend 
says I'm doing it wrong. Should I talk to the IRS about my returns and try to 
straighten things out? -- J.E.C . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Our advisers recommend that you never contact the IRS directly with such a 
question. Instead, if you are truly concerned, talk to your accountant to 
determine if you have done anything improper that requires your filing an 
amended tax return.  
</P>
<P>
 From your telling of the story, we cannot determine if you have made a 
mistake. Certainly, you cannot deduct the same mortgage interest payments on 
both Schedule A and Schedule E. However, our experts say you are entitled to 
write off half the mortgage interest on your Northern California condo on 
Schedule A, because you live there, and the remaining half on Schedule E, 
because you rent out that share. All of the interest on the rental home in 
Southern California should be listed on Schedule E. You Get State and U.S. 
Break on Auto Fees 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In a recent column, you discussed the amount of the annual motor vehicle 
registration fees that could be deducted on our income taxes. Is this deduction 
only for federal taxes or does it apply to state taxes as well? I am a new 
resident of California. -- C.M.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The "license fee" portion of your annual registration payment may be 
deducted on both your state and federal taxes. This amount is clearly noted on 
the renewal form sent out each year by the state Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 If you didn't keep the form, you can call your local DMV branch office to get 
this information, which varies from county to county and may change from year 
to year. Here are the current amounts residents of Southern California may 
deduct on their 1993 tax returns: Owners of non-commercial passenger vehicles 
registered in Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside counties may deduct all but 
$35 of the annual renewal fee for each vehicle. In Orange County you may deduct 
all but $36, and in Ventura County you may deduct all but $34.

A CAREER OPTION CLEAR OF BROKERAGES; REGULATORS: SOME FIND THAT HIGH-PAYING 
JOBS WITH INVESTMENT HOUSES ARE NOT THEIR CUP OF TEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Do securities regulators have any career option besides going to work for the 
brokerage business? 
</P>
<P>
 David E. Shellenberger, a former senior enforcement attorney with the New York 
Stock Exchange, founded a solo practice in Boston representing mainly small 
investors who claimed to have been victimized by large investment houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started the firm because I needed work that had a moral basis to it, and I 
wanted to have an impact on educating investors," Shellenberger says. "I like 
to be on the right side." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Shellenberger has won some large judgments and settlements 
for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he obtained $420,000 from Prudential Securities, including punitive 
damages and attorney's fees, in an arbitration case brought on behalf of a 
retired Latin teacher who claimed her broker made excessive trades in her 
account to generate fees. Last year, Shellenberger collected a total of more 
than $1 million in arbitration awards and settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he acknowledges, "it wasn't necessarily as easy a path as it would have 
been if I represented the (brokerage) industry. . . . I had to start from 
scratch." He notes that defense lawyers get fees whether they win or not, while 
investors' lawyers generally get fees based on a percentage of the award or 
settlement, if they are able to obtain one. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolving door did not always swing so rapidly. From the time the SEC was 
created in 1934 through the 1950s, lawyers tended to remain with the agency in 
what was viewed as a prestigious service. Today, many regulators who stay at 
their jobs end up being looked down on by their opponents as people who didn't 
measure up to the private bar's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 John Perkins, Missouri's securities commissioner for 16 years, says he has 
turned down job offers to stay in public service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government is never going to pay what some law firm on Wall Street is going 
to pay," Perkins says. "I'm not going to criticize someone for saying, 'I've 
got three kids to send to college and the state of Missouri just isn't paying 
me enough to do that.' But I hope never to be in that position. The reason I do 
what I do is that I believe that it's right." SCOT J. PALTROW

CO-FOUNDER LOOKS AT CHAOS IN EARLY STAGES AND FUTURE CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allen Adham, who co-founded Chaos Studios Inc. in Costa Mesa in 1991, sold the 
video game development business two weeks ago for $6.75 million. In an 
interview last week with Times staff writer Dean Takahashi, Adham told how he 
and co-founders Michael Morhaime and Frank Pearce got started and speculated 
about challenges that the video game industry faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much did you get into video games? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In my freshman year in high school, "Space Invaders" and "Asteroids" and 
"Defender" . . . were just picking up. I used to go (to arcades while) in 
junior high school and high school at lunch and just fanatically play those 
games. Then my brother and I talked my dad into buying us (a computer) so we 
could use it for school. We used it to play games. I liked playing the games so 
much that I started writing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was it a struggle at first? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Early on, it was easy. It was a summer job. I knew a half-dozen people in 
the business that I could call and ask for work. I could make $12,000 a summer, 
and that was good money for high school. I would work my own hours, so I had a 
social life and could go to the beach with my friends. The hard part came when 
I graduated from college. My attitude was -- and this is how I talked Mike and 
Frank into it -- we're young, we don't have mortgages or families. All we 
really have to lose is time. We could try it for a year. If takes off, great. 
If it doesn't, chalk it up to experience. . . . I still believe to this day 
that attitude is everything.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the hard part? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The biggest single challenge to me was relinquishing control. When there 
were only three of us, I saw everything and knew everything. Now that there are 
19 of us and we're working on 11 projects, there is no way I can control 
everything. By nature I am a perfectionist, a workaholic. It's difficult for me 
to let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As the games get more sophisticated, will it be easier for small U.S. 
companies to compete with the Japanese, who may not know what the U.S. consumer 
wants? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sega right now is doing better than Nintendo, because Sega aggressively 
pursues American cultural properties such as titles like "X-Men" or "Spider 
Man." If I could get on the phone and call up the head of Nintendo, I'd tell 
him to have American companies do more development or have Nintendo of America 
create its own development so that they could compete on a cultural level. A 
clear example is our "Rock 'n' Roll Racing," a game we did for Interplay 
Productions. We came up with a concept that put rock music hand-in-hand with 
the racing culture. So we said let's get George Thorogood and the Destroyers' 
"Bad to the Bone" and put it in the game. That's an idea that an American 
company had to come up with.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you fear there will be a trough in sales as everyone waits for the 
next-generation game system to come out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That is a chicken-and-egg question. There may be a trough where people hold 
off buying old games. The next year may be a little tight. But the good 
companies making good games will do just fine. I believe Sega's next-generation 
project, the Saturn, will emerge dominant. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There is probably some kind of confusion about what constitutes the video 
game of the future. What will be state of the art? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I can tell you what is state of the art. A lot of games that are hyped as 
next-generation games now are almost non-interactive. They're these beautiful 
showpieces where for the most part you are an interested observer. You don't 
really control much of what happens on the screen. You have branching points 
where you can decide the route the movie plays, but you're not actually 
directing it. The future games need to continue to be very interactive, very 
sweaty palmed, action-oriented.

IN THE GARDEN: GROWING YOUR OWN GREENS; MESCLUN: TASTY FRENCH SALAD MIX IS EASY 
AND INEXPENSIVE TO GROW IN SOUTHLAND GARDENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The delicious but pricey mix of French salad greens called mesclun (or "field 
salad" in some restaurants) may be the easiest thing you can grow in your 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 From seed to salad bowl takes about six weeks and the seeds are unusually easy 
to sprout. Mesclun can be grown almost year round, even in containers, if you 
haven't a garden or the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesclun more or less means mix in the dialect of Nice, and, though gardeners 
and gourmets aren't always sure what's in it, all of the ingredients are grown 
and harvested together. 
</P>
<P>
 Arugula and lettuce are mainstays in traditional mesclun, but almost anything 
goes, as long as it can be called a green. 
</P>
<P>
 One seed company offers six different mescluns, some they invented themselves, 
some based on traditional French blends. Put any in a salad bowl and drizzle a 
little olive oil and vinegar with a couple teaspoons of Dijon mustard mixed in 
and you have a zesty and often beautiful salad. 
</P>
<P>
 The zest comes from the greens other than lettuce, such as endive, chicory, 
dandelion, cress, mustard, mache, chervil, purslane and of course, arugula; 
beauty from the various red and green lettuces, some with traditional roundish 
leaves, some with pointed or deeply lobed leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the contents may very, one thing never does: You must harvest mesclun 
when the plants are small and tender. Wait too long and a touch, or, in the 
case of arugula, a truckload of bitterness awaits you. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants are typically harvested when they are less than six inches tall. Three 
inches tall is considered ideal and they get there in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a scissors and cut the leaves about an inch above the ground. Tear in 
half, soak in the sink to wash off any dirt, dry with a towel or a lettuce 
spinner, dress and the bite-sized pieces are ready to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't plant too much at a time or you'll find the plants going over the hill 
before you can use them. They grow very fast and even waiting a week will make 
leaves larger than you really want for true mesclun. 
</P>
<P>
 Successive plantings are the answer. Although a seed packet may contain 
several thousand seeds, plant only a pinch or two at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rows don't really suit mesclun. Planted in wide beds, the ingredients are as 
pretty in the garden as they are in the salad bowl, maybe more so, when the sun 
is low and the various shades of green and red seem to glow in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The small but wide bed pictured on K1 contains two different mixes in a 
3-by-4-foot space at the Ocean View Farms community garden in Mar Vista. In 
half of the bed is a mix from the Nicoise region of France that contains no 
lettuce but lots of other greens (endive, chicory, dandelion, cress and 
arugula). In the other half is a Provencal mesclun containing lots of lettuce 
as well as other greens (chervil, arugula and endive). 
</P>
<P>
 If you're already growing lettuce, the Nicoise mesclun can be added to salads 
to spice them up a bit, or, for a really tart, teeth-clattering salad, eat them 
alone, as done in Nice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Provencal mesclun is a stand-alone salad -- you don't need to add anything 
but dressing. Most of these European mixes are described as "piquant" or "tart 
and tangy." 
</P>
<P>
 Seedsman Sheperd Ogden of the Cook's Garden thinks that many of these mixes 
are too bitter for most Americans so they developed their own milder mixes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cook's Garden, P.O. Box 535, Londonderry, Vt. 05148 has the largest 
selection, but Sheperd's Garden Seeds, 30 Irene St., Torrington, Conn. 06790 
and the Gourmet Gardener, 4000 West 126th St., Leawood, Kan. 66209, also sell 
mesclun mixes. 
</P>
<P>
 If you garden in a clay soil, make a mesclun bed by mixing organic matter into 
the soil with a spading fork or tiller, so it is well aerated and almost 
fluffy. If your soil is silty or sandy, you can add a little organic matter, 
though it isn't really necessary, but do add fertilizer and spade it into the 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not be able to tell the weeds from the mesclun, since some of the 
ingredients are close cousins of garden weeds. If you expect weeds, water the 
beds every day to bring up the seed, then hoe or pull the weeds before sowing 
the mesclun. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant mesclun in a foot or two of bed at a time. Sowing seed every two weeks 
should keep you in greens for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoroughly soak the soil a few days in advance of sowing. After it dries a 
little on top, lightly pull a garden rake over the bed, making very shallow 
furrows with the tines. Sow the seed sparingly -- seeds should be about 1-2 
inches apart -- and then lightly tamp the soil with the end of the rake. Water 
with a fine spray and keep the soil moist until seed sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the mesclun grows so quickly, pests won't be a problem, except for 
slugs and snails. Watch out for these on the lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-tech trick can help speed germination and keep slugs and snails out. 
Try covering the mesclun bed with a floating row cover (Agrifabric and Agryl 
are two brands, sold by the Cook's Garden and Sheperd's Garden Seeds). These 
woven fabrics let in the light and water, but keep out pests, if you bury the 
edges in the soil. Fit them loosely to the bed right after sowing and the 
greens will push the covers up as they grow. Lift an edge to harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 No garden or short of space? You can also grow a few salad's worth in large 
containers filled with commercial potting soil. Try the mixes that contain 
greens other than lettuce. You can always buy lettuce at the market, then liven 
it up with your own mesclun. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesclun likes the cooler times of the year, from fall into early summer. 
Coastal gardeners should have no trouble growing mesclun even in mid-summer, 
but inland gardeners may have to move their beds into a little shade. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've cut your first mesclun, more leaves will push up and you can 
usually get a second or even third cutting from the same plants, though the 
first is always the best, so you may want to turn the soil and simply plant 
more. Keep planting every few weeks and you'll never run out.

SELLERS CAN GET HELP FROM PROS AT SATURDAY'S FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though the housing market is warming up in many Southland communities, 
selling a home is still a tremendous challenge. But savvy advice can make it 
less of an ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the fifth annual Times' Home Buyers and Sellers Fair, sellers will get tips 
from experts on how to best present their home in a sluggish real estate 
market. And they can learn what the pros think about how the Northridge 
earthquake will affect home sales and prices in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-day consumer education event, the largest of its kind in the country, 
will be held from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Saturday at the Anaheim Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Times' "Starting Out" columnist Dian Hymer, author of "Buying and Selling a 
Home in California," will conduct a special workshop for sellers on how to 
price their homes, prepare the home for sale and closing the deal. Joining her 
will be Dan Lieberman, co-author of "Getting the Most for Your Home in a Down 
Market."

BRACING FOR THE NEXT ONE; SOUTHLAND HOMEOWNERS ARE LOOKING AT HOW HOMES CAN BE 
STRUCTURALLY REINFORCED TO BETTER WITHSTAND EARTHQUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL TICE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Tice is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His name is Billy Martin and he's famous. His Hollywood home is the only one 
on his block still standing after the Northridge earthquake and even the First 
Lady has been by to gawk. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the retired film production manager says the house was "shaken like a 
36-foot boat on the high seas," he survived without a single crack in his 26 
stained-glass windows or his living room's mirrored wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just fate that Martin's 1910 Craftsman bungalow remained intact 
while his neighbors' homes fell off their foundations. Six months earlier, he 
had the house structurally reinforced to better withstand earthquakes, a 
process known as foundation retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's home offered such a striking demonstration of the value of 
retrofitting that Hillary Rodham Clinton has dropped by to check it out, with 
Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wanted to know what I did," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is not enjoying his moment as an earthquake celebrity, however. He just 
wishes he'd been able to persuade his neighbors to retrofit their houses in 
time. "I feel bad," he said. "My neighbors are living in tents. But you know 
how people are -- they don't think about these things until they get kicked in 
the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Still smarting from their most recent kick, many owners of older homes in 
Southern California are taking a look under their dwellings, trying to discover 
whether their foundations are prepared for an even bigger quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For homes built after 1973 or on concrete slab foundations, the structure is 
probably fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But hundreds of thousands of older, wood-framed, raised-foundation houses in 
the Southland lack even the most basic earthquake-safety features. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, older homes built on posts, or with a "tall wall" used to level a 
hillside lot, are at particular risk of collapse in a quake, experts say. Those 
with a room over a garage also need special reinforcing. 
</P>
<P>
 But strengthening existing foundations is not terribly complicated or 
expensive, and it greatly increases the house's ability to withstand 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting secures the house's outer walls to the foundation, so that in an 
earthquake, the house will move together as a unit and stay intact. 
</P>
<P>
 A look under most older houses will reveal a concrete or masonry foundation 
topped with either the floor's supporting boards or a short supporting wall, 
called a cripple wall. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three basic steps that need to be taken to increase a house's 
ability to resist ground movement, and all of the work takes place in the 
usually cramped space beneath the house. 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Resting on top of the foundation is the house's main support board. 
Called the "mudsill," this board should be bolted to the foundation. Normally, 
expansion bolts are used, which have an expanding tip to grip the concrete 
firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the crawl space is too small to allow the bolts to be drilled straight into 
the foundation from above, they are drilled in sideways and L-shaped metal 
brackets hold the sill to the foundation. If your floor's supporting boards, or 
joists, are attached directly to the mudsill, this is the only step you need 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- If you have a cripple wall between the foundation and the floor, bracing 
brackets known as hold-downs should be installed to strengthen the right-angle 
connections between the mudsill and the cripple wall studs. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- The cripple wall should be further reinforced by creating a shear wall, 
usually of half-inch plywood, which is nailed onto the wall at close intervals 
to create more resistance to movement. Fifty percent of the cripple wall's area 
needs to be covered for one-story buildings, 70% for two-story. To prevent 
moisture buildup and rot, ventilation holes are drilled in the plywood, and 
then screened over to keep out rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are more elaborate strengthening measures, they are very 
expensive. "The most bang for the buck is gotten by bolting to the foundation 
and shear-paneling the cripple walls," said Shelly Perluss, general manager of 
Industry-based Cal-Quake Home Improvement. "These are very common failures that 
are relatively easy to remedy. You can spend a little money -- roughly 1%-3% of 
the value of the house -- and get a lot of insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the three steps John Given of Ocean Park took last fall to 
strengthen his 1915 home. "I think it certainly pays," he said recently, having 
survived the quake in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Given was inspired to retrofit his house when he inspected its foundation. "If 
you actually crawl under there and see the entire house is supported by the 
cripple wall," he said, "just timber sitting on a concrete foundation wall, 
literally stabilized only by the weight of the load. . . . It makes you 
understand more clearly what's involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with the cost of rebuilding a house that's jumped off its foundation, 
Given's $2,500 retrofitting job seems quite a bargain. After seeing the 
devastation of the recent quake, Given said, "The lesson here is that $2,500 is 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 And Given warns homeowners to make sure they're working with a pro: "It's well 
worth it to have a structural engineer or seismic retrofitting professional 
come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a retrofitting expert may take a little sleuthing. No special license 
is required for foundation retrofitting contractors. And though there are codes 
covering new construction, retrofitting codes aren't expected to be ready until 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the search more difficult, the Jan. 17 quake has created a retrofitting 
frenzy, with unscrupulous contractors trying to pass themselves off as seismic 
safety experts. Meanwhile, the seasoned retrofitters are all booked months 
ahead -- like geologist Bill Leibman, owner of Pasadena-based Cal-Seismics, 
who's canceled all his advertising to try to quiet the phones down. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibman, who's on the board of directors of the Southern California Assn. of 
Real Estate Retrofit Professionals, warned, "I saw a flyer that said, 'We 
specialize in foundation retrofitting -- and Jacuzzis.' That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to the retrofitting field tend to recommend more work than homes 
really need and charge too much for it. "I'm doing one house right now in 
Pasadena," said Leibman. "A 'friend' gave her a price of $10,000. We did it for 
$3,500." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for homeowners to spend too much because most have no idea what 
condition their foundations are in or what it should cost to retrofit them. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, my husband, Larry, and I both somehow became convinced it would 
cost more than $10,000 to do our one-of-a-kind, 1,800-square-foot clapboard 
house. It was built in stages from 1928 to 1948 and, because of a room 
addition, it has a concrete perimeter foundation under the middle of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one general contractor told us we needed to bolt the house to this 
interior foundation wall and secure a row of pier-and-post supports that also 
run under the center of the house, experienced retrofitters say strengthening 
interior supports is not necessary. Eventually, we got a bid of $2,715 from a 
reputable contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoddy workmanship can also be a problem when homeowners use contractors who 
aren't retrofitting specialists. "I've seen plywood I could pull off with my 
hands," Leibman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad workmanship is a time bomb for the homeowner, who may not know the work 
wasn't done right until the next earthquake. And once the cripple walls are 
covered with plywood, the work is hidden from view. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros recommend that homeowners ask for lots of references and call them, 
check that the contractor's license and insurance are in good standing, get the 
contract in writing and remember it's illegal to ask for more than 10% down on 
any job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want experience, a permit, engineering and an inspection for the work," 
Leibman wrote in a flyer he is distributing to his customers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pamela Miller, a San Bernardino County optometrist, wanted to retrofit 
the foundation of the two-story clapboard home that houses her Highland office, 
she recalled, "There certainly were an awful lot of crooks out there." After 
getting estimates as high as $15,000, Leibman of Cal-Seismics did the building 
for less than $4,000 in the summer of 1991 -- just a few months before the 
Landers earthquake rocked Big Bear and San Bernardino, not far from Highland. 
"So far, we're still standing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspection of her house's foundation revealed it had been moved to the 
current site in the late 1930s and never bolted down. "It's one of those 
things," she said, "like making sure children have immunizations. It's a 
calculated risk, and I think when it's a business you have an obligation to 
protect your customers." 
</P>
<P>
 An experienced do-it-yourselfer, Miller considered tackling the job on her 
own. But after researching the tools and physical requirements -- the work is 
usually done lying down or crouching under your house -- she decided to hire 
Leibman. "I'm an optometrist. My license covers eyes," she said. "Their license 
covers foundations. I think it was better to have someone who does it for a 
living." 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals are divided on whether homeowners should be encouraged to 
retrofit their own foundations. It does greatly reduce the cost, and several 
videos have been produced that aim to instruct people who are handy with 
tools.(See accompanying story.) 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who want to do it themselves, we will sell them the supplies and 
for a small fee, educate them on what they have to do," said Cal-Quake's 
Perluss. "It takes a fair investment in tools and materials and, in most 
places, a non-claustrophobic person." 
</P>
<P>
 But Craig Boatman, general manager at Sylvis Construction in Pasadena, said, 
"In older houses, there's no two alike, so very quickly you run into situations 
where you don't know what to do. We won't do the job without instructions from 
a structural engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, what if your concrete isn't firm enough for the expansion bolts 
to work? The novice might be tempted to use bolts sunk in epoxy instead of 
pouring new concrete. Boatman said that would be a mistake because "you can put 
them in oatmeal and they'll hold. But they won't hold in an earthquake." Also, 
the installation process for epoxy bolts is tricky enough that some areas 
require continuous inspection the entire time they are being installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you need anchor bolts every six feet or every two? Should the bolts be six 
inches long or eight? Is it 8-penny nails or 10-penny nails for the shear 
walls? To know the answers, you need to be familiar with codes in your area and 
the latest in retrofitting technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous to insinuate that people can do this themselves," warned 
Leibman of Cal-Seismics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are growing incentives for homeowners to get the work done though. Real 
estate disclosure laws now require sellers of pre-1960 homes to answer a series 
of questions about the house's earthquake readiness, including whether the 
foundation is bolted, perimeter pier-and-post or non-reinforced masonry 
foundations have been strengthened and the cripple wall reinforced. Hillside 
homeowners must disclose whether their foundation posts were built to resist 
quakes or have been updated. 
</P>
<P>
 If the recent quake has made you want to get earthquake insurance, you may 
find it's difficult to get coverage unless you're retrofitted. "Whether the 
foundation is anchored could be a key question they're going to ask in the 
future," said Richard Masters, a Calabasas-based property and casualty 
insurance expert. But Masters believes the most pressure to upgrade will come 
from mortgage holders. "They're not going to want to issue new mortgages 
without seismic safety on the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Torin of Culver City didn't need any of these incentives to strengthen 
his foundation -- he did the work two months before the Jan. 17 quake and came 
through with no damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The project had been on his mind for a while, he said, "because there's no 
question if you're going to have an earthquake or not. My wife, Barbara, would 
say, 'I want new drapes,' and I would say, 'We're not doing anything else until 
we do the foundation.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because Culver City has partly marshy soil, there was a lot of damage in the 
area. Dozens of pre-1960 homes were severely damaged. Torin drives to work past 
a duplex that's "totaled -- right off the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 He has no illusions that his home is impervious to quakes, though. "You cannot 
earthquake-proof anything," he said. "You can increase your odds, improve your 
safety and minimize your damage. People on both sides of me lost fireplaces and 
across the street too. All we lost were some glasses." 
</P>
<P>
 After coming through the recent quake safely without an anchored foundation, 
Patricia Stallone and Peter Bergman have decided it's time to retrofit their 
1915 Santa Monica triplex. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone, a film producer, said, "We are doing prophylactic work -- we want to 
survive if there is a stronger earthquake nearer to us." In examining their 
foundation, the couple learned the front of their home used to be an open porch 
and was supported by non-reinforced brick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a sand dune," she said. "I considered getting pontoons in case we 
liquefy and float away, but I understand this is better. The way they built 
these houses, they were just attached with tiny nails. So now we can use better 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the oldest multiple unit in Santa Monica," said Bergman, who's a 
member of the Firesign Theatre troupe. "We're expecting it to stay here for a 
while. so we're bolting down a piece of history."

BEDROOM COMMUNITY HAS RURAL ROOTS; TEMPLE CITY: CORNFIELDS GIVE WAY TO 
FAMILY-ORIENTED COMMUNITY THAT FEELS SMALL AND WELCOMES CHILDREN.

 When Florine Thompson moved to Temple City in 1949, most of the bean patches, 
orange groves and chicken ranches she remembered from visits to friends in the 
1930s were gone. Even so, a rural flavor still existed in the unincorporated 
town where she and her family decided to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Caltech professor was growing experimental corn in a big field on the north 
side of town," Thompson, 82, recalled. "Temple City High School has taken over 
the corn patch now." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of changes," said Thompson, a founding member of the Temple 
City Historical Society. "Still, this city remains a satisfying place to live. 
It has a small-town feel and I know many of my neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the western San Gabriel Valley, Temple City covers four square 
miles and is home to more than 30,000 residents. It is bordered by San Gabriel 
to the west, Arcadia to the north and east and El Monte and Rosemead on the 
south.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Linda Pyle of Herbert Hawkins Realtors, Temple City homes range 
in price from $155,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bath house to $400,000 for newer, 
four-bedroom, three-bath models. The average Temple City house has between 
1,300 and 1,800 square feet with three bedrooms and 1 3/4 baths on a 
50-foot-by-115-foot lot. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bonnie and Larry Smith decided to move from the Pico-Fairfax area three 
years ago to be closer to her teaching job in Eagle Rock, the small-town feel 
and children's recreational facilities available in Temple City were a big 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found Los Angeles very convenient for adult entertainment, but not for our 
children. Everything our son and daughter wanted to do involved driving them 
somewhere," Bonnie Smith, 44, said. "Now we have a park and library within 
walking distance. Plus the walking is pleasant and safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first heard about Temple City from a friend who was building a house here," 
Bonnie Smith said. "I asked her, 'Where is that?' When we began looking around 
for a house, we were open to a wide range of possible areas. The realtor 
mentioned Temple City and it struck a bell." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our daughter Delicia, 18, found opportunities in Temple City's Theatre Arts 
Department that just didn't exist in our Los Angeles neighborhood school," she 
said. The Smiths paid in the high $200,000s for their three-bedroom, two-bath 
house, with a spa and guest house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't worried about finding a prejudiced environment in Temple City," 
said Larry Smith, 45. The Smiths are black. "If we met a problem, we felt we 
could deal with it. It turned out our neighbors were very welcoming." 
</P>
<P>
 Temple City originally offered a welcoming rural environment to Jeff and 
Gloria Simpson when they emigrated from England in 1957. Because both worked in 
horticulture, the Simpsons wanted a house with a small yard. "But we liked this 
place so much and the price was only $11,000. We bought it even though the lot 
is 165 feet long. Naturally, we wound up gardening at home and at work," Gloria 
Simpson, 62, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first our neighbors kept many animals: pigeons, chickens and geese but 
when the lots were subdivided in the '60s, the animals had to go," said Jeff 
Simpson, 67, a retired landscape foreman. "Now we only have two tortoises and 
several cats," he added. "But the woody area on our block is home to possums, 
squirrels and a flock of wild parrots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpsons appreciate the warmth of their Temple City neighbors. "If one of 
us has a tragedy, we all cry," Gloria Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city seal proclaims it to be the "Home of Camellias," Temple City 
homeowners don't appear to grow them in any greater quantity than in nearby 
towns. The motto was adopted in 1944 after city council members searched for a 
flower to represent the town. The Camellia Festival, a spring parade held on 
the last Saturday of February, also commemorates the town flower.  
</P>
<P>
 Children play starring roles in the parade by building small floats that are 
pushed or pulled along Las Tunas Boulevard. First-graders from city schools 
serve as king and queen. Longtime resident Jean Gerard remembers when children 
would knock on the door asking to pick her camellia blossoms for float 
decorations. Nowadays a typical Camellia Festival Parade contains about 10 
floats, a dozen local marching bands and scores of uniformed scouts and young 
athletes.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's history began when Walter Temple, son of Pliny Temple, a pioneering 
Los Angeles businessman, purchased 400 acres of Lucky Baldwin's Ranch and 
called it the "Town of Temple." In 1921 he began subdividing lots for a town 
where "people of medium income could come to live and afford to own their 
homes." Temple's shrewdest move was to persuade the Pacific Electric Railway to 
extend the Red Car line from Alhambra into the new town, thus ensuring an easy 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 The first house in the Temple town site was built on Garibaldi Avenue in 1923. 
By 1924 a hardware store and pharmacy had opened on Las Tunas Drive, the city's 
main street. In 1927 the Red Car line began daily operation.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1936 the Town of Temple became Temple City. The change of name was 
primarily caused by mail mis-delivered to Tempe, Ariz., and the Four Square 
Temple in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools in Temple City have always been a big draw," said Jean Gerard, 
who moved to the area with her family in 1953. "My son Mark and his wife have 
raised their family here because they have confidence in the schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "We picked Temple City because of the nice environment, the oversized lot and 
our well-built house, which originally cost $17,500," Gerard said.  
</P>
<P>
 Retired from teaching and widowed for five years, Gerard sometimes wishes she 
lived closer to cultural activities. "This is a bedroom community with all the 
advantages and disadvantages of that kind of town," Gerard said, "but I'll 
probably stay here as long as I can manage the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing numbers of Asian homeowners have settled in Temple City during the 
past decade. Census figures show the Asian population has expanded to 20% from 
5.2% a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At Temple City High School, Asian students make up 29% of the student body 
compared to just over 5% in 1980. Principal Ray Plutko sees the diversity of 
the high school population as a challenge, not a problem. "We look at all 
students individually and try to personalize their education. Four out of five 
of last year's National Merit scholars were Asians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doreen Moore, 48, found her recent move to Temple City to be relatively easy. 
She and her mother, Betty, moved from their two-acre Arcadia residence to a 
smaller three-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot house in Temple City just six blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid $316,500 for this home two years ago. That may be a little high in 
today's slow market environment, but they're building new houses nearby, which 
should help raise our values. And we're not planning to sell any time soon," 
Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we decided to scale down to a smaller house, I checked out areas 
all over the San Gabriel Valley," Moore said. "But I'm very health-conscious 
and have found shopkeepers in the area who take my concerns seriously. In other 
cities I didn't find merchants as knowledgeable about healthy foods. I decided 
I'd be crazy to leave here." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Smith also found the merchants in Temple City friendly and 
accommodating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I went to the market looking for 'Southern comfort food' like 
collard and mustard greens, I couldn't find them," she said. "But I only had to 
ask once and the store began stocking them. I think that shows businesses here 
are really trying to meet different ethnic needs." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the strongest selling points for Temple City is the low crime rate, 
according to realtor Pyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizens in Temple City are encouraged to be aware of what's going on and to 
feel free to call us," said Pat Libertone, crime prevention deputy with the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which provides police services under a 
contract with the city. "The proactive approach of teaching citizens how to 
protect their homes and businesses really pays off in keeping crime down in 
Temple City," Libertone said. At A Glance

APARTMENT LIFE: WHAT'S 'NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR' ON OLD CARPET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), 
an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Since my house sold much quicker than anticipated, I am now renting 
a house on a temporary basis in the city of San Gabriel. I can foresee problems 
when I move out in about a year. In a few of your recent columns, you have 
referenced different aspects of "normal wear and tear," which is where I think 
the problems will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The carpets in this house were stained and threadbare when we moved in. I 
tried to explain this to the landlord, but his English isn't real good so I'm 
not sure he understood. I think he'll give me problems with them when I move 
out. I am trying to remove the stains myself, but I don't know what to do about 
the carpet seams that are unraveling. How does "normal wear and tear" apply to 
such carpets? Can I be charged for added wear and tear to already worn-out 
carpets? When I move out, how can I prove what condition the carpets were in at 
the start of the tenancy? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Threadbare carpets would seem to be worn out and should have no normal 
wear and tear left in them. If the landlord wants to charge you to replace such 
carpets at the end of your tenancy, he will be unlikely to prevail in court if 
you are properly prepared. Before-and-after pictures showing no added wear to 
the carpets are great evidence in court, particularly if they're dated by the 
processor, as many are. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a move-in/out checklist indicating the condition of a unit, including 
floors and floor coverings, is a great help in court. Such forms are generally 
furnished by the landlord or manager and reviewed by you simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they are also available at some stationery stores, or you can develop 
your own. If the landlord is unwilling to go over it with you, you may note the 
condition of the unit and its amenities on the form and mail him a copy of it 
with a cover letter for his information. Also, if the carpet is so bad that it 
represents a safety hazard, and the owner won't at least fix it, you could call 
(818) 308-2806 and complain to the Department of Building and Safety in the 
city of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Senior Building Inspector Sam Duggan, "The department would 
notify the owner of a potential hazard in the unit and inform (him) that he 
must eliminate the hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 The form, letter and pictures should go a long way toward proving your case if 
you are inappropriately charged by the landlord for replacing the carpet. Can 
Security Deposit Be Held for Rent? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in Pasadena and I have a question about my security deposit. In 
September, 1992, my fiance and I moved into a one-bedroom apartment paying a 
$100 non-refundable cleaning fee and a $575 security deposit. The rent was 
$575. 
</P>
<P>
 During April and May, 1993, my hours at work were cut because business was 
extremely slow and the company was losing money. I barely worked 35 hours per 
two-week pay period, creating an insufficient ability to pay my June rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Being unable to pay the full rent, I notified the apartment manager that I 
would relinquish the apartment by June 8, 1993. The manager explained to me 
that I automatically lost my entire security deposit since I did not give a 
30-day notice of my intention to vacate. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to stay but couldn't afford it so I moved out to keep my credit 
record good. My question is, can't I get a prorated portion of my deposit back 
because it was my unforeseen job situation that caused the move? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your employment situation does not affect your security deposit, but you 
may still be able to get some deposit money back. First, "non-refundable" 
cleaning fees for residential rentals have been outlawed for 15 years in the 
state of California. The owner is entitled to deduct only the actual costs for 
cleaning from a cleaning deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owner's costs were less than the $100 fee he charged you, you are 
entitled to a prorated refund from the "non-refundable" cleaning fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, while you are liable for up to 30 days rent from the time you give 
notice to move under a month-to-month rental agreement, the owner cannot 
collect double rent if the unit is re-rented prior to that time. You do not 
lose the deposit "automatically." 
</P>
<P>
 If the owner did not re-rent the apartment before the expiration of your 
30-day notice, and 30 days rent were due, he may keep your deposit, which 
equals 30 days rent in your case, to offset the unpaid rent, provided he made 
"reasonable efforts" to re-rent the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 If you owed less than 30 days rent when you gave notice or the unit was 
re-rented prior to the expiration of the notice, you are entitled to a prorated 
refund from the security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were you, I would first apprise the manager of the law and then ask if 
you have any deposit refund due based upon this new knowledge. If you aren't 
satisfied that you've been treated fairly after that, you may sue in Small 
Claims Court for any refund you may be due.

YOUR MORTGAGE; HOW LENDER DETERMINES WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How will a lender pre-qualify me for a loan? 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to get pre-qualified for a home loan is to call a loan agent 
or mortgage broker and make an appointment to review your financial situation. 
Here's how a lender will look at your finances to determine what price house 
you can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders think in terms of two ratios when they're qualifying you for a home 
loan. Each ratio expresses your expenses as a percentage of your income. 
</P>
<P>
 The first ratio the lender looks at is the ratio between the monthly cost of 
buying your new home (your monthly housing expense) and your gross monthly 
income (before deducting for income taxes). 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders usually don't want your monthly housing expense to exceed 28% to 30% 
of your gross monthly income. The more cash you can put down, the more flexible 
the lender will be. Borrowers who put 10% or less cash down can expect to be 
qualified based on a 28% ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 A lender will multiply your gross monthly income by 28% or 30%, depending on 
your cash down situation. The result is the maximum amount the lender will 
allow you to spend for your monthly housing expense. The monthly housing 
expense includes the mortgage payment (principal and interest), property taxes, 
hazard insurance and homeowner association dues, if you're buying a townhouse 
or condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 The second ratio the lender's use is the ratio between your total monthly debt 
(housing expense combined with other debts) and your gross monthly income. The 
lender will tally your outstanding debts and calculate the minimum amount 
required each month to pay back these debts. Your debts will include bills that 
won't be paid off within the next few months, such as car payments, student 
loans and charge card accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders usually don't want your total monthly debt to exceed 36% of your gross 
monthly income. The lender will multiply your gross monthly income by 36%, then 
subtract your monthly debt obligation from this amount. If the balance is equal 
to or larger than the maximum housing expense figure calculated above (using 
28% or 30% of your gross monthly income), you won't have trouble qualifying. If 
the balance is less than that figure, this means your debt level is high and 
the lender won't qualify you for as large a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The price home you can afford also depends on the amount of cash you have 
available for your down payment and closing costs. Closing costs vary from one 
area to the next but they can run about 5% of the purchase price. The lender 
will subtract an amount to cover closing costs from the cash you have 
available. The balance will be added to the loan amount you qualify for to 
determine the price home you can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First-time tip: One way to increase your purchasing power is to reduce the 
amount of debt you are paying off before you try to qualify for a loan. This 
can be done by paying debts down or consolidating high-interest rate debts into 
one lower interest rate loan. Another way is to choose an adjustable rate 
mortgage (ARM). If your ratios are marginal, talk to a portfolio lender. 
Portfolio lenders don't sell their loans on the secondary money market, so they 
can be more flexible in their loan qualification guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The closing: Your income and debt are just two factors that a lender will 
consider in qualifying you for a home loan. Your credit record, employment 
history, the property appraisal and title to the property will also be examined 
by the lender before you'll be given a loan.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * If you started vegetable seeds already, be sure to thin them to prevent 
overcrowding or stunted plants.Do this when the plants are two to three inches 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give your lawn a boost this spring by starting a regular feeding program 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pinching annuals at planting time will give you a bigger and better bloom 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let the kids in on the fun of a vegetable garden. Quick results are seen 
from planting radish seeds and this keeps their interest while the others grow.

 About five years ago, Jim and Karine Marett of San Diego found themselves 
captivated by the canals of France, so they decided to try their hand at 
running a charter barge on the waterways. It took them two years to arrange the 
details, but they left for France in February, 1991, and today -- three years 
and 46 guests later -- they are ready to begin their fourth cruising 
season.Between April 29 and Oct. 23, they will take their 70-foot "Bateau 
Mary," below, on six-day trips in the Jural Mountain, Alsace-Lorraine and 
Vosges regions. Jim Marett, a licensed captain, prepares all dinners on board, 
specializing in regional foods. Karine -- an alumna of UCLA -- says "history, 
art and architecture are what fascinate me." Both speak fluent French and say 
they strive to tailor each cruise to the interests of their passengers. Charter 
rates are $1,500 per person, based on double occupancy, and include all meals 
on the boat, guided sightseeing and transfers. The Mary accommodates four 
guests "who must be family or friends." For brochures and more information, 
write Jim and Karine Marett, Bateau Mary, Le Port, 21170 
St.-Symphorien-Sur-Saone, France.

MORE ON THE WOLVES

<TEXT>
<P>
 I have spent several summers in Alaska and I am concerned about the frequently 
suggested boycotting of Alaskan tourism (Letters, Feb. 28). There are many 
small businesses in Alaska that depend upon tourism and that have little 
control over state governmental decisions.A universal boycott is irresponsible 
and threatens to destroy businesses that should be supported as environmentally 
responsible, sensitive and constructive. Instead, write to the Alaska Division 
of Tourism and tell them that you are not going on that expensive luxury cruise 
to Alaska. Tell them -- and do it -- that you are instead going on an 
eco-sensitive wilderness tour to view wolves, whales, sea otters and bears, and 
that you will insist upon a pristine wilderness experience.

TAXI TIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your readers should be warned about "radio" taxi cabs at night in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 A radio cab starts its meter from wherever it happens to be when it receives 
the call. This is legal and your only recourse is to refuse to take the cab. 
</P>
<P>
 If your hotel has called the cab for you, ask the doorman or someone from the 
desk to check the meter reading before you get in. Even a regular cab may have 
10 or 12 francs on the meter. That is acceptable because cabs in any large city 
have a small surcharge at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Our hotel called a cab for a short trip to the Folies-Bergere. We got in 
without checking the meter. Then, two blocks from the hotel, we realized that 
the meter read something like $18. The fare, when we arrived at our 
destination, was almost $30. 
</P>
<P>
 We hailed a regular cab on the street and the fare back to the hotel was less 
than one third of what we had paid the radio cab. 
</P>
<P>
 RUSSELL L. JACOBS 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 George Hern Jr., public relations director for the French Government Tourist 
Office in New York City, replies: "The standard rule of radio taxis in Paris 
and elsewhere in the world is that the meter is set at the time and place of 
the call . We agree that travelers should be aware of this. As you suggested, 
it may be wiser to hail a cab or go to the nearest taxi stand. The night 
surcharge is , in fact , the initial charge and is currently 12 francs. There 
is, however, a 'night rate ' per kilometer from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., as well as 
for Sundays and public holidays, which is 5.10 francs, instead of the 
3.23-franc day rate. These rates also apply to radio taxis."

CENTRAL SCHOOLS FARE POORLY IN TESTS; EDUCATION: LOW SCORES IN STATEWIDE EXAMS 
ARE BLAMED IN PART ON THE POVERTY AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY OF MANY 
STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At every grade level and in every subject, students at most Central Los 
Angeles schools scored poorly on a new state exam designed to test critical 
thinking skills, according to results released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some area schools did better than comparable schools on the 
California Learning Assessment Systems test, they were the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators believe the low scores in Central Los Angeles are largely reflective 
of the area's high concentration of students who are poor, highly mobile, speak 
little English and have parents who do not get involved in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of students in my area are poor, from other countries and speak 
English as a second language. Even those who qualified to take the test -- many 
of them are not fluent in English," said Evangelina Stockwell, assistant 
superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Elementary District 
B, which includes the Mid-City area, Downtown and parts of the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our kids are just going to have to work harder. We start behind (in) the 
race already, but we're going to have to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the previous California Assessment Program exam, which graded on a 
curve and set minimum expectation levels, results of the new test were graded 
according to rigorous performance standards established by a task force of 
educators, parents and others. The test was scored on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 
being the highest score. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test, which included mathematics, reading and writing sections, was 
administered last spring to 1 million California students in grades four, eight 
and 10. Students who have attended schools in this country for less than 30 
months or who have been enrolled in classes taught primarily in their native 
languages were exempted from the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the previous exam required students to answer multiple-choice 
questions, students taking the CLAS test were asked to analyze their answers, 
critique literature and show how they arrived at solutions to math problems. 
The new format is intended to raise student achievement by forcing schools to 
meet high standards set by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were exhausted after the test," said Judy Foon, a fourth-grade 
teacher at Solano Avenue Elementary near Chinatown. "This test requires them to 
do more critical thinking, so we've been getting geared for the new format." 
</P>
<P>
 Foon said teachers have been using cooperative learning techniques, which 
combine various subjects into the same lesson. For instance, students could be 
asked to write an essay about science or explain a math problem in essay form. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's efforts appear to have paid off. In every subject, Solano 
students surpassed the scores of the 100 schools to which it was compared by 
the state. The state grouped similar schools according to socioeconomic 
factors, student mobility and the percentage of students not proficient in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to other schools, we did well," Foon said. "But we still have room 
to improve -- to raise the achievement of students who didn't do well. It'll be 
a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles school officials expected scores to be somewhat low since 
it was the first time the exam was administered, they were concerned that -- 
based on the results -- so many students appear to lack basic reading, writing 
and math skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Los Angeles students particularly had trouble on the math portion of 
the exam. At least 90% of the fourth-graders at 88 of 158 elementary schools in 
Central Los Angeles scored a 1 or a 2 on the math section, demonstrating little 
or no understanding of math concepts.  
</P>
<P>
 Older students also posted dismal math scores. At least 90% of the 
eighth-graders at 22 of 29 middle schools and 15 of the 27 high schools in 
Central Los Angeles scored 1 or 2 in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor math scores were not limited to inner-city schools. More than 80% of the 
students throughout the district posted math scores of 1 or 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low scores throughout Central Los Angeles, there were a few bright 
spots. For instance, Third Street School in Hancock Park posted among the top 
math scores in the district. Although only 2% of the students at similar 
schools scored a 6 or 5 on the math portion, 13% of the students at Third 
Street demonstrated full understanding of mathematical concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 The school -- which is 55% Asian, 15% Latino, 9% African American and 20% 
white -- also surpassed the scores at similar schools in reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very proud of our school," said Principal Suzie Oh. "We're already 
introducing pre-algebra and geometry in elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
 Students throughout the area tended to do somewhat better in reading and 
writing, but most Central Los Angeles schools still received low scores when 
compared with other schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when matched with comparable schools, schools in Central Los Angeles did 
not fare well. The scores at nearly every area middle and high school were 
lower than those at similar schools. Most elementaries' scores also were lower. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say the scores for inner-city schools do not reflect certain factors 
that could inhibit student achievement. For instance, many students took the 
exam despite being less than fluent in English. And at some schools, scores 
were based only on a small percentage of the student body because of language 
exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 At Politi Elementary School in Koreatown, only 33 of the school's 850 students 
took the test. The test eventually will be given in Spanish, but it is still 
being developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't judge a school's whole educational program based on a small number 
of students," said Politi Principal Richard Alonzo. "You need to test the 
majority, so yes, you need to do it in Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 At least half of the students at 83 elementary schools and eight middle 
schools in Central Los Angeles are deemed limited-English proficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "Central L.A. has a very high concentration of (limited-English) students, so 
you can't say inner-city schools are doing a really bad job," Alonzo said. "In 
this area, we also have a lot of students moving in and out of the schools. 
Poverty is very high, and you have many parents who don't know how to support 
the educational program at school." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to get more parents involved, Alonzo said the school has been 
holding parent education classes. The school has held six parent reading 
classes, in which parents are encouraged to check out books from the school 
library and read them to their children at home. Test of Knowledge 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some sample problems from the California Learning Assessment System: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourth-Grade Writing: Write a letter to the Student Council giving ideas how 
to improve lunch time at your school. . . . Do your best to convince the 
Student Council that your suggestions are good ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourth-Grade Math: Maria wants to buy a 75-cent snack from a vending 
machine. The machine takes only nickels, dimes and quarters. Maria has seven 
nickels, five dimes and two quarters. Show all the different ways she could pay 
for the snack (you may use words, diagrams or charts). Which of your ways uses 
the fewest number of coins? Explain why this is true. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Nine ways with exact change. Two quarters, two dimes and one nickel 
uses fewest coins. * 10th-Grade Math: A game involves two cubes with sides 
numbered from 1 to 6. After throwing the two cubes, the smaller number is 
subtracted from the larger number to find the difference. If a player throws 
the cubes many times, what difference will probably occur most often? Provide a 
diagram and written explanation that you could use to explain to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: 1. Supporting work should show that problem involves 36 possible 
outcomes.

COMMUNITIES COMPETING FOR $100 MILLION IN FUNDING; DEVELOPMENT: ONLY A FRACTION 
OF L.A.'S IMPOVERISHED AREAS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FEDERAL EMPOWERMENT ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A multimillion-dollar federal empowerment zone that would promote economic 
development in Los Angeles will likely be carved into several portions, and 
communities across the city are already jockeying for their piece. 
</P>
<P>
 With its combination of $100 million for social programs and tax incentives 
for businesses in poor areas, the empowerment zone will be the most significant 
federal community-development program in more than 20 years. Although the 
economic effects could be diluted, council members and other city officials 
have said the zone will likely be broken into three pieces, which is permitted 
under federal regulations so long as half of the census tracts have poverty 
rates of 35% or more and the total population does not exceed 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how it is carved up, the 20-square-mile zone will still exclude an 
overwhelming majority of the eligible areas covering 80 square miles in Los 
Angeles. And as a May 15 deadline approaches for the City Council to prepare a 
draft report on which communities will benefit, the battles among competing 
interests have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it won't get too ugly," said Reynold Blight, director of state 
enterprise zone programs for the city's Community Development Department.  
</P>
<P>
 A preview of the competing neighborhood interests came during a March 3 
council hearing, when groups from Watts to Boyle Heights and from Wilmington to 
Pacoima argued to be part of the zone. The hearing was held in advance of a 
Community Development Department report expected to be given this week to the 
council. That report will recommend areas to be included in the city's 
application to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which must 
be turned in by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all fighting for this piece of pie, and I don't know if there is enough 
money to satisfy us all," said Richard Marshall, a member of the Community 
Advisory Council to the 9th Council District in South-Central. He was among 
about 120 people at the hearing of the council's Community and Economic 
Development Committee and the Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, 
which will hold hearings on the empowerment zone report next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been neglected worse than any of these other poverty areas in the 
city," Marshall told council members, arguing for a zone along Central Avenue 
from 5th Street to Slauson Avenue. "I feel we deserve special consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 But the same argument is being made by advocates of a zone on the Eastside, 
who say the only infrastructure development in their area has been the 
construction of freeways that have broken up the neighborhoods of Boyle 
Heights, El Sereno and Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're lobbying for our future," said Frank Villalobos, president of Barrio 
Planners Inc., one of 19 community groups representing the Eastside at the 
March 3 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 groups presented an economic study identifying a five-square-mile area 
with 33,000 residents for consideration as part of the zone. Villalobos said 
the area includes the industrial section of Boyle Heights and runs along the 
Los Angeles River near several freeways and railroad lines, which makes it well 
suited for economic development. The area is also part of a state enterprise 
zone, which provides state tax breaks to businesses within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The same argument is being made by the Los Angeles Community Empowerment 
Collaborative, a coalition of more than 40 community and business organizations 
near USC that formed in November to push for inclusion in the federal program. 
The group wants a portion of the empowerment zone to overlap the city's 
four-square-mile Central City state enterprise zone near USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report submitted to the council, Central City advocates say their area's 
per capita income of $5,407 is the lowest of the city's five state enterprise 
zones and cite the area's proximity to the university and its existing 
industrial and transportation infrastructure as major advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our area has strong economic development potential and many community-based 
organizations," said Ezekiel Mobley, executive director of the Central City 
South Assn. of Commerce and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the problem, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has said 
it wants to file a joint application with the city, possibly for the 
Watts-Willowbrook or Florence-Firestone areas bordering the two jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal empowerment zone program, the city would be allowed to spend 
the $100 million for programs ranging from child care to job training. Also, 
businesses in the zone will be eligible to receive a host of tax incentives. 
They include payroll tax breaks of up to 20% of the wages of workers who live 
in the zone and accelerated depreciation of equipment, allowing owners to write 
off equipment as a tax loss as soon as it is purchased instead of the normal 
five- to seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, hoping to use Los Angeles as a model for its urban 
agenda, has said the city is virtually assured of receiving one of the zones. 
Los Angeles officials have said they also plan to apply for several of the 65 
HUD-designated urban "enterprise communities" that will receive $3 million each 
in assistance. Impoverished Areas 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 square miles in Los Angles have poverty levels making them eligible 
to be included in the city's application for the $100 million empowerment zone 
program. But guidelines set by the federal government will limit the zone to 
only 20 square miles. Central Los Angeles now contains most of the city's 
heavily impoverished areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 19% of residents in Los Angeles live in poverty (the federal government 
defines a family of four earning less than $14,764 as living in poverty.) In 
the most heavily impoverished areas, 38% to 84% of the residents live in 
poverty.

MODIFIED HIGH SCHOOL PLAN FAILS TO PLACATE ALL CRITICS; EDUCATION: ADDITIONAL 
HOUSING IS PART OF THE PROJECT, BUT OPPONENTS CITE ITS PROXIMITY TO BELMONT.

 Building a high school on a hilly 24-acre site in Temple-Beaudry as the school 
district decided to do last week could pose fewer challenges than persuading 
opponents that the $80-million plan is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials touted the proposed 
2,000-student school as a "state-of-the-art" campus that will offer specialized 
training in public and social service, business, health services, art, 
communications and other career fields to students in grades nine through 12. 
The district will spend $30 million to buy the land and $50 million to build 
the school. The property is in escrow and the purchase is expected to be 
completed this month. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Vickie Castro, whose district includes Temple-Beaudry, 
also pushed to have part of the site set aside for affordable housing and 
commercial uses. "This new Belmont Learning Complex will be a tremendous 
resource for this community," Castro said.  
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the plan's additional features, one proponent, Mauricia Miranda 
Flores, president of United Neighbors of Temple-Beaudry, said, "Apartments, 
child care, markets -- I've lived in Temple-Beaudry for 26 years and there's 
nothing like (this project) here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in favor of it," she said. "A lot of children are being bused outside of 
our community, and I want them to come back here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2,000 students in Belmont High School's attendance area are bused to 
San Fernando Valley schools and an additional 600 attend other schools outside 
the area to participate in various voluntary programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The district hopes the new school will relieve overcrowding at Belmont High, 
which has a student enrollment of 4,200. But many see the Temple-Beaudry site 
as a poor choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the community consensus that this is not a good idea," said Father 
Philip Lance, a spokesman for the United Neighborhoods Organization West. "It's 
not because we don't want high schools, but because of the long-range needs of 
that neighborhood for housing. And it's not what's best educationally for 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Building another large high school in the shadow of Belmont High "is a crime," 
Lance said, because it would become another "warehouse," a label that community 
activists and some educators have given the city's large schools because they 
allow too many students to slip through the cracks. Belmont's dropout rate is 
estimated to be 25% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't solve any problems. It won't relieve Belmont's problems," said 
William J. Mavropoulos, a spokesman for Grupo Latino Echo Park, a 
Temple-Beaudry and Echo Park community group. "Most of the kids who go to 
Belmont come from Pico-Union and Koreatown. They don't come from this area. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new school should be built where it's needed, in Koreatown. It will destroy 
this community to warehouse so many students in one area." 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that the district has failed to consider adequately the potential 
problems -- crime, gang rivalries and a parking squeeze -- that could result 
when thousands more students arrive, just blocks from Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeline Janis-Aparicio, community relations director for Local 11 of the 
Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees Union and a member of UNO West, said she 
had "grave concerns" about another high school across the street from one of 
the nation's largest high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has issued a report that said no significant problems would be 
caused by the new school and any negative impacts could be mitigated. But 
Janis-Aparicio said she believes the district needs to invest the time and 
money in a more extensive environmental impact report that would offer detailed 
plans to mitigate potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are compelling reasons for a new school, but it's unfortunate that it 
had to be that site," she said. "What this community fought for is family 
housing."  
</P>
<P>
 Temple-Beaudry had been promised affordable housing as part of a development 
plan put together in the late 1980s known as Central City West, but with the 
anemic real estate market, developers lost interest. The site for the school is 
owned by a group of investors led by the Shimizu Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many in the community have held on to the hope that the blocks of 
housing that were razed to make way for development would be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The four acres set aside in the school district's plan for housing -- Castro's 
goal is 100 to 250 units -- is "just a gesture," Mavropoulos said. "They need 
closer to 800 homes, at least," he said. "That way you'd have a community." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's plan received the backing of Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los 
Angeles) and Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldera has argued that the area's high schools are severely overcrowded and 
that the Temple-Beaudry school is just one of several that should be built. 
Molina's support hinged on Castro's plan to include housing as part of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting the plan's critics is Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), 
who has called for housing instead of a school at the site. He also blasted the 
school board for abandoning its efforts to buy the 24-acre Ambassador Hotel 
site in Mid-Wilshire for a new school. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco, who was recently appointed to the state Allocations Board, which 
controls the purse strings for such projects, vowed to fight the district's 
decision and continue to push for a school at the Ambassador site: 
</P>
<P>
 "I will do everything in my capacity as an allocation board member to make 
sure we do not abandon the Ambassador site and that I do not turn my back on 
the kids and community who four years ago fought so hard for a school in the 
Mid-Wilshire area." New Campus 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District will buy a 24-acre site in the 
Temple-Beaudry area to build a high school.

REDEVELOPMENT PANEL REASSURES RESIDENTS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A residents' advisory panel working with the Community Redevelopment Agency 
reaffirmed last week that if a redevelopment project is established in Wilshire 
Center and Koreatown, residents will not be displaced under the power of 
eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Advisory Committee is considering several proposals prepared by 
the agency, including rehabilitation, development or construction of commercial 
and residential properties and improvement of public facilities.The committee's 
review is part of a process that could lead to the establishment of an 
agency-managed redevelopment project area. 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager H. Cooke Sunoo said the committee was adamant about avoiding 
residential displacement, and the agency agreed that if a redevelopment project 
is approved, it would defer to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do redevelopment without displacement," Sunoo said. "There are enough 
opportunities to do things elsewhere. Sometimes it just requires additional 
creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, the City Council directed the agency to work with residents in 
parts of the city affected by the 1992 riots to explore revitalization 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine whether the nearly 1,800-acre Wilshire Center and Koreatown study 
area meets the criteria for a redevelopment project, the agency's staff has 
begun a survey to look for physical and economic blight. The latter includes 
buildings with high vacancy or depressed rental rates as well as demographic 
data indicating overcrowding and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member committee was appointed by City Council members John Ferraro, 
Nate Holden and Jackie Goldberg. Additional organizational representatives, 
residents and professionals who live or work in the areas and serve on 
committee task forces boost the advisory group's number to 35. 
</P>
<P>
 It meets monthly, and public participation is welcome. The next meeting, at 1 
p.m. April 7 at Southwestern University School of Law, will focus on further 
review of the draft redevelopment plan.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; DRIVERS WILL BE CROSSING A FINE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A photograph may be worth more than a thousand words to the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, as it gears up to fine motorists who illegally cross 
the tracks in front of Blue Line trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is to keep people from making left-hand turns against 
a red left-hand arrow," said Linda Meadow, manager of systems safety for the 
MTA. "A lot of our accidents aren't real serious in terms of fatalities, but 
they hit the train." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which uses cameras mounted atop poles to snap photographs of 
drivers making illegal turns, was started last year in Compton and Long Beach 
after the MTA board began looking at ways to reduce the number of accidents 
along the Blue Line's 22-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a camera was installed at Los Angeles Street and Washington 
Boulevard, a high-level accident zone, at a cost of about $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we chose (photo enforcement) was we did a survey looking at what 
other places were using, such as in Europe," said Meadow. "We found out that 
when you actually take a picture of someone and send it in the mail, it's very 
effective in reducing the number of violators." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 220 accidents involving trains, pedestrians and motorists 
along the Blue line since the light-rail trains began running in 1990. 
Twenty-three people have been killed, Meadow said. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials hope the 150-millimeter lens, protected in a bulletproof box, 
and signs warning motorists of fines will deter drivers from trying to beat the 
trains. The camera provides a close-up of the motorist and his or her license 
plate, plus the time and date of the violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The vendor, American Traffic Systems, has been contracted to install the 
cameras, issue citations and provide follow-up once fines are issued. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, motorists caught on film have been issued warning citations, but that 
is expected to change to a $104 fine as soon as the forms are finalized, Meadow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though officials have touted the program's success in cities such as Compton, 
where the number of infractions has been reduced by as much as 80% over eight 
months, the number of violations has dropped only slightly at Los Angeles 
Street and Washington Boulevard. An MTA report found an average of 2.0 
violations an hour on weekdays before the camera was installed at the 
intersection; the rate dropped to 1.5 violations an hour after the camera was 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants and residents near the intersection do not think the project 
will influence drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will still be accidents. I don't think it'll change because of (the 
camera)," said Martin Gutierrez, manager at Washington Muffler and Radiator 
garage.  
</P>
<P>
 But Meadow insisted that many people welcome the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been out and installing equipment and people come out and talk," she 
said, "We've gotten an excellent response." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: IT'S BACK TO SCHOOL FOR 100 PARENTS 
</P>

 The new students were lining up to register at Foshay Middle School last week, 
and for many, it is their first time back to school in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter goes to school here so it just worked out perfect that I come 
here because I pick her up from school every day," said Deborah Pleasant, who 
was among the more than 100 parents who registered for adult classes Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The free classes are part of Foshay's Family Center, which opened in January. 
The center offers basic math, literacy classes, English as a Second Language 
and Saturday workshops for families in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center is where parents come to feel comfortable," said Principal Howard 
Lappin. "So far, the response indicates this is something they wanted. We 
didn't have to go out and pull them in." 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant agreed with Lappin, adding that the practical orientation of the 
classes offered is what drew her to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned some great tips on money management," she said, referring to a 
one-day workshop she attended earlier this year. "They covered everything from 
insurance to bank accounts and they talked about making a budget for yourself. 
I found it to be very useful." 
</P>
<P>
 The classes and center are an outgrowth of what began last fall as informal 
meetings among parents, said Debra Laidley, director of the Family Center and 
an ESL teacher at Foshay. Parents and Lappin discussed ways to provide adult 
classes for area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is operating out of two classrooms that were transformed into an 
office and classroom. The staff is composed of five parents who work part time 
and three adult-school teachers. The first year's $75,000 budget is part of a 
five-year state grant Foshay received, Lappin said. A portion of that money has 
been earmarked for increasing parent participation at Foshay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laidley said the center's goal remains simple: educating parents translates 
into educating children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to have a community of lifelong learners here," she said. "When 
you have parents participate and saying education is important, that sends a 
very powerful message to their kids that education is important."

 The recent demise of the Common Ground Foundation's major sponsor has thrown 
the Watts-based dropout prevention program into a financial tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Common Ground received about 85% of its funding from Cross 
Colours, the hip-hop denim clothing company. But the end of Threads 4 Life, the 
parent company of Cross Colours, has left Common Ground's founder searching for 
other funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a stranger to struggle," said Fred Williams, 35, the founder and 
executive director of Common Ground. "We lost the sponsorship, and that's hard 
because they were a major funder." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said Cross Colours officials were giving his foundation about 
$160,000 a year, which covered his $40,000-a-year salary and salaries for six 
workers in the foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a contract and it was sweet. It was too sweet to let go," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life, the City of Commerce company that produced the Cross Colours 
clothing line, was forced to sell all of its manufacturing operations this 
month to cope with mounting financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was approached by Carl Jones, president and founder of Cross Colours, 
in 1991. Jones and T. J. Walker, the other name behind Cross Colours, signed a 
five-year contract with Williams, which was due to expire in 1996, and 
sponsored several events with Williams including an 18-hour "Stop the Violence" 
job-a-thon for inner-city teen-agers soon after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Jones nor Walker could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the demise of Threads 4 Life and the company's funding of Common 
Ground will not mean the end of his organization, which has retrieved more than 
30,000 youths from the streets and put them back in school since it was founded 
in 1988, Williams said. After a nearly monthlong hiatus from his organization, 
Williams said he is working on restructuring Common Ground and will begin 
working on finding new sponsors. LUCILLE RENWICK

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; YOUTH GOSPEL CHOIR WINS PRAISE IN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Europeans were singing the praises of Crenshaw High School's Elite Choir after 
its recent whirlwind tour of the Continent, where it packed concert halls and 
churches from the banks of the Rhine to the City of Light. 
</P>
<P>
 In its last performance of the two-week tour, beneath the flying buttresses of 
Paris' American Cathedral, the blue-robed choir lifted every voice in a city 
better known for haute couture than down-home harmonizing. From the altar of 
the cavernous cathedral in the city's fashionable 8th District, a bunch of kids 
from the Crenshaw area rocked the house, as they had done in Germany and the 
Netherlands on other stops in last month's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 With a mix of high-energy gospel, blues, jazz, African music and Broadway show 
tunes, the performance was part rock concert, part revival. The students sang 
some of their selections in French and German. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had great welcomes everyplace we went," said Iris Stevenson, music 
director and teacher at Crenshaw High. She said that in Mannheim, Germany, the 
group drew a crowd of more than 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students in Stevenson's choir and band classes has swelled from 
12 to more than 700 in the nine years that she has been at Crenshaw. For this 
tour there were about 45 students, some of whom were joined onstage during the 
concert by family members. 
</P>
<P>
 The students helped raise funds to pay their way, with a personal donation 
from Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, whose work with the youths inspired the story for Whoopi Goldberg's 
"Sister Act 2," sometimes uses her own money to help pay for trips. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, the group has traveled to Nice and the Caribbean, 
winning the Jamaican Jazz Festival four years in a row, and has appeared on 
"The Arsenio Hall Show" and HBO's "Chez Whoopi." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochanda Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Crenshaw, was enjoying her first 
visit to Europe. "It has been really exciting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, more than 800 people packed the cathedral for the free performance 
Feb. 27, with nearly a thousand more spilling onto the sidewalk outside hoping 
to get in. They got their wish after the choir agreed to a second, unscheduled 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the concert-goers were Parisians, with a smattering of 
American expatriates. Women in Chanel suits and pearl chokers sat next to 
university students wearing ripped jeans. But most did not sit for long. By the 
end of the second performance, they were clapping wildly, and some Parisians 
were uncharacteristically standing on the pews in the 19th-Century church. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffroy Mauze, a French student, said he was electrified by the performance. 
"You close your eyes and you are captivated, hypnotized," he said. "I hope that 
more people in Europe will begin to appreciate this music." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson directed the choir from behind the piano, where the composer and 
professional pianist alternately tickled and pounded the ivories while coaxing 
the singers to keep up the furious pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakisha Blackmon, a 17-year-old senior, delivered a knockout blow backed by 
the choir with "Help Somebody," a song that had many in the crowd -- and 
Nakisha -- in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students heaped praise for their success on two things -- God and 
Iris Stevenson. 'She is like a gift to us," Nakisha said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says a choir is like a family," said 17-year-old senior Chad McDonald, a 
baritone who plans to study opera after graduation. "And it is." MELISSA McCOY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; GARMENT FACTORY OWNER SENTENCED

<P>
 A local garment factory owner will serve 80 hours of community service and pay 
a $1,000 fine after pleading no contest to a charge of manufacturing knockoffs 
of the Karl Kani and Cross Colours denim clothing lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Song Suk Park, 51, owner of Victory Fashions at 425 West 11th St., pleaded no 
contest in Los Angeles Municipal Court Monday to one misdemeanor count of 
counterfeiting a trademark. She must complete the community service and 
reimburse the city for its investigation by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the roughly $200,000 worth of fake designer clothing seized from 
Victory Fashions in June will be donated to charities and nonprofit groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Municipal Court Commissioner Barry Kohn placed Victory Fashions' 
manager, Manuel Enrique Sagastume, who is also charged with one count of 
counterfeiting a trademark, on a six-month diversion program. If Sagastume, 36, 
obeys all laws during that period, the court will dismiss the case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagastume is a resident of the Wilshire district, and Park, who is also known 
as Son Suk Knepley, Song Suk Yoon and Song Suk Kim, has homes in Cerritos and 
central Los Angeles, city prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park and Sagastume were charged after an employee of Threads 4 Life, until 
this month the parent company of Karl Kani and Cross Colours, stumbled on the 
counterfeit operation at Victory Fashions during a visit to another business in 
the same 11th Street building, city prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life officials complained to the state Department of Justice Bureau 
of Investigation, which searched Victory Fashions on June 16 and found 1,508 
counterfeit Karl Kani pants and a number of Karl Kani and Cross Colours rivets, 
labels, buttons and zippers, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothing, worth $227,000, was ready for shipment to Chicago, said Darryl 
Phillips, special agent for the Department of Justice's trademark infringement 
unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Victory Fashions is one of more than a dozen counterfeiters in Los Angeles 
alone being criminally prosecuted or sued in civil court by Threads 4 Life. 
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life was forced to sell all of its manufacturing operations this 
month to cope with mounting financial difficulties. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; CLEANUP SWEEPS UP CRIME, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners in the garment and flower districts say a pilot program that 
hires the homeless to clean and help patrol the streets has been a success in 
sprucing up the area and reducing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope the program's success will persuade more property owners to 
contribute money to keep the program afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly formed Downtown Property Owners Assn. initiated the Clean and Safe 
program in August in the hope that by cleaning up the area and providing a more 
visible presence, it could improve the area's image, promote safer streets, 
revive the neighborhood and prevent flight of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has employed 43 former or currently homeless people to pick up 
litter, paint over graffiti and steam-clean sidewalks in a 10-block area 
bounded by 7th, 12th, San Julian and Main streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean and Safe organizers also hired their own bicycle patrol team by 
contracting security guards through Wells Fargo Guard Service to cycle daily 
through the streets and help the Los Angeles Police Department officers by 
reporting crimes. The 10 uniformed security guards are equipped with radios to 
communicate directly with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Robert Villarino credited Clean and Safe and other similar 
improvement programs initiated by local organizations for a marked drop in 
Downtown crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall crime decreased 21% from Jan. 1 to Feb. 7 compared with the same 
period last year, Villarino said. The number of robberies dropped by 18% last 
month, compared with last year, while auto thefts dropped 49%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One area with room for improvement is funding, said Marianne Giblin, associate 
director of the Downtown Property Owners Assn., which formed last May. Of the 
organization's 250 Eastside members, only about 65% donated money to the Clean 
and Safe program, Giblin said. Their $105,000 in contributions funded the 
program for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Community Redevelopment Agency contributed $25,000, and City Council 
members Rita Walters and Richard Alatorre found funds to provide $25,000 each. 
But that $75,000 in city donations has been used, Giblin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association hopes to form an assessment district in which each property 
owner would pay a mandatory assessment toward public-improvement projects. The 
association and Chrysalis homeless assistance agency, which hired the workers, 
are seeking local and federal grants, Giblin said. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; STUDENTS CHECK IN ON HOTEL CAREER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed smartly in a maroon jacket with gold details, miniature hotel doorman 
Ivan Felix gleefully demonstrated that he had already mastered the Hyatt touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," the fifth-grader said of his half-hour stint as a doorman at the 
Hyatt Regency. "I open doors for taxis, cars . . . and you make lots of money!" 
With that, Ivan pulled a dollar bill out of his pocket to show off his first 
tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan and 27 of his classmates from Woodlawn Elementary School in Bell visited 
the hotel at 711 S. Hope St. Wednesday and took part in Hyatt's Career Day, 
during which youngsters learn what it is like to work at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Hotels and Resorts initiated Career Day a few years ago as one way 
of reaching out to the community. Not all of the chain's hotels hold the event 
every year, but the Hyatt Regency Downtown has been an enthusiastic participant 
for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a learning day," said Chantal Mariotti, the hotel's director of human 
resources. "We want to get involved in education in the community. And the 
employees love it." 
</P>
<P>
 The program teaches about and encourages careers in the hotel industry while 
stressing "staying in school," Mariotti said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Woodlawn teacher Dolores Beltran, whose husband Philip works as a 
sous-chef at the hotel, the event provided an interesting way to teach her 
students, many of whom are immigrants who speak limited English, how to 
contribute to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon their arrival, Mariotti provided a brief orientation. "Who has ever 
stayed in a hotel?" Mariotti asked the polite group. Two students shyly raised 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mariotti asked what people do in a hotel, the students responded: "They 
watch TV, eat something, sleep. . . ." And "They go to honeymoon!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," Mariotti said, as the children laughed. "A hotel is just like a 
city, and it's just like a house." 
</P>
<P>
 The students were then handed gold-bar name tags, which they could take home, 
and their pint-sized uniforms -- replicas of the adult uniforms -- sewn by the 
hotel seamstress. Using a list of student names, Mariotti two weeks ago 
randomly assigned each student to an employee -- a cook, a desk clerk or even 
the general manager. Mariotti set a rule that tips collected by the junior 
employees must be pooled to pay for a pizza party later for all the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Student cooks Juan Ramon and Irayda Ileana learned another rule from executive 
sous-chef Sayed Moalemi: "In the kitchen, everyone has to have a uniform and a 
hat." Fitted with the tall chef hats, Juan and Irayda went to work dishing up 
food for a banquet. "Fifty-three plates!" said a smiling Juan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martha Daysi and Raul Mercado helped room service waiter Rudy 
Borrayo collect trays left outside rooms by guests. Clad in short, light-green 
jackets, the three rode up the service elevator, stopping on each of the 20 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Borrayo gather the first few trays, Raul was ready to give it a 
try. He sped out of the elevator and down the hall to a tray laden with plates, 
glasses and a carafe. But the tray's weight made him stop and beckon Martha. 
The two came down the hall holding the tray between them, the picture of 
teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for role models, and what they see at home is such a limited 
vision," said hotel General Manager Jerry Simmons, a former professional 
football player who himself worked his way up the Hyatt hierarchy from his 
first job as a part-time steward. 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees agreed that many adults do not know about hotel job 
opportunities. "More people need to come into hotels, especially from the inner 
cities," said Jessie Gayden, assistant director of catering. "People don't know 
these jobs are available." 
</P>
<P>
 But Simmons said he emphasized a more generic career tip as he showed a 
student around his office: "We stress fun -- work should be fun -- and that you 
should love what you do." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; LATINO UNITY IS GOAL OF CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Latino Unity Forum has invited organizations from throughout the county to 
form a Latino Federation at a Saturday conference at Cal State Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The Unity Forum was formed after the 1992 riots by local activists who 
believed attention and resources would not be delivered to the Eastside because 
few riot-related incidents were reported there.They argued that local 
unemployment and poverty should not be overlooked in the effort to assist 
riot-torn neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that summer, forum members have met with organizations representing 
Latino interests from throughout the county to coordinate efforts and improve 
communication, said coordinator Hector Perez-Pacheco. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the Jewish Federation of Southern California, Chicano 
Federation in San Diego and the Hispanic Federation in New York will describe 
their organizations' goals to help the groups decide what they want from their 
own federation, Perez-Pacheco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, it was the groups and organizations from the East L.A. area 
and some from Pico-Union who met, but now we've got people from Pomona, the San 
Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley. And out of this conference, a 
federation will be formed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9 a.m.-to-3 p.m. meeting is at the Student Union. Cal State LA is at 5151 
State University Drive.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; A MODEL LESSON IN CITY PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like countless city planners before them, third- and fourth-grade students at 
Utah Street Elementary School have been trying to fit everything they want into 
the three-dimensional city that takes up a corner of their classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 They have decided they do not want guns, drugs, pollution, gangs, trash or 
alcohol. But they do want enough homes for everyone. And the biggest dilemma of 
all is where to put Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are working on an "instant city" that sits on a topographical 
replica of Central Los Angeles, with the Los Angeles River and the hills of 
Boyle Heights to the east and the steep Bunker Hill to the west. The city has 
been cut into jigsaw pieces, with each student owning a parcel to build 
housing, streets, parks and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The project started shortly after Christmas break with a $10,000 grant from 
Catellus Development, which is developing 50 acres near Union Station. With the 
grant, husband-and-wife instructors Stephen and Velora Brown, who teach a 
combined third- and fourth-grade class, have bought books on architecture and 
will continue the project for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to set up a micro-society," Stephen Brown said. "We have a model 
in a physical sense, and we're trying to set up a society in the other senses 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Buttons tacked into the green-painted plastic foam grass have become flowers, 
Ping-Pong balls on sticks are street lights, and recycled cereal boxes serve as 
houses and hotels.  
</P>
<P>
 The students are in the process of building enough housing for 10,000 people, 
or 160 residents for each parcel. Streets made of cardboard have cars tacked 
onto them made from the same material. Many of the children built churches. One 
included a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica Garcia, 8, created a red-and-white rainbow out of twisted pipe cleaners 
and arched it over her plot. Her friend Paloma Robles, 9, has a freeway running 
through her plot and has planted button flowers throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 And Adan Anguiano, 8, made a hotel for 200 people out of an empty Frosted 
Flakes box. "There's people in here, not corn flakes," he explained to a 
visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend, Oscar Renteria, 9, who designed his plot with a movie set in mind, 
accused him of overcrowding the hotel, but Adan insisted that the building 
offered plenty of room. 
</P>
<P>
 The students had elections Friday to choose a mayor, librarian, banker, school 
board, recreation leader and others to help run their city and classroom more 
smoothly. They are learning about what government is supposed to do and how it 
is supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they will decide where their residents will work, whether there will be 
an industrial zone and where it will go. They must figure out other factors 
that go into running a city and improving the lives of its people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They own property, pay for their property, do banking," Brown said. "I really 
feel that they will be more sophisticated about what goes on in the world."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; EX-DROPOUTS GET A 'JUMP START' ON JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a recent job interview session, students enrolled in a mentoring and 
educational program at Garfield Community Adult School asked banking executives 
what it would take to secure jobs such as theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 One asked how the bank would view a potential employee with a prison record, 
and how he could put it behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer was: Focus on the present and everything you've done in a positive 
manner," said Bart Zitnitsky, a Northern Trust Bank vice president who serves 
on the Operation Jump Start program's board of directors. "They have made the 
initial step to get back into the program (after dropping out of school). They 
deserve the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Jump Start are enrolled in the adult school's Alternative 
Education Work Center to earn their high school diplomas. The nonprofit, 
12-week program gives them a chance to meet business executives, take field 
trips and focus on long-term goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Private donations fund the program, which costs about $250 per student. 
Several corporations have "adopted" Jump Start, providing funding and lending 
executives to address the students. 
</P>
<P>
 At their weekly meetings, the students and Executive Director Rafael Beer 
discuss time management, setting goals, learning to trust other people and 
having hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success is not out of the reach of these students," Beer said. "We help them 
develop confidence in their own ability to achieve the success they want, while 
at the same time gain an understanding of the need for becoming socially 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 A one-day trip to Stoney Point in Chatsworth provided the students with an 
exercise in trust. They experienced trust falls: one of them falling into the 
arms of the rest of the group. And then they went rappelling, which involved 
working with and trusting others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my doubts," said student Christina Hernandez, 17. "But I felt more 
trust after that. Now, I see people and I look at people differently. Before I 
wouldn't trust them, now, I'll trust them and see if they trust me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe more in myself than before I went into the program," said Edgar 
Montano, 18, who hopes to earn his diploma in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Montano, who has taken classes at the work center for two years, is one of 15 
students from the alternative education program who joined Jump Start last 
fall. "It helps you think more about goals," he said, adding that he has his 
sights set on attending a trade school. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the program's highlights was last month's mock job interview session at 
Northern Trust in Westwood. The students dressed up for the session and said 
they came away with a better understanding of the working world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone had gone through a job interview before," said Ray Chaparro, 19. 
"We had to learn how to dress, how to behave, how to present yourself in the 
interview process. They showed us how their 9-to-5 world works."  
</P>
<P>
 And the students held their own, the interviewers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They showed some of the responses you want to hear from people who you want 
to work for you," Zitnitsky said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 A small group of hard-working fifth-graders were to meet at 5 this morning at 
Miles Avenue Elementary to start the trip of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23 youngsters from the nation's largest elementary school were setting out 
on an all-expenses-paid trip into history. This week, they will explore 
national landmarks in Washington, New York City and Philadelphia as part of the 
school's sixth annual Freedoms Foundation Program. The Freedoms Foundation at 
Valley Forge promotes the nation's heritage through educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is an honor, not a vacation, said Gloria Hanson, school project 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The students reported on 20 historical sites and personalities, memorized Maya 
Angelou's inaugural poem, "This Bright Morning Dawning," and learned patriotic 
songs as part of the months of preparation for the trip. They can tell you 
where Abraham Lincoln was shot. And even how many chairs are in the White House 
dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Avenue and Euclid Avenue Elementary in Boyle Heights are the only two 
Los Angeles area schools to participate in the program, said Bob Jones, a 
fifth-grade teacher who coordinates the program with teacher Arlene Peta. 
</P>
<P>
 School fund-raisers have paid for the students' air fare and lodging, which 
amounted to nearly $20,000, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are interviewed and evaluated for their effort, progress in school 
and maturity before being selected for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not just straight-A students, Jones said. "These are kids who 
basically work hard and who strove to go on this trip. Every child knows about 
it since kindergarten." 
</P>
<P>
 Each student will keep a journal and will brief their classmates and program 
sponsors when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Correa, 11, said he has been watching nightly TV newscasts so he would 
be abreast of current events in case he met President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get information to pass along to future kids if I become a 
teacher," Daniel said. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime event." MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL; LIBRARY OPEN AGAIN ON TUESDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bell Community Library will now be open Tuesdays, thanks to a deal the 
city has negotiated with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The library has been open just two days a week since state budget cuts forced 
the county government to cut library and other services last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is owned by the city but staffed by county personnel. Under the 
new agreement, the city will accept an extra day of county library services 
each week in exchange for rent, said Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was paying $2,046 a month in rent and recently calculated the cost 
of operations at $700 a day, Rizzo said. Keeping the library open through the 
fiscal year will cost the city $11,200. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Trish Casjens, who is also president of the Friends of the Library, 
said the few additional hours will make a big difference for patrons. "It's our 
place of culture in town and it's important to keep it open," Casjens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through June 21, the library hours are 1 to 8 p.m. Monday and Tuesday and 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursday. MARY HELEN BERG

 Former City Clerk Martha Ochoa has filed a lawsuit against the city and Mayor 
Frank Duran alleging sex, race and age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa served as clerk from April, 1992, until she was dismissed from the 
$48,000-a-year position by the City Council last May. She received three 
months' severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa was the second city clerk to be fired within 13 months, and one of 
several top administrators to lose their jobs during the tumultuous months 
following the historic 1991 recall of four City Council members and subsequent 
election of recall movement leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint filed March 3 in Superior Court states that Duran fostered 
"demoralizing and derogatory treatment of women and people of color" at City 
Hall and that he verbally abused and intimidated female and minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint further alleges that Ochoa was fired after refusing to perform 
an unspecified "task which was illegal and unethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran dispute the charges. He said Ochoa was dismissed because her work was 
"not up to par." 
</P>
<P>
 "The charges have no merit," he said. "I've never been anything other than 
respectful to the lady. . . . I never said anything to the lady that would 
cause her to do anything but a better job." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Michael Estrada would not comment on the pending litigation, but 
City Manager Charles Gomez called Ochoa's charges "bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 "It mystifies me," he said, pointing out that Ochoa, a Mexican American, is 
charging Duran, who is also Latino, with racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa's complaint is not the first time Duran has been charged with sexism. In 
a run-in last year that has become part of the city's political lore, 
then-Mayor Josie Macias hurled a chair at Duran during a closed council 
session, complaining that she was disgusted by his allegedly sexist attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa is seeking unspecified punitive damages, according to the 20-page 
complaint. She could not be reached for comment. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS 25-STORY HOTEL 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council last week gave a green light to the construction of a 
$115-million, 25-story hotel, office and commercial project, despite some 
members' objections that the massive development deserved more scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the Pacific Trade Center at Western Avenue and Olympic Boulevard 
say the 587,000-square-foot development will become a Koreatown landmark, 
generate more business in the area and provide 1,400 jobs and millions in 
revenues and fees for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that the project is too big for the neighborhood and will snarl 
traffic in an already congested area while siphoning off business and 
development from Wilshire Center, designated in city plans as the regional 
center for such high-rise projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Trade Center will be a joint project of a Korean and American 
partnership, said consultant King Woods. Previously approved by the City 
Planning Commission and the council's Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee, it required the council's approval for zone and General Plan changes 
because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez sought a two-week continuance of the matter to allow 
for more study, a sentiment echoed by several other council members. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Nate Holden, whose district includes the project area, 
squelched the request for a continuance. He said it was unfair to the project's 
developers and supporters to delay it because there had been ample time for 
review as the project moved through the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either want to rebuild L.A. or you don't," said an irate Holden. "You 
either vote it up or down." 
</P>
<P>
 With that high-noon challenge, a vote was called. The result was 10-3 for 
approval, with Hernandez and Councilwomen Rita Walters and Laura Chick voting 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 A second vote next week is necessary for final approval of the project, but 
requires only a simple majority -- eight votes -- to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the project included Mayor Richard Riordan, RLA, trade groups 
representing construction workers, the Koreatown Assn., the Country Club Park 
Neighborhood Assn. and the Miracle Mile Apartment and Commercial Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics included several hotels in Koreatown, the Koreatown Committee for 
Planned Growth and PLAN/LA, an alliance of homeowners' associations. JAKE

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION; HOMES MAY NOT BE IN CITY LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pico-Union residents inched closer to victory in a housing tug of war last 
week as the City Council sought to exempt a new development from a policy that 
would have awarded apartments to the winners of a citywide lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, residents in the Pico-Union 1 and 2 redevelopment project areas are 
now likely to be put at the top of the list for the Crescent Court apartments, 
an advantage they say they are entitled to based on Community Redevelopment 
Agency promises and the original redevelopment plan for the area adopted in 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescent Court is a 32-unit rental townhouse complex on a two-acre parcel at 
12th Place and Valencia Street, funded by a variety of sources, including an 
agency loan and federal tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The city last year adopted an agency-drafted policy that had sought to avoid 
discrimination in selecting residents for public housing developments through a 
variety of measures, including a citywide lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the Pico-Union residents' advisory panels protested that the 
agency's staff never informed them of the change in the original policy, which 
they said promised to consider residents of the project areas on "a 
preferential basis over non-residents." The agency's staff conceded a lack of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the City Council, several Pico-Union residents spoke of 
overcrowded and substandard living conditions and the promises of housing made 
to residents, especially those displaced by other redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the whole pie, we only want a piece of the pie," Julio Rivera, 
11, a Pico-Union resident who shares a one-room apartment with four family 
members, told the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez, who opposed the citywide lottery for this project, 
said Bradley G. Booth, chief counsel of the state Department of Fair Employment 
and Housing, told him that a restriction of the selection process could be 
justified if specific criteria are met. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Hernandez, Booth said, "Demographics and statistics regarding 
the density of the neighborhood and the tremendous impact that has on the 
citizens' quality of life, not to mention the increased burden on the city, 
could be sufficient justification to limit the participants to the lottery." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on 1990 census data, large portions of Pico-Union's residential areas 
suffer overcrowding at a rate greater than three times the city average, 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency held the lottery Feb. 18, but -- at the request of the City Council 
-- has refrained from notifying any of the people selected. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council's direction, the city attorney's office is gathering 
information to make the case that Crescent Court should be exempted from the 
agency's policy. Those findings are to be presented at Wednesday's council 
meeting. JAKE DOHERTY

COVER STORY; CRITICA CARE; IN HOSPITALS AROUND CENTRAL LOS ANGELES, THE 
MAJORITY OF SICKLY INFANTS IN NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE ARE BORN TO ECONOMICALLY 
DISADVANTAGED MOTHERS. MANY OF THE BABIES ARE PREMATURE AND UNDERDEVELOPED. BUT 
THE COMMONLY HELD PERCEPTION THAT MOST OF THEM ARE THE RESULT OF MOTHERS 
ABUSING DRUGS IS NO LONGER THE CASE, SAY NEONATALOGISTS, WHO CITE THE 
WIDESPREAD LACK OF PRENATAL CARE. "THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IF YOU'RE 
UNDERPRIVILEGED, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY WITH A LOW BIRTH WEIGHT," SAYS ONE 
DOCTOR. "AND THE CHANCES OF YOUR BABY GOING INTO ICU ARE GOING TO BE HIGH." 
</P>

<P>
 Isis Thomas lay cradled in her mother's arms in the neonatal intensive care 
unit at Childrens Hospital, IV lines piercing her tiny arms and stomach and a 
breathing tube down her throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Every incubator and crib in the small 10-bed ICU is occupied with babies like 
Isis -- underweight, underdeveloped infants, many born premature and with 
several complications. 
</P>
<P>
 In hospitals around Central Los Angeles, the vast majority of these tiny, 
sickly infants in neonatal intensive care units are born to economically and 
socially disadvantaged mothers, many of whom have limited access to or are 
unaware of the importance of proper prenatal care, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although drug abuse by pregnant women was once among the most common causes of 
infants in need of critical -- and expensive -- neonatal care, other factors 
are now becoming more prevalent in cases of severely ill newborns, some of whom 
will be afflicted with minor problems for most of their lives. And those 
factors -- most of which are avoidable -- are taking their toll on hospitals, 
taxpayers and, most important, young lives. 
</P>
<P>
 An approximate bill to care for one child for two weeks in a neonatal ICU in a 
Central Los Angeles hospital runs about $21,000, most of which is paid for by 
taxpayers because the majority of the parents are poor. While most of the 
neonatal ICU patients live long and somewhat normal lives, a good portion of 
them could have avoided ending up in the intensive care units had their mothers 
taken proper preventive care that costs thousands less, doctors and advocates 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that if you're underprivileged, you're going to have a baby 
with a low birth weight and the chances of your baby going into ICU are going 
to be high," said Dr. Gabriel Escobar of the Permanente Medical Group Division 
of Research in Oakland. "But the issues that lead up to that are not so black 
and white, there are many gray areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Isis falls into one of those gray areas. The baby was born full term, and 
doctors found problems while her mother, Clarice Thomas, was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took an ultrasound and found out that the baby's spine was crooked and 
that I would have to have a (Cesarean) section because she wouldn't make it 
through the birth canal," said Thomas, 39, of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-month-old Isis now suffers from a bad kidney and deformity of her right 
arm, among other ailments. She must be fed through a tube in her stomach and 
requires a tracheal tube to breathe, two of several problems that will remain 
with her for her entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Arnold Platzker, head of neonatology and pediatric pulmonology at 
Childrens Hospital, said it is uncertain what could have caused so many 
complications in the baby. It is a rare case, he said. Most infants in neonatal 
intensive care units are born premature, with birth weights as low as 1 pound, 
4 ounces and multiple problems that sometimes continue with them through life, 
Platzker said.  
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for prematurity in infants are myriad, doctors say, and are not 
genetically or ethnically dictated. It is partly attributable to lifestyle, 
poor diet, youth of mothers, drug abuse, health problems such as diabetes, rare 
genetic problems and lack of prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood health clinics and agencies face an uphill battle in spreading 
the word about the necessity of proper care. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Bevilacqua, a health care worker at La Clinica Sunol in East Los Angeles, 
said the center has a constant flow of more than 200 women from the community 
who seek prenatal services, many of whom are illegal immigrants. However, 
Rodolfo Diaz, executive director of the Community Health Foundation of East Los 
Angeles, said it remains difficult getting some illegal immigrants to seek care 
because some believe that workers will turn them in to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Zola Jones of the Crenshaw-based Great Beginnings for Black Babies said that 
many of her predominantly African American clients who manage to make their way 
to one of her agency's two locations often bring a deficient history of medical 
care with them.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is more of a lack of knowledge about prenatal providers," Jones said. 
"Women, all women, who are without insurance or not accustomed to getting 
regular medical care don't usually know where to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Great Beginnings' workers have started going door to door in neighborhoods, 
canvassing at-risk pregnant women at check-cashing shops and on the streets to 
get them to seek care. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are definitely people out there who need to come in for help, because 
the infant mortality rate is still too high," Jones said. "So we're trying to 
get the word out." 
</P>
<P>
 One recurrent problem is that mothers who are in pre-term labor often do not 
go to the hospital until it is too late to save the baby from serious 
complications, said Dr. Xylina Bean, a neonatologist and director of the Rosa 
Parks Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Martin Luther King.-Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Others don't seek care until they start showing, or they miss appointments. 
Neonatologists say even the most basic prenatal care -- which includes proper 
diet, exercise and taking any necessary medication -- could make a significant 
difference in a newborn. Behavior modification is also sometimes necessary to 
cut out damaging habits. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, alcohol and smoking are most detrimental to fetuses, sometimes 
even more so than drug abuse, doctors say. Women from poor, low-income 
households smoke more than three times as much as those who abuse drugs or 
alcohol, doctors say, citing reports from the American Lung Assn. and the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of drug babies is serious, but tobacco is even more severe," 
Escobar said. "This is the major cause of low birth weight in the U.S. The 
combination of drugs or alcohol, tobacco and lack of access (to prenatal care) 
leads to high-risk indigent babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control show that low birth 
weight ranked as the principal cause of death among African American babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also noted that poverty is largely to blame for higher infant 
mortality rates among blacks, particularly among families who have limited 
access to medical care and are not covered by health insurance. In Central Los 
Angeles, the infant mortality rate for 1992, the most recent figures available, 
was 8.9 per 1,000 births, compared to 7.8 per 1,000 countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant mortality rate is determined by the number of deaths from birth to 
age 1. It combines the neonatal rate, which includes babies who die between 
birth and 28 days, and the post-neonatal rate, which covers deaths between 28 
days and 1 year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said a little-known cause of neonatal problems among immigrant mothers is 
difficulty in acclimating to new environments. The longer they live here, the 
more they suffer from the medical problems common among Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you begin to take on the same patterns of behavior as the populations 
around you, then your risk tends to become the same as that population," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean said that although Latinos currently have a low rate of prematurity 
compared to African Americans, those numbers are likely to increase in future 
generations without greater access to prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stress (in poor communities) has always been put forward as a major problem 
in the environment. Just the stress of living in a hostile environment clearly 
plays a role in producing premature labor," she said. "But whatever the reason, 
the numbers of preemies is still high and it taxes our resources."  
</P>
<P>
 At Childrens Hospital, County-USC Women's Hospital and King-Drew Medical 
Center, there is rarely a vacant bed among the 160 in their neonatal intensive 
care units, where 90% of the babies are from impoverished families. 
</P>
<P>
 At King-Drew, for example, of the approximately 9,000 babies born each year, 
about 500 end up in the neonatal ICU, where they are hooked up to ventilators, 
monitors and feeding tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 As she walked through the neonatal ICU at King-Drew, which opened in June, 
Bean playfully spoke to the dozens of infants and remarked on the progress and 
outcome of each. Only 18% to 20% of the babies in the unit are drug-exposed, 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of these tiny, sickly babies are born after just 23 to 26 weeks 
gestation. They arrive with problems including infections, brain damage and 
birth defects. And the price tag for care is expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs an average of $1,500 to $2,000 a day to care for children in a 
neonatal intensive care unit. Full prenatal care for one mother would cost the 
same amount, said Diaz, of Community Health Foundation in East L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 The stays in neonatal ICUs range from three days to five months or longer. 
Many families, including Thomas and her husband, Prue, have to rely on Medi-Cal 
or Medicare to handle the exorbitant costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomases had no medical insurance during the pregnancy or Isis' birth and 
applied for Medi-Cal in December to cover the thousands of dollars it has cost 
and will cost to care for their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The head of the (neonatal intensive care) unit said she'll be having 
operations until she's 16," Clarice Thomas said of her daughter, who has been 
in the hospital since she was born Oct. 29. "I appreciate the taxpayers helping 
care for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Barajas of South-Central relies on Medi-Cal and low-cost social service 
agencies to help cover the cost of doctors' visits and a leg brace for her son, 
Rolando, 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolando was born five months into his mother's pregnancy after she had a fall 
that induced labor. Rolando has trouble moving the right side of his body and 
was recently diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Barajas said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of his leg brace and going to a special school, Rolando 
does not have extensive problems that require enormous amounts of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Isis goes home, she will need care around the clock, plus various medical 
machinery to keep her alive, Platzker said. Her parents are preparing their 
house and themselves for her release from the hospital, which is still 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate that she's so sick," Clarice Thomas said. "I knew something was wrong, 
but I never anticipated it would be this bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts because I planned to have this baby," she said. "I watched my 
health, went to the doctor, took my medication, was very careful. But it just 
seems it couldn't have been helped."  
</P>
<P>
 Some cases are avoidable, doctors and health experts say. The best way is by 
increasing preventive education and access to medical and prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The portion of the health-care dollar consumed by preventive education 
programs like prenatal care is inconsequential in comparison to the resources 
required to care for a drug-impaired infant," said Dr. Norman B. Duerbeck, 
director of maternal-fetal medicine at White Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A report issued in December from the recently defunct National Commission to 
Prevent Infant Mortality said prenatal care is essential to solving the problem 
of neonatal care and infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue goes beyond increasing access to prenatal care, said Bean of 
King-Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasing access alone doesn't solve the problem," she said. "It doesn't 
allow you to reach the hard-to-reach, at-risk populations. You have to modify 
their behavior to how they approach health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching these populations means finding ways to make them want to seek health 
care, either by bringing it into their housing projects or communities, or 
developing an incentive program that would encourage them to visit health 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neonatal care is a service that is needed and will never go away, because 
there are those unavoidable incidents," Bean added. "And disadvantaged families 
are always going to be around as long as there is a division between rich and 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is a very possible way to reduce the number of disadvantaged 
infants that become part of the neonatal ICU patient list," she said, "and we 
have to move in that direction soon or else our resources will be worn thin." 
On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 An infant is hooked up to a monitor in the Rosa Parks Neonatal Intensive Care 
Unit at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. Of the 9,000 babies born at 
the hospital each year, 500 end up in the neonatal ICU. Many of their ailments 
could have been avoided, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of why there are premature babies and why there are sick babies 
that are born with multiple problems is not a simple answer," said Dr. Xylina 
Bean, a neonatologist. "The important thing is knowing what are the components 
of the problem and beginning to address each one of those issues." 
</P>

Care Unit at Martin Luther King.-Drew Medical Center, discusses the tremendous 
need in South-Central Los Angeles for critical care for premature and very ill

FATHER FIGURE; TO GEORGE RAVELING, WINNING IS TEMPORARY, AND SO IS LOSING. WHAT 
LASTS ARE THE MEN HE MOLDS ON HIS USC TEAMS.

 IN THE LIFE OF A BASKETBALL TEAM, THERE IS A TIME TO plant and a time to reap. 
And then there is a time to motivate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fellas, this is the team that laughed at us last year," George Raveling 
drawls, his Philadelphia parochial-school accent heading south into 
storefront-preacher territory. "It's our turn to laugh tonight. This is our 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 Framed by a locker room full of inspirational slogans ("I'm One Mean Trojan -- 
You'll Feel the Pain!"), the 56-year-old USC men's basketball coach is pacing 
around his seated players, sweat already starting to soil his crisp white 
turtleneck. A big, voluble man, he's pumping up the volume, preaching his 
pregame sermon as his Trojan team prepares to take on Arizona State University, 
a rugged conference rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get the house rockin'!" Raveling hollers, his broad, 6-foot-4-inch 
frame looming over his players' heads. "Let's get 'em excited! Let's fire this 
crowd up ! This is our house! Nobody's gonna be laughing and pointing at us!" 
</P>
<P>
 The pep talk pays off. Charged with emotion, USC starts the game off on a 9-0 
run. By halftime, the team has a comfortable 41-31 lead, thanks to Lorenzo 
Orr's unerring shooting and Mark Boyd's tenacious rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker room, the team is sky-high, whooping and shouting, stoked on 
adrenaline. Twenty more minutes of winning basketball and they'll be 4-1 in the 
Pac-10. It would be a sweet spot for any team, but especially for perennial 
underdog USC, whose men's basketball program has languished for decades in the 
shadow of UCLA, the colossus that once beat its cross-town rival 19 times in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 But talk of a Trojan dynasty will have to wait. USC's sizzling first-half play 
in the Jan. 20 Arizona State game turned out to be the high-water mark of the 
season. Twenty minutes later, at game's end, the team was back in the locker 
room, heads hanging down, tears welling up in some of the players' eyes. Led by 
a stocky, sharpshooting guard named Stevin (Hedake) Smith, Arizona State turned 
the second half into a rout, outscoring the Trojans 56 to 21. With Trojan point 
guard Burt Harris on the bench with a leg injury, backup guard Damaine Powell 
was forced to guard Smith. Overmatched, Powell had a dreadful game. Smith made 
10 of his final 15 shots, including seven three-pointers, as ASU cruised to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker room after the game, there is stone-cold silence. Slumped in a 
chair, Powell sits by himself, the team avoiding him like the plague. Only Mark 
Boyd, the team's senior leader, makes a point of coming over to give him a hug 
and a hushed pep talk. For several agonizing minutes, Raveling stands in front 
of his players, staring at them, rocking on his heels, wrestling with his 
emotions. Everyone, especially the team's freshmen, seems stunned by the 
finality of the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 When Raveling finally speaks, his voice is low and sorrowful, a weary father 
trying to console his grieving sons. "We had the game right where we wanted it, 
but we couldn't play as a unit," he says. "We're all going to have to look 
inside ourselves and see what we can do to improve." After a quick glance at 
Powell, the coach continues: "It's not gonna do any good to blame one 
individual. If you want to blame someone, blame Rav. That's what I get paid 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 After a tough loss, some coaches scream obscenities, pound lockers and throw 
chairs at the walls. Others sulk and pout, snapping at reporters and shooing 
their players into the showers. But when the team gathered for practice the 
next morning, Raveling told them how much he believed in them. Before anyone 
knew it, tears were streaming down his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach was very emotional," Mark Boyd recalls. "He started crying, right in 
front of us. He said he felt terrible, not because we lost but because only one 
person had taken the initiative to go over and talk to Damaine. He knew that if 
someone else had been the one to have a bad game, Damaine would've been the 
first to come over and comfort them." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd falls silent, trying to properly express the moral of this story. "Coach 
wasn't mad about losing," he says finally. "He was upset that we hadn't helped 
each other out as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 ONE OF GEORGE RAVELING'S FAVORITE QUOTATIONS IS FROM JAMES BALDWIN, who wrote: 
"These are our children. We will all profit by or pay for whatever they 
become." 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often, a fortunate son like Harold Miner or Duane Cooper will go on 
to play in the NBA. But for most of the coach's surrogate children, basketball 
provides only a momentary glimpse of the spotlight. In Raveling's eight years 
at USC, only four Trojans have played in the NBA. Even Miner, the most 
successful, doesn't start anymore. So far, no one has lasted more than three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 To Raveling, the lesson is clear. Many of his players will struggle to find 
another career path. As Raveling likes to say, "Athletes live a life of 
illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning basketball games just helps you keep your job," he says quietly one 
morning, writing out defense strategies on a yellow legal pad. "But keeping 
your job helps you work with these kids about the real challenges of life, 
which all happen away from the court. I know there's an enormous demand around 
here to win. But I don't want someone to ask me what I accomplished in my life 
and for me to say that I won this amount of games or took a team to some 
tournament. If at age 56 all I can say is that I taught a kid how to shoot a 
jump shot, well, that's not good enough. These kids come out of 
underprivileged, inner-city areas, and I'm just wasting my time if I haven't 
put something of substance into their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 USC fans surely applaud these lofty ideals, but they don't come to the Sports 
Arena to watch the school's debating society. Like any coach, Raveling's job is 
to win basketball games. It's an immutable law: Lose enough games and you lose 
your job. 
</P>
<P>
 In his tenure at USC, Raveling has shrewdly peddled lowered expectations, 
positioning the Trojans as scrappy underdogs, an easy task at a school where 
football has always been the high-profile sport. But this year was supposed to 
be different. Buoyed by a highly touted class of high school recruits, Raveling 
boasted to reporters that his Fab Four Freshmen -- 6-foot-11 center Avondre 
Jones, 6-foot-4 guard Stais Boseman, 6-foot-3 guard Claude Green and 6-foot-5 
swingman Jaha Wilson -- were "as talented as any group I've ever coached." 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations began to run high after USC started the season by winning 10 of 
its first 12 games, even if some of the victories were over such easy marks as 
Tennessee-Martin and Sacramento State. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Arizona State debacle. Following that loss, the Trojans found 
themselves trapped in a horrific downward spiral. They lost eight of nine 
Pac-10 games, including a blowout at UCLA and an embarrassing defeat at home 
against Washington, which was a woeful 3-16 going into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the UCLA game, the Daily Trojan ran a smart-ass headline 
that said it all: "USC BLOWS 2-0 LEAD, 101-72." 
</P>
<P>
 Each game brought an agonizing new low. With the exception of consistently 
hard-nosed play from senior forward Mark Boyd and 6-foot-5 junior Tremayne 
Anchrum -- and some dogged hustle from Stais Boseman -- the team, in a word, 
stunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo Orr, the team's leading scorer, was painfully inconsistent, rarely 
bothering to play defense. Point guard Burt Harris took bad shots instead of 
making good passes. Brandon Martin would sink three straight jumpers, then go 
cold. When Claude Green launched a three-point shot, fans in the first row 
ducked -- you never knew what he might hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Stanford, Jones made a quick exit, drawing five fouls in five minutes. 
Against UCLA, the team was caught with six men on the court. Against 
Washington, Orr fouled out without scoring, while Jones and Green sat on the 
bench in street clothes, suspended after not showing up at the hotel the night 
before. USC would muster a dramatic overtime victory against UC Berkeley -- 
which twice vanquished UCLA -- late in the season. But largely the Trojans had 
become Raveling's worst nightmare: a team that couldn't play as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 As Boyd dresses in the locker room after the UCLA game, the team's blue-collar 
leader sounds dispirited. "If I was a coach, I wouldn't recruit one of these 
high school All-Americans," he says disgustedly, applying lotion to his legs 
and a splash of cologne to his wrists, as if trying to wash the stench of 
defeat from his limbs. "All you get is ego problems. We've got a lot of 
immature players, too many guys who don't have their heads in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 A star forward himself at Villanova, Raveling takes losing hard, too. Nearly 
every nook of his USC office has a basketball on display, inscribed with the 
score of one of his big wins as head coach at Washington State, Iowa and now 
USC. But Raveling recalls the big losses as well. "I've had my heart broke so 
many times I can't even count anymore," he says the morning after his grim UCLA 
defeat, eating a losing coach's breakfast -- a Coke, two chocolate-chip cookies 
and three Bufferin. "It never gets any easier. I'll know it's time to get out 
when we play a game like last night and it doesn't eat away at my innards." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps what makes Raveling different from other coaches is his sense of 
perspective. After a crushing loss, most coaches spend the next day barricaded 
in their office, staring at game films. The day after his team lost to 
Washington, Raveling went out to see "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 THE PRESSURE TO WIN TAKES ITS TOLL ON COLLEGE COACHES. AFTER A nerve-racking 
one-point loss last month, Temple Coach John Chaney spun out of control, 
screaming and making death threats at opposing Massachusetts Coach John 
Calipari. Northwestern Coach Ricky Byrdsong had to take a leave of absence 
after he began behaving erratically, leaving his bench in the middle of a game 
to shake hands with opposing fans in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Georgetown's John Thompson charged a referee and was thrown out of 
a game. And last December, Indiana's volatile Bobby Knight tried to kick his 
own son, Pat, who'd thrown the ball away at a crucial moment in a game against 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 After 32 years in coaching, Raveling has adopted a Zen-like attitude: Winning 
is temporary, he says, and so is losing. Even after a tough loss, Raveling 
keeps his cool, always taking a few minutes to compose himself -- and his team 
-- before meeting the press for postgame interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe some USC fans wish Raveling had a more fiery temperament. After all, 
Bobby Knight and John Thompson win national championships. Raveling's teams 
have never gone beyond the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet his supporters say he has plenty to boast about. He took his Washington 
State team to the NCAA tournament for the first time in nearly 40 years. At 
Iowa, he won 20 games two years in a row. At USC, he's made a weak program 
respectable, thanks in large part to his recruiting of Harold Miner, a local 
high school star who led the Trojans to two consecutive NCAA tournament 
appearances before turning pro after his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 season, when his team went 24-6, USC rewarded Raveling with a 
five-year contract extension reportedly worth as much as $150,000 a year. But 
when you've never gone to the Final Four, the question is always asked: How 
good a coach are you? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you asked writers to name the best coaches in the Pac-10, you wouldn't see 
George's name at the top of the list," says Bob Cohn, a veteran sportswriter 
for the Arizona Republic. "He's not a great coach in the Bobby Knight-Mike 
Krzyzewski master-strategist mold. But he's got other things going on in his 
life, and I think that's just as admirable as winning basketball games." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Raveling unusual is the impact he has on his players away from the 
court. Miner recently began giving USC back its $60,000 in scholarship funds 
and donates free basketball tickets to kids participating in a 
reading-improvement program. When Duane Cooper, another ex-USC star now in the 
NBA, is downcast about his lack of playing time, he calls his old college coach 
for a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Always lugging a duffel bag full of books and magazines on road trips, 
Raveling concludes practice each morning by giving players a sheaf of clippings 
from newspapers and magazines. One day it might be a business story about money 
management or a successful entrepreneur. Another day it's an excerpt from a 
story about former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who is quoted as saying: 
"You don't make progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and 
complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the team traveled to Atlanta, Raveling took them to visit the 
Martin Luther King Jr. center. More recently, concerned about his players' 
social skills, he conducted an etiquette seminar, staging a practice dinner to 
give his players lessons in place settings and handling silverware, then taking 
them out to a nice restaurant to hone their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who spend four years with George come out as better people than they 
were when they went in," says Cohn. "A lot of coaches say that, but with George 
it's not lip service; he really has an impact on their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressure began to mount on Miner to turn pro, Raveling didn't stand in 
his way. "He was USC's biggest star in years," recalls Washington Post reporter 
Mark Asher, who covers off-the-field sports issues. "But George is the kind of 
coach who'll put the best interests of the player ahead of what might be best 
for George's win-loss record." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of his players, inner-city kids who've grown up without fathers, 
Raveling's broad horizons and position of power make him an appealing 
substitute. Mark Boyd says that when he first arrived at USC, he couldn't take 
his eyes off his coach. "Never having a father in my house, I just got this 
immaculate vibe from him," Boyd recalls. "I'd watch everything he did, what 
he'd say, how he acted with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling seems determined to offer his players what he thirsted for in his own 
youth: a glimpse of the bigger horizon that looms outside the familiar 
landscape of cheering-crowd arenas. "I wish I could put these kids in a car 
every week and show them an art museum or take them to Santa Barbara," he says, 
walking through campus one day, offering hearty greetings to passersby like a 
politician on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are so naive about what life's about," says Raveling, whose own 
marriage ended in divorce years ago. "As much as my heart aches after losing to 
UCLA, it aches even more about how little preparation they've had to compete in 
today's society." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 players in uniform on most USC road trips, 10 are black and five are 
from the Los Angeles area. Except for senior guard John Masdea, all are at USC 
on athletic scholarships. Many grew up in neighborhoods where sports was 
considered the only visible avenue for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opportunity -- my escape -- was basketball," says Boyd, who grew up in a 
cramped household where he never had a bed of his own. "Almost everybody on our 
team comes from a low-income, broken household. For us, basketball is a chance 
to get a college degree, to get somewhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the scholarship is just the beginning of a long -- and very public -- 
struggle. It took Stais Boseman three tries at his SAT tests to earn the 
minimum 700 score needed to qualify for athletic eligibility. Whenever he 
appeared on the court against UCLA, the Bruin student section sent up a nasty 
jeer: "Stu-u-upid! Stu-u-upid!" 
</P>
<P>
 THESE HARDSHIPS ARE CONSTANT REMINDERS OF RAVELING'S OWN youth. He grew up in 
Washington, D.C., a heavily segregated city. His family lived on top of a 
grocery store in a two-room apartment. They shared a bathroom with four other 
families on the same floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling's father died when George was 9, but the son didn't see much of the 
father even when we he was alive. "He was a horse trainer and was away from 
home most of the year," Raveling recalls. "Whenever my dad would come back, 
he'd bring me home a silver dollar. I thought it was the greatest thing in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 A talented basketball player and a diligent student, Raveling went to 
Villanova on an athletic scholarship, where he captained the basketball team in 
1960, his senior year. College had a huge impact on Raveling, who as a young 
man was woefully lacking in social skills. "I've always felt like a sprinter 
who'd slipped at the starting box and was 20 yards behind everybody -- I've 
been in a mad dash to catch up with everybody ever since," he says. "My mom 
worked two jobs when I was a kid. There were no books in our house. Nobody 
envisioned that I'd graduate from college. No one even encouraged me to go to 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling has the air of a man making up for lost time. His Ladera Heights home 
has a library of 3,000 books. At USC, stacks of books lurk everywhere, a 
literary obstacle course for anyone trying to find a seat in his office. One 
mound is topped with Richard Reeves' recent J.F.K. biography, another with 
"Quotations to Cheer You up When the World Is Getting You Down." 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, associate head coach Jack Fertig's office has a shelf packed with 
self-improvement books, all pass-alongs from his boss, each full of passages 
Raveling has highlighted in yellow ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling is always soaking up new facts. Even in the locker room before a 
game, he's leafing through the New York Times, clipping out a story about a 
study finding racial disparities in doctors' warnings to pregnant women ("These 
are the kind of things that make me paranoid," he says wryly). Discovering a 
story in the Los Angeles Times View section about U.S. Presidents, he 
immediately challenges his two assistants, Fertig and Charles Parker, to a 
trivia contest. Who can name the four Presidents who were assassinated? And how 
about the four who died in office? 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling's only son, Mark, a USC junior who's not on the team, shows up just 
as his father ducks back into his office to take a phone call. "Try those 
questions on him ," Raveling says to Fertig. "Tell him it's worth $50 if he 
gets the right answers." After about 10 seconds, Fertig hollers into Raveling's 
office: "Your money's safe!" 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS 5:45 IN THE MORNING. EXCEPT FOR A LONELY STREET-CLEANING truck rumbling 
down Figueroa Street, the USC campus is deserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Look up in the sky and you can see stars. Look inside the North Gym and you 
can see the men's basketball team practicing for an upcoming game. Nearly every 
weekday morning the Trojans are here -- yes, at 5:45 -- sprinting, stretching 
and running plays, hustling through a grueling two-hour practice session under 
the coach's watchful eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude Green pulls up for a silky 18-foot jumper but spends so much time 
admiring his shot that his man slips past him downcourt for an easy layup. "See 
that?" Raveling barks. "You were stylin', looking at how pretty that shot was." 
</P>
<P>
 Rav wiggles his hips like a cheerleader, sliding his voice up into falsetto 
range: "Ooh, what a pretty shot." Then the bark is back in his voice: "And you 
got beat on the break." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5:45s. They're Raveling's way of getting his players' attention before 
they've struggled with a pop quiz or had a fight with a girlfriend, or, as 
Raveling puts it, "before there's any garbage in their pail." 
</P>
<P>
 All of 21, Boyd is the team leader, a self-possessed economics major who's one 
of the team's last links to the Miner glory years. The freshman players look to 
him for advice, impressed by his blue-collar work ethic on the court as well as 
his stylish dress off the court. To his coach, he's a surrogate son. "My mother 
always said there's some people who are 50 going on 20," Raveling notes proudly 
one day. "And then there's people like Mark, who are 20 going on 50." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised by a single working mother in Atlanta, Boyd grew up in a small 
two-bedroom house. His mother had one bedroom; his two sisters had the other. 
He slept on a couch in the living room. "I never had a bedroom my whole life," 
he says. "I was ashamed of where I lived. When my friends wanted to come home 
with me from school, I'd make up excuses because I didn't want them to see I 
didn't have a room." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd says it's difficult for him to go back home and see his old friends -- 
the ones that are still alive. "Half of them are dead, six feet deep, or in 
jail or out on the corner selling drugs," he says matter-of-factly. "I went 
home last Christmas and had a friend who got shot dead at a party from a 
9-millimeter. Another friend was shooting a gun in the air, and some guys 
driving by thought he was shooting at them, so they went after him and shot him 
with a hollow-point .44 Magnum. They blew a huge hole in his back." A true 
urban youth, Boyd knows the caliber of gun that killed each of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the basketball court, Boyd is eager to make contact with anyone who 
has prospered in the outside world. When he found himself seated next to a pair 
of affluent businessmen at a recent athletic banquet at the tony Jonathan Club, 
Boyd peppered them with questions about their paths to success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The UCLA players who were there just sat down on a couch and didn't talk to 
anyone," Boyd notes with surprise. "We USC guys were going around, trying to 
get to know everyone. Hey, if you sat down next to a pair of millionaires, 
wouldn't you want to know how they got there?" Boyd takes the same approach at 
practice. Whether Raveling is teaching rebounding or pick 'n rolls, Boyd is an 
eager pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 Many coaches use their best players as a team example. But when the Trojans 
are lethargic one day, Raveling points to John Masdea, a premed student who is 
a Division I basketball rarity -- a non-scholarship player. "This guy ain't 
even getting a scholarship, but he's come out here for four years and practiced 
hard every morning," Raveling says with fatherly pride. "He's gonna be a 
doctor; someday he's gonna be treating y'all. But he's out here, giving his 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do y'all ever think about him, practicing hard but not playing? Sometimes you 
can't just look inside yourself. You gotta look outside yourself, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Being on a team with kids who come from completely different social 
backgrounds has made Masdea look outside himself, too. On a recent road trip, 
he roomed with Boseman, a shy freshman from a gang-scarred neighborhood in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real surprising," says Masdea, a clean-cut Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
fraternity member who was his high school's valedictorian. "I've played ball 
with inner-city kids, but I never thought much about their home life. Stais has 
gone through so much adversity -- he didn't even know his father, he lived in 
an area where there were lots of gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 By road trip's end, Masdea had invited Boseman to go deep-sea fishing -- a 
sport he'd never imagined experiencing -- with some of the SAE guys. And Stais 
plans to return the favor. "He said, 'Hey, I'll take you back to my 
neighborhood,' " Masdea laughingly recalls. "And I'm goin' -- 'I don't know 
about that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN THE BLACK COACHES ASSN. launched its fight with the NCAA over more 
minority access to higher education, it quickly decided that George Raveling 
would serve as its spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A black man who moves easily in the world of white media and alumni 
powerbrokers, Raveling has become a lightning rod for BCA issues, especially 
when the association threatened a boycott of Jan. 15 basketball games. This was 
after NCAA convention delegates voted down a proposal to rescind its 
controversial 13-scholarship limit for men's basketball. The boycott was 
postponed after the NCAA and the black coaches agreed to arbitration by the 
Justice Department. But the debate has festered since the opening game of the 
season, when Raveling and many other African American basketball coaches staged 
a symbolic protest, wearing all black to their season openers. 
</P>
<P>
 While far from the only issue, scholarship opportunities became the hottest 
topic of debate. When Raveling made his head coaching debut at Washington State 
in 1972, he says, each of the nation's Division I colleges awarded not 13 but 
20 basketball scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 70% of Division I athletic programs losing money -- USC is not one 
of them -- the NCAA leadership views this as an economic issue. But Raveling 
sees it as a fight over educational opportunities for young black men, men like 
himself. "I had two roommates in college who came under the same circumstances 
-- athletic scholarships," he says. "One became a multimillionaire in the 
greeting-card business. Another became mayor of New Haven." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling contends that to grasp such opportunities, today's players must 
project a positive image. Even after a tough loss, USC players are unusually 
courteous and cooperative; no one snarls at reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to mastering the media, Raveling's players need look no further 
than their coach. Unlike many of his thin-skinned peers who keep the media at 
arm's length, Raveling courts the press, chatting with reporters on the 
telephone or taking them to dinner on the team's road trips. One morning, 
Raveling spends 20 minutes fencing on the air with Jim Rome, XTRA-AM's 
sharp-tongued sports-talk host. The exchanges sometimes become heated, but when 
they go off the air at the end, Raveling gently strokes the talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim, I gotta tell you, I really respected you for asking me all the tough 
questions. I would've been disappointed if you hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
 These cozy personal touches pay off. UCLA Coach Jim Harrick has averaged 23 
victories in his six-year tenure while Raveling has endured four losing seasons 
-- and managed only one 20-plus victory season -- in his eight-year USC 
coaching tenure. Yet, as Shannon Fears, a sportswriter for the Eugene, Ore., 
Register-Guard, succinctly put it last year: "It's Raveling who is . . . adored 
by fans, media and his own administration, and Harrick who is considered 
distant, whining and ungrateful." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this rapport comes from Raveling's disarming knack for laughing at 
himself, even after a bitter defeat. After USC was routed by UCLA in February, 
Raveling stood up before a room full of reporters and took his lumps, never 
showing any irritation. One writer asked the coach when he felt the game 
slipping away. Raveling's instant quip: "At the tip." 
</P>
<P>
 BUNDLED UP IN MAROON USC sweats, Lorenzo Orr tentatively sticks his 
long-limbed 6-foot-7 frame into Raveling's office, testing the waters. Coach 
has discovered that the team's star has been late to his meetings with his 
academic tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get on that girl's bad side," Raveling gently cautions him. "She's in 
your corner. You don't want to lose her. You gotta keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling has good reason to worry about his players' academic status. While 
recruiting scandals tend to grab the most headlines, many college athletic 
programs have also been under fire for lax academic standards, especially for 
their embarrassingly low graduation rates -- low in some cases meaning zero. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1986 to 1990, the first four years of Raveling's tenure, only 35% of 
USC's freshman and junior college-transfer players ended up earning their 
degrees. However, if you exclude the players who left school early, either to 
join the NBA or to play for another college basketball program, the graduation 
rate jumps to 65%, virtually the same percentage as USC's overall student-body 
graduation rate. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA rules stipulate that to remain eligible to play, athletes must earn 18 
credit units (out of a possible 24) after two semesters of school. USC rules 
also hold that any athlete whose grade-point average drops below 2.0 goes on 
automatic probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with an influx of athletes who are often woefully unprepared for 
college-level academics, USC built a $3-million Academic Resources Center, 
located in the basement of Heritage Hall, the school's athletic program center. 
Equipped with computer terminals, study rooms and counseling offices, the 
center serves as a support system for most of the 290 students on USC athletic 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you see Cynthia Cardosi at work, chairing a weekly tutors meeting, you 
begin to understand the difficulty of judging academic achievement simply by 
grade-point average. Wearing a turtleneck and black jeans, the veteran academic 
counselor is worried about the Trojans' losing streak. She knows that in times 
of stress, many young players begin to tune out academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young ones, especially the freshmen, are going to be down," she cautions 
her tutors. "So you have to remind them that they can't let their frustrations 
take control and stop them from going to class and studying." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman of great zeal and boundless energy, Cardosi prods the tutors, asking 
if their kids are coming in prepared and digesting their studies. The tutors 
are uncharacteristically silent. "God, you're really quiet this week," Cardosi 
says, studying their faces. She volunteers a positive reaction: "I heard one of 
our students, a real introverted kid, say: 'Hey, my tutor's really cool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cardosi beams. "I don't hear that very often. That's a good sign. It means the 
tutor made an impression on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardosi doesn't wait for the players to seek her out. Last year, when the 
basketball team went to Arizona on a road trip, she traveled with them. She 
came away with a renewed appreciation for Raveling's impact on his players. 
"When they were on the team bus, every one of the coaches was reading a book or 
a magazine," she reports. "I think that sets an incredible example for the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean Cardosi always sees eye-to-eye with the coaches. "Coach 
Raveling and I have some matches," she says spiritedly. "I go into his office 
and say what's on my mind." She laughs. "When I come through his door, he looks 
up and goes, 'What now, Cardosi?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing bothers Cardosi more than a player blowing off a tutorial appointment 
in favor of a shoot-around. "The coaches need to understand that these kids 
feel they have to be at practice," she says. "So they don't always hear the 
coaches tell them that they can't miss a class or a tutor appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardosi considers Raveling an ally. "I like the way he deals with his kids," 
she says. "We just have different philosophies. To me, basketball is a game. To 
George, it's something bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S A CLASSIC SNOOP DOGGY Dogg-style rapper's voice: a sinewy, singsong tenor 
skating atop a languid rhythmic groove, joined by a whiny synthesizer that 
sounds like a snake charmer's flute. 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics are half hoops patois, half hip-hop braggadocio. "When I'm upset, 
I'm strong as heck, like Popeye the sailor, I bank you and make you see 
All-Stars, like Chuck Taylor, a legend like Elgin Baylor, Elizabeth my Taylor, 
your girl is like a video game, I like to play her." 
</P>
<P>
 Avondre Jones is demonstrating his rap prowess, gyrating his spindly legs, 
towering over a mountain of sound equipment in his bedroom as he blasts demo 
tapes of his group 3Wayz's songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go three ways," explains Jones, whose bedroom is decorated with 
pictures of Ice Cube, Charles Barkley, Malcolm X and Avondre himself, the last 
from a recent issue of Sports Illustrated heralding him as one of the country's 
most promising freshman players. "On the gangsta tip, the smooth stuff or 
something wild, that you'd play at a party." 
</P>
<P>
 Still wearing his No. 44 jersey and basketball shorts from a late-afternoon 
practice, Jones is trying to teach his roomie, fellow Fab 4 Freshman Claude 
Green, the art of rap deejaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is Claude Green in the house?" he playfully shouts as he hands the turntables 
over to his roommate, who nervously fumbles with the controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is overcome with the giggles. "Amateur!" he shrieks gleefully. "They'd 
kill you out on the dance floor." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Jones' rap career is sort of on hold, thanks to a stack of arcane 
NCAA rules about professional contracts. It's his basketball career everyone's 
worried about. While Jones' Artesia High teammate Charles O'Bannon has 
blossomed at cross-town rival UCLA, the highly touted Jones has been an enigma, 
playing sparingly, averaging less than five points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations with Raveling were rocky, even before he gave Jones a one-game 
suspension. One week into the season, Jones and his parents had a closed-door 
meeting with the coach, unhappy over Jones' lack of playing time. Before the 
pivotal Arizona State game, Jones came to see Raveling in his office. They 
stepped out into the hall for a private chat -- and within moments were 
shouting at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones admits that his game isn't up to par yet. "I know I can play better," he 
says, fondling a huge ninja sword that he keeps by his bed. "I'm just not used 
to losing. And I'm not used to sitting. I'm used to being the go-to man. In 
high school, I was the star." 
</P>
<P>
 From Raveling's perspective, that's part of the problem. Ever since the 
University of Michigan nearly won the 1992 national championship with its 
heralded Fab Five, incoming freshman have had visions of overnight success on 
the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fab Five was one of the worst things that ever happened to college 
basketball," Raveling complains at one of his weekly lunches with local 
sportswriters. "These kids come in thinking they're gonna win right away. It's 
a problem -- athletes live a life of illusion. What did Avondre say in that 
Sports Illustrated article? 'I want to be a point guard.' Come on!" 
</P>
<P>
 That earns a big laugh from the assembled writers, but Raveling seems 
genuinely troubled by the naivete of his freshman players. "These kids come out 
of an environment where everyone expects instant gratification," the coach says 
later. "That's what our society preaches every day -- the quick fix." 
</P>
<P>
 On the record, Raveling is cautiously optimistic about Avondre's progress. But 
in private, the coach broods about his 19-year-old protege's work ethic and 
level of maturity. At practice, Raveling treats Jones with kid gloves, often 
whispering advice in his ear instead of shouting it out across the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the feeling Raveling hasn't gotten his message across yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know basketball is going to pay off in the end," Jones says one night, 
sorting through his shelves, most of them filled with boxes of high-top 
sneakers. "But if you came to me with $5 million and said I could have a record 
contract and I could give up basketball . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Avondre is silent, staring up at the posters of his heroes, looking first at 
Barkley, then at Ice Cube. He wags his head. "Well, I don't know what I'd do." 
</P>
<P>
 ONE MORNING, RAVELING IS ON the phone with Duane Cooper, a talented 
three-point shooter at USC who's now a reserve guard for the Phoenix Suns. 
Raveling sounds excited. With several of the Suns' stars out with injuries, 
Cooper is getting more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the USC grad sounds worried about sticking with the team. "It's like 
anything else, Coop; the longer you're with 'em, the more respect they'll have 
for the things you can do," Raveling says, giving him a pep talk. "I know it's 
a cliche, but good things happen to good people." 
</P>
<P>
 As Raveling gets up to leave his office, the phone rings again. It's a junior 
college coach calling with a tip about a potential recruit. Although recruiting 
is a big part of Raveling's job, it's largely an off-season pursuit. So he is 
only mildly interested until the coach reveals how many points the player 
scored the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty!" Raveling exclaims, his interest level rising. "Where'd you say he's 
playing Saturday?" 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as he's off the phone, Raveling rushes off to confer with his 
assistant coaches, eager to see what they know about the kid. When he returns, 
he has an extra bounce in his step. "I don't care who you're playing," he says. 
"Scoring 50 is tough to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly Raveling spins around and heads back to his assistants' offices. He 
forgot to tell them about the earlier phone call. It's a moment when the two 
sides of his coaching life come together. He's discovered a hot prospect just 
as a new door is opening for one of his old players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey guys, guess what?" he booms with paternal pride. "Coop's starting 
tonight!"

USER-FRIENDLY CHANGES IN REPACKAGED SAT; NEW NAME, FORMAT ARE THE FIRST 
ALTERATIONS IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TEST SINCE 1974 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Mary Laine Yarber teaches English 
at Santa Monica High School.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of teen-agers have been hearing about it, waiting for it and even 
fearing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's here. No, not puberty, Saturday school or a family vacation -- it's 
the new Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this month, college-bound students will take an SAT whose format has 
changed for the first time since 1974 (the test has been administered since 
1926). That has caused fear in the hearts of some teens, but is panic 
warranted? 
</P>
<P>
 What's so different about the new SAT? 
</P>
<P>
 The name, for one: The A in SAT now stands for Assessment, rather than 
Aptitude, since there is some valid scholarly debate about whether the test can 
truly measure a student's aptitude for learning. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the SAT that most students will take is called SAT I. The 
one-hour achievement tests, which some colleges require in addition to the SAT 
I, are now called the SAT II, and the essay exam that accompanies the SAT II in 
English composition is now the SAT II writing test. If you can handle the name 
changes, you are actually over the most frightening part; the changes in format 
are fairly friendly. The SAT I is still three hours long, and divided into math 
and verbal sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The new math section measures the same kinds of skills as the old: arithmetic, 
geometry and algebra. The new verbal questions still test students' skills in 
reading comprehension, vocabulary, relationships between words and recognition 
of grammatical parts of sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The time allotted to each section, however, is now broken down differently. 
</P>
<P>
 The math section, which consisted of two 30-minute parts, now contains an 
additional 15-minute section. A 15-minute part also has been added to the usual 
two 30-minute sections of the verbal portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the SAT I doesn't include the previous 30-minute section of verbal 
or math questions that did not count toward the students' scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the kinds of questions asked on the SAT I, some changes will no 
doubt please test-takers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who founder on grammar, for example, will be thrilled to know that the 
SAT I is devoid of the Test of Standard Written English, which included 30 
minutes of grammar and punctuation questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading comprehension section, now named critical reading, contains fewer 
passages. The passages are generally longer, though, and some must be compared 
and contrasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fill-in-the-blank questions will be shorter too; questions requiring you 
to think of the antonym of a word have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 And, contrary to popular rumors, there is no essay portion on the SAT I. 
</P>
<P>
 The most talked-about change in the math section is the end of the prohibition 
on calculators. You must provide your own calculator, though, so check those 
batteries before you head for the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 And although all math questions formerly were multiple choice, there are now 
some questions for which students must give answers on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the best way to know what to expect on the SAT I is to practice by 
taking the PSAT I (Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test). It is best to take 
the PSAT in October of your junior year, so you will have enough time to learn 
your results and strengthen weak points before taking the real test the 
following spring.

 The 29th annual Azalea Festival Parade, the highlight of South Gate's 
monthlong community fair, will step off at 1 p.m. today from California Avenue 
down Tweedy Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Azalea queen and grand marshal, two senior citizens selected by the 
community for their civic contributions, will preside over drill teams and 
bands, floats and antique cars.The festival, named after the city's official 
flower, also features sports tournaments, a horse show, bike rodeo, talent 
competition, special dinners and performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival follows a different theme each year, organizers said. This year, 
many events, such as King Arthurs' Artisans Craft Show and the "Knight to 
Remember" dinner and show reflect the theme of "Camelot." 
</P>
<P>
 If festival-goers take a close look at their souvenir program today, they will 
note that this year's event is also an opportunity to honor 1992 Azalea Queen 
Marie Linfor, who was found murdered in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was scheduled to feature a tribute to Linfor, recognizing her life 
and work in the community, said Dodie Mosby, parks and recreation director. The 
Parks Department also has opened a scholarship fund in Linfor's name that will 
help pay fees for children who cannot afford to participate in park activities, 
Mosby said.

MAN'S DEATH IN JAIL WARD INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide detectives this week 
continued to investigate the death of a 41-year-old man in officers' custody at 
County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bernard Wiley Jr. of Mar Vista died at 8:46 p.m. Friday after a struggle 
with officers in the hospital's jail ward, Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested Wiley at 4:38 p.m. Friday after responding to a report of a 
domestic dispute in the 12200 block of Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wiley was being restrained, a struggle ensued and a police officer was 
assaulted, Ramirez said. Wiley reportedly fell down a flight of stairs and 
received a cut on the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested and transported to the County-USC jail ward for treatment and 
booking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley "became combative after his handcuffs were removed" at the hospital, 
Ramirez said. Several deputies and a Los Angeles Police Department officer were 
attempting to restrain him when he stopped breathing, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors could not revive Wiley, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Carrier, spokesman for the coroner's office, said an autopsy has been 
completed. The cause of death will be determined after toxicology results are 
received.

SAFETY, FIRE VIOLATIONS FOUND AT 430-ROOM FRONTIER HOTEL; HOUSING: THE MANAGER 
OF THE DOWNTOWN 12-STORY STRUCTURE BLAMES SOME OF THE DAMAGE ON TENANTS. 
ARRAIGNMENT IS APRIL 7. 
</P>

<P>
 Operators of a 430-room Downtown hotel are facing criminal charges after an 
investigation into violations of fire, health and safety standards, authorities 
said last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The 12-story Frontier Hotel on West 5th Street is one of the larger hotels to 
prompt a criminal filing since the Los Angeles city attorney's Housing 
Enforcement Unit was established five years ago, Deputy City Atty. Janet 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Michael Frontiera, 64, of San Pedro, his sons Joseph Frontiera, 37, of 
Rancho Palos Verdes and Robert Frontiera, 34, of Long Beach, and hotel manager 
David Michael Johnson, 36, of Dove Canyon, are expected to be charged at their 
arraignment April 7 with 23 fire, health and building and safety code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Frontiera acknowledged that the hotel needs work, but said the owners 
had been given insufficient time to complete an estimated $280,000 in repairs 
demanded by the city last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's what's required, that's what's required. But my point is, is it 
criminal? And can we do it on a longer time frame so we can do it out of our 
cash flow?" Robert Frontiera said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ted Goldstein, spokesman for the city attorney's office, said, "There's 
exposed live electrical wiring, an over-fused electrical panel, defective 
electrical and plumbing fixtures. . . . It's not as though we're asking for 
luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 Reopened by the current owners in 1979 after being closed for 22 years, the 
Frontier Hotel houses low-income residents and welfare recipients. About half 
the hotel's 600 tenants are transients. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Frontiera said none of the violations are life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why am I labeled a slumlord? Just because the people here are poor? I'm 
driving a 7-year-old pickup truck. There's no Mercedes here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the hotel manager, said several violations that were cited, including 
trash accumulation and broken or missing heaters, smoke detectors and window 
screens, were caused by tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel staff could not keep up with maintenance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building could be brought up to standard, but in a month "we'll have to do 
it again because of our clientele type," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Violations at the hotel were a major concern because of its size, said Jackson 
of the city attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you have so many tenants, it poses a serious problem. The potential for 
death multiplies." 
</P>
<P>
 Each charge can bring a maximum penalty of $1,000 and six months imprisonment.

 On the afternoon of April 4, 1991, 15 years, 11 months and 27 days after the 
end of the Vietnam War, four Vietnamese youths armed with semiautomatic pistols 
stormed into a Good Guys electronic store on Stockton Boulevard in Sacramento 
and held 41 people hostage. Speaking heavily accented and broken English, they 
issued what the Sacramento Bee described as "a series of bizarre demands." They 
wanted a helicopter to fly to Thailand and fight the Viet Cong, $4 million, 
four bulletproof vests and 40 pieces of 1,000-year-old ginseng roots. 
</P>
<P>
 While a crowd gathered across the street, some enthusiasts equipped with their 
own camcorders, TV reporters informed viewers that three of the gunmen were 
brothers -- Loi Khac Nguyen, 21, Pham Khac Nguyen, 19, and Long Khac Nguyen, 17 
-- and the last, Cuong Tran, 16, was Long Nguyen's best friend. The Nguyen 
brothers had come from a poor Vietnamese Catholic family headed by an 
ex-sergeant of the South Vietnamese army. All four were altar boys. Three of 
the youths had dropped out of school or had been expelled. None had been able 
to find a steady job. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen could be seen on live television behind the store's glass doors, 
strolling back and forth with their firearms, their hostages bound at their 
feet. Sacramento County Sheriff Glen Craig, who had implanted listening devices 
in the store, reported that the gunmen were jubilant at seeing themselves and 
hearing their names on TV -- "Oh, ah, we're going to be movie stars!" The 
sheriff had also told reporters that the gunmen belonged to a loosely knit gang 
called Oriental Boys -- an error, as it turned out, since police couldn't prove 
membership in any gang. 
</P>
<P>
 As the siege wore on, negotiations between the gunmen and the taut-faced, 
gray-haired sheriff reached a stalemate. The gunmen, for their part, had grown 
increasingly edgy and refused to negotiate after authorities met only part of 
one demand -- providing them with a single bulletproof jacket. Sheriff Craig, 
on the other hand, later told reporters that the four would not "focus on any 
single demand. They were attempting to gain notoriety, attention and, perhaps, 
some transportation out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-and-a-half hours later, after the gunmen wounded two of the hostages, a 
SWAT team raided the store on live television. Three of the young men were 
killed immediately, but not before one of them sprayed the hostages with 
bullets, killing two employees -- John Lee Fritz and Kris Sohne -- and a 
customer -- Fernando Gutierrez -- and wounding eight more. Loi Nguyen, the 
oldest, and the one who wore the bulletproof jacket, was seriously wounded. His 
trial on 49 felony counts and three counts of murder is set for July 11. He is 
pleading not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched this tragedy unfold on my TV set that night, I remember being 
overwhelmed by an irrational fear. It was the fear that the Vietnam War had 
somehow been renewed by those gunmen and by those helicopters hovering over the 
store. And though I was on the safe side of the TV screen now and judging their 
barbaric acts, I was not without this singular sense of foreboding: Six years 
ago I could have been one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the story of the Good Guys ended in carnage on the linoleum floor of an 
electronics store, it began an ocean and an epic journey away, nourished by 
numerous subterranean streams. It is those streams I am foundering in. I am at 
once too close and too far from their story. Though an American journalist now, 
I came to this country as a Vietnamese refugee, the son of a South Vietnamese 
army officer. The young men and I, through our fathers, are veterans of a civil 
war we never actually fought. In their demands, I hear the thematic echo of 
vengeance, which forms and shapes all Vietnamese youths who grow up in America. 
Perhaps all this binds me to the Good Guys hostage-takers nearly two decades 
after the last U.S. helicopter hovered over a burning Saigon before heading 
toward the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN I ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS, THE blond kid on Stockton Boulevard rattled off 
names of generic American landmarks in an amiable tone: Midas . . . Shakey's 
pizza . . . Carl's Jr. . . . man, you can't miss it. . . . Turn left at the 
House of Fabrics. Next to it, you'll see the Good Guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the first thing you noticed was yourself. Walk through the glass door 
and a dozen camcorders gave you back your reflections on the various TV sets. 
For as little as $549, you could be (oh, ah) your own movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw but tried not to look at my own faces on those TV screens. The faces, my 
faces, appeared expressionless, the thick brows slightly raised, touched 
perhaps by a tinge of skepticism. I do not believe in instant fame, had always 
thought Andy Warhol's prediction an odd American curse. 
</P>
<P>
 But teen-agers are daily worshipers in this secular temple of high-tech 
consumerism, their eyes mesmerized by the son et lumiere. At the Nintendo 
counter, five Asian teens vied to compete for world championship of Street 
Fighter II. At the cellular phone display, two Latino girls pretended to 
gossip, using those palm-sized communicators. And at the store's far end, a 
hundred or so TV sets formed a kind of electronic wall that talked and sang and 
showed the shopper the panorama of America -- talk shows, soap operas, 
commercials. A fat housewife described her sex life on a dozen or so screens. 
In a hushed tone, she related intimate details of her marital betrayal to Oprah 
and 14 million other people -- "I never told anybody this but . . ." -- and 
managed to blush. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here, in this American postmodern public square, that the ethnic private 
meets the mainstream public. At dinnertime on the night of the Good Guys siege, 
Papa and Mama Nguyen suddenly saw their three eldest boys holding American 
hostages at the neighborhood electronics store. One can assume that their sons 
were simultaneously watching their own drama on dozens of TV sets. It is a kind 
of instantaneous real-life opera made popular by television these days, the 
blood opera with all nuances flattened so that viewers get only a reporter's 
sound bites and vivid endings. Narrative is shaved to the bone, history and 
background ignored.  
</P>
<P>
 That sort of ignorance is peculiarly American, or so it seems to many of the 
12,000 Vietnamese in the Sacramento area. A few who watched the siege recall a 
dangerous combination of arrogance and confusion among the TV reporters and 
especially the authorities. "They ran around like chickens without heads," said 
one Vietnamese man who volunteered to help the police but was turned away. "The 
boys were Vietnamese Catholics and the sheriff initially had a Laotian monk at 
the scene," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet clues that would have helped the sheriffs and the journalists unlock the 
gunmen's psyches were just minutes from the Good Guys, in Little Saigon. In a 
mini-mall a mile or so away, a video store called Ngoc Thao (Precious Herb) 
catered to a Vietnamese clientele. Colorful posters of gangsters and cops 
holding Uzis and of ancient swordsmen in silk brocades flying above temple 
rooftops covered the walls and glass windows. Here, as in many other video 
stores frequented by local Vietnamese in Sacramento, one can find 
1,000-year-old ginseng roots -- the precious cure-all usually discovered by the 
lucky hero in kung fu epics -- or other magical panaceas and cursed swords. 
They're in hundreds of Hong Kong videos, dubbed in Vietnamese, that line the 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The cashier, a heavily made-up woman, was having a busy day. Like a high 
priestess with holy water, she dispensed pieces of Asia's fabled past to hordes 
of homesick Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sister, when is the Royal Tramp video coming out? I've been waiting for 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sister, we want 'Dragon Palms' and 'The Revenge of Black Orchid.' I hear the 
woman in 'Orchid' is the best fighter and, like a man, kills everyone who 
assassinated her parents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aunty, how much does a karaoke machine cost? Everybody in my family is dying 
to be a rock 'n' roll star." 
</P>
<P>
 At the entrance, an 8-year-old holding a plastic bag filled with kung fu 
videos was his old man's pride and joy. Papa urged youngest son to say 
something to a friend, an army buddy wearing a fatigue jacket. Youngest son 
shrugged, then, without enthusiasm, recited a quote from a movie:  
</P>
<P>
 "Honorable father, I must leave you now and find a mentor to learn the martial 
art way. I will avenge our family honor after I have mastered the Iron Palms of 
Death." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men laughed and applauded the mythological voice of China, a voice 
that provides a kind of parochial snare in the Americanization process. Thanks 
to CNN, satellite dishes, cable TVs, VCRs, jumbo jets, camcorders and fax 
machines, integration turns retro-future-active. Technology renews old myths, 
shrinks oceans, packages memories, melts borders, rejuvenates old passions, 
redefines the assimilation process. For Asian children immigrating to America 
today, their parents' homelands are no longer as far away as they were for 
children in earlier times. The American-born Vietnamese boy who mouths ancient 
wisdoms may not know their meaning, may never, for that matter, master the Iron 
Palms of Death, but somehow Asia has already exuded mysticism into his soul. 
Indeed, the alluring incense, the singsong languages, the communal and familial 
Confucian values of loyalty and obligation, the old-world gestures of 
self-sacrifice and revenge -- all that earlier generations of American-born 
Asians tried so hard to exorcise -- is now in style, evidenced in the Little 
Saigons and Little Seouls that dot so many California urban landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 TWO DAYS AFTER THE GOOD GUYS SIEGE,a Sacramento Bee photo that ran the length 
of the page showed the Nguyen brothers' parents standing in their living room 
as if facing a firing squad. Though stricken with grief, Bim Khac and Sao Thi 
Nguyen admitted journalists into their tiny two-bedroom unit in the Laura Dawn 
Manor Apartments, a two-story structure rented out mostly to Southeast Asian 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo shows a sagging sofa, a VCR and, of course, a large TV set. On top 
of the TV stands a South Vietnamese flag -- three red horizontal stripes 
against a gold background -- representing a country that no longer exists. On 
the opposite wall, a three-tier shrine displays crucifixes, statues of Mary, 
Joseph and Jesus and various martyred saints, all with mournful faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nguyens and their six children spent four months in a refugee camp in 
Indonesia before coming to the United States in the early 1980s. In Sacramento, 
they were receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The ex-sergeant 
from the South Vietnamese army, who is active in church, said through an 
interpreter that he was no help to his children when it came to explaining 
American things such as homework or news on TV. Still, wasn't what he wanted 
for his children the same as what any Vietnamese parent wants -- that they do 
well in school but keep "Vietnamese traditions"? 
</P>
<P>
 "Please tell the people of Sacramento I am very sorry for what my sons have 
done," the patriarch offered. Asked how his quiet, obedient boys wound up 
becoming hostage-takers, Nguyen and his wife provided only a miserable silence. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the silence of an older generation of Vietnamese refugees who no 
longer feel anchored anywhere but in their impoverished homes. The exterior 
landscape belongs to America, strange and nonsensical, not their true home. 
Inside, many Vietnamese refugees tend to raise their children with stern rules 
-- the way they themselves were raised back home. Vietnamese is spoken, with 
familial personal pronouns -- youngest son, older sister, aunt, father, great 
uncle, and so on -- lacing every sentence to remind the speakers and the 
listeners of their status in the Confucian hierarchical scheme of things. These 
parents are unprepared for children who lead dual lives, who may in fact commit 
rash and incomprehensibly violent acts -- not at all the docile and obedient 
Vietnamese children they had hoped to raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are no longer really Vietnamese, nor are they really Americans," said a 
former teacher, who recently came from Vietnam and now lives on welfare in 
Sacramento, of his own children. He called their tangled assimilation "crippled 
Americanization." 
</P>
<P>
 For Loi, Pham and Long Nguyen and Cuong Tran, who failed school and grew up 
between the Good Guys electronics store and the Ngoc Thao, there existed two 
separate notions -- notoriety and revenge, revenge being the stronger impulse. 
One encourages public displays (i.e., confessing on "Oprah," or holding 
shoppers hostage and giving incoherent speeches) that may lead mainstream 
America to acknowledge that they exist. The other fulfills the old man's 
extraterritorial passion -- "helicopters to Thailand to kill Viet Cong" -- and 
rejects America as the wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
 To grow up Vietnamese in America, after all, is to grow up with the legacy of 
belonging to the loser's side and to endure all that entails. To grow up in 
America is to desire individual fame and glory, a larger sense of the self. 
Driving on Stockton Boulevard, it suddenly occurs to me that, while I myself 
might have learned to walk that strange Vietnamese American hyphen, it 
continues to hurl young and hapless Vietnamese down into a dark and bottomless 
pit. 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER GOOD GUYS, THE MEDIA OFFERED A VARIETY OF EXPLANATIONS. One had to do 
with the chronology of waves, as in waves of Vietnamese immigrants. The first 
wave of refugees who came to America in 1975, my wave, comprised intellectuals, 
educators, army officers, skilled civil servants, professionals -- Vietnam's 
best and brightest -- those who had not experienced Vietnam under communist 
rule. This wave adjusted readily to American life, to an America of the 1970s 
that was economically stable and motivated, in part by guilt, to be generous to 
the newly arrived: There were English as a Second Language teachers, 
low-interest loans, job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The later wave, the boat people who came in the '80s, were a different group 
-- people who had been traumatized by re-education camps, cannibalism, rape, 
robbery, drowning at the hands of sea pirates, people who had suffered a 
chaotic and broken society back home under communist hands. These less-skilled, 
less-educated refugees were ill equipped to adjust to a less generous America. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were deeper currents that fed this second-wave refugee family that 
the media failed to detect. According to one Vietnamese who has been a social 
worker and knows the family well, the Nguyen parents had been burned not once 
but twice by communism. They fled to the South in 1954 when Catholics were 
persecuted by Ho Chi Minh and his army, and they fled Saigon as boat people a 
few years after the communists ransacked the South in 1975. Communist crimes, 
Viet Cong crimes, human-rights abuses by the Hanoi regime -- all are 
meticulously documented by Vietnamese Catholic newspapers and magazines in the 
United States. The Viet Cong, whom the eldest Nguyen boy barely remembered, 
nevertheless figured as the prime villains in the household cosmology -- the 
chief cause of their family's suffering in America, the robbers of their 
father's dignity, the blasphemers of the crucifix in their church, called the 
Vietnamese Catholic Martyrs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nguyen brothers and Cuong Pham (whose more-affluent Chinese Vietnamese 
parents, unlike the Nguyens, refused to open their doors to journalists) were 
reportedly Hong Kong movie fanatics. All four youths watched the highly 
stylized films whose sword-crossing heroes and gun-toting detectives and 
gangsters duked it out amid Hong Kong high-rises, filling their waking dreams 
with homilies to honor, fraternal loyalty, betrayal and, of course, revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Vietnamese living in Sacramento, these Hong Kong videos are the real 
culprit in the Good Guys shootout. Gangster films like John Woo's "A Better 
Tomorrow" and "Bullet in the Head" were the rage among Vietnamese youth in the 
late 1980s. It was in re-enacting these gang-shooting scenes, some speculate, 
that the gunmen coolly flipped coins to decide which of the hostages would take 
the first bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Bullet in the Head," three best friends -- blood brothers from Hong Kong 
looking to make a name for themselves (they have been losers up to this point) 
-- travel to Vietnam during the war to smuggle illegal ampicillin. With the 
help of an assassin, they end up fighting everyone, including the Viet Cong. 
Though profit was their original quest, they are searching for their lost souls 
-- they cannot decide whether they are good guys or bad guys. Along the way, 
the brothers are captured by the Viet Cong and tortured. They escape when Army 
of Republic of Vietnam helicopters arrive and attack the Viet Cong stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 What moves the plot along and prompts young Vietnamese viewers to 
whooping-oohing cheers, is the escalating interplay of terror and death from 
one scene to the next, culminating in a betrayal of camaraderie and leading to 
vengeance. A few weeks after Good Guys, Sacramento police received a mysterious 
letter signed by the Brothers of the Dragon.  
</P>
<P>
 "On 4-4-91 you have killed our brothers in Sacramento for no reason," it 
announced. "For this reason there must be revenge. The Brothers of the Dragon 
have decided in a meeting a lesson will be made." On the margins of the letter 
were the Vietnamese words that embody the Hong Kong video gangster mythos, 
words that many Vietnamese gang members have tattooed on their own skin: Tinh, 
Tien, Tu, Toi, Thu -- Love, Money, Prison, Sin, Revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 I TRY BUT CANNOT REACH LOI NGUYEN. HIS DEFENSE LAWYER, LINDA M. Parisi, 
refuses to answer my letters and phone calls. She traveled to Vietnam at her 
own expense to better understand the case and is known to be extremely 
protective of her client. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I go to interview his parents, both under psychiatric care. Although I 
imagine myself to be an American journalist, the closer I come to their home, 
the more I realize this has been a false assumption. Sitting in my car outside 
the Laura Dawn Manor, I am overwhelmed by fear and guilt. Once the door opens 
and the old couple welcomes me in, in my mother's language, I know I will lose 
all perspective. An American journalist would ask the old couple, "How do you 
feel?" but I can't. Among Vietnamese, a collective understanding assumes that 
we have all suffered an epic loss, so it is pointless to ask. Once inside, I 
might as well put away the note pad and declare my loyalty to the old couple, 
whatever their shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 I am also aware that I will somehow benefit from their tragedy. If the youths 
were inarticulate and failed to become stars, I, the one who has a public 
voice, am about to gain a measure of notoriety as the teller of their 
sensational tale. Irrational as it may be, I feel like a cannibal. And this, 
perhaps more than any other reason, is why I can't bring myself to knock on 
their door. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeated, I return to San Francisco, the city of glassy high-rises and rolling 
hills, where I live. It is, I realize, a different narrative that I am after 
now, one that moves from the incidental toward the historical. I go to Tu Lan, 
a Vietnamese coffee shop in the Tenderloin area where Vietnamese men wearing 
unkempt army jackets argue about Vietnamese politics in low voices on a weekday 
afternoon. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air like a white mosquito net. A song 
entitled "Mother Vietnam: We Are Still Here" echoes from the stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 Thuan, a 22-year-old who came to the United States five years ago, stares at 
my laptop with large, sad eyes as I jot down some notes. Of course he has heard 
about the Good Guys siege, which has become a legend among his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "What those guys tried to do is to make America notice us. To me they're 
martyrs. Brother, America doesn't care if we live or die. At night, I see 
Vietnamese kids wandering the streets like ghosts. Some run away from home, 
some have no home to go to. Some travel from one city to the next looking for 
something, not knowing what. Maybe if I had come early and become articulate 
and educated like you, it would be different. But it's too late. Now I'm just a 
nobody. No education. I'm just stupid like a pig." 
</P>
<P>
 Thuan, whose father died in a communist re-education camp, has an easy 
explanation for the hostage-takers' demands. "The ginseng roots are to increase 
your internal strength tenfold. Everybody knows that. Some say you can see in 
the dark if you drink enough tea made from it. The older the roots are, the 
more potent and powerful. The helicopters are for revenge. If I were the 
sheriff, brother, I'd have given them the helicopter and ammunition and sent 
them to Vietnam to kill all the f------ Viet Cong in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 IF I WERE ARTICULATE AND EDUCATED LIKE YOU, BROTHER . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how articulate a Vietnamese becomes, dear brother, when we set 
foot on the American shore, history is already against us. Vietnam goes on 
without us. America goes on without acknowledging us. We, like our defeated 
fathers, have become beside the point, a footnote in a small chapter of the 
history book. Our mythology is merely a private dream in America: There is no 
war to fight, no heroic quest, no territory to defend, no visible enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember that day when my father, the South Vietnamese general, remained 
behind in Vietnam while my family and I escaped to Guam. We sat on a beach near 
our refugee camp with a hundred or so Vietnamese countrymen, listening to the 
British Broadcasting Corp. detail Saigon's fall. I heard screams, saw wailing 
women tear their hair, saw men beat the sand with their fists, saw children 
weep. Then as the sun set, an old man stood up and sang our national anthem. 
"Let's go to the battlefields together, why regret one's life? National blood 
debts must be avenged by blood. . . . Oh, citizens, sacrifice your lives for 
the flag. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And so on. But no one joined the old man in the song. There was only silence. 
Then my mother whispered a challenge: "We are no longer citizens, we are now ma 
troi (wandering ghosts)." And the sun, blood red, dissolved into the horizon 
where Vietnam was, behind my mother's words. 
</P>
<P>
 Silence enshrouded the two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco where 10 of us 
-- two grandmothers, six grandchildren, two struggling sisters -- made our new 
home. Our bodies hurtled through the narrow, dark corridors like bats, avoiding 
the tiny kitchen where only the women were allowed entrance (and the smell of 
fish sauce seeped out). We ate in silence (but always with the television 
turned on) in the dining room that served as another bedroom at night; waited 
silently in line for the bathroom, took showers together, slept together, yet 
we negotiated these intimate acts with the gestures of mimes. Why talk at all 
if everything to be voiced would only invoke sorrow? Where once we had been 
lively, upper-middle-class families in that tropical country so far away, here 
we were mousy, impoverished, miserable exiles living in a deep, dark hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese refugee's first self-assessment in America is, inevitably, of 
his own helplessness. It is characterized by blushing, by looking down at one's 
feet, by avoiding eye contact and by waiting: for welfare and food stamps, for 
the free clinic exam, for free jackets donated by charity, for green cards. As 
for the Vietnamese child, at some point he comes to the brutal realization that 
"his" side has lost, and "his" nation is gone; that his parents are 
inarticulate fools in a new country called America, and he must face the 
outside world alone. 
</P>
<P>
 As I did. One autumn morning in the locker room of my junior high, Johnny M., 
the blond and blue-eyed boy standing gloriously naked, asked, "Refugee boy, 
which side were you on? The winner's or the loser's?"  
</P>
<P>
 English still an unbendable language on my tongue, I answered, "Me: Loser's 
side!" The locker room immediately erupted into a chorus of laughter, and I 
felt Johnny's wet towel on my face -- the white flag, I supposed, to surrender 
with. In geography class, Mrs. Collier brought out the new map of East Asia. 
Vietnam, that country coiling in the voluptuous shape of an S, was no longer 
mine. It was repainted now in a uniform color -- red -- the South flooded with 
blood. Mrs. Collier didn't know why, exactly, that strange Asian kid, so quiet, 
suddenly buried his face in his arms and wept. 
</P>
<P>
 It was my father's passion that I was feeling. A couple of months after our 
arrival, my father, the defeated general, made it to America. He and Aunty 
Tuyet's husband, a paratroop captain, had commandeered a ship and escaped from 
Vietnam. The defeated warriors shattered the silence with tales of battles. The 
women evacuated to other corners of the apartment, but we boys sat and 
listened, half in rapture, half in fright. Late at night, over Johnnie Walker 
whiskey, the living-room warriors recounted the time when they were young and 
brave and most alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Captain: "I remember going up Cambodia, brother, in '71. We killed so many 
Viet Cong up there, we lost count. There was this Mien, and he would kill and 
kill, crazy for blood, and take out the VC livers and eat them raw. . . . I 
swear in front of my ancestral grave I know no one more loyal than that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The General: "Viet Cong were everywhere, hidden in the jungle, in the tall 
bushes. From my helicopter, I ordered napalm. You could see the balls of fire 
brighten the tree line when they exploded. I remember an American adviser 
friend of mine, killed in a helicopter. Incroyable! Blown up by a SAM missile. 
My own helicopter was shot at by snipers. We landed before it exploded. But we 
killed at least 800 of them that day." 
</P>
<P>
 How can such language not stir a child's imagination? America is dull by 
comparison; it is too real, too impersonal outside the window -- a parking lot, 
a supermarket, Coke machines, the fog drifting harsh and cold. But inside, 
napalm fire, helicopters exploding, paratroopers landing, bombs oozing out of a 
drunken warrior's fragmented sentences, transforming the dilapidated apartment 
into a battleground. Did I not hear the wailing voices of Viet Cong under fire? 
Did I not see a helicopter burst into flame? Smell the burnt flesh? 
</P>
<P>
 Outside our apartment there was a stairwell, dark and cool. The voices echoing 
from it now -- giggling voices trying to be serious -- belonged to my cousins 
and me, four child musketeers, swearing a sacred oath of vengeance after our 
fathers, drunk, had gone to bed. We talked of eradicating the Viet Cong from 
the face of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "With bazookas, with M16s, with kung fu power." 
</P>
<P>
 "With Bruce Lee's swiftness and endurance, we can massacre them all." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can bomb the levees north of Hanoi during the monsoon." I, the 
12-year-old, the plotter, offered. "We can flood the nasty Viet Cong out to the 
South China Sea." 
</P>
<P>
 In this way the dynamic of the exiled Vietnamese family is formed. 
</P>
<P>
 So I still understand my brother in the coffee shop. But while he speaks of 
vengeance, I have learned a different lesson, the American lesson: the knack of 
re-inventing oneself. To survive in the New World, we must, likewise, challenge 
the old world's blood-for-blood ethos and search for a new story line. 
</P>
<P>
 I am no longer simply Vietnamese. I have changed. I have, like many I know, 
driven down that hyphen that stretches like a freeway from the mythological 
kingdom with its 1,000-year-old ginseng roots toward the cosmopolitan city, the 
wind in my hair and Springsteen on the radio. English is a bendable language 
now, English my own song. 
</P>
<P>
 I am, for that matter, no longer moved by the old man's martial words on that 
Guam beach. I believe instead in self-liberation, in American rebirth. But 
never mind. I am thinking now of those four boys and their fatal gestures and 
what distinguishes good guys from bad guys in the new Vietnamese-American 
fable.  
</P>
<P>
 I AM NOT A CATHOLIC. There is no three-tiered shrine in my family's living 
room for martyred saints. My mother is a Buddhist but she stopped praying for a 
time when we lost the war. My father, born a French citizen when Vietnam was a 
colony, was given a Christian name but never went to church. Unlike the Nguyen 
brothers, I am only half a Northerner, and I take my cardinal points from the 
South, from Saigon, my birthplace, where bourgeois sensibilities and Southern 
irreverence replaces Northern pieties. I have been to Paris and Nice, where my 
father's relatives live and where -- for the first time since leaving Vietnam 
-- I felt, shamelessly, somehow I had come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northerners are fanatics," my father said at dinner one night after the 
Good Guys incident. My father had lived in Paris and liked wine more than 
jasmine tea; within five years of his arrival in America, he obtained an MBA 
and lifted us out of poverty into a suburban middle-class life. "The 
Northerners immolate themselves and talk too readily of martyrdom. They don't 
think rationally. They think emotionally. Tu sais, comme ta mere! Those boys 
must have ingested all the plots for tragedy from their Northern Catholic 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 My mother dropped her chopsticks and feigned anger. "We Northerners defeated 
the French while you drank their wine," she said, but we all laughed. She was, 
like the rest of us, also drinking French wine. As the entire family sat there 
under the gaudy faux-crystal chandelier, in my parent's five-bedroom house with 
its kidney-shaped swimming pool, the irony did not escape us: Historical 
tragedy had come to seem beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? Perhaps only a loser knows real freedom. Forced outside 
of history, away from home and hearth, he can choose to remake himself. One 
night America seeps in, and out goes the Vietnamese soul of sorrow. For the 
Vietnamese refugee family, the past is an enigma best left (at least 
temporarily) alone. Didn't I see America invade the household when the 
conversation at dinner in our new home leaned slowly but surely toward real 
estate and escrow, toward jobs and cars and GPAs and overtime and vacation 
plans -- the language of the American dream? Even my father's dinner 
conversation had shifted to memories of an earlier time, a time before the war, 
when B-52 bombs were not falling and Vietnam was a lush tropical paradise or 
when he was living in Paris as a young man, tempestuously in love. 
</P>
<P>
 But I suspect irony was a luxury unavailable to those young men. Without the 
warriors-turned-businessmen, the pool, the chandelier above the dining room 
table to anchor them in a more complex reality, their passions remained colored 
by old-world vehemence. 
</P>
<P>
 A big difference between me and them was that my father helped me with my 
homework. I trusted my father's version of America, that "it was built when 
Europe dumped its nonconformists on America's shore." That to make it in 
America, you need shrewdness, flexibility and a good aptitude for knowing your 
place in the world. My father, who saw himself as living in exile, nevertheless 
taught me how to interpret Walter Cronkite's bad news, taught me how to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not, because of my father's help, fail school. That singularly most 
important American-making institution embraced me and rejected those boys. I am 
also nearly seven years older than Loi Nguyen, old enough to record the actual 
war in my memories as an army brat. I do not need John Woo's slo-mo gore. 
Because I thought it through myself years ago, I know the illogic of killing 
Viet Cong from helicopters in peacetime -- how would you distinguish them from 
ordinary Vietnamese? Which conical-hatted figure would you shoot? 
</P>
<P>
 A FRIEND WHO WORKS IN Palawan refugee camp in the Philippines recently sent me 
a poem he found carved on a stone under a tamarind tree. Written by an unknown 
Vietnamese boat person, it tells how to escape tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your mind is like a radio that you can dial to a different voice. It depends 
on you. So do not keep your mind always tuned to sorrow. If you want, just 
change the channel." 
</P>
<P>
 When I turned 30 recently, years after I switched the dial, as it were, my 
father said, "At your age I was already a colonel." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very different now, Dad," I snapped, a little irritated. "I don't have 
a need to be a warrior here in America." My father smiled a sad, knowing smile. 
What relevant words of wisdom can an exiled general pass down to his fully 
grown American son, the one whom he sometimes introduces to his ex-army buddies 
as "the American one," which in Vietnamese could translate, depending on the 
context, as "bad," "soulless" or "traitor"? 
</P>
<P>
 As I think about those young men and what they did, I realize that I, in 
Vietnamese eyes, haven't been a very good son. I had denounced my father's 
passion for his homeland as parochialism, had learned to listen to his war 
stories as tales of nostalgia, had, in fact, taken the private angst of his 
generation and disseminated it in public light -- an unfilial act. 
</P>
<P>
 I imagine the Nguyen brothers adoring their father, the ex-sergeant of the 
South Vietnamese army. They must have loved and trusted his war stories. 
According to the Sacramento Bee, the Nguyen brothers had folded their arms, the 
Vietnamese filial pious gesture, and asked their parents for permission to 
leave the house that fateful day. This image haunts me. They tried to bring 
dignity to their father by fighting his war. They coveted being good Vietnamese 
sons: To assuage the old man's grief, the young man must defeat his old man's 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamlet's unfocused vehemence is not to my taste, his bloody rampage to be 
his father's son inappropriate to the New World. I am more intrigued by the 
complicated character of Indar in V.S. Naipaul's "A Bend in The River," who has 
lost his family home and fortune to political upheavals and been forced outside 
of territorial boundaries. "I am lucky," he said, "I carry the world within me. 
. . . I'm tired of being on the losing side. I want to win and win and win." 
</P>
<P>
 "To be or not to be" is no longer the question, for some of us Vietnamese 
children in America have learned to escape the outdated passions. These days, 
after a weekend visit I hug my mother but cannot approach my father. We regard 
each other instead from a distance, nod, and no more. We are veterans from 
different wars, and I have won mine.  
</P>
<P>
 A MILE OR SO FROM THE Good Guys store, at the newest plot in St. Mary's 
Cemetery, flanked by a large statue of St. Pius and an American flag, Long and 
Pham Nguyen are buried side by side. It takes awhile to find their tombstones 
behind the pink mausoleum. It is late afternoon, and a few birds chirp as the 
sprinklers spray mist that forms rainbows. The only other visitors at St. 
Mary's are a Vietnamese family busy burning incense sticks. The smoke, blown by 
a warm breeze, wavers alluringly. 
</P>
<P>
 This desert-like landscape, with it sandalwood fragrance, is not part of Joan 
Didion's California anymore. The dark epic journeys that end in California have 
new players. Searching for the Nguyen brothers' tombstones, I find names that 
leave a kind of phosphorescence on my mind -- names like Le, Tran, Vuong, 
Nguyen -- Vietnamese last names that once belonged to emperors of millennia 
passed, etched on new tombstones on plots where the grass has not yet fully 
grown.

THE UNTOUCHABLES; BASEBALL: BELL HIGH'S DOMINATING PITCHING STAFF PLANS TO KEEP 
THE EAGLES IN CONTENTION FOR THE CITY TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Baseball fans whose teams face Bell High School may want to get to the games 
early this year to watch batting prac tice. That's just about all the contact 
their school's hitters will be making on game day. 
</P>
<P>
 With pitchers Johnny Moreno, Yamel Delgado and Larry Gayton, who have a 
combined 0.83 earned-run average, this season looks to be a very good -- but a 
very boring -- one for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just fine with Coach Henry Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably have the best pitching staff in the area," he said. Moreno, 
Delgado and Gayton "take a lot of pressure off our hitters because we know that 
we don't need to score a lot of runs to win a game." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be up to players such as South Gate's Jose Montenegro, the 
Southeastern Conference Co-Player of the Year, and Roosevelt's Alex Rodriguez, 
a City Times second-team selection, to gather hits against Bell's talented 
trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's Wesley Rachels, Bell Gardens' Pedro Loza and South Gate's Alonso 
Lopez -- all City Times first-teamers -- return to fuel their teams' 
championship drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the top area teams: Southeastern Conference 
</P>
<P>
 Bell (21-4, 12-4): City 3-A pitcher Moreno, who was 6-1 with a 0.50 ERA, 
Delgado (6-1, 0.90) and Gayton (6-1, 1.10) should keep the Eagles in every 
game. Newcomer Manuel Armendariz will be a welcome addition to the pitching 
staff. The offensive burden will be shared among hitters such as senior first 
baseman Valente Bertran, who hit .354 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont (9-15, 5-11): Senior pitcher Rinaldo Monterrosa, who was 3-3 last year 
with a 2.60 ERA, returns for the Pathfinders. Fremont's top newcomer is Joel 
Marquez, who hit .390 for the junior varsity team last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield (8-12, 6-10): The Bulldogs' top returner will be junior outfielder 
Ramiro Cuevas, who hit .295 last season. Junior pitcher Byron Valencia, who was 
2-2 with a 2.10 ERA last year, will see more action this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park (23-8, 10-6): Talented senior Alex Orpeza will be one of the 
Southeastern Conference's marquee players. The third baseman hit .466 last 
season with two home runs and 20 RBIs. Pitcher Mario Arambula, who was 5-5 last 
season with a 2.10 ERA, will also platoon at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson (11-11, 8-8): Senior pitcher Juan Arellano, who was 5-2 with a 3.0 
ERA last season, will head the Bulldogs' staff. Junior Jose Solis, who hit .275 
as a utility player last year, will start at catcher in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan (5-18, 3-13): Senior shortstop Benny Olivades led the Bulldogs last 
year with a .370 batting average. Olivades should get support from slugger 
Sergio Medrano, who hit .333 with five home runs at the center field spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke (4-12, 4-12): The Saints will be led by the bats of seniors Ronald 
Smith, who hit .484 with four home runs and 17 RBIs last season and Hector 
Chavez, who hit .485 with three home runs and 15 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt (19-4, 13-3): As usual, the Roughriders will feature a cast of 
heavy-hitters led by star catcher Alex Rodriguez, who hit .372 last season. 
Second baseman Juan Carlos Rodriguez, who hit .350, and junior center-fielder 
Chris Minter, who hit .400 for the junior varsity team, will give Rodriguez 
plenty of offensive support. As always, pitching is a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate (26-5, 14-2): The defending City 3-A champs are an early favorite 
to return to the finals. Pitcher Alonso Lopez, a City 3-A first-team selection 
last season, was virtually unhittable with a 1.58 ERA and 11-0 record. Third 
baseman Jose Montenegro, who batted .444 with 34 RBIs, and first baseman Jesse 
Torres, who batted .427, are City 3-A first-teamers who will anchor a solid 
core of hitters. Southern Pacific Conference 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (26-5, 16-3): Last season's City 3-A runner-up should have little 
trouble repeating as Southern Pacific champ. Second baseman Mike McNeely, who 
hit .407 last year, and third baseman Mark Sarrea, who hit .356, will provide 
invaluable leadership for a talented crop of newcomers. The presence and 
talents of 16-game winner Mark Jones, who was named City 3-A most valuable 
player last year as a pitcher, will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey (0-17, 0-5): As the Dons embark on a new season, they hope to break a 
two-year winless streak. Senior Brandon Brown and junior Reginald Douglas look 
to help Dorsey turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (10-11, 8-9): Junior Joseph George, who hit .418 last season, will 
split time between shortstop and third base this year. The Generals hit .312 as 
a team last season but their pitching staff will need to improve on their 4.07 
team ERA. Northern Conference 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln (12-5, 6-3): The Tigers hit an impressive .320 as a team last season 
with sluggers such as shortstop Ceasar Castenada, who hit .360 with five home 
runs. Third baseman Lizado Erami, who hit .340 with 10 home runs last season, 
will also provide plenty of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson (14-7, 9-6): Center fielder Dan Alarcon batted .344 last year and looks 
to be the Mules' top offensive threat this season. Pitcher Rene Herrera, who 
had 2.20 ERA while batting .401, will be Wilson's top returner. Southern 
Section 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens (14-14-1; 9-5-1): Almont League Offensive Player of the Year 
Pedro Loza heads a hard-hitting Lancer team. The senior center-fielder batted 
.481 last season while stealing 32 bases in 35 attempts, including 27 straight 
in league play. Senior shortstop Manual Arana hit .347 with two home runs and 
19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathedral (11-12; 6-6): The Phantoms have nine returnees from the squad that 
knocked off Montclair Prep, the No. 4 team in the Southern Section, in the 
first round of last year's playoffs. Senior shortstop Luis De Leon hit .403 
last season and was named to the Santa Fe League's first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (11-12, 9-5): Senior shortstop Wesley Rachels, who hit .493 with 30 
RBIs and four home runs last year, is the odds-on favorite to be named City 
Times' Player of the Year this season. Rachels, a two-time All-Mission League 
first-team selection, is joined by senior pitcher Bobby Thomason, who was 3-2 
last year in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesian (8-10; 5-6): All-Santa Fe League first-team first baseman Ed 
Fernandez was one of the league's top batters last year with a .425 average. 
Senior pitchers Alex Chacon, who was 5-2 with a 1.5 ERA, and Louis Marcus, who 
was 4-2 with a 2.2 ERA, head a strong staff.

THE LOST MINES OF LLALLAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCELO DE URIOSTE , Antonin Kratochvil is a documentary photographer whose 
work has appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world. De Urioste, a 
Bolivian-born author and journalist, currently lives in Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1904, in the barren mountains in western Bolivia, Simon I. Patino found "La 
Salvadora." It was the richest tin deposit in the world. Hard-working miners 
and the latest technology made Patino the "King of Tin" -- one of the 10 
richest men on the planet. Patino transformed a desert of stone into Llallagua, 
a busy city with six high schools, three theaters, two hospitals, an Olympic 
swimming pool, a golf course and a crowded commercial downtown. During World 
War II, Bolivian mines produced nearly all the tin used by Allied forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, a revolution took place and the tin mines, which produced 70% of 
Bolivia's foreign earnings, were seized by the state. Llallagua, about 180 
miles southeast of La Paz, became a city of 30,000 residents, including 
powerful union leaders, government bureaucrats and relatively wealthy miners 
and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's venture, however, was an economic failure. Tin is expensive to 
mine and the government had not invested its earnings into new technology. 
Between 1979 and 1985, the state industry lost $500 million, contributing to an 
inflation rate that reached 24,000% in 1985. The situation became even worse 
when international tin prices crashed that year. Victor Paz Estenssoro -- the 
same president who had nationalized the tin mines and who returned to office in 
1985 -- was forced to privatize the industry and invite foreign investment. 
Some mines, including Llallagua, were closed. Twenty-thousand miners were fired 
nationwide. Llallagua's population was halved, leaving a city of hungry 
phantoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are the palliris , jucos and independent miners depicted here -- an 
acknowledged, but largely ignored populace that resulted from Bolivia's 
industrial upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of palliris -- women scavengers -- scrounge though the tailings left 
by the mining companies, looking for rocks with enough tin to sell to a tienda 
mineral -- an assayer. They never had unions, salaries or social security, and 
they work in one of the harshest environments imaginable -- at an altitude of 
12,000 feet, where trees and birds can hardly exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Jucos are thieves who steal tin ore from the state-owned mines. Massive theft 
was one of the reasons the government's industry collapsed. Theft was so 
lucrative that in the late '80s it was difficult for the university in 
Llallagua to hire support personnel because potential candidates made more 
money as jucos . 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of laid-off state employees become independent miners, now working 
without the benefits they once enjoyed: free housing, education and health 
services, subsidized food and stable salaries. Independents make up 80% of 
Bolivia's mining workforce, but, using technology that was already obsolete in 
the 19th Century, they produce less than 20% of the nation's total mineral 
output. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Bolivia enjoys political stability, the lowest rate of inflation in 
Latin America and small but steady economic growth. The benefits of these 
reforms have not yet reached the lives of the phantoms left behind. But new 
winds may be blowing over the metallic mountains of Llallagua. A Brazilian 
industrial giant has proposed a joint venture to work the massive tin tailings. 
In the mountains of Llallagua, tomorrow could be another day -- if phantoms can 
become miners again. MARCELO DE URIOSTE

COLUMN ONE; ORANGE COUNTY TRIBE BATTLES FOR ITS IDENTITY; THE JUANENO INDIANS 
WERE STRIPPED OF A LARGE PART OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THEY SEEK U.S. 
RECOGNITION TO VALIDATE THEIR PAST AND ENRICH THEIR FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Spaniards, the Mexicans, the Catholic Church and U.S. settlers took 
away their land and left them homeless, the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians 
could lay claim to much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground beneath Disneyland, Camp Pendleton and Mission San Juan Capistrano 
belonged to them. Many Juanenos are buried under what now are strip malls and 
parking lots, forgotten long ago in the rush from wilderness to pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 But their 4,500 descendants, about half of whom live near the adobe mission 
here, have not forgotten. They are trying to persuade the federal government 
that they exist as a tribe with roots dating back 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That struggle for recognition is a product of the Juanenos' embattled history 
and the increasingly strident competition that may determine their future. They 
are among hundreds of Indian groups hoping to win the potentially lucrative 
blessing of the U.S. government. Federal recognition could bring a tribe a 
reservation, with schools, housing and health care provided by taxpayers. It 
could even mean a casino brimming with profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos' campaign is also complicated by a spate of tribal pretenders 
inspired by what critics call "Dances With Wolves" romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a place to carry on the traditions of our culture," Juaneno leader 
David Belardes said. "For our children, our children's children and their 
children. We are the indigenous people of this area." 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos formally applied for tribal status in 1982 but made their first 
government claim more than a century before that. In recent months, they have 
emerged from among hundreds of bands, rising to No. 1 on a long list trying to 
gain active consideration by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their bid has been bolstered by recognition from the state, which cited an 
archeological history dating back a hundred centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos' lack of federal recognition is "an oversight of history," said 
Paul Apodaca, curator of Native American art at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana 
and an authority on Indian culture. "Absolutely, they're a tribe. They had 
their own language, their own group identity. They practiced religion in a way 
that was distinct to them. They were a legitimate social entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember, tribal recognition is not the government granting them 
something. Rather, it is recognizing them as a legitimate legal entity that the 
government has unfinished business with. And the government has unfinished 
business with the Juanenos. It needs to grant them recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the plight of the Acjachemen people -- as the Juanenos were 
originally called -- is similar to that of many California tribes. After 
thousands of years comfortably living off the land and developing a rich, 
peace-loving culture, they were enslaved by Spanish missionaries in the 18th 
Century. The Mexican government recognized them as citizens with limited 
rights. The United States seized the territory in 1848. Its settlers offered a 
$25 a head bounty on California Indians, a practice that did not end until the 
turn of the century. The bounty forced many Juanenos to retreat to the hills 
and others to marry Latinos in attempts to assimilate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such obstacles, the Juanenos maintained an "identity continuously 
throughout history, so we are, in fact, a tribe," said Belardes, 47, whose 
father, grandfather and great-grandfather pioneered the tribe's cause and who 
have a street named after them in San Juan Capistrano. "And we've governed 
ourselves from mission times to the present. In my mind, that means federal 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Juanenos can be found as far as Texas and Florida, but most live in 
Orange County. Many are Catholics who have intermarried and "continue to pay 
taxes on the land our forefathers owned before the government took it away," 
said Belardes, a groundskeeper for the Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 As often as he can, he and fellow Juanenos gather for ceremonial dances and 
prayers, basket weaving and tribal conferences, where they speak their own 
language, Acjachemen, and pass on the sorrows and triumphs of their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In the history they often retell, the Acjachemen people welcomed the Spanish 
missionaries, only to be converted to the conquerors' religion and commandeered 
to help build Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spaniards renamed the tribe for the mission. They used "Juanenos" to refer 
to the scattered but closely related bands of raven-haired, brown-eyed, 
olive-skinned Indians living in the canyons and along the shores of the 
Pacific. Although it is hard to estimate population data, scholars say several 
hundred to several thousand Juanenos roamed the beaches and arid hills of much 
of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Their territory extended from the southern tier of what is now Los Angeles 
County to Camp Pendleton in north San Diego County and east to Riverside 
County, according to the state resolution recognizing the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some historians and members of the Gabrielino Indian band dispute those 
boundaries, saying the Gabrielinos -- who lived primarily in the Los Angeles 
Basin -- shared at least part of the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to work as slaves, the Juanenos were shackled with collars and leashes 
and kept in line by the garrisons that accompanied the mission fathers. The 
Spaniards used them for construction work, farming and domestic labor, 
forbidding them to pray to their god, Chinigchinich, or speak Acjachemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish originally intended to return the mission lands to the Indians 
after they had civilized the tribe. But the Juanenos received only a few plots 
after the new Mexican government secularized the mission and freed them from 
the padres' authority in 1833. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the land was divided among white settlers, who established a town in 
San Juan Capistrano in 1841. California became a U.S. territory after the 
Mexican-American War in 1848, and a state in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
 When the United States seized the territory, "it sent Army generals around to 
negotiate treaties," Apodaca said. "And they just didn't meet with everybody. 
It's that simple. There was no real pressure to because they already owned the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos first petitioned U.S. authorities for recognition in the mid-19th 
Century, when the bounty program was still in force. 
</P>
<P>
 The bounty, or scalping as it was commonly known, ended only because law 
enforcement became more civilized and society more friendly to California 
Indians, who did not become U.S citizens until 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the century, the Juanenos had lost all claim to their vast 
acreage. Not one of 18 treaties signed with early settlers was ratified by 
Congress, which foresaw the state's potential wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 The very existence of the treaties was concealed for half a century. Had they 
been ratified, Indians would have owned about a quarter of the state, scholars 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 After statehood, many Indians were crammed onto what was left of the Spanish 
ranchos, then left homeless when the lands were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that the Juanenos' peaceful nature cost them the chance for 
federal recognition earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Juanenos were made to suffer largely for being peace-loving," said Jane 
Uyeno, president of the Native American Indian Cultural Center in Tustin. "Like 
a lot of tribes who chose not to fight, they got stomped -- in every way 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Pechanga tribe, which fought the last Indian war in 
California, ended up with more than 6,000 acres in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, each Juaneno was awarded $150 as part of $25 million set aside by the 
federal government to buy out California's Indians. They had filed suit more 
than a decade earlier over land rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the payoff and the tawdry history it represented, Juaneno leader 
Clarence Lobo filed a second suit on behalf of the state's Indians. When the 
government offered to settle that suit 20 years later for $29.1 million, Lobo 
objected, saying it amounted to 47 cents an acre for the Indians' confiscated 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 What angered him more, Lobo said, was that fellow Indians outvoted him 4 to 1 
to accept the settlement. In 1972, they received individual checks of $668.52, 
after legal fees. Lobo refused his check and moved to Northern California, 
where he died of a brain tumor. An elementary school in San Clemente was 
recently named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A tribe recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs can establish its own 
sovereign government, with a court system and police force. It has access to 
lucrative grants for higher education and the power to tax any tenant who uses 
the land. It can also gain the multimillion-dollar profits that some 
reservations reap from casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal pie for Indians is so small that if you include more tribes, 
slices of the pie get even smaller," said a top congressional aide who works 
only on behalf of Indians and who requested anonymity. "What often results is 
an ugly fight bordering on civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 tribes in the continental United States and 226 native villages 
in Alaska are recognized by the federal government. About a third of those in 
the continental United States are in California, and nearly a third of those 
are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 All have satisfied the strict ethnological, historical, legal and political 
requirements outlined in federal guidelines, the bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal recognition depends on factors including a tribe's "repeated 
identification by (U.S.) authorities, a longstanding relationship with state 
government, repeated dealings with a county, parish or local government based 
on the group's individual identity," according to the agency's literature. 
</P>
<P>
 A prospective tribe's chances are enhanced if it has been identified as an 
Indian entity by scholars, the media and in dealings with recognized tribes or 
national Indian organizations, the agency says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Federal Acknowledgment Program was established in 1978 to handle 
modern claims, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has recognized nine tribes out of 
147 petitions. Congress has recognized four on its own. Six tribes are under 
active consideration, with three -- including the Juanenos -- to be considered 
next, agency spokesman Carl Shaw said. Another 83 are in the application 
process, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaining tribal status has been complicated by legalized gambling, which began 
on reservations in 1980, and the surge in "new age" Native American groups. 
Both have increased the number of contenders for tribal status and raise 
questions in some minds about some groups' motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tribes assailed the Golden Hill Paugussetts of Bridgeport, Conn., for 
instance, saying the group seeks recognition solely to establish a casino that 
would try to divert New York City gamblers from Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the profit potential is enticing. The Mashantucket Pequot's Foxwoods 
casino in Connecticut reports a net operating profit of more than $20 million a 
month and a 45% to 50% profit margin compared to that of 10% to 15% in Atlantic 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian gaming enterprises began with a bingo hall in Florida and have expanded 
to 68 casinos and 170 high-stakes bingo games in 24 states, with more planned. 
About half the nation's recognized tribes are trying to open gaming halls. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County is home to three such casinos. Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties have one each. In Palm Springs, the Agua Caliente band of Cahuilla 
Indians plans to build a gaming casino downtown to be managed by Caesars World. 
The partnership, announced in November, 1992, calls for a $25-million gambling 
hall to open in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes said he was approached about opening a casino in Orange County if the 
Juanenos are recognized. Suggested reservation sites include military bases 
that are facing closure or land in the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to be recognized," he said. "Beyond that, we cross each bridge as 
we come to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tribes fear the potential of what Indian lobbyist George Waters calls "new age 
charlatans from California" to win recognition from Congress, which can grant 
tribal status without imposing the Bureau of Indian Affair's criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them the post-'Dances With Wolves' Indians," he said, referring to 
the 1990 Kevin Costner movie. "They run around in sweat lodges, thinking Indian 
religion is so cool. Most aren't even Indians. But they hinder the efforts of 
all of those who might be legitimate. The effort to become recognized is, I'm 
afraid, a vicious struggle with too many competitors and a government running 
out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, Indian groups fear that the inclusion of "charlatan" tribes 
could diminish their own role as self-contained, sovereign powers -- for which 
they have fought for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Juanenos hope that recognition comes during the Clinton Administration. 
Such optimism is sobered by the fact that few tribes were recognized during the 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush years. 
</P>
<P>
 Juaneno leader Belardes hopes tribal recognition will come, in part, to bestow 
lasting honor on Lobo. 
</P>
<P>
 If their fight fails? "It will be a continuation of how our people have been 
wronged throughout history," Belardes said. "We've survived and made it on our 
own, without the government's help. So we would continue to exist, to maintain 
our culture and carry on, to teach our traditions to our children, who would 
pass it on to theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In God's eyes -- if not the nation's -- we know we belong." Who Are the 
Juanenos? 
</P>
<P>
 * Name: The name Juaneno was given to native Californians by the Spaniards, 
who converted them to Christianity in the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * Numbers: 3,000 still live in California; many live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * History: Tribe dates back 10,000 years and once populated the arid hills, 
canyons and beaches of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Customs: Family groups lived in villages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Language: Acagchemem. (pronounced ha-SHAY-mem) 
</P>
<P>
 * Religion: Chinigchinich. (pronounced cha-NEE-cha-NEE)

COLUMN ONE; A TRIBE'S BATTLE FOR ITS IDENTITY; OVER THE YEARS, THE JUANENO 
INDIANS WERE STRIPPED OF A LARGE PART OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THEY SEEK U.S. 
RECOGNITION TO VALIDATE THEIR PAST AND ENRICH THEIR FUTURE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Spaniards, the Mexicans, the Catholic Church and U.S. settlers took 
away their land and left them homeless, the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians 
could lay claim to much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground beneath Disneyland, Camp Pendleton and Mission San Juan Capistrano 
belonged to them. Many Juanenos are buried under what now are strip malls and 
parking lots, forgotten long ago in the rush from wilderness to pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 But their 4,500 descendants, about half of whom live near the adobe mission 
here, have not forgotten. They are trying to persuade the federal government 
that they exist as a tribe with roots dating back 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That struggle for recognition is a product of the Juanenos' embattled history 
and the increasingly strident competition that may determine their future. They 
are among hundreds of Indian groups hoping to win the potentially lucrative 
blessing of the U.S. government. Federal recognition could bring a tribe a 
reservation, with schools, housing and health care provided by taxpayers. It 
could even mean a casino brimming with profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos' campaign is also complicated by a spate of tribal pretenders 
inspired by what critics call "Dances With Wolves" romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a place to carry on the traditions of our culture," Juaneno leader 
David Belardes said. "For our children, our children's children and their 
children. We are the indigenous people of this area." 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos formally applied for tribal status in 1982 but made their first 
government claim more than a century before that. In recent months, they have 
emerged from among hundreds of bands, rising to No. 1 on a long list trying to 
gain active consideration by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their bid has been bolstered by recognition from the state, which cited an 
archeological history dating back a hundred centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos' lack of federal recognition is "an oversight of history," said 
Paul Apodaca, curator of Native American art at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana 
and an authority on Indian culture. "Absolutely, they're a tribe. They had 
their own language, their own group identity. They practiced religion in a way 
that was distinct to them. They were a legitimate social entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember, tribal recognition is not the government granting them 
something. Rather, it is recognizing them as a legitimate legal entity that the 
government has unfinished business with. And the government has unfinished 
business with the Juanenos. It needs to grant them recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the plight of the Acjachemen people -- as the Juanenos were 
originally called -- is similar to that of many California tribes. After 
thousands of years comfortably living off the land and developing a rich, 
peace-loving culture, they were enslaved by Spanish missionaries in the 18th 
Century. The Mexican government recognized them as citizens with limited 
rights. The United States seized the territory in 1848. Its settlers offered a 
$25 a head bounty on California Indians, a practice that did not end until the 
turn of the century. The bounty forced many Juanenos to retreat to the hills 
and others to marry Latinos in attempts to assimilate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such obstacles, the Juanenos maintained an "identity continuously 
throughout history, so we are, in fact, a tribe," said Belardes, 47, whose 
father, grandfather and great-grandfather pioneered the tribe's cause and who 
have a street named after them in San Juan Capistrano. "And we've governed 
ourselves from mission times to the present. In my mind, that means federal 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Juanenos can be found as far as Texas and Florida, but most live in 
Orange County. Many are Catholics who have intermarried and "continue to pay 
taxes on the land our forefathers owned before the government took it away," 
said Belardes, a groundskeeper for the Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 As often as he can, he and fellow Juanenos gather for ceremonial dances and 
prayers, basket weaving and tribal conferences, where they speak their own 
language, Acjachemen, and pass on the sorrows and triumphs of their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In the history they often retell, the Acjachemen people welcomed the Spanish 
missionaries, only to be converted to the conquerors' religion and commandeered 
to help build Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spaniards renamed the tribe for the mission. They used "Juanenos" to refer 
to the scattered but closely related bands of raven-haired, brown-eyed, 
olive-skinned Indians living in the canyons and along the shores of the 
Pacific. Although it is hard to estimate population data, scholars say several 
hundred to several thousand Juanenos roamed the beaches and arid hills of much 
of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Their territory extended from the southern tier of what is now Los Angeles 
County to Camp Pendleton in north San Diego County and east to Riverside 
County, according to the state resolution recognizing the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some historians and members of the Gabrielino Indian band dispute those 
boundaries, saying the Gabrielinos -- who lived primarily in the Los Angeles 
Basin -- shared at least part of the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to work as slaves, the Juanenos were shackled with collars and leashes 
and kept in line by the garrisons that accompanied the mission fathers. The 
Spaniards used them for construction work, farming and domestic labor, 
forbidding them to pray to their god, Chinigchinich, or speak Acjachemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish originally intended to return the mission lands to the Indians 
after they had civilized the tribe. But the Juanenos received only a few plots 
after the new Mexican government secularized the mission and freed them from 
the padres' authority in 1833. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the land was divided among white settlers, who established a town in 
San Juan Capistrano in 1841. California became a U.S. territory after the 
Mexican-American War in 1848, and a state in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
 When the United States seized the territory, "it sent Army generals around to 
negotiate treaties," Apodaca said. "And they just didn't meet with everybody. 
It's that simple. There was no real pressure to because they already owned the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos first petitioned U.S. authorities for recognition in the mid-19th 
Century, when the bounty program was still in force. 
</P>
<P>
 The bounty, or scalping as it was commonly known, ended only because law 
enforcement became more civilized and society more friendly to California 
Indians, who did not become U.S citizens until 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the century, the Juanenos had lost all claim to their vast 
acreage. Not one of 18 treaties signed with early settlers was ratified by 
Congress, which foresaw the state's potential wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 The very existence of the treaties was concealed for half a century. Had they 
been ratified, Indians would have owned about a quarter of the state, scholars 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 After statehood, many Indians were crammed onto what was left of the Spanish 
ranchos, then left homeless when the lands were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that the Juanenos' peaceful nature cost them the chance for 
federal recognition earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Juanenos were made to suffer largely for being peace-loving," said Jane 
Uyeno, president of the Native American Indian Cultural Center in Tustin. "Like 
a lot of tribes who chose not to fight, they got stomped -- in every way 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Pechanga tribe, which fought the last Indian war in 
California, ended up with more than 6,000 acres in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, each Juaneno was awarded $150 as part of $25 million set aside by the 
federal government to buy out California's Indians. They had filed suit more 
than a decade earlier over land rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the payoff and the tawdry history it represented, Juaneno leader 
Clarence Lobo filed a second suit on behalf of the state's Indians. When the 
government offered to settle that suit 20 years later for $29.1 million, Lobo 
objected, saying it amounted to 47 cents an acre for the Indians' confiscated 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 What angered him more, Lobo said, was that fellow Indians outvoted him 4 to 1 
to accept the settlement. In 1972, they received individual checks of $668.52, 
after legal fees. Lobo refused his check and moved to Northern California, 
where he died of a brain tumor. An elementary school in San Clemente was 
recently named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A tribe recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs can establish its own 
sovereign government, with a court system and police force. It has access to 
lucrative grants for higher education and the power to tax any tenant who uses 
the land. It can also gain the multimillion-dollar profits that some 
reservations reap from casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal pie for Indians is so small that if you include more tribes, 
slices of the pie get even smaller," said a top congressional aide who works 
only on behalf of Indians and who requested anonymity. "What often results is 
an ugly fight bordering on civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 tribes in the continental United States and 226 native villages 
in Alaska are recognized by the federal government. About a third of those in 
the continental United States are in California, and nearly a third of those 
are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 All have satisfied the strict ethnological, historical, legal and political 
requirements outlined in federal guidelines, the bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal recognition depends on factors including a tribe's "repeated 
identification by (U.S.) authorities, a longstanding relationship with state 
government, repeated dealings with a county, parish or local government based 
on the group's individual identity," according to the agency's literature. 
</P>
<P>
 A prospective tribe's chances are enhanced if it has been identified as an 
Indian entity by scholars, the media and in dealings with recognized tribes or 
national Indian organizations, the agency says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Federal Acknowledgment Program was established in 1978 to handle 
modern claims, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has recognized nine tribes out of 
147 petitions. Congress has recognized four on its own. Six tribes are under 
active consideration, with three -- including the Juanenos -- to be considered 
next, agency spokesman Carl Shaw said. Another 83 are in the application 
process, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaining tribal status has been complicated by legalized gambling, which began 
on reservations in 1980, and the surge in "new age" Native American groups. 
Both have increased the number of contenders for tribal status and raise 
questions in some minds about some groups' motives. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tribes assailed the Golden Hill Paugussetts of Bridgeport, Conn., for 
instance, saying the group seeks recognition solely to establish a casino that 
would try to divert New York City gamblers from Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the profit potential is enticing. The Mashantucket Pequot's Foxwoods 
casino in Connecticut reports a net operating profit of more than $20 million a 
month and a 45% to 50% profit margin compared to that of 10% to 15% in Atlantic 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian gaming enterprises began with a bingo hall in Florida and have expanded 
to 68 casinos and 170 high-stakes bingo games in 24 states, with more planned. 
About half the nation's recognized tribes are trying to open gaming halls. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County is home to three such casinos. Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties have one each. In Palm Springs, the Agua Caliente band of Cahuilla 
Indians plans to build a gaming casino downtown to be managed by Caesars World. 
The partnership, announced in November, 1992, calls for a $25-million gambling 
hall to open in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes said he was approached about opening a casino in Orange County if the 
Juanenos are recognized. Suggested reservation sites include military bases 
that are facing closure or land in the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to be recognized," he said. "Beyond that, we cross each bridge as 
we come to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tribes fear the potential of what Indian lobbyist George Waters calls "new age 
charlatans from California" to win recognition from Congress, which can grant 
tribal status without imposing the Bureau of Indian Affair's criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them the post-'Dances With Wolves' Indians," he said, referring to 
the 1990 Kevin Costner movie. "They run around in sweat lodges, thinking Indian 
religion is so cool. Most aren't even Indians. But they hinder the efforts of 
all of those who might be legitimate. The effort to become recognized is, I'm 
afraid, a vicious struggle with too many competitors and a government running 
out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, Indian groups fear that the inclusion of "charlatan" tribes 
could diminish their own role as self-contained, sovereign powers -- for which 
they have fought for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Juanenos hope that recognition comes during the Clinton Administration. 
Such optimism is sobered by the fact that few tribes were recognized during the 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush years. 
</P>
<P>
 Juaneno leader Belardes hopes tribal recognition will come, in part, to bestow 
lasting honor on Lobo. 
</P>
<P>
 If their fight fails? "It will be a continuation of how our people have been 
wronged throughout history," Belardes said. "We've survived and made it on our 
own, without the government's help. So we would continue to exist, to maintain 
our culture and carry on, to teach our traditions to our children, who would 
pass it on to theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In God's eyes -- if not the nation's -- we know we belong."

NEWS ANALYSIS; WILL HUFFINGTON'S PURSE STRINGS TANGLE SENATE RACE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few months ago, campaign handicappers were counting Dianne Feinstein's 
reelection to the U.S. Senate as one of this year's best bets in California. 
</P>
<P>
 After two consecutive statewide campaigns, she has the profile of a centrist 
Democrat that looked to be a close match for the modern California voter. And 
during an active first year in Washington, she pushed her poll numbers into the 
range where incumbents are rarely threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Feinstein headquarters today, the staff is preparing to fight for the 
senator's political life in a race they expect will probably be more expensive 
than any congressional contest in U.S. history. The reason is Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 46, a little-known freshman in Congress who only moved to 
California a few years ago, would ordinarily be regarded as a minor annoyance 
for a powerful veteran such as Feinstein. But the former Texas oilman is a 
multimillionaire who shook the political landscape in 1992 when he spent more 
than $5 million of his own money to unseat a popular GOP veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he seems to have something similar in mind for the entire state. His bank 
account has already scared off some of the Republican Party's rising stars who 
had considered the race. And those remaining in the June 7 GOP primary are 
regarded as such long shots that Huffington has set his sights on a November 
showdown with Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason that Dianne . . . has to worry about reelection is the size 
of Huffington's personal war chest and his avowed willingness to spend it," 
said Democratic campaign consultant Darry Sragow, who managed Feinstein's 1990 
gubernatorial campaign but is not involved in this year's Senate race. "She is 
in a strong position, but were I advising Dianne, I would suggest she not take 
the race lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 California's size and diversity has forced its statewide candidates to become 
television celebrities because it is the only medium that has proved effective 
at reaching millions of voters. And because it costs millions of dollars to 
become a familiar face in living rooms from Eureka to San Diego, California's 
statewide offices have been limited to those who are well-known or those with 
enormous amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein is ranked sixth among the wealthiest elected officers in Washington 
and when she ran for governor in 1990 she spent about $3 million of her own 
money in a losing effort. But she spent none of her own money to win the Senate 
seat two years ago and for once will face an opponent even richer than she is. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll Call, a weekly newspaper in Washington, has estimated her wealth, mostly 
from her husband's investments, at $50 million, and Huffington's at $75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign watchers from both parties are wondering how much of his 
fortune the Republican candidate is willing to risk on this race. With personal 
money and contributions, Huffington has said his minimum campaign budget is 
about $15 million compared to the $10 million Feinstein's staff is planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats speculate that he may be willing to send this race into the 
financial stratosphere by spending $20 million -- more than five times the 
national average for a Senate race. If so, the campaign will wander into 
uncharted territory where conventional rules do not apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said in an interview that his campaign budget might run over $20 
million, but added: "I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats believe that Huffington has spent more than $1 million on television 
commercials and sources say he has pledged at least $2 million to the state 
Republican Party's grass-roots effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will help GOP candidates throughout the state and it has won the 
newcomer a lot of friends. Last week he was endorsed by the state Senate 
Republican caucus, a rare action before a GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Huffington, a respected businessman, has proven that he has what it 
takes to win," Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy said in a statement. "He 
represents the party's best chance to regain this Senate seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington will face two Republicans who have promised to wage active 
campaigns in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate William E. Dannemeyer, 63, is a former seven-term Orange County 
congressman who made his reputation as a champion of conservative causes and an 
outspoken opponent of homosexuals. Now he accuses Huffington of practicing 
liberal politics that threaten the nation's economic and social well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on your short voting record, I have a question for you," Dannemeyer 
wrote to Huffington in a recent letter. "Why don't you re-register as a 
Democrat?" 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's other primary challenger is a 34-year-old Riverside attorney, 
Kate Squires, who is a newcomer to politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republican conservatives who are unhappy with Huffington are quietly 
encouraging Dannemeyer and Squires. But neither has shown the financial 
horsepower needed to wage an effective statewide campaign and even some of 
their supporters say they expect Huffington to be the party's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Both campaigns have indicated that they will focus their efforts on each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's first job is to introduce himself to California voters. So over 
the last month he has broadcast a trilogy of television commercials throughout 
the state. One spot focused on crime, another on his biography as a 
businessman, and a third raised the issue of social values. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has not targeted Feinstein directly in his television commercials 
yet, but in speeches to Republican groups he has outlined his campaign's 
strategy to defeat the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican plans to call attention to Feinstein's vote last year for 
President Clinton's deficit reduction package of tax increases and spending 
cuts and to her Democratic colleague in the Senate, Barbara Boxer. He contends 
the picture will show Feinstein to be a big-spending liberal who has made a 
career out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern about Mrs. Feinstein is her vote on the budget -- that is the 
reason I really got involved in this race," Huffington said in a recent speech 
in Sacramento. "Her rhetoric is moderate, but her actions are liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a line the two California senators used in the closing 
days of their 1992 campaign, Huffington added: "She and Mrs. Boxer, who is not 
known as a moderate, are the Thelma and Louise of the United States Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, 60, has not broadcast any television commercials yet and she has 
not targeted Huffington in her public speeches. But in comments to reporters 
she has clearly framed the contest as one between a proven and dedicated public 
servant and an ambitious opportunist who has little knowledge of California, 
let alone how to solve its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, she has had her eye on this race ever since she was elected in 
November, 1992, to serve the two years remaining in the Senate term left vacant 
by Pete Wilson's election to governor. She has been given credit for helping to 
fund more Border Patrol guards, securing disaster aid for California and 
persuading a cautious Senate to embrace her controversial ban on military-style 
semiautomatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I've demonstrated that I can be effective," Feinstein said in an 
interview Friday. "So I'm asking the people who voted for me two years ago to 
reinforce that vote and elect me for a full six-year term." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign intends to make generous use of the charge that 
Huffington is trying to buy the election and that he is a carpetbagger who only 
moved to California from Texas in 1991. They also contend that Huffington's 
fortune is inherited, not earned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running against a Texan who, in his luggage, brought a lot of money," she 
said in an interview. "He ran for the House, got there, and decided in eight 
months that it wasn't for him, so he's trying for the Senate. I don't think 
that washes in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that California would elect (in Huffington) is a dollar sign," 
she added. "There is not one product of public service." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign says it is happy to debate his inexperience in 
government and use of personal funds. With so many voters unhappy about 
government's performance, Huffington contends that experience in Congress is 
not a campaign asset. And by using his personal funds, Huffington said he will 
not depend on special interests to win election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope she spends $2 million talking about his inexperience," said Ken 
Khachigian, a Huffington campaign adviser. "It shows how out of touch she is to 
think that (the voters') concept of experience is picking up a government check 
every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates are considered moderates within their parties and their 
positions overlap on a number of prominent issues. Except for the vote on 
Clinton's budget package, it is unclear how many issues will distinguish 
Feinstein and Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Both favor abortion rights and have opposed discrimination against 
homosexuals. On crime, both said they favor gun control, the death penalty and 
the new "three strikes" anti-crime law. On immigration, both have called for 
more border guards and a cutback in public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prospect of a political campaign between a pair of multimillionaires, 
the race is certain to stimulate debate about the political power of money. 
</P>
<P>
 After Huffington and other millionaire House candidates ran in 1992, Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) authored a bill that seeks to equalize the 
playing field for candidates with average incomes. It would eliminate the 
$1,000 contribution limit on federal candidates only until they match the 
personal contribution made by a wealthy opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically have given the advantage to rich people who may or may not know 
anything about politics and who have very little ideological commitment but who 
have big bank accounts," said Rohrabacher, who said he will remain neutral in 
the GOP Senate primary. "This applies to both Michael Huffington and Dianne 
Feinstein."

 One Orange County sheriff's deputy was carrying an unauthorized weapon. A 
second used a loaded pistol during a training exercise. The officers pointed 
their guns at each other, in violation of the golden rule of safety that most 
children can recite. And the loaded pistol did not have its safety catch 
engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was the police community's worst nightmare: one officer killed at 
the hands of another. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the surviving officer, Deputy Brian P. Scanlan, was effectively 
cleared this week of criminal wrongdoing, dispelling a cloud that had hovered 
menacingly over the killing, the death of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins will long 
linger in the collective memory of the county's police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a topic of discussion at a lot of briefings, a lot of coffee 
stops and a lot of training sessions," Orange Police Chief John R. Robertson 
said the day after the Orange County Grand Jury rejected the recommendation of 
county prosecutors, and declined to indict Scanlan for involuntary 
manslaughter. "There are a lot of lessons to be learned here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 2 1/2 months that have transpired since the fatal shooting -- the first 
accidental death of a deputy during a training exercise in the 105-year history 
of the Sheriff's Department -- several police agencies around the county have 
re-examined and re-emphasized their policies regarding firearms and field 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the Sheriff's Department itself is considering changing a rule that 
forbids deputies to carry backup weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates said in an interview at week's end that the Scanlan-Robins 
shooting has brought tension to the department -- and emotional upheaval to him 
personally -- that is probably unparalleled in his 33-year career on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not been an easy roller-coaster ride for us here. We get somewhat 
healed, and then something else happens," said Gates, explaining that it has 
been especially difficult to cope with the shooting because he has received 
scant information on the district attorney's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Questions are going to be there for the rest of our lives," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to be shot by a bad guy," the sheriff mused. In that situation, 
"you've given your life trying to accomplish something good, and you're shot in 
the line of that duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good person/good person tragedy. There is no bad guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the first detailed account of the shooting, released by the 
Sheriff's Department on Thursday, Robins and Scanlan -- longtime colleagues and 
buddies outside working hours -- were re-enacting a traffic stop in a Lake 
Forest movie theater parking lot when Robins, mimicking a maneuver he had seen 
on the street, reached for a .25-caliber automatic he had concealed behind the 
sun visor of his car, and pointed it at Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Startled, Scanlan -- who was holding his loaded pistol and was resting his 
right arm on the patrol car's roof -- stepped back reflexively and accidentally 
shot Robins in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 As Scanlan scurried forward to help his wounded colleague, Robins uttered his 
last word: "Hospital." Scanlan rushed him there, but Robins died. 
</P>
<P>
 In most Orange County police departments, officers are allowed to carry second 
or backup weapons. But they must be certified to handle them, have the approval 
of their supervisor to carry them and, generally, keep the weapons on them. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more officers have taken to carrying two weapons in recent years, 
police leaders around the county said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go to a cocktail party and you listen to the people talk about carrying 
guns," said Ronald E. Lowenberg, Huntington Beach's police chief. 
"Unfortunately, I think, instead of moving away from the Old West, we're going 
back to a situation where people feel it's necessary to arm themselves. Maybe 
the police officers just feel it's necessary to carry additional firepower." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Detective Henry Boggs, president of that city's police union, agreed, 
calling a second weapon "mandatory in today's environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But backup weapons are against the rules in the Sheriff's Department, and 
carrying an unauthorized weapon in any department can be cause for serious 
discipline, various chiefs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Gates said he was unsure whether Robins' second weapon was even 
loaded, and whether he was actually carrying the handgun as a backup, or had it 
in the car for some other reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it appears to have cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Scanlan) was just surprised and 'Boom!' I'm sure that (Scanlan) was 
shocked, and I'm sure that led to pulling the trigger," Robertson said. "We 
train our officers to react in a split second. If they don't, it may cost them 
their lives. Unfortunately, in this case, it cost somebody (else) a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Every veteran officer has haunting memories of close calls or tragic 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Placentia Police Chief Manuel Ortega recalled the time he chased a 
thief in a field as a young officer and how he had his gun drawn, finger on the 
trigger, when a teen-ager popped up at close range. He still feels lucky he did 
not shoot reflexively. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters thought back to his days in the Air 
Force in the 1960s when one officer shot and killed another accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
 David L. Snowden, Costa Mesa's police chief, also recalled a time when a man 
under his command had his own gun go off, the bullet lodging in his buttocks. 
"Many of us said, 'There but for the grace of God go I,' " Snowden said. "In 
our business, we have that opportunity more than anybody in any other 
profession. We have that ability to have accidents that injure or kill 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Scanlan-Robins tragedy, he added: "This is probably the worst of the 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 2 1/2 months since the shooting, but every briefing at the 
Sheriff's Department still includes an added reminder to be vigilant in 
firearms safety, Gates said. Other departments also responded to Robins' death 
by re-emphasizing their safety rules and regulations, issuing fresh memos with 
points about firearms highlighted, or calling special briefings in response to 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the mistakes resulted from clear policy violations -- using a loaded 
weapon during training, for one -- departments have not actually made rule 
changes in the aftermath. Rather, it has been a case of relearning basic 
lessons. The hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have so many policies in law enforcement. Usually a policy book is three 
inches thick. It's important sometimes to remind people what is important," 
said Stanley L. Knee, chief of the Garden Grove police force. "Immediately 
after (the shooting), we ensured that our policies mandated safe training, we 
ensured that our people understood the policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Gates: "I'm sure that all the law enforcement agencies in the area have 
pulled out their rules. What are we doing? How are we doing it? Let's make sure 
we're doing it properly." 
</P>
<P>
 While police officers were relieved to learn Thursday that Scanlan was not 
indicted, some were upset to hear that Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi wanted to prosecute him for involuntary manslaughter. District 
attorneys and police are normally on the same side in crime-fighting. So when 
prosecutors investigate officer-involved shootings, tension inevitably results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there has been an instance when an accidental shooting by a 
police officer in Orange County has been prosecuted," said Boggs, the Irvine 
police union president. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garden Grove Sgt. Joe Johnson sees it differently. "The D.A.'s decision 
sends a message, same as we send to our own," he said. "You are responsible for 
your actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the shooting, and again in response to the news that there would be 
no indictment, local black activists called for further investigation into the 
incident, questioning whether race may have been a factor. Robins was black; 
Scanlan is white. 
</P>
<P>
 As the African American groups mourned Robins at vigils and held press 
conferences to criticize the sheriff's handling of the incident, the schism 
between police departments and minority communities appears to grow even wider. 
Not only has the incident led to outrage among civil rights leaders, but their 
response to it has also further alienated the law enforcement community. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest problem is . . . these minority groups and their speculation that 
this was a race-related incident, without any evidence whatsoever," said Robert 
MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They preferred, they hoped, that there was something racial here, so they 
could use it for their own purposes," MacLeod said. "They don't care about 
Darryn Robins; they don't even know him. Yet they stood back and made it harder 
for the Robins family and every Orange County sheriff's deputy, and the Scanlan 
family, by their totally unwarranted insinuations and the allegation that it 
was racial." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod, who heads the 1,300-member union, said the Scanlan-Robins incident 
has been the topic of conversation at every board meeting -- gatherings of two 
or more deputies -- for months. 
</P>
<P>
 In other departments, too, the pain lingers, mingled with the trauma from the 
spate of recent shootings of law enforcement officers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like lately our flags have been flying at half-mast more often than 
not, the black bands have been on badges more often than not," Lowenberg said. 
"It's even more disturbing when an unfortunate accident like this occurs, and 
someone loses their life at the hands of another law enforcement officer."

'TWO-STRIKERS' KNOW THE MARGIN FOR ERROR IS THIN; CRIME: REPEAT OFFENDERS FEEL 
THE PRESSURE OF TOUGH SENTENCING LAW. BUT SOME SAY IT WILL NOT BE A DETERRENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Joe Lopez does not think of himself as a criminal, even though heroin has put 
him behind bars nearly a dozen times. Nor does the gaunt, 48-year-old addict 
think of himself as a violent man, even though armed robbery is his favored 
technique for scoring the next fix. 
</P>
<P>
 "My philosophy is not to hurt anybody," said Lopez, his wavy hair streaked 
with gray, as he waited just after sunrise at a methadone clinic on Los 
Angeles' Eastside. "But my sickness always comes first." 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the tough "three strikes and you're out" sentencing law went into 
effect, Lopez is no longer merely a repeat offender, but one of at least 30,000 
"two-strikers" statewide who face life imprisonment if they commit one more 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, the controversial measure is not a detached debate, one waged over 
politics, ideology or the mechanics of the legal system. They know this is 
about their margin for error, that even a nonviolent crime -- such as receiving 
stolen property or forging a check -- now could mean growing old in the dank 
confines of a prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man," Lopez said, "this is a killer." 
</P>
<P>
 From the housing projects of Watts to the homeless encampments near MacArthur 
Park, the new law has become a hot topic of street-corner debate, with rage and 
fear invariably giving way to fatalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Few habitual offenders, whether gangbangers or crack addicts, believe that the 
threat of a life term will serve as much of a deterrent. But they all feel the 
pressure of suddenly being thrust into the ranks of the unforgiven, aware that 
a criminal past -- even one that has been left behind -- can come back to haunt 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really depressing living with this over your head," said Manuel Johnson, 
25, an ex-Crip who works in the Beverly Hills office of Amer-I-Can Inc., a 
self-esteem course for former gang members. "It's almost like the system is 
saying: 'I dare you. I dare you to mess up again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such consequences, a Compton gang member said the kingpins who run 
his neighborhood simply would employ young followers with clean records to do 
more of their dirty work. A Venice surfer with convictions for cocaine and 
methamphetamine abuse expressed dismay at the prospect of life behind bars. 
Then he casually fired up a joint. And a Downtown panhandler known as Tex 
claimed he was not inclined to violence, but would rather go on a bloody spree 
than waste away behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might as well go out as a Trojan," said the 37-year-old ex-con. "Nobody in 
their right mind wants to sit between four walls and have someone tell them 
what to do and what to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a handful of horrific slayings helped generate support for the 
stringent sentencing guidelines, the large majority of felons affected by the 
law are not serial killers or child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglars, many of them addicts who steal to feed their habits, are responsible 
for more than 70% of repeat offenses, according to the state Department of 
Corrections. Largely because these thieves could be sent away for life, 
officials estimate that it will cost $21 billion just to build enough cells to 
house the additional 109,000 inmates expected by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert (Chano) Morales said he could be one of them, if a paycheck does not 
come soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanning the traffic that zips past Lucy's Drive-In on Pico Boulevard, the 
24-year-old day laborer waits vainly for a chance to trim hedges or bust 
concrete, the only legitimate avenue he has found for a tattooed ex-con. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has no interest in reliving the gangbanging days that twice landed 
him behind bars, first for assault with a deadly weapon, then for armed 
robbery. But he also says he could cross that line again -- if he finds no 
other way to care for his 3-year-old daughter at their decrepit Westlake 
tenement hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to steal food to keep her fed, I'll do it," said Morales, his long 
brown ponytail peeking out of a backward baseball cap. "Whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the measure, signed into law Monday by Gov. Pete Wilson, shed no 
tears for those who choose to break the law. Crime is out of control, they 
argue, precisely because California has coddled its criminals rather than 
removing them from society. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Fisher, whose brother was shot dead in 1987 by an ex-girlfriend who 
stalked him at his Carlsbad apartment, said the cost of constructing more 
prisons pales in comparison with the toll extracted on a victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you from a personal experience what the cost of crime is -- the 
cost is lives," said Fisher, who serves on the board of the Doris Tate Crime 
Victims Bureau, an advocacy group named after the late mother of Sharon Tate, 
the actress killed in 1969 by members of the Charles Manson family. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that get-tough policies have boosted the state's prison population 
by nearly 300% since 1980 while doing little to enhance safety on the streets. 
Moreover, they add, the brunt of such laws likely will fall on Latino and 
African American men, who account for 63% of California inmates -- and whose 
bleak economic prospects are seen by some as the driving force behind many 
criminal deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've left a Darwinian situation in the inner city and should not be 
surprised at the results," said Constance L. Rice, western regional counsel for 
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, each of the first two strikes must be one of 26 violent or 
serious felonies, which include murder, rape, assault with a deadly weapon, 
armed robbery, residential burglary, arson and furnishing drugs to a minor. The 
third strike can be any of the more than 500 felonies on the books in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Had such a law been in place in his teen-age years, Robert Fuiava could be 
doing life, although he doubts that would have deterred him from opening fire 
on gang rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuiava, a 21-year-old Crip with "Samoa" tattooed across his rippled stomach, 
packed his first pistol at an age when most kids start Little League. By 14, he 
had been convicted of seven counts of attempted murder and sentenced to the 
California Youth Authority. Paroled at 20, he was sent back seven months later 
when police raided his Compton home in a drug sting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're out there getting ready to do a drive-by, you're not thinking 
about what's going to happen if you get caught," Fuiava, who will be paroled 
again when he turns 25, said during an interview at the CYA facility in Chino. 
"You're thinking: 'I got to go to the neighborhood, do my shooting and get out 
and go home and drink a 40 ounce.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who go straight say the journey is fraught with pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been six years since Charles (Chopper) Harris was in trouble with the 
law, the same amount of time that the former gangbanger spent locked up for 
armed robbery and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 27, he makes $600 a week working for P W Construction Inc., which is 
remodeling apartments at his old stomping grounds, the Jordan Downs housing 
project in Watts. Dressed in a sleek leather jacket and black corduroy slacks 
at his 102nd Street office, Harris stands out as one of the community's success 
stories, literally helping to rebuild a neighborhood he also helped ravage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harris still worries every day about the unpredictable forces that he says 
can misdirect a man's life, especially in an environment where the illegal road 
to survival sometimes seems to beckon more readily than positive paths. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mission is to obey the laws of a free society," he said. "But down here, 
the abnormal is accepted as normal and the normal is unspoken of -- it's all 
backwards. Just walking down the street, you can get caught by that bad 
influence anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs catch hold of some people and never let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a trash-strewn lot near MacArthur Park, a woman stares vacantly at 
a tiny makeup mirror cupped in the palm of her hand. Her dress is a festive 
burst of brightly colored blue, yellow and orange squares. But at 33, her brown 
eyes are sunken and her cheeks hollow, testament to years of using heroin and 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 She figures she has been convicted at least "a couple dozen" times, mostly for 
robbery and drug possession. But consequences do not matter when the craving 
calls. She will do whatever it takes to get high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you help me out?" the woman asks, hoping for a couple of dollars in 
exchange for sex. "I can help you."

S. AFRICA TROOPS RESTORE CALM TO HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of heavily armed South African army commandos patrolled this 
riot-torn homeland capital on foot and in huge armored vehicles Saturday, 
welcomed for the first time as liberators against a repressive regime that had 
tried to keep blacks from voting in next month's democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Sent to restore order after a popular uprising here, the army's role is likely 
to grow following an unprecedented decision in Pretoria to oust 
Bophuthatswana's despotic leader, Lucas Mangope. South Africa's multi-party 
transitional executive council announced that it will install an interim local 
government until the nominally independent territory is reincorporated into 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha announced that diplomat 
Tjaart van der Walt had been put in charge of running the homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Botha said he and African National Congress official Mac Maharaj visited 
Mangope late Saturday to tell him that he was no longer in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, the government's law and order minister, Hernus Kriel, declared 
52 cities and towns, including Pretoria and Johannesburg, as "unrest areas" for 
an indefinite period to clamp down on rising racial tensions following the 
weeklong crisis and bloodshed in Bophuthatswana. 
</P>
<P>
 The designation gives the police extrajudicial powers to detain people without 
trial, order curfews and disperse crowds. While the emergency powers have been 
used against blacks in the past, many of the towns covered under Kriel's order 
are dominated by the militant white supremacists who had stormed Mmabatho early 
Friday to prop up Mangope's corrupt rule. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 24 people were reported killed Friday, many in nightmarish scenes 
after marauding bands of Afrikaner vigilantes, some wearing balaclavas and 
other masks, terrorized the town by firing wildly from pickups at black 
pedestrians and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The invasion of white racist gunmen finally unified Mangope's mostly black 
security forces, who had shifted loyalties all week. They killed at least three 
neo-Nazis, including two wounded men who were summarily executed at point-blank 
range in front of journalists by a uniformed Bophuthatswana policeman. TV 
cameras captured the horrifying scene for the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of the self-styled white warriors were then forced to retreat by the 
Bophuthatswana and South African defense forces. It was a humiliating defeat 
for the belligerent white leaders who have terrified the country for months 
with threats of armed resistance to wreck the transition to democracy and black 
majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first fallout from the debacle, retired Gen. Constand Viljoen quit the 
leadership of the Afrikaner Volksfront, an uneasy alliance of militant 
white-power groups, opening a major rift in the right wing. He said he would 
instead align himself with the Freedom Front, a hastily created party that he 
said is committed to using nonviolent means to protect white minority rights 
and win a self-ruled Afrikaner state. 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation from the Freedom Front rushed to submit a list of candidates for 
the national election 15 minutes before a deadline expired at midnight Friday, 
ensuring that the party will be listed on the April 26-28 election ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Viljoen had ordered the white extremists into Mmabatho at Mangope's urging. 
The attempted rescue of the tyrant from the anger ofhis own people was meant to 
be a replay of February, 1988, when Viljoen, then head of the South African 
Defense Forces, led his tanks and troops to suppress a coup against Mangope. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with both Bophuthatswana and Viljoen's all-white party finally in the 
election, the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party led by conservative Chief 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi remains the only major party outside the democratic 
process. The IFP registered last week, but without a list of candidates, its 
name will be stricken from the ballots, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials insist the twice-postponed deadline can't be delayed again 
if the 80 million ballots required are to be printed in time by a London-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC President Nelson Mandela said he will visit Bophuthatswana on Monday. He 
blamed Mangope's "selfish views" for the violence that has swept the region, 
one of 10 so-called homelands and territories created under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 With angry black mobs looting the town center and swaggering white gunmen 
careening through residential areas, Mangope finally agreed Friday to allow the 
homeland's more than 2 million residents to take part in the elections. But he 
later apparently reneged in a meeting with Judge Johann Kriegler, who heads the 
Independent Electoral Commission. That prompted Mangope's removal Saturday by 
the transitional executive council in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope and his erstwhile right-wing defenders had few friends in Mmabatho on 
Saturday morning. As they surveyed the damage and did their first shopping in 
days, blacks and whites smiled and waved at the South African soldiers in 
helmets and flak jackets who patrolled the debris-strewn streets and deployed 
outside deserted government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome them, but we think they took a long time to come," said one black 
university student as a convoy of armored personnel carriers rumbled by. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope should be tried in a court, another student complained. "His ruling 
has been terrible," he said angrily. "We could replace him with Idi Amin. 
Anything would be better in his place." 
</P>
<P>
 Several people defended the orgy of looting and vandalism, insisting it was 
directed mostly at shops owned by Mangope's family or cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, race relations always have been good here, a neatly laid town 
of cozy brick homes and grandiose government buildings. But many said the 
arrival of the white extremists, especially the neo-Nazis in the Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement, had suddenly fanned a political crisis into a potential 
racial blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Supin, a black city councilor and former mayor who boasts that he has 
been jailed every year for the last 15 years by Mangope, complained that more 
white vigilantes weren't killed. "We should have never let any of them leave 
alive," he said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, especially whites, are unsure if the racial furies will now subside. 
"I'm looking, today and tomorrow, to see whether to stay or go," said Di Mauro, 
50, a white building contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Riana von Wyk, who watched as workers emptied the remains of her brother's 
vandalized auto parts store, shook her head. "This was the most wonderful 
place," she said. "No problem with blacks. Very calm. Now it's a nightmare."

 Secretary of State Warren Christopher's human rights mission to Beijing fell 
apart Saturday as senior Chinese and U.S. officials let loose a stunning 
torrent of vituperation against each other over China's recent harassment of 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "China will never accept the United States' human rights concept," Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, one of the principal architects of the deadly 1989 crackdown 
at Tian An Men Square, told Christopher during a 40-minute lecture Saturday 
afternoon, according to a Chinese spokesman. "History has already proven that 
it is futile to apply pressure against China." 
</P>
<P>
 Li also bluntly threatened that "the United States will lose its share of the 
big China market" if the Clinton Administration withdraws Beijing's trading 
privileges in the United States because of human rights disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the usually mild-mannered secretary of state was quoted by his 
top aides as having told Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen, after four hours of 
frosty talks that included a noontime meal of scallops and Peking duck, "I wish 
the meeting had been as good as the lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Never in the 23 years since then-National Security Adviser Henry A. Kissinger 
made his groundbreaking trip to Beijing have officials of the United States and 
China engaged in such a bitter and public display of name-calling on a 
high-level visit. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Christopher's aides, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Winston 
Lord, accused Chinese officials of displaying "chutzpah" and an "Alice in 
Wonderland" mentality. And Christopher's spokesman, Mike McCurry, said 
Saturday's meetings were "the chilliest I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the meetings took place, Chinese security forces continued a series of 
actions aimed at harassing both democracy advocates and any foreign 
correspondents who might disseminate the dissidents' messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prominent dissidents were asked to leave town during Christopher's 
weekend visit, which coincides with the annual meeting of the National People's 
Congress. Others found their homes surrounded by Public Security Bureau police. 
</P>
<P>
 Several foreign reporters who tried to visit the dissidents at their homes 
were detained by police for supposed traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two American reporters, Nick Driver of United Press International and Matt 
Forney of Newsweek, were held for six hours in the recreation room of a western 
Beijing apartment complex where they had gone in an attempt to meet with 
dissident labor activist Liu Nianchun. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher telephoned the two reporters at their offices after they were 
released. A correspondent from the Netherlands was also arrested Saturday, 
according to a fellow Dutch reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state came to Beijing to see if the human rights climate was 
improving. An executive order signed by President Clinton requires Christopher 
to make sure there is "overall significant progress" in a number of human 
rights areas before recommending an annual renewal of China's low-tariff trade 
benefits in the United States. The benefits would otherwise expire in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher visit has been marked by some of the tightest security seen in 
the Chinese capital since the democracy movement of 1989. Police security was 
particularly intense in the eastern Beijing diplomatic quarter surrounding the 
U.S. Embassy and the residence of U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two weeks leading up to the Christopher visit and the opening of the 
People's Congress session Thursday, major Chinese cities have been marked by a 
nervousness that reflects growing concern about China's direction after the 
death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
 Deng, 89, is in failing health, and the anticipation of a succession battle 
following his death has spawned several pessimistic reports about China's 
ability to hold together in the post-Deng era. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign analysts said they believe the Chinese regime decided upon a show 
of force before and during Christopher's visit because it believed some 
dissidents, individually or through some underground organization, hoped to use 
the trip for the first serious challenge to the regime since the Tian An Men 
upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the furor between the Chinese and American governments was a 
meeting in Beijing two weeks ago between China's most famous dissident, Wei 
Jingsheng, and Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck. Soon afterward, 
Chinese security forces detained Wei and several other dissidents for short 
periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei, who was released from jail last September after serving 14 1/2 years of a 
15-year prison sentence, is the author of a famous wallposter called "The Fifth 
Modernization: Democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 In it, he criticized Deng for failing to end the dictatorship of the Communist 
Party over political life in China. The reference was a direct slap at Deng's 
vaunted program of four modernizations to improve China. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six months since his release, Wei, 44, had resumed some political 
activity. In one recent interview with two Western reporters, for example, he 
urged the United States to keep up the pressure on China for human rights 
improvements, saying, "If you retreat, you lose." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Saturday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin 
said the Chinese government was "deeply disappointed" by Shattuck's meeting 
with Wei. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Shattuck) took actions which constituted interference in China's internal 
affairs and in disregard of Chinese law," the spokesman said. "The U.S. public 
opinion played up the issue, and U.S. officials made accusations against 
China." 
</P>
<P>
 In his meetings with the Chinese, Christopher strongly defended Shattuck's 
conduct. "He indicated in no uncertain terms that it's basic to the work of 
U.S. diplomats abroad to meet freely with foreign citizens," according to 
McCurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord sought to minimize the impact of Saturday's meetings, cautioning 
reporters that "this is a three-day trip. . . . I don't think we should judge, 
based on two meetings, the overall tenor of the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher met with Li, China's premier, and Qian, who is both vice premier 
and foreign minister, on Saturday. He is scheduled to meet Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin today and then see Qian again Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the disagreements on the first day were so severe and the 
rhetorical blasts from both sides so harsh that, privately, U.S. officials 
acknowledged they have no hope of easing the deep strains between the two 
governments during Christopher's trip. "This was an in-your-face visit," one 
U.S. official observed. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Chinese officials traded barbs and delivered sermons about each 
other's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the U.S. visitors come to China, they should show respect for their 
hosts and abide by Chinese law," Wu said. "There is a Chinese saying: 'Courtesy 
calls for reciprocity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lord countered, "It's extraordinary that anyone could make that statement when 
they've been rounding people up, detaining them, lecturing them, warning them." 
Chinese officials insisted that only three people have been detained, and then 
only "for investigation of their violations of criminal law." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day of meetings, it appeared that one key element of China's 
strategy is to try to separate Christopher and his State Department from 
Clinton and his White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese spokesman repeatedly emphasized what a good meeting Jiang, China's 
president and party leader, had had with Clinton in Seattle last November. And 
he returned several times to the fact that the President had said he wanted a 
China that is strong, stable and prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 The other part of China's approach was to use its 1.2 billion consumers as a 
lure to U.S. business in hopes of intensifying the corporate world's already 
strong pressure on the Clinton Administration to moderate its human rights 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to have worked. Appearing this morning before 200 members of the 
American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, Christopher found himself besieged by 
business executives, who warned him that U.S. policies linking trade benefits 
to human rights reform could cost the United States billions of dollars in lost 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "United States policy puts U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage," 
said Philip Carmichael, an executive with a company that sells scientific 
equipment to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 William Warrick, a senior China executive for AT&T, which has extensive 
investments in China, warned that the withdrawal of "most-favored-nation" 
trading status would result in the Americans being cut out of the world's 
fastest-growing market. 
</P>
<P>
 In his comments to the business group, Christopher tried to downplay the 
extent of U.S. demands on China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our specific conditions are reasonable, narrow and clear," Christopher said. 
"What we seek in China should not be regarded as extraordinary. We are not 
asking for a radical transformation of the Chinese system. We do ask that China 
follow the basic standards of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that 
binds most of the nations of the world today."

U.S., JAPAN END CELLULAR FEUD; CLINTON HAILS PACT; TRADE: THE WHOLE BILATERAL 
BUSINESS PICTURE BRIGHTENS. WHITE HOUSE SEES MOTOROLA ACCORD AS A MODEL FOR 
FUTURE DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five days before a deadline for U.S. retaliation, Japan and the United States 
ended a bitter dispute over access to Japan's cellular telephone market 
Saturday, raising prospects for a resumption of broader talks that could ease 
trade tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement aims to allow Motorola Inc. to compete on an equal basis with 
Japanese companies in providing cellular phone service in the heavily populated 
region stretching from Tokyo to Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials portrayed the agreement as a model for future trade 
pacts because it commits the Japanese government to specific business-related 
targets, one of the central goals of the Clinton Administration's trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big win for everyone," said President Clinton, who called the 
agreement a breakthrough in U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers in the United States will gain because the agreement means more 
demand for cellular telephones and related equipment made in America," Clinton 
said. "Japanese consumers win because they'll have access to better service and 
better technology at better prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Takenori Kanzaki, the Japanese minister of posts and telecommunications, 
expressed hope that "the settlement will translate into maintenance and further 
development of the good economic relationship between the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute centered on a 10-year effort by Motorola to sell cellular 
telephones in the 155-mile corridor from Tokyo to Nagoya. Motorola had 
maintained that such sales had been blocked as a result of foot-dragging by its 
local partner, the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. That company, known as IDO, had 
been assigned the partnership by the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the new agreement, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
said, the White House would lift a threat of trade sanctions against Japanese 
products, which had been announced in February. The deadline for unveiling 
specific retaliatory measures, which could have included sharp tariff increases 
on Japanese goods sold in the United States, was Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the agreement amounted to a "total and unconditional surrender" 
by the Japanese, Kantor replied: "It'd be unfortunate to describe it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that as a result of specific commitments included in the agreement, 
"we think we've reduced . . . all of the stumbling blocks we can imagine" that 
stood in the way of Motorola gaining the right to compete on even turf with 
Japanese companies offering cellular telephones and services. 
</P>
<P>
 While the agreement spells out the number of base stations, relays and radio 
frequencies that will be available to Motorola, it does not guarantee that the 
U.S. company will gain a specific percentage of the Japanese market. But the 
availability of these crucial elements in cellular telephone service, which had 
been blocked in the past, should make the company more competitive with local 
Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Brenner, Motorola executive vice president, said at a Tokyo news 
conference that the new measures will boost the company's capacity from about 
150,000 subscribers to about 450,000. The value of additional sales as a result 
of the deal "will be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement seems to be "an omen of things to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides have said they don't want a trade war; they don't want sanctions. 
The fact that the Japanese were willing to negotiate the deal -- I hope it will 
be good for both countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola officials said the agreement will protect "hundreds" of manufacturing 
and engineering jobs. The company builds its cellular telephones in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the agreement, about 95% of the population in the Tokyo-Nagoya 
corridor will be able to sign up for cellular service by September, 1995, at 
least two years earlier than it would have otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Motorola negotiations, conducted in Tokyo, were independent of broader 
U.S.-Japanese talks covering other trade disputes. The wider talks, agreed to 
last July, are intended to provide greater access for American companies trying 
to sell automobiles and auto parts, insurance, medical equipment and other 
telecommunications gear in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Those talks broke down in February after months of bitter debate. Washington 
has insisted that the two sides determine an acceptable way to measure progress 
in opening the Japanese market, and Tokyo argues that such an approach amounts 
to managing trade in a way that runs counter to free trade principles. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador Walter F. Mondale said Saturday that while the cellular 
telephone dispute was never a formal part of the "framework" trade talks, its 
resolution is "an encouraging example of what can happen when we get rid of the 
sterile debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi is scheduled to visit Washington next 
week to meet with W. Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for 
economic policy, to discuss resuming the stalled trade talks, the Japanese 
Foreign Ministry said Friday.

YELTSIN ENDS OFFICIAL SNUB OF NIXON, AIDES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 In a face-saving finale to an embarrassing diplomatic tiff, Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin on Saturday declared that Moscow would no longer give an 
official cold shoulder to former U.S. President Richard Nixon, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin himself will not receive Nixon because of the recent death of 
Yeltsin's mother-in-law, who was buried Saturday, the aides said. But 
government officials who had been under orders not to see Nixon will now be 
allowed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 A Nixon adviser, Dmitri Simes, said a high-ranking Yeltsin aide had called on 
Nixon on Saturday to say that "President Yeltsin considered the incident of the 
past week to be closed." Simes said the 63-year-old Russian president is now 
urging government officials and members of Parliament to meet with the 
81-year-old American. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yeltsin's conciliatory step stopped far short of an apology, it was 
aimed at smoothing over a public snub of Nixon, who was one of Yeltsin's 
earliest and most loyal supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also have been designed to soothe one of Yeltsin's oldest friends, 
national security adviser Oleg Lobov, who had officially invited Nixon to visit 
and then found himself embroiled in a diplomatic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's office released a statement saying Yeltsin had received messages from 
President Clinton and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, asking the 
Russian president to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon arrived in Moscow last Sunday having made it clear, both to the U.S. and 
Russian governments, that he was on a private fact-finding mission and intended 
to hold meetings with Russian opposition leaders -- including Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky. The neo-fascist leader had been shunned by Clinton and Vice 
President Al Gore on recent visits to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he gave Nixon a green light to meet with anyone he liked and that 
he requested a report on the Russian political scene when Nixon returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting with Yeltsin had originally been scheduled for the beginning of 
Nixon's visit, Simes said. But when Yeltsin's aides switched the meeting to the 
end of Nixon's 10-day visit, Nixon proceeded to meet with opposition leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a violation of protocol in Russia, where one is expected to pay one's 
respects to senior officials before venturing further. Most egregious, Nixon 
met Monday with Yeltsin's archenemy, Alexander V. Rutskoi, who was released 
just two weeks ago from Lefortovo Prison, where he had been held after leading 
last October's armed rebellion against Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Furious, Yeltsin appeared on television Wednesday to say that neither he nor 
any member of his government would receive Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is still a great country, and you cannot just play with it like that," 
Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin promptly canceled his meeting with 
Nixon, and economist Yegor T. Gaidar, head of the Russia's Choice bloc in 
Parliament, began to waffle. 
</P>
<P>
 At a reception Friday sparsely attended by Russian dignitaries, Nixon said he 
remained Yeltsin's friend and offered a toast to Clinton and Yeltsin as 
"partners not just for peace but also for freedom."

SEISMIC EXPERTS CAUGHT BETWEEN PRIVACY, SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The whole point of the conference was to share information about the Loma 
Prieta earthquake. But when someone asked for details about the widely 
suspected structural damage within the host hotel, the subject was taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to say I couldn't talk about it," said Sigmund Freeman, a consulting 
engineer who became intimately familiar with the failures and repairs at the 
Hyatt Regency in Burlingame -- and who was barred from discussing them under 
terms of a legal settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we were in that very building and nobody knew what had really happened 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a frustrating quandary for Freeman and one often faced by engineers who 
know more about a building's problems than the owners or their lawyers want 
them to say. 
</P>
<P>
 A classic conflict between privacy and the public's right to know, the problem 
surfaces every day in routine construction disputes and real estate deals. 
Consulting engineers are often required to keep their findings confidential to 
avoid exposing their clients to lawsuits, bad publicity, loss of rental income 
or pressure to make expensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the perennial issue assumes new urgency after a major earthquake, when 
suppressed information can stymie the scientific inquiries that lead to 
improved seismic safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake-damaged building is really the best lab we have," said Tom 
Tobin, executive director of the California Seismic Safety Commission. "If the 
information is not brought forth, the rest of the community can't learn from it 
and public policy can't be advanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, researchers have raced to document 
its effects before damaged buildings are demolished or repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the time pressure, gaining access to privately owned shopping centers, 
offices and industrial plants has often been a matter of diplomacy dependent on 
the hospitality of landlords. In exchange for entry, some researchers said, 
they have had to promise never to reveal the building's owner or location. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they added, landlords have usually cooperated but are becoming 
increasingly skittish as time passes and they consult lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to get the information," said Helmut Krawinkler, a Stanford 
University engineering professor who is co-authoring a report on the Northridge 
temblor for the Oakland-based Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't work to tell people you're working for the public interest," 
Krawinkler said. "You have to know somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern of damage within modern steel-frame buildings was one of the most 
significant discoveries of the Northridge quake because experts have always 
considered steel relatively invulnerable to quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But engineers say the findings took weeks to emerge, partly because building 
owners were afraid of alarming their tenants and because the cracked girders 
could not be readily detected. More than 20 buildings with the problem have 
been identified so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinpointing the buildings also has been difficult because of the secrecy 
surrounding the problem. A Westside building was reported to have steel 
supporting columns cracked all the way through, and photos of the damage were 
widely circulated among private engineers and researchers. But the identity of 
the 10-story structure has remained secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the need for some organized way to obtain such information, Tobin 
of the Seismic Safety Commission has considered proposing legislation that 
would require engineering studies on buildings to be filed at City Hall, where 
they would become a matter of public record. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea is rife with legal concerns for the property rights and privacy 
of owners, Tobin said. And on a practical level, he added, the specter of 
publicity might prevent landlords from undertaking any seismic safety surveys 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over disclosure of "bad seismic news," as Tobin calls it, was the 
subject of a 1992 commission report that said, "The public has a fundamental 
right to be warned of known seismic hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 But the report also concluded that it would be unfair to force landlords to 
reveal their buildings' flaws -- possibly generating unrest among employees, 
business tenants and residents -- without first resolving which buildings ought 
to be seismically upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been able to figure out a good solution that respects everybody's 
rights," Tobin said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure is such a nettlesome issue that it took the Structural Engineers' 
Assn. of California five years to come up with a tepid guideline: "The 
engineer's duty to disclose is an unsettled area of law." 
</P>
<P>
 The guideline also cites a 1985 opinion by the state attorney general stating 
that an engineer has a professional duty to warn of "imminent risk of serious 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Curry, the San Diego engineer who heads the group's Professional 
Practices Committee, said assessing building safety is an inexact science, and 
opinions of engineers can vary greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is so afraid of their liability. . . . You have to be very sure you 
have imminent risk," Curry said. "There were many buildings that failed in 
Northridge that I wouldn't have guessed about beforehand." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when the danger appears obvious, it can be difficult to ensure that 
repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer David Murphy said he had been so frustrated by the slow pace of 
repairs at an old masonry building in San Francisco that he finally reported 
the problem to city officials. He said he and other engineers had repeatedly 
warned the owners of potentially lethal seismic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, Murphy said, there was no conflict: "Even if you're working for an 
attorney or client trying to get you to uphold a certain level of 
confidentiality, none of that holds water when it comes to public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's recommended repairs on the building had not been completed when the 
Loma Prieta quake struck in October, 1989, crushing five people to death 
beneath 10 feet of brick. 
</P>
<P>
 Sued for fraud and wrongful death, the landlords paid $10 million in 
out-of-court settlements to the families of the victims, an injured survivor, 
and business tenants of the building, according to Joseph M. Breall, an 
attorney for some of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fear of just such a tragedy that prompted one Los Angeles engineer, 
Arnold Bookbinder of Van Nuys, to embark on a 10-year crusade to clarify his 
profession's responsibilities -- with no satisfying resolution to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookbinder wanted to blow the whistle on a four-story condominium complex he 
had inspected and considered seismically unsafe. But he said he was warned by 
the architect's lawyer that it could expose him to litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he had been hired by the attorney as a possible expert witness -- the 
architect was defending a dispute over a leaky roof -- Bookbinder was told his 
report was part of the lawyer's "work product" and had to remain confidential. 
The lawyer fired him before he could be deposed by opposing counsel and warned 
him to keep his mouth shut, said Bookbinder, declining to identify the 
building, the lawyer and others involved. 
</P>
<P>
 With two children in college and a fledgling solo practice, Bookbinder felt he 
could not afford a lawsuit. But he was tortured by his belief that the 
building's supporting columns contained one-third the amount of reinforcing 
steel they needed to withstand a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookbinder turned to Sacramento for guidance and soon found himself in a legal 
morass. He elicited the 1985 "duty to warn" opinion from then-Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp, but quickly discovered it did not address a crucial situation: 
when an engineer is working for an attorney. So he obtained a second opinion, 
this time from the state Legislature's legal staff, which held attorney-client 
privilege sacrosanct. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointed but undaunted, Bookbinder contacted the California Bar Assn. 
Eventually, the State Bar proposed changing the lawyers' confidentiality rule 
to exempt situations presenting a risk of bodily harm. The proposed amendment 
was submitted to the state Supreme Court for approval and was rejected without 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookbinder sent an impassioned letter to the court, urging it to reconsider. 
"Why must citizens of the state of California lose their lives, or receive 
bodily harm when this type of catastrophe can be avoided?" he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In a response dated Jan. 10 -- one week before the Northridge quake -- the 
court again declined to take up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Other engineers said Bookbinder's quandary is an extreme example of a common 
problem pitting their profession's ideals against the realities of the workaday 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 When engineers work as consultants on legal cases, it is standard practice for 
attorneys to discuss their findings with them first and reach a consensus 
before anything is written down, said John G. Shipp, president of the 
Structural Engineers' Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very definitely controlling what gets in the record," said Shipp, a 
vice president at EQE International in Irvine, who often works as an expert 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp said he personally has omitted findings, usually in matters that had no 
effect on public safety. But he recalled one troubling case in which he was 
asked to review a three-story office building damaged in the 1987 Whittier 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner was suing contractors for quake damage. Shipp said the owner's 
lawyer told him to omit some recommended repairs from his report because the 
defendants could not be held liable for that specific damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp said he left the information out, but was successful in privately urging 
the owner to make the additional repairs. He declined to identify the building. 
</P>
<P>
 One lawyer who specializes in construction disputes, Joel Castro of Santa 
Monica, expressed surprise at allegations that attorneys sometimes try to shape 
the reports of consulting engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine a competent, ethical attorney instructing his consultant to 
just drop the ball on a dangerous building condition," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Breall, the San Francisco attorney, said attorneys often try to limit the 
information that goes into the court record so it will not be exploited by an 
adversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar concerns arise outside the courtroom, when seismic surveys are 
required by a lender or insurance company, or when an owner wants to plan for 
future improvements. Once confronted with an engineer's findings, many owners 
are loath to undertake -- or simply cannot afford -- the recommended repairs, 
and they certainly do not want the results disseminated, said structural 
engineer Elwood Smietana, an EQE vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We alone have probably looked at several hundred buildings in California in 
the last decade where we've observed the building could be a collapse hazard 
and it was never fixed," Smietana said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctance to disclose building defects obstructs even federal 
investigators and has surfaced during several celebrated cases unrelated to 
earthquakes, said Peter Wright, director of the Building and Fire Research 
Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 When dozens of panes of glass began sailing down from the windows of the 
60-story John Hancock Tower in Boston in the 1970s, the resulting private 
analyses were sealed under the terms of an out-of-court legal agreement, 
frustrating an NIST inquiry, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In so many of these cases," Wright said, "the records are locked up in 
settlements and will not be available to anybody -- which is a great pity, 
because it impedes the ability of everyone else to learn what went wrong and 
avoid repeating it."

JUDGES, LAWYERS SPURN COSTLY FORTIFIED COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Van Nuys courtrooms converted to high-tech fortresses at a cost of 
$140,000 for trials involving potentially violent defendants or spectators have 
seldom been used for that purpose, partly because judges and lawyers dislike 
the oppressive atmosphere they create. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a steady stream of traffic scofflaws, evicted tenants and compliant 
crooks have argued their cases there -- protected by the best bullet-resistant 
glass and high-security doors that money can buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has dismayed some law enforcement officials, who feel the 
high-security courtrooms are being wasted on low-risk cases. Their concerns 
come at a time when Los Angeles County officials are weighing whether to 
install similar hardware in a new courthouse near Los Angeles Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The fortified courtrooms contain a 9-foot-high, bullet-resistant glass wall 
where a low wooden railing would normally separate spectators from court 
officials, and a small booth, where a potentially violent defendant can be 
isolated yet still observe the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, anyone going from the spectator area to the front of the court must 
be buzzed through doors electronically controlled by a bailiff. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, most judges find the glass barrier so onerous they keep the doors 
propped wide open, rendering the security feature useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that they went to that expense for those courtrooms and then 
don't use them," said Lt. Dave Long, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department's head of security for the Van Nuys, Burbank and Glendale 
courthouses. "Lots of times, judges just don't want to be inconvenienced." 
</P>
<P>
 But Van Nuys judges said they shun the courtrooms only because they were so 
poorly designed that they don't offer the security promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call it a high-security courtroom, but it's especially insecure," said 
Robert Letteau, supervising judge of the Van Nuys Superior Court, referring to 
the cramped quarters at the front of the courtroom that place defendants closer 
to jurors than they normally would be. "I'm sorry the county put the money into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys agree, although for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extremely oppressive atmosphere that can only work to the client's 
detriment," because it suggests a defendant is dangerous, said Norman Koplof, 
head of the Van Nuys public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Well aware of the judges' criticisms, county officials would like to outfit 
the new courthouse near the airport with removable glass panels instead of a 
permanent glass wall between the audience and the litigants. 
</P>
<P>
 The same option was considered and rejected as too costly when the Van Nuys 
courtrooms were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The panels would have 
added as much as $21,000 to the price of each $70,000 courtroom, said the 
architect who designed the Van Nuys Municipal Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question it's a better way to do it, but it's a question of 
cost," said Rob Quist, deputy court administrator for the Administratively 
Unified Courts, which includes Van Nuys and some other formerly independent 
judicial districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The first high-security courtroom in Van Nuys Municipal Court opened in 1989, 
one year after a man attempted to take a prosecutor hostage there and was 
killed in a shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, who have the final say over courtroom assignments, were encouraged to 
use the special room on an as-needed basis in cases involving gangs or other 
hostile parties, especially if threats had been exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the court has been used primarily for traffic matters and other 
low-risk cases. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that there are actually very few high-risk cases, but plenty of 
other pressing matters that need courtroom space, court officials said. The 
shortage of courtrooms has been particularly acute since the San Fernando 
Courthouse was condemned after the Northridge earthquake and more than a dozen 
judges were transferred to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of being assigned to judges hearing criminal matters, the 
high-security court is so unpopular that it was recently assigned to a San 
Fernando commissioner who mainly hears eviction matters, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, judges and attorneys believe they receive enough protection from metal 
detectors placed at the entrance to the courthouse after the 1988 shooting. But 
Sheriff's Lt. Long warned that no courthouse is completely secure and that 
irate spectators in Compton and other parts of the state have leaped over 
wooden railings and beaten court officials with their fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Richard Tinsley, the supervisor in charge of security for the Van Nuys 
Municipal Court, said he has advised judges to use the high-security courtroom 
in at least four potentially violent criminal cases during the past two years. 
Much to his chagrin, the judges turned him down and instead relied on extra 
bailiffs, who had to be pulled off other assignments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, nothing has happened to prove us right about the need to use these 
courtrooms -- so far," Tinsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Michael Luros is one of the magistrates who rejected 
Tinsley's advice and, in a normal courtroom, presided over a monthlong 
preliminary hearing involving three potentially violent gang members earlier 
this year. The defense attorneys in the case also opposed moving to the 
high-security courtroom, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It creates a very, very negative impression. It makes the jury feel like 
they're in jail too, and I believe it frustrates case settlement because the 
defendant also feels like he is already in prison," Luros said. "Most of the 
judges don't like it for the very same reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 But other court officials compared the high-security features to an insurance 
policy that is seldom if ever used, but still valuable to have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it overkill? I don't think so," said Jessica Perrin Silvers, the former 
city attorney taken hostage in the 1988 incident, who is now supervising judge 
of the Van Nuys Municipal Court. "It's obviously much more intimidating than 
the usual courtroom setting. But you never know on any given day if there will 
be threats against witnesses and the need will arise." 
</P>
<P>
 In Van Nuys Superior Court, some bailiffs -- who are responsible for 
courthouse security -- are upset that civil cases are being heard in the 
high-security courtroom when judges from San Fernando are hearing criminal 
matters in less secure courts that lack holding cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a solution," said one bailiff, who asked not to be identified. "Just 
flip-flop the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 The high-security courtroom in Superior Court opened in late 1991 and has been 
used by two judges, both of whom said they found it inconvenient. Judge Michael 
Hoff, who presided over criminal cases there during 1992, said that until he 
had another entrance installed jurors had to go through seven doors to get to 
the jury box. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Bert Glennon, who has been assigned to the court for the past 13 months, 
heard criminal cases there until six months ago, when he began presiding mostly 
over civil cases in the high-security courtroom. He stills hears an occasional 
criminal trial, but finds the glass wall so oppressive that he always props 
open the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep them open and I have since the day I got here," Glennon said. "I've 
just never had the need to fully utilize the courtroom."

NEWS ANALYSIS; RESILIENT WILSON MANEUVERS CAMPAIGN AGENDA TO HIS TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Gov. Pete Wilson, to whom the sounds of praise -- or even grudging respect 
-- have come as seldom as good economic news these last few years, the opening 
of this political season has been a springtime of optimism. His reelection 
campaign, almost universally derided as an impossible quest a few months back, 
has managed to set the agenda for the race just as it is capturing public 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was last week, signing the popular "three strikes and you're out" 
legislation, then jumping onto his campaign plane for a two-day swing around 
the state. Two of his Democratic opponents, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, filled the air with campaign 
advertisements but the state's political insiders said both seemed to be taking 
a temporary back seat to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson has only token opposition for his party's nomination, the 
Democrats have other concerns: Brown, although still the acknowledged 
front-runner and a strong opponent for Wilson, is facing open warfare for her 
party's nomination. Garamendi is laboring under the prospect that his candidacy 
is doomed unless his campaign receives a quick infusion of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Shadowing both is state Sen. Tom Hayden, who entered the race with a splash 
last month. A self-described, go-for-broke reform candidate, Hayden says the 
Democrats have allowed the race to be fought on Wilson's turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has managed to shift the debate away from the economy to crime and I 
attribute this to hard work," said Hayden, no friend of Wilson. "He has managed 
to pull the other Democratic candidates onto his terrain, much to my surprise, 
because Democrats won't get elected if they are fundamentally similar to the 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
 The sense that momentum is shifting has given Republicans, who for months have 
quietly anticipated losing the governor's office, a renewed optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three months ago, I was saying publicly that it was Kathleen Brown's to lose, 
but in my judgment she was fully capable of losing," said Steven A. Merksamer, 
a Sacramento lawyer and prominent Republican activist. "Today, it's Pete 
Wilson's to lose and I doubt he will." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, while acknowledging that Wilson has made a comeback, offer a stern 
reminder that predictions made in March of a campaign year can be sheer folly 
by the time the November general election rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all had our moments in the sun and the campaign has really not been 
fully engaged," said Michael Reese, Brown's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Wilson's success is relative. For most incumbents, polls that show 
challengers leading would be taken as intimations of disaster. But for Wilson, 
who was more than 20 points behind his Democratic challengers in polls taken 
last summer, the current move to within single digits of Brown and Garamendi 
marks something of a surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have eight more months in which to make their case, which this year 
will boil down to a recitation of the ills that have befallen California on the 
Republican's watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Many credit part of Wilson's surge to the Jan. 17 earthquake, which placed the 
governor front and center before the television cameras for days running. "The 
earthquake was a disaster for everyone except the governor," one Republican 
said. Moreover, repercussions of the quake continue to dominate news coverage 
at a time when Wilson's lesser-known challengers are seeking to define 
themselves for voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's entry corralled some of the attention that otherwise might have been 
directed to Brown and Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden plans to run a grass-roots campaign that will hammer on the issue of 
campaign reform and the influence of big money on California politics. But the 
other candidates are running far more conventional campaigns, for which they 
are now fine-tuning their strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has escalated his criticisms of Brown in recent weeks, calling her 
"out of touch" on the hot-button issue of violent crime and questioning her 
commitment to the death penalty, which she says she personally opposes but 
would carry out as governor. His intent, those watching his campaign say, is to 
bait her into engaging in the sort of back-and-forth squabbling that could 
increase Garamendi's stature. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Democrats nervously wish Brown would enter the fray and assuage 
their concerns that she can handle a tough opponent, she has sought to define 
herself on her own terms. "She can afford to stay above the fray," said one 
Democrat who, like most political insiders interviewed for this story, spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown advisers say that she has been angered by Garamendi's recent attacks and 
that they stand ready to respond if necessary. "We are not going to sit there 
and unilaterally disarm," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's campaign manager, Darry Sragow, said that if Brown chooses to 
ignore Garamendi's gibes, she will suffer politically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with not engaging is that Californians favor a tough, strong, 
assertive leader for governor, and by not engaging, she confirms the charges 
that we are leveling -- that she has a coronation complex," Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Garamendi, the problem is how to sustain the assault. At the end of last 
year, Garamendi had $1 million on hand, while Brown had five times as much. 
Sragow openly states that the campaign is "spending money as fast as it comes 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 To mount a serious attack on Brown, Garamendi will have to lend himself huge 
sums of money -- a move that many anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen's lead over Garamendi is pretty soft and if John had the money that 
would obviously change things," said one Democrat who is friendly with both. "I 
just don't know that that's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's strategy is to reintroduce himself to California voters. His image 
has suffered from several years of governing during difficult economic times. 
On his announcement swing last week, he repeated a litany of actions that have 
marked his three decades of public life. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, he focused on the issue of crime, reminding voters that he had 
been in the forefront of efforts to toughen sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are going to be put into a position of having to make a choice between 
Pete Wilson and an alternative -- and neither of those alternatives appears to 
be appealing right now," said Dan Schnur, Wilson's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats privately express nervous admiration for Wilson, whose tenacity 
seems boundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the toughest son of a bitch in politics," one well-regarded Democrat 
said. "From just a technical point of view, the guy was down and out, and most 
people had counted to 10 and were ready to ring the bell on him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidates for governor and their partisans continue to predict 
victory, insisting that all Wilson has done is reclaim voters who should have 
been in his corner all along. When voters have to cast their ballots, they say, 
they will remember the state's hardships under his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no reason to like this guy," one said. "Why would they want to see 
him up on their television screens for another couple of years?"

ON CALIFORNIA: THAT GRINDING SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The court system is a rickety contraption. Underpowered, overburdened and hard 
on the eyes, it clanks and smokes and shudders through the gear shifts, barely 
wobbling along. While politicians can talk tough about crime bills, and social 
theorists can speak grandly of justice, the task of holding the machine 
together falls to workaday judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers -- the 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 They perform this daily miracle mainly with grease, great gobs of it. The 
grease is compromise, and it is applied, most often, outside court, in chambers 
and hallways and quick telephone conversations: 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce the charge to manslaughter and my client will plead guilty.  
</P>
<P>
 Our offer is five years, credit for time served. The judge won't tolerate 
anything less.  
</P>
<P>
 Deal done. Matter closed. Next case. Something like 90% of all criminal cases 
are resolved without a trial, speedy or otherwise. It might not be pretty. It 
might not remind anyone of Oliver Wendell Holmes, or even Perry Mason. But this 
is how the machine has worked -- until this week. This week, in California, a 
wrench was thrown in the gearbox. This week, California got a new "three 
strikes" law. It inspired no shortage of public dialogue about fairness and 
compassion, deterrence and retribution. For the mechanics, however, the change 
was at once more prosaic and immediate: Someone had taken their grease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, in short, dictates sentences of 25 years to life when criminals 
with two prior felony convictions are convicted of a third felony count, 
violent or otherwise. The law was born of public outrage. The idea is to throw 
'em all in jail -- murderers, rapists, carjackers, burglars, anyone who can't 
break the crime habit -- and then lose the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough, but for the people who run the justice machine this is no simple 
matter of revving up a motor. While the public focus last week was on the first 
to fall -- the man accused of robbing someone of 50 cents on L.A.'s Skid Row; 
the Oakland thief allegedly caught with stolen bicycles -- the mechanics were 
more focused on how the law might undermine their ability to negotiate, to keep 
the machine running. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system," said R. Dan Murphy, assistant district attorney for Los Angeles 
County, "functions because most cases don't go to trial. This introduces a 
dynamic new element, and a great deal of uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about the workaday process, "the system," was being rethought, from 
Juvenile Court rules, to bail amounts, to pretrial motions, to appellate 
processes, everything. "Rap sheets," one defense attorney said, "maybe rap 
sheets can't be accepted at face value anymore." His point: A prosecutor who 
says a defendant has prior felonies now will need to prove it, and perhaps even 
to prove that the previous convictions were proper. 
</P>
<P>
 Plea bargaining? There were questions on what, if anything, the prosecutors 
now can bring to the table. There were greater questions about what a good 
defense attorney should accept, and not just on third strike felonies. "The 
universe of settlement," said Jeff Brown, San Francisco's veteran public 
defender, "is now out of balance. Nobody knows what a case is worth anymore." 
Defendants with but three strikes to play with, and who understand the stakes 
of the game, cannot be expected to concede any of them. This means more trials, 
more judges, more juries, more jails, more courthouses, more prosecutors, more 
lawyers. Lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, is not the first collision in California between the justice 
machine and the politics machine. As public fear has boiled over, politicians 
have responded with sweeping reforms. When this happens, the mechanics must 
grab their baling wire and grease, clamber down into their device and make it 
all work. Usually they pull it off, and over time not much changes. Certainly 
not the caseload -- which ought to raise questions about the wisdom of back-end 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know," said one prosecutor, "that the pipeline is never-ending. You 
can keep jailing them all you want, for as long as you want, but unless you 
deal with the problems of society -- poverty, truancy, one-parent families -- 
it won't do much good. You might scare the old guys and put away the hypes, but 
the young ones, the gangbangers, they won't be deterred. They all think they 
are invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 Such wisdom from mechanics is largely unappreciated by the reformers, who move 
in a different direction. More than anything, they seem determined to remove 
from the process all human discretion. First to fall were the parole officers. 
Next, judges saw their sentencing powers clipped. Now, with the "three strikes" 
law, prosecutors lose room to maneuver, to reason, to weigh. The movement is 
toward a justice machine that, more than metaphor, is truly a machine, fully 
automated, no questions asked, justice by the numbers, no mechanics, no grease, 
no tinkering. Now there is a contraption to worry about.

WILY 'WELFARE COYOTES' PESTER PARK TOURISTS; OUTDOORS: ANIMALS IN DEATH VALLEY 
BLOCK TRAFFIC AND NIP VISITORS WHO ARE SLOW IN OFFERING TREATS. FEEDING THE 
WILDLIFE MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE, RANGERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They stop cars on the lonely desert roads here, shaking down tourists for 
potato chips and sandwiches. They brazenly pull at a visitor's pant leg to get 
attention. And sometimes they take a nip at those who are slow to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 They are known as the "welfare coyotes," a pack of rogue animals, supremely 
adaptable and intelligent, who have become a nuisance bordering on a menace 
around campgrounds in the last few months, particularly at Stove Pipe Wells, 
Furnace Creek and Wild Rose Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coyotes have figured out that if they get out in the road and stop 
traffic the tourists will feed them," Death Valley National Monument Ranger 
Kevin Emmerich said. "It's become a really big problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers estimate that there are only a dozen troublemakers among the 1,000 
coyotes that roam the monument's 3,200 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was at Wild Rose recently that one rogue coyote bit a man on the leg, 
although the visitor was not injured seriously. Another man was bitten as he 
was reaching into his car for a sandwich. About half a dozen incidents ranging 
from nipping clothing to biting have been reported to rangers in the last three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes are normally shy and reclusive. But last year a coyote was shot by 
rangers because of its aggressive behavior. The rangers fear that more coyotes 
may have to be killed if they continue to threaten people because they can 
carry diseases such as rabies. For now, park officials are considering milder 
tactics, including tranquilizing and relocating the rogue coyotes to more 
remote areas of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent problems are the result of tourists feeding the coyotes to get 
close-up photos, rangers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't telling us about this -- they know they shouldn't be doing 
this," Emmerich said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "the coyote knows now that approaching people is a way to get food. It has 
lost its fear of man. Even throwing rocks at them doesn't always chase them 
away," Emmerich said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to feed wild animals in a national park or monument, a 
misdemeanor that carries a $50 fine. So far the rangers have not cited any 
visitors for violating the rule. But they are trying to educate tourists about 
the hazards for people as well as for coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it becomes dependent on handouts, the coyote will lose its ability to 
hunt," Ranger Glenn Gossard said. "And as the most common predator in the 
monument, the coyote is very important in controlling the rodent population." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmerich said the welfare coyotes prowl for goodies alone or in packs. Lately, 
a gang of three has been stopping traffic at Stove Pipe Wells to beg for treats 
from visitors' picnic baskets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Wagenknecht, a volunteer who helps the rangers at Stove Pipe Wells, is 
familiar with the four-legged panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be about five of them that are the worst," Wagenknecht said. 
"They stand in the middle of the road in front of cars until the car slows 
down. They know if they can get the car to stop, food usually comes out the 
window." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagenknecht said he has been impressed by the animals' keen intelligence. 
"They've learned to look both ways carefully before they cross the road. How 
long does it take to teach a kid that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The coyotes also seem to know whom to dodge. The park volunteer noted that 
"when they see a ranger in his uniform, they run away," but they will walk 
right up to a man in Bermuda shorts eating a hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting to be dangerous," Wagenknecht said. "These are wild animals that 
don't distinguish that much between a sandwich and a hand."

A CITY TORN; BERKELEY, RENOWNED FOR ITS SOFT HEART, IS DIVIDED BY PROPOSAL TO 
GET TOUGH WITH PUSHY PANHANDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in the cradle of the free-speech movement, tolerance has long been a 
source of great civic pride. No matter the message, no matter the messenger, 
Berkeley has opened its arms, embracing all with the gusto befitting a 
university town. 
</P>
<P>
 But now a nagging urban problem -- pushy panhandlers -- has crept in, and the 
quest for a solution is causing much anguish. Suddenly, a city renowned for big 
hearts, liberal voters and universal acceptance has begun to wonder whether the 
time has come to get tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have clearly reached the brink of their compassion. Fed up with 
intimidating, foul-mouthed beggars who refuse to take no for an answer, they 
are demanding passage of a law that would forbid "aggressive" panhandling, 
prohibit lying or sitting on sidewalks and ban begging near banks and movie 
theaters and after dark. The goal, they say, is not to banish paupers, but to 
restore civility to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally steadfast, however, are those who still preach indulgence. Cracking 
down on beggars, they contend, would place a cruel and unconstitutional muzzle 
on society's most desperate and vulnerable souls. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in this case is the City Council, and, like Berkeley itself, it is 
badly torn: "It won't be easy," Councilwoman Dona Spring said of the decision 
awaiting her and her colleagues April 12. "We don't want to punish panhandlers, 
but we do need to change behavior so our streets are safe and pleasant for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 If Berkeley lowers the boom on beggars, it will blend right in with a distinct 
national pattern. From South Lake Tahoe to Dallas to New York, cities weary of 
offensive street conduct -- and discouraged by the failure of kinder, gentler 
solutions -- are steering a newly punitive course. 
</P>
<P>
 A December study by the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty 
documented this trend. In the last two years, the center measured a sharp rise 
in government actions that reflect "hostility toward . . . needy citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 In Atlanta, city officials gearing up to play host to the 1996 Summer Olympic 
Games passed a nuisance ordinance under which obnoxious panhandlers can be 
jailed for up to six months. Street people in Georgia's capital also risk 
arrest if they loiter in abandoned buildings or enter parking lots where they 
have no cars to claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's beggars may not cause fear in a passerby, urinate in public or 
recline on a sidewalk, and Cincinnati has outlawed "interfering with a 
pedestrian" and removed public benches used by those who troll for change. 
</P>
<P>
 In Reno, it is OK to stand silently with a "Will Work for Food" sign. But 
those who alarm a pedestrian -- or make someone take "evasive action" to avoid 
encountering them -- could be fined or sentenced to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities even require a permit to beg. That nearly happened in Santa Cruz, 
but was ultimately considered too cumbersome to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, under a law that received initial approval by the City Council 
Tuesday, Santa Cruz beggars have been forbidden to use public benches or 
planters to plead for alms, and must not follow, block or invade the personal 
space of their targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach city also will hold its beggars to a strict code of conduct, 
insisting that they be sober, polite and truthful: "We don't want any cursing," 
Councilman Neal Coonerty said, "and we don't want people giving false reasons 
when they ask for money, like, 'My disability check is due tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Coonerty, a bookstore owner, said he championed the proposed ordinance because 
unruly panhandlers were alienating downtown shoppers: "Downtown is our civic 
living room, and people are tired of putting up with intimidation and other 
types of behavior that are ruining their public space." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said he hopes the new law will "send a message that there are 
limits to our tolerance in Santa Cruz." Apparently, someone has sent a message 
back. After the council meeting Tuesday, Coonerty said an angry foe of the new 
law told him, "Bricks are next." The following night, the front window of his 
store was shattered by a brick. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates call the panhandling crackdowns short-sighted reactions 
that, though often politically popular, do little to address the underlying 
causes of poverty. Such actions, they say, are an echo of anti-vagrancy laws 
adopted by cities 30 years ago. Those laws, which essentially penalized people 
for wandering about with no lawful purpose, were invalidated by a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision in 1972. Today's measures are carefully tailored in ways that 
often hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is a resurgence of misguided responses by politicians 
looking for a quick fix," said Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law 
Center. "They are under enormous pressure from the public to do something, and 
the result is a crackdown that may drive people away but does nothing to 
address the causes of this terrible social problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In Berkeley, those clamoring for panhandling restrictions say they are all for 
addressing the social problem. Indeed, the community has been a generous 
provider of homeless assistance. Among other things, there are two shelters, a 
job center and an emergency food project in town, and merchants pioneered a 
novel program allowing residents to buy vouchers that the needy can exchange 
for food and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy, then, is not over homelessness, but street behavior. During 
the past several years, some residents say, Berkeley's downtown has been 
overtaken by a new generation of "entrepreneurial panhandlers" -- many of whom 
live outside the city, have homes and simply find it easier, or more 
profitable, to beg than find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 From the doorstep of his music store on busy Shattuck Avenue, Cary Nasatir can 
point out a half-dozen regulars who have mined his neighborhood for years. One 
lives in Richmond, Nasatir says, and is dropped off by his wife in a Ford 
Escort each morning. Another takes the bus in, arriving promptly at 11 a.m. The 
first panhandler was recently arrested after threatening restaurant customers 
who would not give him change. The second routinely screams curses at those who 
ignore his outstretched hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know these people -- I've talked with them many times -- and they do not 
want jobs, they do not need shelter," Nasatir said. "They are here because they 
can make $70 or $80 a day sitting on the sidewalk. It's a big scam." 
</P>
<P>
 What angers Nasatir and others is not the presence of such people, but the 
effect their behavior has on the downtown's ambience -- and, consequently, on 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are losing good, loyal customers because they are afraid, intimidated or 
just tired of being attacked five times between their car and our store," said 
Barbara Maiss, manager of Lawson's Stationery. "They'd rather go to a nice, 
clean mall with security guards. And who can blame them?" 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, a tobacconist, a fine china store, a computer outlet, a 
florist, a toy store, and a delicatessen have all closed or relocated from the 
Shattuck Avenue area, and new businesses have been reluctant to move in. 
Nasatir said his store, Tupper & Reed, "still sells a lot of sheet music for 
$3.95," but laments that "there aren't many people coming in and plunking down 
$15,000 for a piano anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, merchants have decided, is to adopt standards of conduct that, 
in Nasatir's words, "will make downtown as inhospitable as possible" for 
panhandlers. In some cities, this has been a relatively simple task. But here 
in the home of People's Park, the panhandling proposals have sparked 
demonstrations, candlelight vigils, raucous public hearings -- and even a 
monthlong fast by a follower of the late Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have numerous complaints about the proposed rules. Some call them 
unconstitutional, saying they violate free speech rights and would criminalize 
people for the status of being needy. Others say existing laws targeting 
assault and other crimes give police ample tools to handle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Seitz, a Berkeley resident since 1967, condemned the proposals as an 
overreaction and the product of an irrational climate of fear. "People these 
days are afraid of anything that might possibly offend them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Erica Etelson agreed, and said she finds it outrageous that "the 
alleviation of consumer discomfort" is being used as an excuse to penalize 
"destitute individuals who have no homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an aggressive panhandler comes up to you," Etelson suggests, "why not just 
exercise your constitutional right to say no?" 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of new rules realize their fight will be a bruising one. That, they 
say, is part of life in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accomplishing something like this is very difficult in Berkeley because of 
our reputation for tolerance and political correctness," said Rebecca Rhine, 
director of the Telegraph Merchants Assn. "Nobody wants to stand up publicly 
and tell these aggressive, obstreperous people, 'I've had enough. Go away."' 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, however, many Berkeley residents have that urge, the merchants 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might take a ballot measure to do it," Rhine said, "but I think we will 
see change in Berkeley before too long."

ALGERIA FORCES SEEK FREED ISLAMISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Security forces scouring the mountains of eastern Algeria killed five men and 
arrested 39 Saturday in a manhunt for Muslim gunmen and 900 fellow Islamists 
they freed from a fortress prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Algerian state radio, ending official silence on the breakout, said the forces 
were combing the rugged Aures region where Algerian guerrillas once held out 
against French forces after launching the war that led to independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamists included 280 plucked from Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 The official news agency APS, monitored in Paris, said "a large number of 
armed groups" attacked Tazoult prison near Batna overnight Thursday and 
exchanged heavy fire with prison staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, APS, quoting Liberte daily newspaper, spoke of "a spectacular 
operation by terrorist groups" against the prison near Batna, 217 miles 
southeast of Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
 It said "900 Islamic prisoners, of whom 280 had been condemned to death, 
escaped and four (prison) guards were killed." 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest report, the agency, quoting a Justice Ministry statement, said 
39 assailants and escapees had been arrested and five shot dead by security 
forces.

LEADER OF CALI CARTEL TURNS HIMSELF IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A leader of the world's biggest cocaine-trafficking gang surrendered Saturday 
following months of negotiations between his lawyers and authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The surrender of Cali cartel leader Julio Fabio Urdinola came 100 days after 
authorities killed Pablo Escobar, the boss of the rival Medellin cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government used different strategies in netting the two: a military 
operation against Escobar and talks and offers of leniency for the Cali 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 A broadcast by the Cripton TV news station showed Urdinola pulling up in a 
station wagon to a maximum-security penitentiary in Palmira, 18 miles east of 
Cali, and going inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a penal code enacted late last year, traffickers who surrender, disclose 
their operations and turn their illicit gains over to the state can win 
leniency.

EL SALVADOR POLITICAL RALLY ERUPTS IN VIOLENCE; 1 KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major rally held to honor the Salvadoran government's right-wing 
presidential candidate erupted in violence Saturday after market vendors and 
pro-left youths fought with the candidate's supporters, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 41 people were hurt, according to rescue agencies.A 27-year-old man 
was reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence began as Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the 
ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), pressed through a crowded 
market to a downtown plaza for an end-of-campaign rally. Witnesses said the 
vendors hurled fruit and chairs at Calderon Sol, who was accompanied by 
President Alfredo Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Calderon Sol and Cristiani had passed, the melee escalated. The vendors, 
joined by a number of pro-left youths, and the Arena crowd began hurling rocks, 
throwing fists and finally shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arena blamed the violence on the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN), the former rebels who formed a political party after El 
Salvador's civil war ended, witnesses said the melee appeared spontaneous. 
Nevertheless, it will likely escalate tensions.

NEWS ANALYSIS; IN TROUBLE AT HOME, YELTSIN DOES AS U.S. PRESIDENTS DO; 
DIPLOMACY: THE RUSSIAN FLEXES ATROPHIED SUPERPOWER MUSCLES. HE TRIES 
JUMP-STARTING THE MIDEAST PEACE TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin is stealing a page from the modern U.S. 
President's playbook: When facing domestic calamity, try foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia remains a great power that expects to play a key role in resolving 
international disputes, Yeltsin announced in his Feb. 24 State of the Nation 
speech to Parliament. His popularity sinking along with the dismal Russian 
economy and hard-liners nipping at his heels, the president and his men have 
set out to prove they mean business. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing that Russia intends to flex its atrophied superpower muscles not only 
in the former Yugoslav federation but also in the Middle East, Yeltsin last 
week sent his foreign minister to mediate between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and try to jump-start the peace negotiations stalled by 
the Feb. 25 massacre of at least 30 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin also appointed a special envoy, diplomat Viktor Posuvalyuk, to handle 
Russia's Middle East peacemaking activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The uninvited and unannounced diplomatic overture dismayed Israeli leaders, 
who had earlier told Igor Ivanov, the visiting Russian first deputy foreign 
minister, that Russian involvement was not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he first heard that Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev intended to visit Tel Aviv on Friday from the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why he's coming," Rabin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin received Kozyrev politely but told him that Russian mediation could hurt 
the chances for direct negotiations between Israel and the PLO, Israeli 
diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, who was described as "very annoyed," said he viewed Kozyrev's 
appearance as "a sign of competition between the United States and Russia over 
the negotiations," diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres left Moscow more room to maneuver, 
saying, "We respect very much the role Russia is playing." Peres distinguished 
between pro-Arab Soviet-era diplomacy and the new Russian initiative, which he 
called "really an attempt to contribute so the two parties come together." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddled with $80 billion in foreign debt and once again seeking to delay its 
repayment schedule for 1994, Russia is in no position to reassert its Cold 
War-era influence on the Middle East by dishing out arms and aid to its old 
Arab allies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a public relations boost for Russian diplomacy, however, it certainly 
succeeded. In Tunis, Tunisia, on Friday, Kozyrev stood beside PLO leader Yasser 
Arafat and announced that the PLO was ready to resume negotiations with Israel 
on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher are expected to discuss 
conditions for revival of Israeli-PLO talks at a meeting Monday in the Russian 
port of Vladivostok, including the possibility of stationing foreign observers 
in the occupied territories to comply with Palestinian demands for security 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Preoccupied with the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the ensuing 
domestic upheavals, Moscow effectively dropped out of the Middle East peace 
process after the initial Madrid conference in October, 1991, and has since 
allowed Washington to orchestrate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Posuvalyuk, the new Yeltsin envoy, said Russia once again intends to play a 
significant role in peacemaking in the Middle East and in other conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia occupies its own substantial niche in the Middle East, which no other 
country can claim, due to Russia's historical and spiritual uniqueness," 
Posuvalyuk told the newspaper Sevodnya. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as such new rhetoric about a special Russian role in managing its 
neighbors' affairs has the White House worried, so the Russian press has begun 
to fret about Washington's new cooler tone toward Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cooling Must Not Become Confrontation," ran the headline in Saturday's 
editions of the Red Star newspaper. The paper noted that America is stepping up 
its involvement with the former Soviet republics -- notably Ukraine and 
Georgia, whose presidents visited the United States earlier this month -- in an 
effort to balance Moscow's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Izvestia newspaper wrote that U.S.-Russian relations are in "a most 
serious crisis" following the surge of nationalist and Communist forces in the 
December parliamentary elections and a subsequent harder line from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington cannot but be worried" by the "declaration of the former Soviet 
republics as a zone of Russian 'special interest,' the unwillingness to 
withdraw troops from Latvia and Estonia, and the decisive support for the 
Bosnian Serbs," the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin took his defense of Russia's prestige to an extreme Wednesday by 
furiously declaring he would not receive former U.S. President Richard Nixon 
after Nixon first met with Yeltsin's political archenemies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, in a face-saving move, Yeltsin aides announced that while the 
president himself could not receive Nixon because of the recent death of his 
mother-in-law, whose funeral was held Saturday, the ban on any government 
official meeting Nixon would be rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Yeltsin's new bluster may be merely a bid to improve his poll ratings. 
His popularity plunged after he used tanks to suppress a revolt by Parliament 
leaders in October, and last week for the first time he slipped behind Prime 
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin in one widely watched survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin faces a grim economic outlook, with unemployment rising, living 
standards continuing to slide and his policies under attack in a hostile Duma. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a member of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party, 
Sergei Kalashnikov, told a news conference that some of Russia's new poor could 
not even afford to buy 500 grams of bread a day -- the ration that was given to 
the starving residents of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) during the World War 
II siege of that city. 
</P>
<P>
 And Russia's military, whose support was crucial to Yeltsin's survival in 
October, has launched a lobbying effort, saying it cannot survive proposed 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder that Yeltsin, like many a U.S. President facing a hostile 
Congress and a sagging economy, is angling for a foreign policy triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Yeltsin could succeed abroad -- and still wind up like former Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev or former U.S. President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excessive activity in the international arena -- if it coincides with 
dramatic failures in the economy -- causes irritation rather than understanding 
and support," warned Andrei V. Kortunov of Moscow's U.S.A.-Canada Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success in foreign policy is not an answer."

TOP GENERAL SALUTES GIS IN SOMALIA; AFRICA: SHALIKASHVILI IN FAREWELL TRIP AS 
TROOPS DEPART. SECURITY IS TIGHT IN CAPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As lawlessness in the streets of the Somali capital continued to spiral out of 
control Saturday, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, arrived at Mogadishu's heavily guarded airport for a tense, 22-hour 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 His aim was to congratulate the last of America's departing troops and consult 
with the U.N. commanders the United States is leaving behind. 
</P>
<P>
 But before landing at a seaside airport blanketed by U.S. Marine artillery 
batteries, sniper positions and hundreds of ground troops, Shalikashvili told 
reporters that he is "very concerned" about security in the anarchic nation 
after the last American soldier leaves March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day of abductions, hijackings and a stabbing directed at U.N. personnel 
and their contractors in Mogadishu, U.S. commanders on the ground already were 
taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after he landed, the general was whisked from the tarmac in an armored 
convoy to a fleet of armed helicopters, which took him to the headquarters of 
the Egyptian and Pakistani U.N. peacekeeping contingents located less than a 
mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman spent Saturday night at the airport, one of the last 
high-security compounds left in the city that more than 20,000 U.S. Marines 
secured for the first time Dec. 9, 1992, after two years of civil war. Until 
his scheduled departure at 1 p.m. today, Shalikashvili was to remain either at 
the airport or aboard one of the dozen U.S. warships just offshore, where he 
planned to thank the troops for what he earlier had called "a great victory . . 
. that is celebrated in our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 "The victory is in the thousands of children, men and women -- Somalis -- who 
are alive today," he told reporters, referring to the initial U.S. military 
intervention that saved hundreds of thousands of Somalis from a war-induced 
famine that had claimed 300,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Just outside the airport walls, though, it was clear that the U.S. military 
had met with somewhat less success during the second phase of its objective 
here -- to provide the logistic, military and strategic backbone of a U.N. 
mission to pacify and rebuild the ruined nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city still without a government, power or even the most basic municipal 
services, Somali gunmen Saturday apparently abducted a New Zealander and a 
Kenyan from a truck owned by the United Nations' Australian catering company, a 
U.N. spokesman confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate incident, gunmen hijacked a truck owned by an American logistics 
contractor, the Texas-based Brown & Root. And elsewhere in town, a U.N. officer 
was stabbed on the street near a U.N. residence. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman George Bennet said he would not use the word kidnaping to 
describe the disappearance of the two employees of Morris Catering, which has 
the exclusive contract to feed the more than 20,000 U.N. soldiers and civilians 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The details of this incident are still sketchy and obscure," he said. But he 
confirmed that the Morris employees were taken away at gunpoint just after noon 
and that they have been missing ever since. It was the second serious attack on 
the Australian catering firm. The owner's son, Tyson Morris, was shot to death 
gangland style last October in a dispute over hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistani Brig. Gen. Saulat Abbas, commander of the largest armed contingent 
the United States will leave behind, planned to brief Shalikashvili about the 
escalating lawlessness when they dined together at the Pakistani camp Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concerns were echoed by U.S. Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery, the departing 
commander of the thousands of U.S. forces that served under the United Nations 
since it took command of the mission last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he expressed "guarded optimism" about continuing U.N. efforts to 
bring together Somalia's warring clans and their armed militias into some form 
of government, Montgomery indicated in an interview with The Times last week 
that he, too, expects security to deteriorate rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Montgomery stressed that all U.S. troops who served in Somalia during a 
15-month intervention in which 30 American servicemen have been killed and 175 
injured in attacks by clan militiamen are, in fact, heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never flinched, and they have been the backbone of this operation here," 
Montgomery said of his troops. "No matter how America feels about Somalia or 
the United Nations, they really need to feel good about the professionalism, 
the dedication and the valor of the American servicemen and servicewomen who 
served here. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no Vietnam here, and there has been far more fighting over an 
extended time here than in Desert Shield and Desert Storm. I don't think 
anybody back there (in the United States) thinks these Americans did not 
perform at the best of their ability."

PILOTS OF SHUTTLE 'LAND' WITH LAPTOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shuttle Columbia's pilots practiced landings Saturday, using a laptop 
computer that displayed the approach to the space center runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Commander John Casper and pilot Andrew Allen took turns maneuvering a hand 
controller similar to the shuttle's real one, even though it will be nearly 
another week before they bring the shuttle down. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration wants to see if the landing 
simulator helps pilots maintain their flying skills in orbit. It was introduced 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good procedural review," Casper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casper and Allen plan to practice more landings before attempting the real 
thing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of spacecraft glow -- one of Columbia's primary ground-controlled 
experiments -- encountered more trouble Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 An ultraviolet-light detector malfunctioned and Mission Control had the crew 
zoom in on the instrument with a camera on the end of Columbia's robot arm. 
Researchers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., suspect 
something might be partially blocking the light path. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the same researchers commanded a container on the shuttle to open 
and release nitrogen gas, but nothing emerged. The problem was traced to a 
ground computer and corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists want to better understand the orange glow that surrounds spacecraft 
zooming through gas molecules. The glow can obscure telescope observations.

FIRST LADY ADMITS 'MISSTEPS' IN HANDLING WHITEWATER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton acknowledged Saturday "a lot of missteps" in 
the handling of the Whitewater controversy and, in part, blamed her desire for 
privacy for the matter not being explained earlier and more fully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I made mistakes," she said in an interview with Newsweek magazine, 
discussing the handling of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 She said "this thing has gotten blown so out of proportion" and that she 
regretted not recognizing sooner that journalists would pursue the matter if 
details were not provided. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview with Time magazine, she said: "We made lots of 
mistakes. We never should have made the investment, for one." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the interviews with the magazines, the First Lady, whose role in 
Whitewater has come under increasing scrutiny, has had little public comment on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 She was involved in the Whitewater land deal in the 1970s, both by managing 
her family's financial affairs and as an Arkansas attorney who represented 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which had ties to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 She told Newsweek that "I get my back up every so often" about having to 
answer questions she believes have no connection with her husband's public 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have been pulled kicking and screaming to the conclusion that if you 
choose to run for public office you give up any zone of privacy at all," she 
said.

WHITEWATER RAINS ON DEMOCRATS' PARADE; POLITICS: AT NATIONAL MEETING, THE PARTY 
MOOD DROWNS IN A DELUGE OF DEFENSIVENESS OVER CLINTON INQUIRY. CHAIRMAN POINTS 
FINGER AT 3 GOP SENATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrats who arrived in this city humming "Happy Days Are Here Again" 
departed Saturday fighting the Whitewater blues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of their national committee's three-day spring meeting, they 
found that time and energy they had intended to devote to celebrating the 
successes of the Administration and laying plans for this fall's midterm 
elections had to be spent rebutting accusations stemming from the Whitewater 
controversy and denouncing President Clinton's accusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm led the assault on the 
GOP during Saturday's closing session. He charged that three Republican 
senators who have been criticizing Clinton on Whitewater -- Minority Leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas, Phil Gramm of Texas and Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York -- are 
themselves "experts on ethical misbehavior" whose own conduct should be 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm said questions should be raised about claims that Dole had urged a 
former campaign aide to make a series of campaign contributions that led to the 
aide's conviction on federal tax charges; that Gramm had accepted a vacation 
home at half-price from the head of a failed savings and loan who later asked 
for help with regulators; and that D'Amato, when he was a local party official 
on Long Island, was involved in a scheme to force civic employees to contribute 
to the Nassau County Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of that investigation, D'Amato told a federal grand jury he knew 
nothing about the scheme, but documents discovered later suggested he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm told the Senate Ethics Committee he did not know at the time that he was 
only billed for half of the 1987 construction costs of the home, and he 
received a ruling that he did not violate rules against receiving improper 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven months after the house was built, Gramm contacted S&L regulators on 
behalf of the builder, but he has said he did nothing improper. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dole, Wilhelm cited testimony in a Kansas trial alleging that Dole 
leaned on a political associate to make political contributions that are at the 
center of the former aide's tax fraud trial. 
</P>
<P>
 David C. Owen is accused of improperly taking tax deductions for contributions 
to a 1986 Kansas campaign. A witness at the trial said Owen did not want to 
make the contributions but was pressured by Dole. But the GOP leader is not 
accused of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm ruefully recalled that a few days earlier, bullish reports of 
declining unemployment and soaring economic indicators were "overwhelmed" by 
the announcement of the subpoenas issued to Administration officials by Robert 
B. Fiske Jr., the special counsel investigating the Whitewater real estate 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into conflict-of-interest allegations against both the 
President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton resulting from their 
partnership with an Arkansas businessman who established the Whitewater 
Development Corp. and also owned a financially troubled savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Party leaders spent a good deal of time here proclaiming their confidence in 
the innocence of the Clintons and striving to distinguish Whitewater from 
scandals that have engulfed Republican presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will emerge from this dilemma and it will not be an Irangate and it will 
not be a Watergate," Ohio party Chairman Harry Meshel declared in a welcoming 
speech. "It will be an opportunity for the President to finally get this off 
the table and to return to the domestic and international issues that are 
important to Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 A favorable reference to the embattled First Lady by Vice President Al Gore in 
an address to the meeting produced a standing ovation from the audience, some 
of whom wore lapel stickers saying: "Don't Pillory Hillary." 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, party leaders say they don't see the Whitewater 
controversy damaging their candidates' prospects in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think somebody is going to vote against (Texas Gov. Ann Richards) 
because of some real estate deal that went sour in Arkansas 14 years ago," 
Texas party Chairman Robert Slagle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (Whitewater) is not on the radar screen in California," said state party 
Chairman Bill Press. "Our races will be decided by issues like crime and health 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 But others said they worry that they have a lot to lose if the Whitewater 
matter drags on or serious evidence of misconduct by Clinton or his aides comes 
to light. "The party's fate is tied to Clinton," Don Fowler, an executive 
committee member from South Carolina, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 If they have not yet lost ground to the GOP, some Democrats said they fear 
that the controversy has already cost them the chance to make the gains they 
sought by emphasizing Clinton's legislative victories, including approval of 
his economic plan and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part of Whitewater is that it's distracting the President's 
attention from some of the issues he is trying to push through Congress," 
Slagle said.

FISKE SENDS A MESSAGE: DON'T INTERFERE; PROBE: WHITEWATER SPECIAL COUNSEL IS 
PRAISED FOR QUICKLY TAKING CHARGE OF CASE. LAWYERS SAY IT'S SHAPING UP LIKE A 
TEXTBOOK INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. was not just collecting evidence with his 
surprise subpoenas to the White House and the Rose Law Firm. His primary 
purpose, according to sources familiar with his strategy, was to send a stern 
message to President Clinton's top aides and other key players in the 
Whitewater controversy that he is alert to any attempt to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, a former New York prosecutor appointed in January to conduct an 
independent investigation of the Clinton family's investment in the Ozark real 
estate development and related issues, has already won widespread praise from 
Democrats as well as some Republicans for the speed with which he has taken 
charge of all aspects of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 He has not only issued subpoenas in response to reports of document shredding 
at the Rose Law Firm and questionable White House contacts with regulators, but 
has also muted demands for wide-ranging congressional hearings and achieved a 
promise of full cooperation from the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from Fiske's actions so far, lawyers familiar with the delicate task 
of investigating a White House-related case said that he appears on his way to 
conducting a textbook investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing an excellent job -- thorough and aggressive," said Samuel Dash, 
the Washington lawyer who made a reputation investigating the Watergate scandal 
during the Richard Nixon Administration. "He's wanting to be all business. . . 
. He's casting a wide net." 
</P>
<P>
 While Fiske has declined to discuss his strategy, lawyers both inside and 
outside his inner circle said his decision to interview White House aides and 
Rose Law Firm couriers was an important first step intended to make it clear 
that any efforts to cover up possible crimes will be treated as seriously as 
the crimes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals, prosecutors learned too late that 
crucial evidence had either been destroyed or kept from them. What Fiske is 
trying to prevent, the experts say, is another instance comparable to the 
famous 18-minute gap on Nixon's Watergate tapes or the shredding of documents 
by White House aide Oliver L. North as the Iran-Contra scheme unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants everyone to know that, if they tamper with evidence, he will not 
treat them lightly," said one knowledgeable source who declined to be 
identified. "He must feel that there is some advantage to scaring the people at 
the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Fiske subpoenaed top White House aides to testify before a grand 
jury in Washington about meetings with Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, 
the government official responsible for overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp. 
investigation of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which was owned by 
the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have said they were simply getting a status report on 
the RTC inquiry, but Republicans in Congress contend that the meetings created 
at least an appearance that the White House was trying to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Rock, Fiske called two Rose Law Firm couriers to testify before a 
grand jury after they acknowledged shredding documents that they said belonged 
to Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster. Before he apparently committed 
suicide last summer, Foster was in charge of closing the books on the Clintons' 
Whitewater investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence E. Walsh, the Iran-Contra special prosecutor who spent five years 
trying to sort out efforts by aides to President Ronald Reagan to conceal 
evidence, praised Fiske for his quickness in issuing subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very decisive," said Walsh, who was criticized for taking too long to 
investigate the secret sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of money to 
Nicaraguan rebels. "He's made a decision to issue a subpoena much faster than I 
did. I think that is very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has Fiske's investigation deviated much from a standard technique in 
white-collar criminal cases: interviewing low-level functionaries before taking 
depositions from top players. Therefore, it is widely assumed that he will wait 
until later to talk to Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Several White House aides said they were unaware of any effort by Fiske so far 
to schedule an interview with the President. Clinton's personal lawyer, Donald 
Kendall, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fiske interviews the President, as he has said he will do, it could set 
something of a precedent. Even though Nixon was forced to relinquish tapes of 
his Watergate conversations, he was not interviewed by investigators until 
after he left office. Reagan answered written questions about the Iran-Contra 
affair and let investigators read his personal diaries, but he did not testify 
while in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has not indicated that he would reject a request for an interview from 
Fiske. Last week, the special counsel said the White House had pledged to 
cooperate fully with his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As legal scholars note, the legal issues posed by an interview of Clinton on 
the subject of Whitewater are much different than the issues that faced Nixon 
in Watergate and Reagan in Iran-Contra. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's inquiry, which focuses on the personal finances of Clinton before he 
was elected President, does not involve executive prerogatives or national 
security concerns that prevented prosecutors from questioning Nixon or Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 In most investigations involving a President, there also is the predictable 
tension between the role of the independent investigator and the oversight 
function of Congress. In the Iran-Contra affair, the decision of a special 
congressional investigating committee to grant limited immunity to key figures 
in the case later undermined Walsh's ability to prosecute them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Walsh's final report on the scandal, issued last December, he asserted that 
the public good was served by the Iran-Contra congressional hearings, even 
though it made his task much harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a conflict between the oversight and prosecutorial roles develops . . . 
," he wrote, "the law is clear that it is Congress that must prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Republicans in Congress, most of whom were previously 
critical of Walsh, have cited this quote as proof they should be conducting 
unfettered hearings into the Whitewater controversy. But the Democratic 
majority is resisting any congressional investigation of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Walsh objected to Republicans using his quote to support 
their call for a congressional investigation of the Whitewater dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Iran-Contra -- unlike Whitewater -- involved a direct standoff 
between the President and Congress. Reagan was accused of violating two 
restrictions imposed on him by Congress -- one limiting the sale of arms to 
foreign countries and the other banning aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see nothing in this case that suggests an ongoing confrontation with the 
Congress," Walsh said. "What is it about this case that is so urgent that Fiske 
cannot finish his job before they hold hearings?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dash, on the other hand, praised Fiske for proposing a compromise instead of 
simply opposing congressional hearings. The Whitewater special counsel has 
suggested that Congress can conduct hearings into the White House-Treasury 
Department meetings after he finishes his interviews with the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash noted that Fiske, who was appointed by the executive branch, has no 
constitutional right to request a delay in congressional oversight hearings 
into activities of the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's charter, drafted by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, gives him wide latitude to 
investigate anything remotely relating to the Whitewater matter, and he has 
indicated through his actions so far that he intends to use that authority. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, members of Congress are questioning whether Fiske can conclude 
his investigation within one year, as he has promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are anxious that the fruits of his inquiry be made public before 
the next presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiske is said to be confident that he can finish his investigation, 
prosecute any offenders and issue a final report long before the 1996 election.

TUCSON TAKES INVASION OF AFRICANIZED BEES IN STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordon Waller was the first person in Arizona to be ambushed by Africanized 
honeybees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a retired federal government bee expert and hobbyist beekeeper, Waller 
was fooled by the swarm of honeybees that landed on a creosote bush in front of 
a friend's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't anything spectacular," he said. Innocently enough, he shook the 
branches so the bees would fall into his hive box, and he carried it into the 
back yard so his friend's children could study them. 
</P>
<P>
 The family went on vacation and five weeks after capturing the swarm, Waller 
drove over to see how they were doing. He nonchalantly opened the top of the 
white box. The bees attacked him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never experienced anything quite so intense in my life," Waller said. "I 
knew instantly what they were -- Africanized honeybees -- and I ran for the car 
as fast as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Some followed him inside the vehicle. "If European bees are in a car, they go 
for the window to try to get out. But these kept going after me." 
</P>
<P>
 He was home in minutes, ran indoors and found he had only been stung 10 times. 
Why not hundreds of times, as is typically feared? "The thing about these bees 
is that they're predictably unpredictable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Africanized honeybees arrived here last summer, and Waller was their first 
target. He had no reason to expect them because they arrived months ahead of 
projections. Since then, they have stung half a dozen people, none critically, 
and have killed at least two dogs in the Tucson area. 
</P>
<P>
 And the city seems to be taking it all in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many Africanized bees in town that the state's Department of 
Agriculture has stopped trapping them for identification. Tucson is considered 
"colonized" by the winged Brazilian devils. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tucson Citizen has all but stopped reporting bee incidents. A municipal 
water department employee works full time to remove Africanized bee colonies 
from water meter boxes. And residents in areas where bees have been confirmed 
now shrug them off as just another nuisance in daily life, along with snakes 
and scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm careful but I'm not overly concerned," said Inge Huhn, who lives across 
the street from where a dog was killed while being shampooed. The scent of the 
lather apparently set the bees off. The dog was stung 150 times; its owner was 
stung six times before she got safely indoors.

O.C. GEARING UP NOW TO COPE WITH BEES' ARRIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Telephone hot lines are being set up. Schoolchildren and service club members 
are being talked to. Plants at amusement parks are being pulled and different 
shrubs plunked in their places. All this to prepare for the bees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Africanized honeybees are not expected to begin arriving in Orange County 
until late 1994 or early 1995. Still, local officials say it will take at least 
that long for government agencies to perfect contingency plans and for people 
to learn enough about the bees to calm their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be a big problem at first," said Larry Shaw, a specialist 
with the Orange County Vector Control District, which oversees pest 
eradication. "There will be a lot of fears and concerns about the unknown, then 
people will learn to live with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The bees -- which have been making their way slowly northward from Brazil 
since 1957 -- look almost exactly like the more familiar European honeybees and 
have a sting of about the same intensity. Unlike their European cousins, 
however, the Africanized bees are easily provoked and then tend to attack 
aggressively in swarms. They are commonly called "killer bees," a nickname that 
makes biologists wince because it exaggerates the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for their arrival, county officials nearly two years ago created 
the Orange County Africanized Honeybee Technical Advisory Team -- a group 
composed of representatives of various county agencies who meet monthly to make 
plans and disseminate information. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has come up with several prongs of attack. County officials now make 
regular forays to elementary schools and service club meetings to teach 
children and adults alike about the bees and what precautions to take. A hot 
line is being prepared to handle the expected avalanche of calls once the first 
Africanized honeybee sightings are confirmed. And vector control officials are 
organizing a five-member eradication team to respond to calls from people who 
discover bee swarms in their back yards or outdoor property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department is getting into the act by training its 
personnel in special rescue techniques to be employed in the event of bee 
attacks. Some of the department's trucks are being equipped with special bee 
vales -- netted head coverings -- to protect the firefighters who conduct those 
rescues. 
</P>
<P>
 And Disneyland is preparing for possible encounters with the migrating bees. 
Park officials are maintaining existing contracts with pest controllers to 
eradicate any Africanized bees that decide to settle there and training all 
personnel about the insects. In addition, maintenance crews are replacing some 
bee-friendly plants and flowers, said John McClintock, the park's supervisor of 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we don't want our guests inconvenienced or made uncomfortable," he 
said, "we have done some replanting in areas around food services to put in 
different kinds of vegetation less attractive to bees. We believe that we are 
prepared for any situation that might occur." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Knott's Berry Farm said that park officials there had not yet 
developed a plan to combat potential incursion by the bees. "We're taking our 
natural disasters one at a time," spokesman Bob Ochsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is all this fuss really necessary? 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that most people likely will be little affected by the infestation 
unless they happen to disturb a hive. And even then, they say, the average 
person should be able to outrun the bees quickly enough to get away without 
serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, here are the experts' suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove any debris from your property that provides dark enclosed areas 
likely to attract bees. This would include such things as old tires, trees 
containing large knot-hole cavities, piles of rubble and unused nursery plant 
containers. Screen off likely shelters such as attic openings, vents and small 
openings under the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you find a bee swarm within the structure of your house, contact a local 
pest control company to eradicate it. If the swarm is outside on or near your 
property, call the county vector control department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leave the bees alone. Stay as far away from them as possible and avoid 
making loud noises or strong vibrations such as those associated with power 
yard tools like blowers and lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are attacked by a swarm of Africanized honeybees, run in a fast 
zig-zag pattern away from the direction of attack. Cover your face with your 
shirt or coat and try to make it to a building, car or some other enclosed area 
as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * If stung, try to remove the stingers as soon as possible but only after you 
have reached a safe haven and are no longer in danger of being attacked. Remove 
the stingers by scraping them off sideways with a sharp implement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not panic. Consult a physician immediately or as soon as possible and 
report the stinging incident to local authorities.

A MAJOR TALENT; DODGERS' BONUS BABY DARREN DREIFORT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BET TO 
MAKE THE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's all over now, the contract squabbles, the criticism, the midnight wake-up 
calls to his father from the press.  
</P>
<P>
 Eyes no longer roll in the Dodger clubhouse at the mention of Darren Dreifort, 
and the bullpen has long retired the debate about his demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the conversation is more about whose job Dreifort is going to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does he have a chance to make the team?" Manager Tom Lasorda said. "Yes, he 
has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The kid from Wichita State has a very good chance to make the team, and all 
the other Dodger pitchers know it. Even if they haven't seen Dreifort throw, 
they know. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks like a guy who has such low blood pressure that nothing really 
excites him," Orel Hershiser said. "Dreifort just looks like a reliever, like a 
guy who could absorb a loss the night before and walk through the locker room 
with the same expressions and same mannerisms the next day.  
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't look like one of those hyper, Mitch Williams type of relievers. He 
looks like one of the laid-back kind, like Alejandro Pena, whose nickname was 
Slow, because he did everything slow. We used to say that Pena stands slow. 
Dreifort looks like that kind of guy -- he stands slow." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort seems unfazed by all the commotion about him, and he doesn't 
understand why his pitching is such a big deal, or if it even is. But if 
Dreifort, 21, makes the team, he could be one of the first Dodgers to skip past 
the minor leagues since Sandy Koufax. Chan Ho Park, who is pegged as a starter, 
could be the other. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a question of if Dreifort or Park will make the big club, but when. 
If they are not on 
</P>
<P>
 the team when camp breaks in three weeks, insiders say, look for them to make 
it during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure people are worried about their jobs," Hershiser said. "One guy is 
bumping into the relief group and one is bumping into a group of starters who 
didn't miss a start last year. The relief group lost one guy in Pedro Martinez, 
but it is also a group that is very secure in their positions, at least at the 
top with Todd Worrell, Jim Gott and Roger McDowell. So we are probably talking 
about the other two or three spots in the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers probably will carry 11 pitchers, but even if they carry 10 
Dreifort could be included. The right-hander was a middle reliever in college, 
but when he entered a game he usually closed it, regardless of the number of 
innings remaining. Last season, the other three spots in the bullpen were 
filled by Martinez, Omar Daal, a left-hander, and Ricky Trlicek. This spring 
the Dodgers are again holding a left-handed tryout with six pitchers and are 
also taking a good look at right-handers Rudy Seanez and John DeSilva. But no 
reliever is getting a better look than Dreifort. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the type of pitches that Darren has, as far as an immediate impact 
at the major league level, Darren is probably better suited for a relief role," 
said Fred Claire, executive vice president. "Pitching talent at some point 
defines its role. If you look back at some of the pitchers who came up through 
the Dodger system, Bobby Welch or Orel Hershiser, they pitched in whatever role 
that was there, they just wanted the chance. That's when the arm is so good and 
the ability is so good that you just see where it fits. It doesn't have to be 
determined from Day One." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort has three pitches, a sinking fastball that drops about six inches 
over the plate, a slider and a slow curve he learned about two weeks ago. 
Pitching coach Ron Perranoski says Dreifort's fastball away is virtually 
unhittable. He needs work, but Perranoski doesn't mind, because Dreifort and 
Park rank alongside other promising pitchers he has worked with, including 
Steve Howe and Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the stuff to make it," Perranoski said of Dreifort. "You are going to 
see improvement before the spring is over in the consistency of his control. 
He's a fast learner and I like his confidence. He can intimidate a hitter, and 
when he learns to use both sides of the plate, he will really intimidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very coachable, and I like his makeup and his approach. If something 
bothers him out there, he doesn't mention it, he keeps it inside. . . . He just 
has that poise and that presence, you just see it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was with trepidation that Dreifort walked into the Dodger clubhouse one day 
last September. After months of turning down hundreds of thousands and 
eventually a million dollars from the Dodgers, Dreifort finally signed for a 
bonus of $1.3 million. He was the top college pitcher in the nation and the 
Dodgers selected him first in the 1993 draft, the second player chosen overall. 
But the negotiations were anything but easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort's side was handled by his father, John, who is the interim vice 
president at Wichita State and chairman of the history department. He was 
advised by agent Scott Boras, but everything was kept within the rules to 
secure Darren's NCAA eligibility in case Darren returned to school for his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Dreifort was selected, his father had done his research and was 
told he could expect a signing bonus of about $2 million. Clearly he wanted his 
son signed to a major league contract. But the Dodgers' first offer was 
$600,000, and there would be no big league contract -- only months of posturing 
and eventual standoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger players began to wonder, who is this guy, anyway? How could he turn 
down $1 million? And Dreifort said he wondered, "If I ever sign, how will I be 
accepted?" 
</P>
<P>
 "When I spent that week in L.A. after I signed, I wondered how the guys were 
going to feel about everything, but it turned out fine. Everybody was really 
nice and a lot of guys helped me out. I was glad to sign. I was getting tired 
of it, and it was a lot on my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Kip Gross, who knew Dreifort's coach in the Alaskan league, called 
Dreifort aside and talked with him. "I didn't want him to bury himself early," 
Gross said. "His coach told me he was a great kid, so when he got to L.A. I 
told him just don't try to impress anybody, you are going to impress enough. I 
told him that guys will bury you and it can get in your head, so don't let it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wish somebody would have told that to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there would be another stumbling block.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort developed soreness in his left knee in the Fall Instructional League 
in Arizona, apparently from running. He had surgery on that knee before his 
junior season, but had recovered and pitched during the spring. Frank Jobe, the 
Dodgers' orthopedist, said he went to Wichita and examined Dreifort before the 
draft, and the knee appeared on track.  
</P>
<P>
 The soreness was not major, Jobe said, but the Dodgers made some changes in 
Dreifort's mechanics to ease the pressure on the knee. Then Dreifort turned up 
with a sore elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't run in three months, and then I think my elbow started getting sore 
because they changed my mechanics after pitching the same way for so long," 
Dreifort said. "After that, I stayed there and played catch and stuff, and Dr. 
Jobe looked at everything again and said it would be fine. But I knew about the 
problems the Dodgers had with their previous draft picks, and I wondered how 
people were going to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort left camp earlier than scheduled, returning home with a 
rehabilitation plan for the winter and now, he says he feels fine.  
</P>
<P>
 His first couple of days this spring he was a little hesitant, but he relaxed 
quickly. He was fined in the player's kangaroo court for riding in a golf cart, 
the first player on the docket. And when he offered a defense, he was fined 
again. "The guys wanted to get him a third time, but I think I wouldn't go for 
it," said Tim Wallach, the presiding judge. "Guys are going to try to get him 
because he's a rookie." 
</P>
<P>
 Clubhouse employees are impressed with his politeness. Billy DeLury, the 
team's traveling secretary, says he hopes Dreifort never changes because he is 
so cooperative. Charlie Strasser, the team trainer, says he's the type of guy 
you would want for a son. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the contract squabble going back and forth, we felt like we already 
knew Darren before we met him," Jim Gott said. "It was a debated topic, but we 
weren't going to hold it against him. It's the advice that is around you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he gets here and he's a great kid and he has so much talent. He 
volunteered to come out and help us when we as a bullpen helped a boy who had 
cancer. Darren never hesitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, this competition is great. It makes me better."

JIM MURRAY: FOOTBALL ONCE WAS A SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fable, not by Aesop: 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time there used to be a sport in this country called football and 
it was played between competing elevens of students from the institutions of 
higher learning.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they came out to the practice field direct from the chem lab or the 
library. They not only played for nothing, their parents paid for them just to 
go to school.  
</P>
<P>
 They really played for just a sweater with a block H or Y on it. The letterman 
was the real big man on campus, frequently the student body president and 
sometimes a straight-A student. 
</P>
<P>
 They played for the old blue and gold, alma mater dear. They had school songs 
like "Boola Boola" and cheers from a Greek chorus and classmates came in 
raccoon coats and beanies and waved pompons and the Yale-Harvard game sold out 
and so did the Army-Navy game, even though it was played with real 
undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches were really part of the faculty -- Knute Rockne taught chemistry -- 
who treated football as just another P.E. class.  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say when it changed. But the media got in the act. 
Intercollegiate athletics sold papers and the poets of the press box pulled out 
all the stops. Football players became mythic. They became Galloping Ghosts, 
Four Horsemen, Dream Backfields, Fighting Irish.  
</P>
<P>
 The coaches caught on. Somewhere along the line, one coach figured if he could 
find a way to get just one player out of a coal mine and smuggle him into 
school, he would have an edge. Then, some other coach figured he would top that 
by getting two players out of a coal mine, or a roundhouse, he would go to a 
bowl game. They entered the mix. They told the story of the coach on a trip 
through Minnesota who stopped to get directions from a plowboy, and when the 
young man raised the plow with one hand to point the way, the coach knew he had 
his fullback -- also his conference championship.  
</P>
<P>
 They called guys like this ringers. Pretty soon, the whole first team was 
composed of ringers, then the whole squad. The coach became a staff and you had 
more people teaching football on campus than physics. Students became walk-ons. 
They could pick up the towels.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, they began to figure ways to eliminate the middleman entirely -- the 
college. Coaches housed their players in "athletic dormitories," segregated 
from the university as a whole. They found ways to eliminate annoying entrance 
requirements. The football team had as little to do with the university as the 
sanitation crew. Literacy was no longer an issue. You had guys who not only 
could not read or write when they entered college but, 4 1/2 years later, they 
still couldn't. In the old days, someone with a weak mind and a strong back was 
given a shovel. Here they were given scholarships.  
</P>
<P>
 If their scholarship wasn't at issue, neither was their citizenship. They 
stopped looking for Eagle Scouts. Vultures were better. Football is not for the 
genteel, the role models. Football was for the kind of guys who might go join 
the Foreign Legion. They didn't need their pictures in Sports Illustrated, they 
needed them in the post office. You not only looked on the farms for prospects, 
you looked in the courts. You not only needed people who weren't afraid to hit 
people, you needed people who didn't mind it at all. You didn't need permission 
of the parents, you needed the permission of the parole officer.  
</P>
<P>
 Pro football entered the equation. When the bards of press row invented the 
Galloping Ghost and the Four Horsemen, the professional game was invented. Red 
Grange and the four Notre Damers against a blue-gray October sky sold more 
tickets than Dempsey-Tunney. In a sense, they invented the Green Bay Packers, 
Chicago Bears and, ultimately, the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers. 
Football hit Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Coaches were overjoyed. They had a new selling point. You were no longer 
playing for God, country and Yale. You were playing for the Dallas Cowboys, 
Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins.  
</P>
<P>
 It came a long way from "Boola, Boola," Walter Camp, Hold-that-line! or "Far 
Above Cayuga's Waters." It is such a big business, you expect the Japanese to 
buy it any day now. The players today want to be paid to remove the last 
hypocrisy. It is claimed they bring money for the school, business for the 
community and sponsors for the telecasts. It can't be argued. Game day in, say, 
South Bend, is a fiscal bonanza.  
</P>
<P>
 But they are getting an education free of charge that is worth $100,000 over 
four or five years, to say nothing of future benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 That used to be enough. A football player named Eisenhower became a five-star 
general and President of the United States. A football player named White 
became Supreme Court Justice. A football player named Ford became President.  
</P>
<P>
 Football went from being a sport to being a business. It is a college dropout. 
But you knew it had to come to this the first time you heard a coach say, 
"Winning is the only thing." The rest was foregone. The game had left the halls 
of ivy and become just another mercantile or entertainment conglomerate.

THE $7.8-MILLION MAN -- NOT ; JODY REED, PLAYING WITH BREWERS FOR A GUARANTEED 
$350,000, MIGHT NEVER LIVE DOWN HIS DEPARTURE FROM THE DODGERS 
</P>

<P>
 Stupid? 
</P>
<P>
 Greedy? 
</P>
<P>
 The victim of an agent's staggering miscalculation? 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Reed bristles at each of these characterizations, but he is doomed to 
ridicule, if not regret. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are ripping on me because I'm only going to make a million dollars 
this year," said the former Dodger second baseman, now with the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A million dollars. Since when is that nothing? What's going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on is that Reed rejected a three-year, $7.8-million offer to 
remain with the Dodgers and was without alternatives when he accepted 
employment with the Brewers at a bargain-basement salary. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-year veteran is guaranteed $350,000, the salary of some second- and 
third-year players. 
</P>
<P>
 He might make $1 million, but only if he has enough plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is no guarantee beyond 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a career choice that I have to live with," Reed said. "I'm happy with 
the way things turned out. I don't understand why everyone else is unhappy 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else is incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
 At $7.8 million for three years, Reed would have made $2.6 million in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 At $7.8 million for three years, Reed, 31, wouldn't have had to worry about 
another contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed has earned $4.95 million in the last three years, but he has responded to 
the events of last winter by repositioning -- not firing, he insists -- 
longtime friend and agent J.D. Dowell in other areas of his business affairs. 
He has hired respected Baltimore agent Ron Shapiro to handle future contract 
talks, providing there are any. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the importance of some experience in that field," Reed said, 
suggesting that he might have paid a severe price for Dowell's lack of it, 
although he added: 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't a case of bad advice. I was told all the possibilities and 
probabilities and it was my decision. If there is any blame to be given, it 
should go to me. My guy did his job. I elected to take the path I took." 
</P>
<P>
 The yellow brick road it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Reed's route -- rejecting the security of the Dodgers' offer for the 
uncertainty of a market that ultimately left him in limbo -- seems to represent 
one of the biggest mistakes of the free-agent era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball economics are so distorted that half the time the players don't even 
recognize the value of money, the extent of what they are being offered," said 
one American League general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jody Reed is a fine second baseman, but he isn't Joe Morgan, Ryne Sandberg or 
Robby Thompson. He wasn't coming off the year Thompson was, but that seemed to 
be his yardstick." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, also a free agent after last season, batted .312, hit 19 homers, 
drove in 65 runs and won a Gold Glove in the field. He re-signed with the San 
Francisco Giants for three years at $11.625 million and received a fourth-year 
option for $3.375 million more. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed provided stability for the Dodgers at what had been a revolving-door 
position after the departure of Steve Sax. 
</P>
<P>
 In 132 games, he made only five errors, a Dodger record at the position. He 
batted .276 with 21 doubles. He had two home runs and has never had more than 
five in a season. He had one stolen base and has never had more than seven in a 
season. He drove in 31 runs and has never had more than 60. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played hard and played well," Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice 
president, said in reflection. "We had great appreciation for the job he did, 
and that was reflected in our offer, the $7.8 million for three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed had been acquired in a prearranged deal with the Colorado Rockies, who 
selected him from the Boston Red Sox in the expansion draft, then traded him to 
the Dodgers for hard-throwing but oft-injured pitcher Rudy Seanez. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said his summer in L.A. was "an absolute pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had fun and did my job," he said. "The fans were great, the media was 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that I not only developed a player-manager respect with Tom Lasorda, 
but I enjoyed being around him. I also felt the team made big improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way, shape or form was I thinking it wouldn't work out for the future 
there. Then, bam, it didn't. I was surprised and a little shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 And feeling stupid? 
</P>
<P>
 "People who put money as their top priority will say I was stupid," Reed said. 
"The same people will say I'm lying when I say that money isn't my top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were personal issues I tried to work out with the Dodgers. I had no 
problem with the offer if it wasn't for those issues. I was uncomfortable with 
them, but I don't want to get into what they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say that at one point last season, Reed went to Claire and said that 
many players felt that shortstop Jose Offerman shouldn't be in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that Reed, as the pivot man on double plays, had some concerns 
for his safety on late feeds from Offerman, but how any of that played into 
contract talks, if it did at all, is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 A rationalization for rejecting the Dodgers' offer? 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing of a personal or confidential nature involved," Claire 
said. "There's nothing complicated or complex about it. What we were offering 
and they were asking was never close. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that simple. We weren't in the same ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a fair and precise offer and got right to it. Jody had about a week 
in which he could have taken it. We told him if he exercised his right to file 
for free agency, we would exercise ours and remove the offer because we would 
want to start talking to other players then, in the same way he'd be talking to 
other clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, however, said he wasn't given that warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was protecting my rights and following the rules of the game," he said of 
his filing. "At that point I didn't see any reason to sever ties, but Fred 
called and said the offer was no longer valid. I didn't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, the only thing I don't understand about the year in L.A. was the 
thinking of the one guy (Claire), but he makes the calls and I'm not the first 
to question them. All I know is that I followed the filing rules and suddenly 
became a villain. What did I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers turned their attention to Thompson, but couldn't close that gap 
either, Claire said, and when Thompson re-signed with the Giants, "Jody's agent 
called and said that defined the market. I mean, we didn't stop trying to sign 
Jody until we made the trade (for Delino DeShields), but we were never close." 
</P>
<P>
 The point being, Claire said, that if the Dodgers had wanted to pay Thompson 
prices, they would have paid for Thompson himself, allowing them to keep Pedro 
Martinez, who was traded to the Montreal Expos for DeShields only four days 
after Reed had filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony is that the process left us with one of the best young second 
baseman in baseball, if not the best," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed was left in a cold market, with virtually no offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect to be showered with big offers, but I was surprised by the 
extreme nature of the downward turn," he said of the market. "It was weird, but 
I wasn't alone, and for people to keep singling out Jody Reed is difficult to 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed cited Chris Sabo, Brian Harper, Walt Weiss, Harold Reynolds and Bip 
Roberts as other veteran free agents who had to scramble for comparatively 
low-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, however, was that only Reed went in having rejected a major 
offer from his former club. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it greed, as ESPN proclaimed? 
</P>
<P>
 "What hurts most is that I've tried to live my life as a Christian," Reed 
said. "To be portrayed as greedy by some in the media is the antithesis of a 
Christian, and I feel it may have torn down the good work I've tried to do and 
the example I've tried to set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people see beyond (the characterization). If they can't, I'd like to 
apologize to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed added that he was never worried about permanent unemployment and doesn't 
believe he made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I happy here? Yes," he said. "Is my family happy? Yes. Do I feel I'm where 
the Lord wants me to be? Yes. Will I enjoy playing baseball here? All 
indications are that I will. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a veteran, I feel I can help mold a young club. We may be only a player or 
two away from competing with the best in the division."

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES; THE SOUND-BITE GENERATION; BASKETBALL'S 
FAST-THINKING FANS FAVOR FASTEST SPORT; BASEBALL IS AS GOOD AS EVER, BUT IT 
CAN'T HOLD AUDIENCE 
</P>

<P>
 As baseball resumes this spring and as the basketball season begins to wind 
down, one thing is evident: On the popularity meter, these are sports heading 
in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball is gaining. Baseball, the undisputed national pastime 30 or 40 
years ago, has lost its grip on the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide polls, television ratings and other indicators make the critical 
points: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although pro football is America's most popular spectator game, the public's 
interest in basketball on all other fronts -- college, prep and playground -- 
is either comparable with football's or ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although attendance remains high for major league baseball -- identifying 
the game's loyal but aging fan base -- support for baseball has been declining 
in the country at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * The college basketball championship game has moved ahead of the World Series 
to become the nation's second-biggest annual sports attraction. In the most 
recent television ratings, the NCAA title game's 22.2 was exceeded only by the 
Super Bowl's 45.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1980, the average annual World Series TV rating has tumbled 47% to last 
fall's 17.3. By contrast, the NBA finals were up to a 17.9 average last spring, 
when college basketball's Final Four matchups averaged 17.0. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't be supposed, though, that as a game, baseball has deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 This is still the same superb game it was in the years before television, 
before radio, before telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed is the America that created baseball more than a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it is basketball that is in tune with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is an era of information overload, instant gratification and shortened 
attention spans. This, to use a TV phrase, is the sound-bite era. 
</P>
<P>
 And, contributing to the restive collective consciousness, basketball offers 
the quickness of movement and the repetitive, almost continuous, scoring that 
so strongly appeal to the sound-bite generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, once the obvious leader, is losing ground not because of its 
defects, real or imagined, but because 1990s Americans want something livelier, 
more modern, more pertinent. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a country always in evolution, and its history, in large part, is a 
history of a quickening of pace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the slow, hard days before electric lights and indoor plumbing, the symbol 
of early America was the horse. Nothing moved faster than a horse could run. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace picked up with the coming of electric, steam and oil power to a more 
active generation, and the symbol of that somewhat hastier time was a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 In those years, nothing moved faster than a ball could be hit with a bat, and 
baseball suitably became the national pastime. But that era, too, was doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 With fiber optics and computer science and dunked basketballs, the pace has 
quickened again, and the symbol of this new age is the sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Time appears to be instantaneous on living-color television. The evening news 
can acquaint the entire country with the latest war reports, or more often the 
latest scandals, in bites of eight or 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 And in doing so, TV people have found that that's all that Americans want to 
hear about anything, anyway, unless an ice skater has been assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Clinton recently said, "It's hard to get more than one message a 
day across to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 If in such a country basketball is a better fit than baseball, the fit wasn't 
planned, it simply happened, evolving out of the nature of basketball -- which 
not too long ago was a slow-moving sport with final scores of 28-27 and 32-30. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a 104-102 sport because, for one thing, most of the nation's 
finest athletes are now in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have gone for pro basketball if I were taller," Kansas City Chief 
quarterback Joe Montana said, expressing a view often made by professionals in 
all sports. "Basketball was my favorite game in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Many non-professionals, who play neighborhood and playground basketball all 
over America, agree with the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball has such deep roots," former coach Red Auerbach once said. "It's a 
team game that two people can play. In fact, it's a team game that one guy can 
play by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 As a spectator sport, it also differs considerably from the others. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical winter night, in an interval of three or four seconds, you can 
watch the athletic seven-footers of the NBA make -- in one play -- a sequence 
of six or seven seemingly impossible moves, followed by somebody's sudden shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot drops in more often than not, starting a race to the other end of the 
court and, perhaps, a dunk, followed by another race and another basket and 
another race in a long, exciting melange of sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no home run trots, no balks, no huddles. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is the constant commotion that holds the attention of today's shouting 
sports fans, who have to think fast to keep up with it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Their thoughts wandered last fall when a baseball player, Lenny Dykstra, in 
one of the big events of the sports year, took five consecutive pitches in a 
typically slow-moving playoff game -- never moving his bat from his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Most end-of-the-century Americans don't have the time or patience to sit 
through the baseball playoffs. And so that night they missed one of the great 
athletic moments of our time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that can speed up baseball is the 11 o'clock news. Between 
commercials, an entire World Series game can be staged in one sound bite 
without missing a significant pitch or base hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But that, of course, isn't the game that baseball fans love. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs, they insist, is a sport without flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 As aspiring baseball player Michael Jordan said last year when he was still 
playing basketball: "I don't think baseball has done anything wrong. I think a 
new generation grew up with the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Still very much in place are all the aspects of baseball that made it the 
national pastime early in the 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 As presented on warm summer evenings -- or even on cold nights in California 
-- baseball is still a pastoral game of precision, pageantry and a pleasing 
simplicity that masks often picturesque complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 As a television program, though, it doesn't adapt as well as basketball does 
or as football can with its avalanche of violent plays and instant replays. 
</P>
<P>
 So the best way to see a baseball game is to sit quietly in the stands, using 
binoculars now and then to focus on the batter, the pitcher, or the managers -- 
who can always be outguessed -- or on such details as the changing alignments 
of the defensive teams. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost every pitch, one or more infielders will shift left or right, move 
in or out, and one or more outfielders will move a step or two or more. 
</P>
<P>
 If the score is close, every pitch begins a new ballgame, and any pitch can be 
decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 What doesn't happen can be as interesting as what does in baseball, which its 
fans call a game of expectations. And it all moves with such deliberate speed 
that every spectator has an opportunity to live in the minds of the principals 
-- the players and their managers -- and to think along with them pitch to 
pitch, out to out, inning to inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most clubs, the object is to get a runner to second base," Oakland 
Athletic Manager Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he's there, can the hitter get him home? 
</P>
<P>
 Can he do it if he falls behind, 0 and 2? 
</P>
<P>
 Can he do it if he works the count to 3 and 1? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a team game, but it's a team game only nominally. The essence of baseball 
is pitcher vs. hitter: the mind games of man vs. man. 
</P>
<P>
 No other sport except boxing is so conspicuously man to man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra personified the timeless nature of the sport last October when a 
National League playoff game was poking along as usual. Tenth inning, score 
even, 3-3, series even, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to bat for the Philadelphia Phillies -- slowly -- Dykstra finally 
stepped in and took a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Then another ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took Strike 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ball 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Five pitches -- and Dykstra's bat was still on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Was anything happening? 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any drama when a good hitter simply stands there looking at the 
pitches? 
</P>
<P>
 It all depends. 
</P>
<P>
 It depends on whether the viewer realizes -- or cares -- that in that spot, 
Dykstra, a singles hitter normally, is working the count for his home run pitch 
-- an inside fastball up in the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he would have fouled off three or four if he'd had to," said Steve 
Moyer of Chicago's Stats, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the sixth pitch was Dykstra's. And since the home run he hit that 
time had been planned and deliberately executed, it could be recognized 
immediately for what it was -- one of the most difficult feats in all of team 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the turning point in a series that ended the season for the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who had the time to wait for it, that was a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few things more clearly define the difference between baseball and basketball 
than what happens after the final play: 
</P>
<P>
 * When the game is over and the crowd leaves the arena, basketball fans find 
it hard to remember what went on, precisely. They know who won, but the rest is 
often a blur. 
</P>
<P>
 * By contrast, baseball fans, on their way home, or when they get there, can 
reconstruct the whole game in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 A mental exercise of that sort is a distinct plus to baseball fans, as well as 
to football fans and golfers, who frequently replay their games too. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's all irrelevant to basketball fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most recent game is a jot in history. Who wants to give it another 
thought? After the last dunk every night, basketball fans are instantly ready 
for another show. 
</P>
<P>
 The polls show that many baseball fans are over 50. Basketball fans tend to be 
much younger -- and it could be that their world was shaped by, of all things, 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound-bite era began, some believe, with television's modern commercial 
messages, whose producers wished to cram a lot of information into a few 
seconds. Thus they started cutting quickly from this to that, and learned, in 
the process, that the optimum way to sell a complex message is with quick 
bites. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those viewing the earliest action commercials were the producers of TV 
news shows and movies, some of whom soon made movies that way, too, telling 
their simple stories with sequences of quick visual images. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what killed old movies: Not just the sex and violence and color, 
but also the modern pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Video games and MTV are likewise filled with rapidly changing images, and 
hence are more likely to appeal to younger sports crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 And, quite possibly, such activities have made basketball fans mentally more 
alert than the Americans of 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They simply think faster -- or at least process visual information faster -- 
than Grandpa used to. 
</P>
<P>
 It ought not to come as a surprise, in any event, that today's sports fans, 
nourished on the action of the new commercials, new movies, new video games, 
MTV and the like, and hammered by the continuous sound bites of television's 
news shows, should feel right at home at a basketball game.  
</P>
<P>
 And out of place in a ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of settling down and getting more deeply involved in something that 
is just a game is foreign to the sound-bite generation. 
</P>
<P>
 But not to baseball fans, who, in a relaxed ballpark setting, still enjoy 
matching wits with a manager who can't decide whether to change pitchers now or 
five minutes from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the swiftness of the game makes basketball more congenial than 
baseball to the modern mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't make it better. 
</P>
<P>
 The rarest individual in the sports world today is the major leaguer who can 
get three hits in 10 at-bats. Who in the NBA can't dunk a basketball? How They 
Rate 
</P>
<P>
 Using television ratings from championship games as a barometer of fan 
interest, a look at television ratings at five-year intervals over the last 20 
years. The four events listed are either series-deciding games -- in the World 
Series and NBA finals -- or the college basketball championship game and Super 
Bowl. 06,17,06,06,06,06,06 Event 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 World Series 33.7 
35.9 21.0 27.0 19.1 NCAA basketball 20.5 19.9 22.3 18.8 22.2 NBA finals 14.3 
15.4 14.9 21.2 20.3 Super Bowl 41.6 47.1 46.4 43.5 45.5  
</P>
<P>
 Note: Series averages are a little lower each year for the World Series and 
NBA finals. Baseball's 1983 number is abnormally low because it was a day game. 
Major league pragmatists concluded afterward that 21.0 is too high a price to 
pay for the afternoon starting times that satisfy purists and children. All 
World Series games are now played at night.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS FAN CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF 'NIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins doesn't watch the Atlanta Hawks any more -- not on pay TV, 
not on free TV, not on any TV. For the better part of 11 years, Dominique 
Wilkins was the Atlanta Hawk. 'Nique was unique. He was as much a part of Ted 
Turner's life as Jane Fonda was, and one thing you have to say for Turner, the 
man surrounds himself with people who keep in great shape. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the trade. The one that changed Dominique's address and his 
life. The one 'Nique didn't even know about until he came home to his wife, 
Nicole, and discovered that team officials had just dropped by their house 
looking for him, in order to break the news. After years and years of shooting 
the lights out in Georgia, he was being told to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 He was going to L.A., city of angels, land of earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mmm-hmmm, that was the first thing I thought of," Dominique said, sitting 
inside an arena in Los Angeles that actually had to be closed for a while after 
the January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked, "And are you still thinking about quakes?" 
</P>
<P>
 And with a sheepish smile, Dominique said, "Oh, you better believe it. Every 
time I cross a bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, welcome to L.A., anyway, 'Nique. Hope you settle down and hope you stick 
around. Because this city can use every class act it can get. I, for one, feel 
just fine about Dominique Wilkins being our town's compensation for the loss of 
the sulky Danny Manning, and I trust that Clipper executives are sincere in 
their pledge that Dominique will be here for the remainder of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there might be more overpasses than actual bridges here in 'Nique's 
new community, we need to give the man plenty of time and room to make the 
necessary adjustments. After all, the cross-country voyage that turned him into 
a Clipper was the most disconcerting trip of Dominique's life. It transported 
him to the city of the 1984 Summer Olympics, held when his NBA career was in 
its infancy, from the city of the 1996 Summer Olympics, where this career could 
very well end. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique is a member of "Dream Team II." He will be right there in Atlanta to 
put the finishing touches (including finger rolls and dunks) on his life in 
basketball, and won't that be a party for the folks back home? 
</P>
<P>
 His first return engagement will be a week from Friday, when he and the 
Clippers will visit the Omni. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever watch the Hawks on TV anymore?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope," 'Nique said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By circumstance or by choice?" 
</P>
<P>
 "By choice," he said. "I don't really want to know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Not from hard feelings, exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique shook his head and said, "They made a choice. They felt this (the 
trade) was something they had to do for the team. I don't agree with it, but 
that was their decision. So now I'm here and I'll take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 What people have to understand is, Dominique Wilkins is Dale Murphy. It took 
me a few weeks to realize this. 'Nique did for Atlanta basketball exactly what 
Murph did for Atlanta baseball. He carried the team during the lean years. Same 
as Murphy. He represented it at public functions, in promotions and in 
advertisements. Same as Murphy. He suffered through down season after down 
season. Same as Murphy. And then, when the team finally improved enough to 
challenge for a championship, the first person traded was him . Same as Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 What a shame. Particularly in the case of Wilkins, who spent his collegiate 
years at Georgia and was so popular back home that the Hawks couldn't stand the 
thought of him playing for Utah, which drafted him in 1982, and promptly gave 
up two players and cash to bring him back before 'Nique could hit a single note 
for the Jazz. Back then, people from Atlanta couldn't imagine him playing 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Dominique Wilkins was born in Paris, France, but it was in Atlanta 
that 'Nique became magnifique. 
</P>
<P>
 The man can fly. He is 34, but his legs remain young. The ruptured right 
Achilles' tendon is, forgive me, behind him, and as for his game, well, to 
quote one former NBA star, Rick Barry, "Night in, night out, nobody plays 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The man can score. He already is averaging more than 30 points per game for 
the Clippers. He has led them in scoring in six of his first seven games. He is 
still a lean, clean scoring machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the man rebound? Well, no one has ever confused him with Dennis Rodman. 
(In shooting touch or in hairstyles.) Wilt Chamberlain once observed that even 
the lead-footed Larry Bird had a far better rebounding average than Wilkins. 
"Why?" Wilt asked rhetorically. "One of them always thinks his jumping ability 
is enough. The other knows he has to do something else to get that ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Dominique can dominate. He can fill up a basket faster than 
anybody since Red Riding Hood. He has the hangtime of Elgin and the wingspan of 
Dr. J and has moves even Earl the Pearl must envy. The man can do everything 
with a basketball except slide it under a door. And he has accepted this 
virtual betrayal by the Hawks as well as anyone in his position could have been 
expected to handle it, so the least we can do is make him feel at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's made it feel like home, so far," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, you'll stay?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins gave a shrug and another sheepish smile and said, "Who 
knows? I never thought I'd leave the last place."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NATIONAL ROUNDUP; SATURDAY OF UPSETS COMPLICATES NINE 
LIVES IN KANSAS CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 39th and 40th floors atop the Hyatt Regency in Kansas City, Mo., are 
cordoned off from the curious so that nine men can concentrate on a job that 
just got more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 They began meeting Thursday to set the 64-team field for the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, it's Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt cramped for time," said Tom Jernstedt, longtime tournament director. 
"We just figured we'd better get going about a half-day earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 They needn't have bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 Even choosing the top-seeded teams in the four regions, usually not all that 
difficult, got tougher when the nation's top three teams, four of the top five, 
six of the top eight and seven of the top 11 lost Saturday in conference 
tournaments or the end of regular-season play. 
</P>
<P>
 March Madness started a week early. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure seems to me this is going to be the hardest year ever to pick the 
64," said Bob Frederick, Kansas athletic director and tournament selection 
committee chairman next season, when Duke's Tom Butters leaves the job. 
</P>
<P>
 All Frederick needed to do was to call across town, where his No. 11 Jayhawks 
were beaten by No. 23 Oklahoma State, 69-68, in the Big Eight semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Or he could talk with Butters, whose No. 5 Duke team lost to Virginia, 66-61, 
in the Atlantic Coast Conference semifinals at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, the top and bottom of the bracket are not nearly as tough to call as 
the middle of the bracket, and there will be a bigger middle, if you will," 
Frederick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you pick the top, but consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Southeast Region, which seemed to be locked up with No. 1 Arkansas as 
the top-seeded team. But if the Razorbacks get a No. 1 when the pairings are 
announced today, it will be after losing to Kentucky, 90-78, in the 
Southeastern Conference semifinals Saturday at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 So what, Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson said. "After the first-round game, I 
thought that was enough to secure a spot. We won 25 games, we won our 
conference, we won our division. We were on a 13-game winning steak." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The East Region, which seemed to be No. 2 Connecticut's own, but if the 
Huskies are seeded No. 1, it will be after a 69-67 loss to Providence in the 
Big East semifinals at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Midwest Region, which probably would have been topped by No. 3 Missouri 
on Thursday, but who knew on Saturday, because the Tigers, who were the first 
undefeated team in Big Eight play since 1971, lost to Nebraska, 98-91, in the 
tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The West Region, with perhaps either No. 4 North Carolina or No. 5 Duke 
coming across country to be seeded No. 1, depending on which won the ACC 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina apparently didn't get a memo about the responsibilities of the 
highly ranked and beat Wake Forest, 86-84, in overtime. Duke adhered to 
national form. 
</P>
<P>
 Should North Carolina be given No. 1 in the East -- to the consternation of 
folks from Connecticut -- or should the Tar Heels lose to Virginia in the ACC 
final today, the door could have been open for No. 7 Arizona, but the Wildcats 
lost, 94-87, to Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, Duke is done as a No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our thought process can be disrupted by upsets, and with this parity we have, 
there will be teams winning that you didn't expect," said Butters. "You better 
be prepared for that throughout the (selection) process." 
</P>
<P>
 Scrap Plan A. SEC TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Kentucky 90, No. 1 Arkansas 78 -- Gimel Martinez, cotton protruding 
from his nose after a collision on the court, made a jump shot, then a 
three-pointer, to stop a second-half run by the Razorbacks (25-3). Kentucky 
(25-6) made 16 three-point shots and plays Florida in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Florida 68, Alabama 52 -- The Gators (25-6) got five three-pointers and 
17 points from Craig Brown and switched from their usual man-to-man defense to 
a zone. Alabama (19-9) responded with its worst shooting of the season, 35%. 
BIG EAST TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Providence 69, No. 2 Connecticut 67 -- Robert Phelps, a senior reserve who has 
struggled with his shooting throughout his career, made 10 of 11 shots and had 
six points in the final 2 1/2 minutes for the Friars (19-9), who probably have 
played their way into the NCAA tournament by winning seven in a row. The 
Huskies (27-4) had won the league title by a record three games. Providence 
will be playing in its first Big East championship game today against 
Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgetown 76, Seton Hall 71 -- The Hoyas (18-10), who had lost three in a row 
coming into the tournament and had two victories over Division II teams, might 
have climbed off the bubble and into the NCAA field when they wiped out a 
12-point deficit and defeated the Pirates (17-12). ACC TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia 66, No. 5 Duke 61 -- Grant Hill, always counted on to score down the 
stretch, committed seven turnovers and was held to six-for-20 shooting by 
Cornel Parker of Virginia (17-11). Virginia held the Blue Devils (23-5) without 
a basket for 6 1/2 minutes and probably assured itself of an NCAA bid, no 
matter what it does today against North Carolina. BIG EIGHT TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska 98, No. 3 Missouri 91 -- Eric Piatkowski scored 24 points for the 
Cornhuskers (19-9) and got great satisfaction from stopping the Big Eight's 
longest winning streak in 65 years because he doesn't like Missouri (25-3). 
"They're always taking cheap shots, one after another," he said after helping 
end the Tiger streak in the conference at 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Oklahoma State 69, No. 11 Kansas 68 -- Bryant Reeves made 15 of 17 free 
throws and finished with 27 points for the Cowboys (23-8), who held the 
Jayhawks (25-7) scoreless in the last 3 1/2 minutes and advanced to a game in 
the finals against Nebraska. SOUTHWEST TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 Texas 87, Texas A&M 62 -- B.J. Tyler hit five three-pointers and scored 
25 points to lead the Longhorns (25-7) past the Aggies (19-10) at Dallas. It 
was the first tournament title for Texas, which won its eighth game in a row 
and 18th of its last 19. METRO TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Louisville 76, Virginia Tech 67 -- Dwayne Morton scored eight points 
during an 11-2 second half run as the Cardinals (25-5) overcame their largest 
halftime deficit this season, 14 points, to beat the Hokies (18-10) at Biloxi, 
Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Mississippi 68, North Carolina Charlotte 64 -- Freshman Damien Smith 
scored six of his eight points in a key run as the Eagles (15-13) beat the 
49ers (16-12) to earn a finals matchup with Louisville. WAC TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii 73, Brigham Young 66 -- Trevor Ruffin hit five second-half 
three-pointers as the Rainbows (18-14) rallied to beat the Cougars (21-9) at 
Salt Lake City and claim the Western Athletic Conference tournament's automatic 
NCAA berth. BIG SKY TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State 85, Idaho State 81 -- Shambric Williams scored 17 of his 27 points 
in the second half to send the Broncos (17-12) past Idaho State (18-9) at Boise 
for the Big Sky Conference tournament title and NCAA bid. MAC TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio University 89, Miami of Ohio 66 -- Gary Trent scored 22 points, including 
seven during a 19-4 run in the first half that put the game out of reach, as 
the Bobcats beat Miami (19-10) to win the Mid-American Conference tournament 
and an NCAA berth at Columbus. OTHER TOP 25 GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 97, No. 8 Michigan 93 -- Cedric Neloms scored 28 points and 
Patrick Baldwin hit a key three-pointer in overtime for Northwestern (14-13, 
5-13), which won at home and denied the Wolverines (21-7, 13-5) the Big Ten 
title outright. Michigan, which got 33 points from Jalen Rose and 32 from Juwan 
Howard, has lost three of four but still can share the championship if Illinois 
beats Purdue today. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Indiana 78, Wisconsin 65 -- Damon Bailey scored 19 points in helping 
the Hoosiers (19-8, 12-6), who had lost three of four, snap a slump and beat 
the Badgers (17-10, 8-10) in a Big Ten game at Bloomington, Ind. Field Passes

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; WHY IS EVERYONE ATTACKING SHAQ? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He can't shoot free throws, he doesn't work on his game, he simply drops in 
between movies and CDs, he has no moves, no shot, no clue. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Is this Shaquille O'Neal they are talking about? 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old who's No. 1 in the league in scoring, No. 2 in rebounding, No. 
2 in shooting percentage and No. 6 in blocks? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal is suddenly up to his eyebrows in Shaq-bashers -- opposing players, 
writers, those who should know better. In a recent Sports Illustrated poll, 12 
of 21 coaches picked someone else to start a franchise around. 
</P>
<P>
 One coach who picked Alonzo Mourning called O'Neal "a part-time basketball 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 This merely proves what we have always known: There are a lot of coaches in 
the wrong business. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal works as hard as any prodigy ever has. Derrick Coleman and Larry 
Johnson, the top picks the two years before O'Neal, didn't sign until after the 
season started, nor did Mourning, nominated by Hornet officials as the center 
with the ideal attitude. O'Neal agreed to terms with the Orlando Magic in 
midsummer and went to Pete Newell's big man's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 He went back last summer. As raw as he is, he has shots and moves he didn't 
have as a rookie. His assists are up 42%. Part of the bashing is herd mentality 
-- if everyone's saying it, there must be something to it. Part is his peers' 
natural resentment -- he has so much. Part is his immaturity -- if they are 
going to carp, I'm going to brag. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt he has been overexposed, the Jordan phenomenon multiplied by 
1,000. Jordan went almost 10 years before his endorsement income passed $10 
million; O'Neal hit $15 million as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan never made a movie. O'Neal got star billing in his, with ads that ran 
everywhere, the latest drops in a water torture of his fellows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It blows my mind, I get so many Shaq questions," says Mr. Nice Guy, David 
Robinson. "About his feelings, that he's upset about calls, that he doesn't 
like this or that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is Shaq? Why should I lose sleep that he's upset? It's funny to me (that) 
everyone plays to him so much. He's a good player, no question. He's athletic, 
300 pounds, a phenomenon. He gets credit for how good he is, but it blows my 
mind how people are concerned how he feels neglected." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Magic lost last week at San Antonio, Spur players jumped in Shaq's 
face to rub it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Who played like the MVP today, you or David (Robinson)?" Willie 
Anderson said. "That ticked him off." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, O'Neal had held his own: 32 points and 11 rebounds to Robinson's 
36-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Shaq is a polite young man with great respect for his elders and 
so soft-spoken, he used to whisper through interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he did about 10,000 commercials that bragged for him. Remember the 
one in which Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton 
and John Wooden welcomed him into their inner circle? How do you think 
Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing felt about that one? 
</P>
<P>
 At 21, he dictated his life story, breaking a longstanding tradition: Have the 
life, then write the story. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as All-Star weekend, O'Neal was pretending the resentment directed 
toward him was media hype. He changed his tune when the West players jumped all 
over him, after which he vowed to get them, "one by one." 
</P>
<P>
 Said O'Neal after the San Antonio loss: "Jealousy is the ugliest word in the 
dictionary. I can do a whole bunch of things. Every time I do something, I do 
it well. My movie's doing well. My album will be platinum soon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the best at what I do. I'm just a man of many talents. People don't 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't look like we can put him down as humble anymore, does it? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there aren't that many leading-man roles for seven-footers and, 
whereas singing requires vocal talent, rapping can be done with only a 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal has to grow up in the harsh spotlight of fame, but one way or another, 
he's happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has three peers. In two years, they will be playing for second place. 
NOT SO GOLDEN STATE 
</P>
<P>
 Don Nelson, the NBA's only three-time coach of the year, is becoming more 
disenchanted by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: No matter what he has lost, no one else is likely to cut him the 
deal he has as Golden State's coach, general manager and part owner of a 
$100-million franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, once the program, is now an employee under Dan Finnane, installed as 
president by Nelson's sponsor, owner Jim Fitzgerald, after Nelson's expensive 
search for the elusive big man (Ralph Sampson, Jim Peterson, Alton Lister). 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, Nelson now trumpets his game plans, like the one he 
dreamed up at Portland when Chris Webber was sidelined, with Billy Owens at 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our ace in the hole," Nelson said. "If (Owens) could have come up 
with a Magic Johnson-type of performance and we could have posted him and run 
the offense through him and he could have done all those things, we could have 
just given them fits. But obviously, he wasn't up to the task." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the greatest compliment anyone had ever paid Owens. The Warriors lost 
by 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Warriors don't work as hard as Nelson's beloved Chris Mullin-Tim 
Hardaway-Mitch Richmond club and get upset when their coach yells at them. 
After a report that an argument with Webber during a game at Charlotte had 
strained the relationship, Nelson complained about "a leak in our locker room." 
Writers' access on days off was whittled to a 15-minute period after practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Next season, the Warriors get Hardaway and Sarunas Marciulionis back. Imagine 
the possibilities, if they last until then. IT'S OK, MIKEY 
</P>
<P>
 Loved that Sports Illustrated shot at Michael Jordan for embarrassing 
baseball. You would have thought a game with Marge Schott, George Steinbrenner, 
Jose Canseco and no commissioner would be beyond embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan is only embarrassing himself, so if he can take it, where's the harm? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not to baseball. Here's the world's greatest athlete falling on his 
face, making the game look like an art form instead of a discipline built on 
hand-eye coordination, in which a fat man who smokes cigarettes can hit .300. 
</P>
<P>
 What ticks off baseball people is that a basketball player's lark is the No. 1 
story in spring training, tangible proof he's more famous than any baseball 
star. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 I would feel a lot better about that Laker rebuilding program if Doug Christie 
and Anthony Peeler ever played. Right now, their seasons are virtual 
write-offs. Peeler showed less as a sophomore than as a rookie and is still 
sidelined. Christie, their best prospect, is No. 4 guard and No. 4 forward. 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting hot out there in GM land: The Bulls' closed-mouthed Jerry Krause, 
who normally refuses to appear on talk shows, called one from his car when he 
heard himself being criticized for missing out on Jeff Hornacek. The host then 
asked Krause about it. Krause said he couldn't talk about it. . . . Boston's 
Dave Gavitt called a news conference to answer a Boston Globe story that he 
didn't work at his job. He held the session up for 45 minutes when the writer, 
Jackie McMullan, was caught in traffic. . . . Bullet owner Abe Pollin took out 
a quarter-page ad in two Washington papers to rebut Washington Post columnist 
Michael Wilbon's criticism of USAir Arena. Pollin said Boston Garden, Chicago 
Stadium and Richfield Coliseum were all worse, unfortunately picking three 
stadiums that are being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys again? The Jazz won 10 in a row after a first-half swan dive that 
had Karl Malone criticizing everything, including the music on the 
public-address system -- "We're from Utah, so we can't play any hard-core 
stuff. Why can't we be jamming like everyone else?" -- and suggesting he be 
traded to a real contender, as Charles Barkley was. . . . Houston Coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich, singing the blues after his division rival landed Hornacek: "If 
you look at the perfect player for their team, he's it. He's going to space the 
floor and open things up for that big guy." . . . Jeff Malone, no relation and 
no friend to Karl, after his exile to Philadelphia in the Hornacek deal: "They 
made their move and I guess Karl was happy about it. I look forward to them 
being in the finals. If they don't get there, come back to me and we'll talk 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Merely their little way of welcoming him to the Eastern Conference: The Knicks 
roughed up Danny Manning in their showdown elbow-a-thon at Atlanta last week, 
held him to 13 points and trimmed the Hawks' lead to one game. "They're going 
to miss Dominique (Wilkins) a little bit," Pat Riley said afterward. . . . Said 
Isiah Thomas: "Danny's a great player, but 'Nique can mess around and get 40." 
</P>
<P>
 Where have all the Clippers gone, continued: Charles Smith says he and Manning 
were ecstatic to leave, but Smith's current situation could be better. He lost 
his starting job, says his arthroscopically repaired knee hurts again and is 
often booed in Madison Square Garden. "I hear it, but I can't let it bother 
me," he said. "The crowd isn't going to get on Patrick, John (Starks) or Oak 
(Charles Oakley) so when things go wrong, it comes in my direction." 
</P>
<P>
 He's the czar of more than the telestrator: The Bulls committed a costly 
backcourt violation in their loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, failing to 
realize that they had only six seconds to cross midcourt after a timeout. Said 
Cleveland Coach Mike Fratello: "I've mentioned a number of times we have a very 
intelligent team. Those guys realized that. They went out and extended the 
defense and did it in a way that was subtle enough. They didn't announce it or 
pull any alarms. They subtly got out there on their own and extended the 
pressure." Actually, none of Fratello's players knew there were only six 
seconds left. "We had no idea," Mark Price said. Added Gerald Wilkins: "I was 
wondering what the call was."

<P>
 What was materializing as another uneventful spring-training game Saturday 
ended tumultuously with insults, confrontations and a police escort. 
</P>
<P>
 The umpiring crew of Mark Johnson, Tim McClelland and Jim Quick received a 
police escort out of Tempe Diablo Stadium after the Colorado Rockies' 7-6 
victory over the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium security thought it was appropriate after Johnson ejected Angel 
shortstop Gary DiSarcina in the ninth inning. There was a heated confrontation 
between DiSarcina and Johnson, and when the game ended moments later, Angel 
hitting Coach Rod Carew had to be separated from Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He insulted my ability to hit a baseball," said DiSarcina, who never had been 
ejected in his professional career. "I don't know the guy from Adam, never even 
talked to him before in my life, and he insults me.

 "I wasn't going to stand there and take it. He was the antagonist. He was the 
one who went ballistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, according to two players, told DiSarcina: "You're a .220 hitter and 
I'm going to (get) you all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "Let's just say we had a few words." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he'll hold a grudge," DiSarcina said, "so I'm going to make sure I 
swing the bat when he's behind the plate. Every time up, it's hit and run." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers hates to even entertain the notion, but concedes that he 
might think twice about playing DiSarcina in games Johnson is umpiring behind 
the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I've seen grudges last 20 years in the game," Rodgers said. "I usually 
don't look to see who's umpiring to make my lineup card out, and I hate to 
resort to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there's not a whole lot you can do about it. But I'm afraid, 
you ain't seen nothin' yet."

 Starter Joe Magrane and reliever Julio Valera will not open the season with 
the Angels, but after watching them make their first appearances on the 
practice field Saturday, Dr. Lewis Yocum expects that each will return. If 
everything goes according to plan, Yocum said, Magrane will be in the starting 
rotation by the end of April and Valera will be in the bullpen by June. 
Magrane, pitching off a mound for the first time since undergoing arthroscopic 
elbow surgery last month, felt no pain or discomfort in his 10-minute outing. 
He says he will be pitching in a spring-training game by the end of the month. 
Valera, who pitched on the side for the first time since undergoing surgery 
July 8 on his right elbow, also experienced no discomfort.

 The Angels (1-8) committed three errors Saturday, and now have 10 in their 
first nine games. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CANDIOTTI IS FIRST TO GO FIVE

 Tom Candiotti went five innings -- the first Dodger to go that far this spring 
-- and gave up two runs and six hits as the Dodgers lost to the Houston Astros, 
3-2, at Kissimmee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough day for a knuckler, with the wind blowing in like it was," 
Candiotti said, "but I felt pretty good.I'm not quite ready to go nine innings, 
but I felt stronger in the third and fourth and fifth, so that's a pretty good 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the highlight of the game was the Dodgers' first run, a perfectly 
executed suicide squeeze, with shortstop Rafael Bournigal bunting across Raul 
Mondesi without a play. 
</P>

 Leadoff hitter Brett Butler was hit on the shoulder by Houston starter Darryl 
Kile on the third pitch of the game. Butler was on his hands and knees for 
about 30 seconds before trotting to first. . . . South Korean Chan Ho Park will 
pitch in Vero Beach today against the Montreal Expos. The game will be 
televised back to Seoul by SBS Korea. Channel 5 will televise the game at 10 
a.m. . . . Rookie Darren Dreifort is also expected to pitch. . . . Delino 
DeShields, struck with a bat in a batting cage accident March 2 that broke his 
left cheekbone, played for the first time Saturday in an intrasquad workout at 
Vero Beach. The second baseman wore a special mask when he was fielding and 
running the bases, but not when he was batting. BILL DWYRE

BASEBALL'S CRITICS HIT THE WRONG TARGETS; ANALYSIS: THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH 
THE GAME IS AN AGING FAN BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nationally, the old Brooklyn Dodgers were one of the most popular teams of all 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the country in those days, the Dodgers were uniquely symbolic of 
both hope and hope lost. 
</P>
<P>
 In big games, they were usually the underdog. They were usually outscored. And 
they never quit trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, though, no baseball club could play that role in America's psyche -- 
not that there aren't plenty of candidates. The difference is that baseball 
isn't as relevant as it was in the 1950s and earlier, when basketball and pro 
football were like minor league. 
</P>
<P>
 Distinctly major league today, the NFL and NBA have baseball in a vise, and, 
every spring and every fall, they squeeze hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's many critics, when examining the game's troubles, seldom take that 
into account. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, unfairly or ignorantly, they attack baseball itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of their notions and some comments on their misperceptions: 
</P>
<P>
 " They say that greedy players, always seeking more money, have turned off 
baseball fans. " 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that baseball players are in the same greed boat with NFL and NBA 
players, and with rock stars, too, not to mention rappers and others who 
obviously all make more than any entertainer is worth. It is both erroneous and 
unjust to come down on baseball players only. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the reason a .237-hitting second baseman can ask for, and get, $2 
million is that on a continent with a population exceeding 300 million, there 
aren't 30 good second basemen who can hit .237. 
</P>
<P>
 " They say the games are too long. " 
</P>
<P>
 Any reporter who spends an afternoon or evening talking with the spectators in 
baseball or football crowds will discover that long games are low on their hate 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 The push for shorter games comes from radio and TV people, who don't want to 
miss the start of the next scheduled program, and newspaper people, who have 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 " They say that player strikes and threats of more strikes have turned off 
baseball's fans. " 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance always rises not long after a baseball strike. After an NFL strike, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 " Critics name Jose Canseco, among others, and say that a reason for 
baseball's fall in popularity is that modern ballplayers are contemptuous of 
sports fans. " 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s and '40s, Ted Williams, a .400 hitter who refused to tip his cap 
after home runs, fought a running battle with press and public. Sports fans and 
journalists have always been dissed by athletic malcontents. 
</P>
<P>
 " Noting the absence of Williams, Rogers Hornsby, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Joe 
DiMaggio and other old superstars, they say that baseball doesn't have many 
heroes anymore. " 
</P>
<P>
 Some answers: 
</P>
<P>
 * The past is often telescoped in the mind of an old critic. At any one time, 
baseball has seldom had more than a few superstars. DiMaggio never saw Ruth or 
Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the national publicity race today, there is more competition from other 
sports than there was 50 years ago. If Cal Ripken Jr. had played in DiMaggio's 
time, when pro football and basketball seemed immaterial to many Americans, he 
would be a famous man today. A famous old man, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Night games and better pitching have in recent years combined to rob some 
good batters of the hits that could have made them .370 or even .400 hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 * At any given time, baseball will always have fewer superstars than, say, 
basketball because of the nature of the two sports. It's simply a lot easier to 
star in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 When a game has to be won in the final seconds, a great basketball player can 
often do it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 When a baseball game has to be won at the end, a great hitter is always 
constrained by the realities of his sport. During a ninth-inning rally, he 
might never come to bat, and even if he does, as talented as he is, he can 
count on making out seven times out of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it this way: In his long basketball career, Michael Jordan was never 
intentionally walked. 
</P>
<P>
 " They say, vociferously, that baseball is an afternoon sport and that nothing 
but the greed of the owners prompts them to play so many night games. " 
</P>
<P>
 In a workingman's country, there are more fans for a night attraction than a 
matinee. How can anyone be seriously faulted for making his or her product 
available to the largest possible numbers? 
</P>
<P>
 Like any capitalistic organization, baseball is driven by the profit motive, 
but its starting-time decisions, at least, are consistent with the principle of 
the greatest good for the greatest number. 
</P>
<P>
 " They say that World Series night games are costing baseball what could be 
its next generation of fans -- today's kids and teens. " 
</P>
<P>
 In a country with four time zones, there's no way to make a ballgame available 
to all adults and kids everywhere. Baseball would lose some adults if it played 
World Series baseball in children's hours -- just as the NFL loses Eastern 
adults and kids, too, as well as national rating points, by starting its Monday 
games at 9 p.m. ET. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it's harder than one thinks to tailor a general-interest product to 
kids. Newspapers deliberately trying to appeal to teen-agers have had less 
success than those focusing on simply improving quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, there isn't too much that baseball can do to wean today's 
youngsters away from the heart-pounding violence of contemporary TV or the 
bursts of sound and color in their Sega Genesis lives. Baseball just can't 
compete in that league. 
</P>
<P>
 It has to pray that when they grow up a little, some of today's children will 
tire of the Sega-Nintendo frenzy and opt for the slower but richer and more 
pleasurable life of a baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
 " They say there's no action in baseball. " 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's problem isn't lack of action. It never had much action even in its 
heyday as the national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, it's a game that, unlike football or basketball, can't 
reinvent itself without destroying itself. 
</P>
<P>
 To survive into the heart of another century, baseball needs nothing but a few 
million fans who like it the way it is.

VLASIC, MAURER PUT THE HURT ON THE OTHER GUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacifica's basketball team turned to its casualty list Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Vlasic spent the week fighting allergies and a sore throat. Erik Maurer 
spent most of Thursday night and all day Friday having his ankle treated. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were the ones who caused the pain and suffering in the Mariners' 
60-55 victory over University of San Diego High in Southern California Regional 
Division III boys' basketball final at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer scored 12 points in the first half to keep the Mariners from 
collapsing. Vlasic made eight free throws in the final minute to put them over 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way I was going to miss this game," Vlasic said. "Right now, I 
feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different story a few hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic, the Mariners' leading scorer, tried to hide his illness from Coach Bob 
Becker. But a sneezing fit while his ankles were being taped by Becker blew his 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up at Chris, and I knew he was sick," Becker said. "I think the kids 
try to hide things from me, because they know I won't play them if I think 
they're too sick or hurt. Chris tried, but he started sneezing and coughing and 
hacking. I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 So Becker limited Vlasic's playing time in the first half, hoping to save him 
for the fourth quarter. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic scored 13 of his 15 points in the second half. He began his free throw 
rampage with the score tied, 52-52. He also grabbed two key rebounds in the 
final minute and was fouled both times. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight of his free throws touched only net. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just you, the ball and the rim," Vlasic said. "It's that simple. Every 
time I made one, it just built up my confidence a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Becker: "I wanted Chris fresh at the end. I wanted him out there if we 
were close. I didn't want him asking out of the game at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 So Becker placed responsibility on Maurer's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer sprained his ankle Thursday and missed the entire second half of the 
victory over San Diego St. Augustine. He was at the chiropractor's office until 
12:30 a.m. and wasn't sure he was going to play until right before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker put Maurer in Vlasic's spot in the first half. He responded, gimpy 
ankle and all, making all six of his shots in the half and finishing with 15 
points. It kept the Mariners from disaster. Even with his point production, 
they still trailed, 35-24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to think where we would have been without Erik," Becker said. "I don't 
know how much he was hurting, but I'm sure glad he was out there. He saved us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Maurer: "It felt fine once I got out there. And right now, everything 
feels great. Just great."

MIKE PENNER: REFEREE'S WHISTLE HALTS A CHAMPIONSHIP MARCH FOR MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary McKnight's face, as red as his crimson sweater from tipoff on, just about 
burst with 1:21 left on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should be ashamed!" McKnight screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is sinful!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you can sleep tonight!" 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight stomped his foot and uttered an expression not normally heard in a 
Mater Dei High School religion class and shouted at Southern Section 
Commissioner Dean Crowley, seated at courtside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who said he was qualified?" McKnight bellowed, gesturing toward his game-long 
nemesis Saturday, referee Ernest Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 The second annual L.A. County-Orange County High School All-Star Game -- also 
known as Los Angeles Crenshaw-Mater Dei in the Southern California Division I 
Regional finals -- had just been decided, not by a tomahawk jam by Crenshaw's 
Tremaine Fowlkes or a spinning layup by Mater Dei's Miles Simon, but a whistle 
by Kelley that momentarily silenced a pulsating Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 A wild scramble for a loose ball had just gone to Mater Dei's Mike Karich, who 
straightened up, whirled and flipped a pass back to Clay McKnight, who launched 
a potential game-tying three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot went down. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Crenshaw forward Kristaan Johnson, flat on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mater Dei's bench erupted with jubilant fists thrust in the air, Kelley's 
jogged toward the scorer's table, waving off the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal screen on Karich was the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Three points were taken away from Mater Dei's side of the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 One point was added to Crenshaw's after Johnson sank the first of two throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, a 69-69 tie mutated into a 70-66 Crenshaw lead, soon to go 
down in the books as a 71-67 Crenshaw victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "A possible seven-point turnaround," McKnight said a half-hour later outside 
the dressing room, a half-hour cooling period. Or at least McKnight had cooled. 
His thermostat had been nudged from kettle-shaking boil to a steady simmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnson pushed through the screen," McKnight contended. "Not only should the 
three have counted, but Karich should have been at the line for two." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, son of former UCLA great Marques, is headed to his dad's alma mater, 
where he will apparently major in theater. Karich's elbow brushed Johnson as he 
turned to dish the ball, but Johnson went down as if he were hit by a bazooka 
shell -- a fine piece of ad-lib acting, even if Johnson had to say so himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get a foul," Johnson said, "so I flopped. I exaggerated a little 
bit to get the ref's attention. He called it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the wind hadn't been knocked out of Johnson, it certainly left Mater Dei's 
sails. Despite being pounded on the boards all night, despite watching Johnson 
and mates put back missed shot after missed shot until one Cougar got it right, 
the Monarchs had struggled back to just three down in the final 90 seconds, 
then tie it, then have the tie unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 As McKnight ranted on the sidelines, his players put their heads down, trying 
to outrace the clock, but their emotions had been body slammed. For Mater Dei, 
the game ended quietly, save for the head coach's echoing mantra: "You should 
be ashamed of yourself! You should be ashamed of yourself!" 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in as many years, Mater Dei's quest for a state title had 
expired here, in the Southern California Regional final, against Crenshaw. And 
for the Monarchs, the joke remained the same: 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw had them outmanned, five transfers to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have said these two teams deserve these other, with their tentacles 
reaching out for the cream of Southland teen-aged jump-shooting talent, going 
where 99% of the other programs can't. Crenshaw's entire starting lineup 
transferred in from other schools, which ought to be reflected in the pregame 
introductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting at one guard, from Fremont High School, No. 5, Tommie Davis." 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting at the other guard, from Serra High School, No. 11, Reggie 
McFerren." 
</P>
<P>
 Go on down the line. Johnson previously played at Montclair Prep. Fowlkes came 
in from Culver City. Ronnie Arch, Westchester High. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of stuff makes McKnight bristle, to the point where he brought up 
the topic, unprompted, after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we get too caught up in all the recruiting violations that we 
forget about the kids," he said. "Since LeRon Ellis played here, in 1987, we've 
had two transfers. Two transfers in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Granted, those two transfers were All-Americans, Reggie Geary and Schea 
Cotton. But you name me one school that hasn't had two transfers in seven 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight wanted to shift the spotlight onto his players and away from the 
talent scouts, real or imagined. "We've made the final four three years in a 
row," McKnight said. "That's a mighty feat." 
</P>
<P>
 The referee's whistle wasn't ringing so loudly in McKnight's ears now. He 
actually smiled as he alluded to a quote in Saturday's newspaper, attributed to 
Crenshaw's Arch, who called his team "a a big bus" and Mater Dei "a little 
Datsun B-210. We're on a mission to run them over." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're a little Datsun," McKnight mused, "we must have a pretty big 
bumper." 
</P>
<P>
 He shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Datsun? Give me some credit at least. I always go American."

WHEN OENNING FINDS HER RHYTHM, WARRIORS WALTZ TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamie Oenning was playing less like a standout senior guard and more like a 
basketball novice, and Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs reached his limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangs shouted at Oenning throughout the first half of the Southern California 
Regional Division II girls' final after each mistake she made, which kept him 
busy. Finally, at halftime Saturday at Anaheim Arena, Bangs pulled her aside 
and made his feelings known at length in a face-to-face session. 
</P>
<P>
 And exactly what was said? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, let's just say that it couldn't be used in print," Bangs said. "But I 
felt I made my point." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Oenning bounced back from her dismal first-half performance to help 
lead Woodbridge to a 46-41 victory over Mission Hills Alemany. She made an 
important 15-foot jump shot from the baseline with 1 minute 25 seconds to play 
to give Woodbridge a 44-41 lead -- and a big lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing less was expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've seen it so many times down the stretch, it doesn't surprise you," 
Bangs said. "She is our best shooter, and she was in her rhythm on that shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a key. That was the clutch shot of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning, who leads the Warriors in scoring with an average of about 14 points, 
scored only eight on four-of-12 shooting. But she was able to help the Warriors 
in other ways, with five assists and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous, and it was hard for me shooting here," Oenning said. 
"It wasn't easy going from shooting at Woodbridge High to a place where NBA 
players play." 
</P>
<P>
 Bangs knew that Oenning would not wilt because of his criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jamie has been around me for a long time," Bangs said. "I didn't think her 
head was into the game, and I told her so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted her to start getting focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning wanted the same, but Alemany was not cooperating, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were playing really tough man-to-man defense on us," Oenning said. "It 
was really hard for me to even get off a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I finally got in my rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge needs Oenning to maintain it for one more game. The Warriors will 
play Sacramento El Camino for the State championship Saturday in Oakland. And 
Oenning hopes to end her final high school game the way she has ended all the 
others in her senior year -- smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words can't really describe how I feel," she said. "I wouldn't want to end my 
career with any other people than the people I am with right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole season has been like a dream, and the dream continues."

REGIONAL FINAL GAME PROVES TO BE A MIXED BAG FOR THE MONARCHS 
</P>

 Controversy overshadowed a great basketball game at Anaheim Arena Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1 minute 21 seconds remaining, a blocking foul on Mater Dei's Mike Karich 
wiped out a three-pointer by Clay McKnight that would have tied the score at 
69. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Los Angeles Crenshaw had to hang on to beat Mater Dei, 71-67, in a game 
that was similar to Crenshaw's 63-61, buzzer-beater victory over the Monarchs 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars were more physical, talented, and mature than the Monarchs . . . 
yet Mater Dei had its chances to win late. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had only one starter returning from last year's team," Mater Dei Coach 
Gary McKnight said. "This season we had guys who played JVs last year, some who 
were in the eighth grade . . . I couldn't be more proud of these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Shaun Jackson played UCLA-bound forward Kristaan Johnson to a 
standstill. Johnson had 27 points and nine rebounds and Jackson had 19 points 
and five rebounds, scoring six of the Monarchs' seven fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Schea Cotton had 16 points and seven rebounds before fouling out with 
2 minutes 25 seconds remaining. Junior guard Clay McKnight handled the 
relentless pressure of Crenshaw's defense and had 11 points and two 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson, Cotton, and McKnight figure to return and to make another run 
at the Southern California Regional final, it was the last chance for point 
guard Miles Simon, who is Arizona-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, who had missed a potential game-winning shot in the closing minutes of 
last season's loss, had another chance to win a title but watched his shot roll 
off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jackson cut the lead to 68-66 on two free throws with 3:14 remaining, 
Simon made a steal, sped upcourt, spun around one defender and missed a tough 
layup with 2:46 to play.  
</P>
<P>
 It all seemed to unravel from there for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one seconds later, Cotton fouled out and McKnight's three-pointer was 
erased 1:04 later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Kris pushed Mike, but I told our guys what I think doesn't count," 
McKnight said.

BECKLEY ENJOYS HER ROOM WITH CHAMPIONSHIP VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarah Beckley has this thing about big games. 
</P>
<P>
 She likes playing in arenas, and she will do almost anything she can to ensure 
Brea-Olinda plays in an extra-large building. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a playoff game or a championship game, Beckley has thrived in the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Her big-game affinity continued Saturday, when she gave her blessing to 
Southern California's newest arena by scoring a game-high 17 points and pulling 
down a game-high 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her performance was one of the key reasons Brea-Olinda defeated Newport 
Harbor, 67-39, to advance to the State championship game Saturday at Oakland 
Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing lacking was her observation skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Have you noticed that you seem to play better in big games? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said her coach, John Hattrup. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always seems to play better in an arena," he said. "I think it's because 
of the focus and concentration and the intensity of the game and what's riding 
on the game. The measure of a good player is not by what they do against 
mediocre competition, it's what they do against good teams in big games, and I 
think Sarah has proven that she is a big-time player." 
</P>
<P>
 Beckley, a 5-foot-11 senior who is often overlooked on a team featuring Nicole 
Erickson and Colleen Hudson, had a game-high 18 points and 12 rebounds in last 
week's 70-40 Southern Section championship victory over Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the section semifinals, Beckley has averaged 13.4 points in seven games, 
a step up from her 10-point regular-season average.  
</P>
<P>
 This year's excellence isn't an isolated case, either. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- She was the second-leading scorer, with eight points, and the leading 
rebounder, with nine, in last year's 42-41 State championship victory over Fair 
Oaks Bella Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She had a game-high 16 points and 11 rebounds in last year's regional 
championship, a 45-39 victory over San Diego University City. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She had 11 points in last year's section championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Get the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 "She is so powerful on her boards -- unbelievable," Newport Harbor Coach 
Shannon Jakosky said. "She crashes the offensive board beautifully. She's 
strong and is able to position very well.

CALL MY AGENT; IT'S LOCAL; PUBLISHING STILL REVOLVES AROUND NEW YORK CITY, BUT 
THANKS TO PHONES AND FAXES, LITERARY REPRESENTATIVES SUCH AS PAT TEAL AND 
SANDRA DIJKSTRA CAN BUILD CAREERS FROM HERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Fullerton literary agent Pat Teal has heard it once, she's heard it a 
hundred times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time there's a writers' conference," she says, "all the agents from out 
of New York get asked, 'How do you work outside of New York?' And we always say 
the same thing: 'Our work is done on the telephone. It doesn't matter. We have 
a big telephone bill, but it's all done in the mail and on the phone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Operating a continent away from the heart of the publishing industry hasn't 
hurt Teal, who sports a tiny gold necklace that proclaims her a "Super Agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 15 years, she has earned a reputation as one of the top 
representatives of romance writers. Working out of two converted bedrooms in 
her Fullerton home, she sells more than 100 books a year on subjects that range 
from mysteries to hang-gliding and dying with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Teal's success defies the stereotype of the literary agent who lunches daily 
with editors at chic Manhattan eateries and spends her evenings at glamorous 
publishing soirees whose stellar guest lists are fodder for the Liz Smith 
column. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary agents may have historically been based in New York City, but thanks 
to phones and faxes, that's no longer necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a majority still operate out of the 212 area code, a sizable number 
are scattered throughout the country -- from Los Angeles to Chicago to Seattle. 
Even Wichita, Kan., and Hampton, Va., boast of literary agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that one can be an agent almost anywhere," says Sandra Dijkstra, 
a prominent agent who works out of Del Mar, the San Diego County beach town 
best known for its horse racing track. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a presence in New York you don't have to live in New York," she says. 
"You just have to have material you believe in and you persuade others to 
believe in. You don't have to be in New York to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dijkstra, whose clients include Amy Tan, Le Ly Hayslip and Maxine Hong 
Kingston, says that "almost any person can put a stake outside and say, 'I'm an 
agent.' Which is one of the dangers for unknowledgeable authors. . . . But the 
fact is only legitimate agents are paid attention to." 
</P>
<P>
 What does it take to be a successful agent? "An eye for talent, an ear for a 
new voice, a taste for the market and trends and a mind for negotiating and" -- 
Dijkstra laughs -- "for navigating the sometimes murky waters of publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful career," Dijkstra says. "What you're doing is helping talent 
find its audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Dijkstra, who has a master's in comparative literature and a Ph.D. in French 
literature, taught literature classes at the University of Virginia and then at 
UCLA and UC Irvine during what she calls her "gypsy decade" of the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 She became an agent in 1983 after a friend asked her to shop around her 
proposal for a women's history book during a trip Dijkstra was going to make to 
New York. Dijkstra sold the book and was in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the skills of a teacher translate very nicely to the skills of 
agenting," she says, "because in a sense teachers are pitching ideas, and 
teachers have to know a little about a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 What began as an office in a single room in her home 10 minutes up the hill 
from the beach has expanded into an entire wing staffed by five employees who 
help her field 300 submissions a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Teal was just completing her master's in English literature at Cal State 
Fullerton in 1978 when she teamed up with fellow Fullerton resident Sandra Watt 
to form the Teal and Watt Literary Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women had known each other socially: Their husbands played tennis on 
weekends, and they'd all go out to eat afterward. At the time, Watt was a vice 
president of an educational publishing house in Orange County and, Teal 
recalls, "she got tired of making money for somebody else. She said, 'Why don't 
we start an agency?' I said, 'I don't know anything about that, Sandy.' And she 
said, 'I can teach you.' So in we went." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long before the new agency made its first sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after opening up shop, Teal ran into Cal State Fullerton English 
professor Rita Balkey at a campus social event. Balkey, who taught a class on 
the Bible as literature, had been free-lance writing commentaries for a local 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I complimented her on her articles, and she said: 'Well, I've written a book. 
I've sent it all over the place, and I can't sell it.' So I thought her book 
would read very much like her wonderful, nostalgic articles and I said, 'Oh, 
why don't you let me read it and let me see if I can sell it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Teal with a laugh: "It turned out to be a really torrid bodice ripper! I 
just couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Teal says she sold Balkey's historical romance novel "so fast I thought this 
was an easy job -- only to find out it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 That sale, however, set the tone for the fledgling Fullerton agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Teal -- she and Watt went their separate ways after eight years, and Watt is 
now based in Hollywood -- says "there was a great demand for romances" at the 
time. It's a trend that continues to account for nearly 50% of all mass-market 
paperbacks sold in the United States, and romance writers make up about 75% of 
Teal's authors. 
</P>
<P>
 Being an agent, Teal says, "is not a 9-to-5 job." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the three-hour time difference between the East and West coasts, her day 
begins at "6:30 on the dot." That's when she begins calling New York. "You have 
to work on their time," she explains, adding that she's on the phone until New 
York "folds," at 3 p.m. locally. 
</P>
<P>
 When not talking to New York, she says, she's fielding calls from authors from 
all over the country. But after 3 o'clock, "I can concentrate on my local 
authors." Her evenings are spent reading manuscripts and going over contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 of Teal's authors live in Orange County, including June Casey Triglia 
("By Her Own Design"), Lori Herter ("The Willow File") and Maralys Wills 
("Scatterpath"). But the majority are spread around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Her authors vary from one who sends her something "just about every week" to 
another who sends her something once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her most prolific writers is Marie Ferrarella of Irvine, for whom Teal 
has sold 64 books over the past 11 years. "She's a dynamo," says Teal of 
Ferrarella, who recently received a Romance Writers of America award for best 
in her category. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their preference for working far from New York, both Teal and Dijkstra 
occasionally travel on business. 
</P>
<P>
 Dijkstra makes two major trips a year to New York -- in the spring and summer 
-- in addition to brief trips to close specific deals or to attend publishing 
parties. Teal also makes one or two weeklong trips a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take a list of your books in and call on editors, have breakfast, lunch, 
dinner," she says. Meeting with editors face-to-face, she says, "shows that you 
think enough of them to come in and see them personally. But I see them at the 
conferences, and I'm all over the place, and so is every other agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Teal, in fact, discovers many of her new authors at the half-dozen writing and 
publishing conferences she attends each year. Others, such as a Bountiful, 
Utah, writer for whom Teal recently sold a three-book mystery series, come 
recommended by writers she's already representing. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean that literary gold doesn't sometimes surface in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Dijkstra discovered Carlsbad children's book author Janell Cannon through a 
submission in the mail. Cannon's "Stellaluna" -- an illustrated tale of a lost 
baby fruit bat that falls into a bird's nest and is raised as a bird -- soared 
to the top spot on Publishers Weekly's children's bestseller list last year and 
was awarded best illustrated book of the year by the Children's Booksellers of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a joy it is to just find something that comes over the transom, and it 
becomes one of the most important children's books of the year, " Dijkstra 
says. "That was a kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Dijkstra met Tan -- whose best-selling 1989 novel, "The Joy Luck Club," put 
Dijkstra's agency on the map -- at the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, a 
fiction writers workshop run by former UC Irvine writing professor Oakley Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Tan then sent a short story to Dijkstra, who thought it was "fantastic. I told 
her if she'd write two more, we could have a meeting." Tan did, and 16 of her 
short stories would later be linked together to form the critically acclaimed 
novel about four Chinese immigrant women and their daughters living in 
modern-day San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But the novel was far from complete when Dijkstra took Tan's 50 pages of 
manuscript to New York, where, Dijkstra recalls, "I told people I had to have 
at least $50,000" -- an enviable advance for an unknown writer with only one 
published short story to her credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she went to New York, however, Dijkstra made a crucial suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't pleased with Tan's original title for the book, "Wind and Water." 
Recalls Dijkstra: "I said I'd be laughed out of Manhattan with those words on 
the title." So she asked Tan to write a book proposal, and in Tan's synopsis of 
the novel she mentioned the name of the social and investment circle her four 
older female characters belonged to. 
</P>
<P>
 Dijkstra recalls reading about the Joy Luck Club and saying, " 'Oh, my God!' I 
got goose bumps. Who doesn't want to be a member of the Joy Luck Club? I mean, 
it's a best-selling title. It's a magical combination of words. You have to pay 
attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Determining how a book can be shown to its best advantage to publishers is, 
Dijkstra says, "what agents are paid for." 
</P>
<P>
 On another level, she says, "we are fulfilling authors' dreams. That's the 
toughest of all, because sometimes an author's dreams are completely 
unrealistic."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, she says, "we can't forget that our mission is to fulfill those 
sometimes unrealizable dreams. That's why we're hired. And the joy of the job 
is working with such talented people."

WRITERS SHOULD START OUT BY DOING THEIR HOMEWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Mar literary agent Sandra Dijkstra receives about 300 submissions a week 
from writers around the country. Dijkstra, whose clients include Amy Tan and 
Maxine Hong Kingston, offers these suggestions to fledgling writers seeking an 
agent: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do your homework: Be familiar with the books in the field that you're 
writing about and know what your book adds to the field. What's distinctive 
about it? 
</P>
<P>
 Writers "have to be aware of what else is out there and have some sense of 
what their book is going to be compared to," she says. "That's really helpful. 
When we do a book proposal, we always include a profile of the author and 
(information about) the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 * Look in the acknowledgments of similar books "and see what agents are 
representing those books and figure out how to approach an agent. Writers 
really should not be approaching an agent by telephone because they're too 
busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she says, "it's a print business. We need to see how they write. The 
cover letter is going to be the gateway to their imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 * It helps if a writer comes recommended by a published author or by someone 
who has credentials in the business. "We always pay a little more attention 
when something is recommended," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "But mostly," Dijkstra says, "my advice is they should first of all be 
readers, because if they don't read, they won't be good writers. The second 
thing, of course, is to be dedicated to the craft of writing. I think writers 
should be people who have to write, and spend more time with that than learning 
the business of publishing." 
</P>
<P>
 And, she adds, "don't be afraid to take a chance and let your (literary) voice 
develop. Writers have to believe in themselves. If they don't believe in 
themselves, nobody else will." DENNIS McLELLAN

TRAVEL INSIDER: GOAL FOR A SOCCER SUMMER: GETTING FOOT IN HOTEL DOOR; LODGING: 
AS STADIUMS ACROSS U.S. FILL FOR WORLD CUP, SO WILL ROOMS AND FLIGHTS. BOOK 
EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is our right, as free Americans, to value baseball, football and basketball 
above soccer and turn a deaf ear to the upcoming World Cup competition in this 
country. But those who ignore soccer this summer may be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how this first U.S. staging of the World Cup goes, the ignorant 
American traveler could either stumble into a city full of inflated rates and 
booked-up hotels, or hand over full price to a hotelier who is on the brink of 
resorting to "fire sale" rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming soccer competition, bringing hundreds of international athletes 
to this country for the world's largest professional sporting spectacle, will 
stretch from June 17 to July 17 with matches in nine U.S. cities. Organizers 
say they expect all stadiums involved to sell out. An influx of up to 1 million 
foreign spectators has been forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such numbers, World Cup organizers started setting aside hotel 
rooms in 1992, and by late last year had reserved an estimated 2 million 
room-nights at hotels nationwide. Some of those beds have since been released, 
and as hotel room-deposit deadlines arrive in mid-April and May, many more 
rooms may or may not be released. If international travelers beat a path here, 
as organizers predict, the number of rooms released will be small, and the 
result for other travelers to those cities will be lower availability and 
higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In that event, said World Cup Accommodations Bureau spokesman John Parker, 
non-soccer travelers should "use their own experience of a Super Bowl" in 
deciding whether to brave affected cities. That is, book rooms months ahead or 
stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if foreign fans stay home, or sleep six to a room, or lodge 
under the roofs of family and friends, or sleep in bags under the stars, 
hoteliers here could find themselves with thousands of rooms to dump in June 
and July. Despite the avowed confidence of World Cup organizers, John Marks, 
president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitor Bureau, noted that many 
hoteliers in his area are "very uncertain" about the World Cup projection 
they've heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks estimated that nearly 10,000 of the 50,000 hotel rooms in the greater 
San Francisco area were blocked for the World Cup as of mid-February -- a 
figure comparable to the number the city gets for gatherings of the National 
Auto Dealers Assn. or the American Dental Assn. Marks said he has been told to 
expect up to 10,000 Brazilians, 5,000-6,000 Colombians, 3,000-6,000 Swiss, and 
smaller numbers of Russians and Cameroonians. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the soccer pilgrims prove as predictable as convention-bound dentists? 
The summer hotel outlook, in the Bay Area and beyond, depends in part on the 
answer to that question. To get a sense of availability, check for newly 
released rooms after the deposit deadlines in mid-April and mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another level to this, too. After the initial round of matches, 
winners and their fans advance to new cities, potentially complicating air 
travel as well as ground accommodations. Protect yourself and book early. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown of World Cup dates and the affected metropolitan areas. Note 
that some national teams (Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, Italy) 
tend to draw far more heavily than others (Bulgaria, Cameroon, Morocco, 
Romania).

GILBERT GARCETTI; IN THE HOT SEAT AS L.A. DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox 11 News and a 
contributor to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning 
Edition. He interviewed Gilbert Garcetti at Fox TV studios in Hollywood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you are a big-city district attorney, winning the high-profile cases is 
very important. Losing them often means losing the next election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the district attorney's office has had difficulty with highly 
publicized trials, failing to get expected convictions in such celebrated cases 
as "Twilight Zone," McMartin Pre-School, Rodney G. King, Reginald O. Denny and 
Lyle and Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is more aware of this than the man who currently sits in the D.A.'s 
office. At 52, Gilbert L. Garcetti is a career prosecutor with a quarter 
century of experience. In his first year as Los Angeles County's chief crime 
fighter, he's seen his troops fail to get tough convictions in the Denny case 
and face a hung jury in the Menendez trial. But Garcetti doesn't think some 
sort of "big-case curse" haunts his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, son of Mexican immigrants, was born in South-Central Los Angeles. 
After getting his undergraduate degree at USC on a scholarship, he earned his 
law degree at UCLA in 1967. He joined the D.A.'s office after taking a year to 
work on Democrat Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign. By the late 1970s, he 
was directing the D.A.'s Special Investigations Unit. Then he got sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti was diagnosed with lymphoma. His hair fell out during treatment -- 
and was gray when it grew back. But he beat the cancer, and in 1984, when Ira 
Reiner was elected D.A., he made Garcetti his chief deputy. Reiner eventually 
demoted his deputy in a feud that resulted in Garcetti unseating his boss in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be days when Garcetti wonders if it was worth it. County budget 
cuts have made it impossible to hire enough lawyers and support staff to handle 
an ever-increasing caseload. His lead prosecutor in the Menendez murder trial, 
Pamela Bozanich, had to learn to use a word-processing program to type her own 
briefs, because she was told there was no money to hire a secretary. And the 
new "three strikes you're out" bill signed into law last week, mandating life 
sentences on the third felony conviction, means public defenders may demand 
trials for their clients rather than accepting plea bargains. Garcetti, who 
opposed the bill, says it will make his job even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Garcetti seems game for the challenge. The father of a daughter in law 
school and a son who is a Rhodes scholar, he says he's determined to make Los 
Angeles a place his kids are proud to call home. In a late-night interview 
after a flight back from Washington, Garcetti appeared tired, but not weary. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What about this problem of not winning the high-profile cases? Why 
is it so hard to get a guilty verdict when the spotlight is on?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I don't think it is. If you look at our effort over a 10-year period, 
the ones that didn't come out the way we thought they should is a very small 
amount. People name five big cases we lost. But we've had tremendous successes 
in big cases. The Charles Keating case, The Night Stalker case. I don't buy 
that we can't make the big case. I have been D.A. now for 14 months. I'm very 
proud of the effort all our lawyers have made on the so-called "high-profile" 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you learn from the deadlock in the Menendez trial?  
</P>
<P>
 A: First is the importance of being able to directly question prospective 
jurors. When you have a juror who is, at best, misleading when answering a key 
question on a questionnaire, and we can't examine that juror, it puts us behind 
the eight ball in a way the defense can never be put. The defense only needs 
one juror. We need all 12.  
</P>
<P>
 The second lesson has to do with emotion. We made a conscious decision about 
how the trial lawyers would handle the case. And obviously, the emotion 
generated by the defense convinced, or at least swayed, some jurors to the 
defense version of the evidence and the law. We have to appreciate and 
understand that there are many people who are swayed by emotion, and not 
necessarily by the cold facts and the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Everybody in this state has budget problems these days -- how have cuts 
affected your department, and the way you prosecute cases?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The Board of Supervisors cut us $12.6 million and that's on top of an 
$11-million cut the year before. We're short on lawyers to prosecute crimes and 
we're short on investigators who can get the information we need to make the 
cases. Probably, right now, there are lawyers going out, late at night, looking 
for witnesses themselves, because we don't have the investigators to do it. I 
am down by 108 lawyers when you look at who handles street crime. We used to 
have between 240 to 260 investigators -- now we're down to 185 or 190. So, even 
though I want to handle worker's compensation fraud, and environmental crime, 
and home-equity fraud scams and a whole variety of other crimes, if I am forced 
to prioritize, then I have to put the resources into violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases are being dismissed because the prosecutor walks into court and is told 
by the witness coordinator, "We don't have the witness." Cases are not being 
prepared the way they should, so a case that should take three or four days 
takes a week and a half. We're not getting, perhaps, the convictions we should. 
We're simply not being as successful. Ultimately, we are not able to maximize 
our effort in seeking justice and protection of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Three strikes, you're out" -- you opposed the law. What's the problem?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Let me emphasize that I am in favor of the concept of three strikes, you're 
out -- when it's properly focused toward violent, recidivist offenders. I was 
not in favor of the bill which passed because it isn't properly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of a bulls-eye target. The bull's eye is violent crime. The next ring 
out is what is defined as serious crime -- things like burglary. The subsequent 
rings are felonies of diminishing seriousness. This bill says for the third 
strike, it doesn't make any difference what part of the target you hit. That's 
just crazy. But we will do it. This is now the law, and we will enforce the 
law.  
</P>
<P>
 The other problem I have is that it's misleading. The governor and the 
Legislature, by passing this law, are saying, "The fear of random, violent 
crime that you feel every day is now taken care of, because we're going to put 
these bad guys away." Wrong. Unless part of the overall package involves early 
intervention and crime prevention, putting these people in prison will not 
reduce our fear. Because violent crime will continue, unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Public defenders up and down the state are saying they're not 
plea-bargaining anyone now that the law is in effect. Is that just 
defense-lawyer posturing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Part of it is. But it goes to another reason I opposed this bill -- the 
cost. Forget about all the new state prisons we'll have to build, and just look 
at the costs of trying cases. Public defenders will decline to accept 
plea-bargains on the second strike, or even the first. So we are now going to 
have many more jury trials. On one hand, I'm happy about that, because we might 
get better sentences as a result of going to trial. On the other hand, we don't 
have the lawyers and investigators to handle our current case load, and now 
we're going to have to substantially increase that load.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's move to gun control. In this town, weapons are available day or 
night, and used with great frequency. If you could mandate a solution, what 
would it be?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We know that the police are stopping citizens and finding weapons. These 
people should be arrested. But because of what's happening in our society, the 
police turn away and tell the individual to make sure they know how to use the 
gun. I'm personally in favor of banning assault weapons -- I see no reason why 
any citizen should own one. I don't believe there is any acceptable way of 
going beyond that now, except perhaps licensing weapons -- much like a driver's 
test. Before you take possession of the gun, you should have to prove you know 
how to use it.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are many who believe there is a direct correlation between guns and 
drugs -- that drugs are at the root of the epidemic of violence. Is it time to 
rethink the prohibition against drugs? Do we need to look at it as more of a 
social problem and less of a law-enforcement problem?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, and no. To the extent that all we do is prosecute people involved in 
drugs, put them in prison and wait for them to come out, yes -- that has to 
change. I support the idea of drug courts. It's much more productive for 
society if we take a person who is drug-dependent and get them off drugs. That 
may mean a structured program rather than prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But I do not, and cannot, agree that we should legalize drugs. The first 
question I always ask is, which drugs should be legal? Cocaine? What about rock 
cocaine? Have you ever seen what rock cocaine does to people? It's extremely 
addictive. It tears apart individuals and families. Heroin? Are we going to 
legalize that. Most people say, "Oh no, not that one!" 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Besides drugs, what else accounts for the remarkable viciousness that we 
see?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Alcohol is still probably a bigger problem than any of the hard drugs. But 
there are other issues. We still seem to be willing to put the guards in the 
prisons to watch over the violent criminals, but we don't seem to be willing 
yet to zero in on that young woman who dropped out of school and is about to 
have a child who is at risk before his or her conception. Even once the child 
is conceived we don't help that young mother and her child. When that youngster 
is born, we already know he or she has a better than average chance of dropping 
out of school. And when you also know that 82% of all the people in prison 
throughout this country are dropouts, it should give you an idea of the 
importance of keeping people in school. We don't make the concerted effort 
early on. We wait for them to commit several criminal acts before we pay any 
attention to them. 
</P>
<P>
 We have so many youngsters who have no hope -- none. That's why your life and 
mine are worthless to them. It's because their life is also worthless to them. 
They don't believe they are going to be around much longer. This is an accepted 
attitude all throughout the Latino and the African-American gangs right now. We 
have to give them some hope. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to also -- and this is perhaps my most difficult personal challenge -- 
establish the credibility of the criminal-justice system. Not just in the 
Latino and African-American communities, but throughout the city. There's a 
loss of faith in the system. So we have to be fair, we have to be thorough. If 
we can't do that, it's not going to get better.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been critical of the juvenile-justice system -- what reforms do we 
need in dealing with underage offenders?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We need more ability to protect the community from serious juvenile 
offenders. Right now, if a juvenile is 15 years old and kills 10 people, that 
person gets out of jail at age 25. I can't tell you that your family, or 
anyone's family will be protected when he gets out. So on the one hand I want 
to extend the period of time we can incarcerate such an individual -- as a 
juvenile or an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 I also want people in the neighborhood to know who the violent and criminal 
juveniles might be. Right now, everything is confidential in juvenile court. If 
someone is charged with rape, with murder, with assault with a deadly weapon, 
citizens have a right to know that. That's so we can protect ourselves, but it 
also puts pressure on the family to do their job as parents. 
</P>
<P>
 When you look at this whole picture of violence the only way to address it is 
in a very comprehensive way. It begins with juvenile justice. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also what I call cycles of violence. We are filing one domestic 
homicide case every nine days! Remember, nearly every person on death row grew 
up in a family with domestic violence or child abuse. That's why we have 
targeted domestic violence as an absolute priority. 
</P>
<P>
 And that includes child support. We have today over 565,000 active 
child-support cases my office is currently handling -- that's over a million 
kids in Los Angeles. That's crime prevention, because when those kids don't get 
court-ordered family support, those are the kids who drop out of school, the 
ones we begin to see in court. We have to reach them before they get there.

VALLEY BRIEFING: SAN FERNANDO; A TINY TOWN WITH LOTS OF CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most historic locations in the Valley, the city of San Fernando has 
changed a lot since its days as a railroad boom town, when lots sold for $150 
each. Yet despite being surrounded entirely by Los Angeles, San Fernando has 
managed to retain the feel of a small town: The city's outdoor shopping 
district, is an virtual anomaly in the mall-crazy Valley. And the rustic flavor 
of its politics -- in which candidates for city office rely on friends and 
relatives rather than paid consultants -- also separates it from its gargantuan 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando is not without its own big city-like problems, however. Gangs and 
grafitti, and the January firing of parks director Jess Margarito for alleged 
misuse of his office have blemished the city's once-pristine reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although San Fernando has always had a sizable Latino population, there has 
been a major population shift in the past decade, with a 35% drop in the white 
population and a 53% rise in the number of Latinos. Since 1986, the five-member 
City Council has had a Latino majority, mirroring its changing face. History 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Like the Valley itself, the name for the city comes from the San 
Fernando Mission in nearby Mission Hills, founded on September 8, 1797, with 
Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen in charge. Named Mision San Fernando Rey de 
Espana in honor of Ferdinand III, King of Castille and Leon in the 1200s, the 
mission was the Valley's social and economic center of activity until its 
secularization in the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning: San Fernando was established Sept. 15, 1874, when Charles 
Maclay -- who with George K. Porter had purchased the entire northeast Valley 
months earlier -- submitted a township map to the Los Angeles County recorder. 
With help from the Southern Pacific Railroad, which completed a rail line 
through the new town the same year, Maclay's plans to create a town came true. 
And when the railroad completed its northward movement, linking Los Angeles and 
San Fernando to the rest of the nation, the city continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth: With growth came plans for incorporation, and on August 31, 1911, San 
Fernando became the second incorporated city in the Valley (Burbank was the 
first several months earlier). Yet unlike many nearby communities following the 
completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, San Fernando had its own supply 
of well water and thus did not succumb to annexation to Los Angeles. Community 
Issues 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding: Rebuilding after the Northridge earthquake is the main issue in 
San Fernando. The little city suffered $31.5 million in property damage, 
including potentially crippling blows to 63 buildings -- the San Fernando 
Superior Courthouse among them -- and serious damage to 835 others. Luckily, 
the conservatively managed city had money in its coffers, and should be able to 
get by on budget reserves, according to City Administrator Mary Strenn. The 
effect on San Fernando businesses, however, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipeline: The controversy surrounding the Four Corners oil pipeline, which 
ruptured in eight places during the Northridge earthquake -- including a 
fracture that fueled a large fire beside O'Melveny Elementary School -- has 
become the most high-profile issue in the campaign for the upcoming April 12 
City Council election. A complex jurisdictional nightmare, the pipeline has 
puzzled the city's officials, all of whom want the pipeline out, but are 
uncertain what they can do to have it removed or rerouted. Community Profile
