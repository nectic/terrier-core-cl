FROM DINOPHOBIA TO GYNEPHOBIA; MICHAEL CRICHTON'S LATEST NOVEL TAKES A NEW

<TEXT>
<P>
 The decline of American manhood can be traced from a daffy heavyweight 
champion named Leon Spinks, who snuggled up with a lady of the night and awoke 
the next morning to discover that she had stolen his false teeth. Since then, 
of course, things far dearer to men than dentures have become targets in the 
war between the sexes. (Take a bow, John Wayne Bobbitt.) But not until the 
publication of Michael Crichton's "Disclosure" has it been so obvious that the 
women's movement possesses the power to turn an admirable male mind to 
guacamole. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Crichton has apparently convinced himself that testosterone is out of 
fashion, his latest bid for the bestseller list is filled to overflowing with 
men who are whining, conniving, backpedaling paranoids. Even his hero is a 
coward and a hypocrite, a self-deluded lunkhead who thinks he is standing on 
principle when he is really just protecting an investment. So forget the 
propaganda about "Disclosure" being the big-issue novel that proves sexual 
harassment cuts both ways. In truth, it is nothing more than Crichton's 
unwitting confession that the modern woman plays too rough for him. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the message as soon as you meet Tom Sanders, the empty vessel in whom 
Crichton places his fear and anxiety. Tom's wife has the day off from her law 
practice, but she still wants him to feed their two children breakfast even 
though he's running late. She pouts, she flashes a little skin, she gets her 
way. Their 4-year-old daughter is just as willfully bitchy, goosing poor dad 
when he should be headed for the Seattle-based computer company where he's 
counting on being named a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is no relief for Tom when he finally escapes the harpies at home for 
the relative calm of takeovers and corporate treachery. From his company's 
plant in Texas comes a report that the women on the clean-up crew are demanding 
that the pin-ups in the men's locker room to be taken down. But that is nothing 
compared to the news from the plant in Malaysia, where the line foreman has 
gone into hiding because his cousin's sister put a curse on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Crichton has established women as the root of all evil -- no subtlety for 
him -- he drops the big one: The ever-suffering Tom gets passed over for the 
vice presidency in favor of Meredith Johnson, a scheming blond vixen who was 
his girl friend a decade ago. Meredith inspires the only good line in a book 
written with all the style and grace of a how-to manual. "I mean face it," the 
company's head of programming says, "she's got an outstanding molded case, with 
superior fit and finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Bless her hard heart, Meredith also has a libido in overdrive, albeit one she 
is using to advance her own devious cause. But Tom doesn't realize that until 
after she tries to rape him in a scene that would be howlingly funny if it 
didn't trivialize the ugliest crime there is short of murder. Meredith 
remembers Tom's preference for cold Chardonnay, she admires his "nice hard 
tush," she hints at hanky-panky on business trips, and she works them both into 
a sexual lather -- all before finishing her first day on the job. But Tom backs 
off because she coughs, and in his book, a cough in the heat of passion 
suggests a lack of sincerity. Fussy, fussy. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tom has gone from hot and bothered to cold and bewildered, he cries 
sexual harassment. He still finds himself in the company of strange females, 
though. The kindest adjective applied to his attorney is brisk, the mediator 
for his harassment case is an old bat in the making, one of his supporters at 
work is an intense geek and the other is a withdrawn geek. Damn, what kind of 
women has Michael Crichton been hanging around? 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever they are, they convinced him to check his brains at the door while 
writing "Disclosure," the brains that got him through Harvard Medical School 
and made him a big-name author with "The Andromeda Strain" and "Jurassic Park." 
There isn't a guy worth his hormones who doesn't know the type that must have 
driven Crichton around the bend. You say gingerbread man and they say it's 
gingerbread cookie , as if their nit-picking could possibly do anything but 
move you closer to that nincompoop Rush Limbaugh. Then you meet a woman who 
appreciates the joke when the eminent country philosopher Kinky Friedman sings 
"Get Your Biscuits in the Oven (And Your Buns in the Bed)," and your world is 
back in balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone should expect balance in a polemic masquerading as a novel, 
but you do expect Crichton to be smart. He isn't. Case in point: his bemoaning 
that long gone era when all you had to be to get promoted was good. He never 
pauses to note that men almost always got the promotions back then because 
other men were in charge. Even a guy who would think all kinds of politically 
incorrect thoughts if a woman got a job he wanted can figure that out. What he 
can't figure out is why so many women, after seeing how the business world can 
turn men into such prize asses, still want to be just like them.

FROM DINOPHOBIA TO GYNEPHOBIA; MICHAEL CRICHTON'S LATEST NOVEL TAKES A NEW 
ANGLE ON GENDER EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE.; DISCLOSURE, BY MICHAEL CRICHTON 
(ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24; 406 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 At last, at last it's been published, a dead-bang bestseller that puts the 
explosive social issue of sexual harassment between best-selling hardcovers, 
not in some incoherent government report destined for the recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the predatory, omnipotent, salacious boss, and here is the prey, the 
dependent employee afraid to say no or even yes to the boss's advances, for 
fear of losing job and family and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, wait, sorry. I skipped something. There's this asterisk. The gimmick. The 
switcheroo. 
</P>
<P>
 The predatory, omnipotent, salacious boss is Meredith Johnson, a woman with 
all the usual longs -- legs, hair, eyelashes -- and a few shorts, like temper 
and judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 And the employee is Tom Sanders, husband, father, corporate good guy at a 
computer firm, who, for several months many years ago, shared a bed and broke 
bread with Meredith, or in their case broke a bed and shared bread. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "Disclosure," Michael Crichton's gotcha novel, his sucker punch, his 
dodgem computer game of modern sex roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with its novel role-reversing, "Disclosure" lays out some classic 
elements of abuse of power. Realign the gender roles -- male boss, female 
employee -- and it's a textbook sexual harassment case. Problem is, no one 
reads textbooks -- they read novels, novels with engaging devices like this 
one. And no one pays $3.5 million to make a textbook into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Crichton says his case is based in truth. I have no doubt of it. Yet, as I 
would tell my journalism students when they were gloating over finding out, 
say, what make of car a public official drove . . . just because it's true 
doesn't make it significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment is wrong and illegal, women or men. Making the female 
predator the sexual harassment story -- as this one is bound to for a time, 
because Crichton is a powerhouse storyteller whose books make movies that make 
money -- is to elevate the simply true to the significant, the way the old 
man-bites-dog story of the journalism trade can obscure the 99% of the time 
that dogs bite men. 
</P>
<P>
 At worst, this book makes Crichton a kind of an emotional profiteer, cutting 
in a line that women have been waiting in for a very long time. (Think of 
native Americans' anger at New Agers co-opting their religious rituals, and 
charging fancy prices for them.) 
</P>
<P>
 It put me in mind of "Good Morning, Merry Sunshine," columnist Bob Greene's 
1984 diary of new fatherhood, extolling its sentimental wonders. He waxed 
lyrical over his child's tiny garments even as he disdained the chores of 
diapers and spit-up that he marvels that women have performed for eons -- and 
without the rewards of a bestseller congratulating themselves on it, his 
critics noted acidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Crichton bulletproofs himself against that. He opens "Disclosure" quoting the 
Civil Rights Act and publisher Katharine Graham -- "Power is neither male nor 
female" -- and ends with a disclaimer that "Disclosure" is "not intended to 
deny the fact that the great majority of harassment claims are brought by women 
against men . . . the advantage of a role-reversal story is that it may enable 
us to examine aspects concealed by traditional responses and conventional 
rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he has his beefcake/cheesecake and eats it too. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't immunize him from preposterous devices. My favorite was when 
Meredith comes to work in high heels and suit but no stockings, because, she 
explains to Tom, it's "so much cooler on a hot day." In Seattle? I've read 
nothing so silly since a scene in a screenplay described a woman frying bacon 
naked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disclosure" is populated with a large cast of cartoons: Tom's wife, the 
lawyer with a housekeeper who complains until Tom says she is "about as 
oppressed as Leona Helmsley," and she, cartoonishly, responds, "This is because 
a woman got your job, isn't it?" Everyone will enjoy loathing the 
hellbent-for-Pulitzer femi-columnist and the smarmy PC male lawyer whose finger 
is "chapped from wetting it and holding it to the wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Crichton is no slouch himself when it comes to reading the breezes. In "Rising 
Sun," he jacked up a murder novel into a debate on the flaws of American 
business and the venal triumphs of the Japanese. "Disclosure" takes a high-tech 
computer company merger-massacre and ornaments it like a Christmas tree with 
hot-button sexual politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheat is that yes, Meredith is a nympho-braniac and a serial harasser, but 
her semi-rape of Tom is also a calculated squeeze play to cut him from the 
DigiCom herd and out of a multimillion-dollar windfall. No one has such grand 
designs in mind when he feels up a $7-an-hour typist. 
</P>
<P>
 The "men are people too" stuff is laid on a tad thick. Tom orders the foreman 
at one plant to get the girlie pinups out of the men's locker room, even if the 
women have photo hunks in their locker room. And, after his awful encounter, he 
echoes the female rape victim's concern "that it was all his fault, that he had 
misled (her) in some important way." 
</P>
<P>
 God knows we need to talk about these matters, from acquaintance rape and the 
plaint that "pale males eat it again" to corporate genetics; when Tom whines 
about Meredith's unfair advantage in having plastic surgery to look like the 
boss's dead daughter (another absurd moment), he is reminded that he, too, 
performed to please the boss, from playing golf to guzzling beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disclosure" is a thin forum for such heavy debate, but apart from 
Oprahvision, in this country, movie-fiction is, dismally, all we've got. 
</P>
<P>
 All the more reason for Crichton to play it straight. The test is, will 
"Disclosure" be celebrated for its admonitions and its questions, or for its 
sensational Rush Limbaugh fodder? Do I really think I need to answer that 
question? 
</P>
<P>
 "Disclosure" is also available in a large print edition and on audio cassette, 
read by John Lithgow, from Random House Audio (4 hours, abridged; $22.50).

COMING UP TO OXBRIDGE; THE STRUGGLE OVER WORDS; LOOKING FOR CLASS: SEEKING 
WISDOM AND ROMANCE AT OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE, BY BRUCE FEILER RANDOM HOUSE: $23; 
330 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stephen Galloway, Stephen Galloway, a Los Angeles-based writer, graduated 
from Cambridge in 1981. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This place (Cambridge) is the Devil, or at least his principal residence; they 
call it a University, but any other appellation would have suited it much 
better, for Study is the last pursuit of the Society. . . . I have only supped 
at home three times since my arrival, and my table is constantly covered with 
invitations.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Lord Byron. Letter, 1805 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I saw Cambridge, I was 17 years old. A friend and I had driven 
across England to visit the medieval town and parked outside the colonnades of 
Trinity College, one of the two dozen semi-independent units that make up the 
university. As I walked through the gilded courtyard -- the largest in Europe 
-- its simple sandstone buildings seemed to sweep away from me, down to a 
silvery river where gondola-like punts floated past ivy-covered walls, under 
Gothic bridges and on to a future that I could only imagine. I knew at that 
point there was nowhere in the world I wanted to be as much as Cambridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now in my dreams, 12 years since I last saw the city, it still haunts me. 
Vistas that I try futilely to recreate in my waking mind will suddenly appear 
in all their age-worn detail, and friends whose faces have become mere blurs 
will re-emerge, laughing and talking and drinking and smoking as exuberantly as 
they did then. In those dreams, the city is as alive and vibrant as it was 
every day of the three years I eventually came to spend there. 
</P>
<P>
 It was painful for me, given these memories, to read Bruce Feiler's very 
different view of Cambridge. (Oxford, which figures in the title of his book, 
plays only a minor role here.) As much as I loved the university, he dislikes 
it; as utterly as I was at ease there, he appears to have felt out-of-place. 
And yet the striking thing about his book, for all its divergence of opinion 
from my own, is how completely recognizable the world he describes is, and how 
vividly he makes it spring to life before us. 
</P>
<P>
 Feiler, a graduate of Yale in his 20s, spent a year at Cambridge preparing a 
master's degree in international relations. He had already lived and taught in 
Japan for several years (an account he engagingly presents in "Learning to Bow: 
Inside the Heart of Japan"), and there are times when one feels he both liked 
and understood that country better. One problem, strangely enough, was the 
language. He amusingly describes landing at Heathrow airport at the beginning 
of his stay and being tempted to fly to Paris instead. "At least there," he 
notes, "I could speak the language." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed language, that common tongue that divides England from America, 
sometimes emerges as the critical barrier between Feiler and the strange old 
world he encounters. It's not just a question of vocabulary (his rooms, when he 
arrives, turn out to be a mere room; academic terms have names like Michaelmas 
and Lent; and flirting goes by the bizarre appellation sharking ); it's the 
very spirit behind the words. In a telephone interview before reaching 
Cambridge, he recounts his shock when an interviewer criticizes a "blemish" on 
his record -- his having had only a B+ in French at Yale. To any English ear, 
the ironic teasing of this comment is only too apparent. But not to Feiler. 
</P>
<P>
 Such trans-Atlantic differences dominate the book. "For an American, living in 
Britain is often like living in a time warp," Feiler notes. "A variety of 
elements contribute to this feeling. Telephones have numbers that range from 
five to seven digits and receivers that weigh from three to five pounds. Rooms 
have light bulbs that are 60 watts too low and electrical outlets that have 
varying configurations of holes so (that) household appliances are always sold 
with no plugs attached. Even the air is congested with a postnasal drip that 
impedes the passage of time. But nothing contributes more to this sense of 
delay than the national obsession with conversations, which proceed slowly and 
surely around the country every day with a passion for language, a zest for 
altercation, and the occasional whiff of old-fashioned snobbery." 
</P>
<P>
 A passion for language. A zest for altercation. There, more than anything 
else, lies the glory of Cambridge and the aspect I miss the most about it: the 
cut-and-thrust of ideas, the struggle over words. And it is surprising that 
Feiler, with his generous curiosity about other cultures, doesn't care for 
these. Perhaps it is his (to a European) very American sense of pragmatism that 
rejects such airy discussions as pointless; perhaps, too, it is his awareness 
of the snobbery that occasionally lies behind such verbal duels. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambridge is a curious place -- a mixture of the intellectually lofty and the 
most dreadfully petty; an ivory tower that can be the most wonderful crucible 
of ideas and also quite removed from the "real" world; the most romantic city 
on earth and, at the same time, one in which romance can sometimes appear 
squalid. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this, most of all, that seems to bother Feiler. Oxford and Cambridge are 
"probably the two most concentrated centers for decadence anywhere in the 
country," he writes, and "Cambridge today is a sexual melting pot where the 
inexperienced meet the idealistic, the promiscuous meet the repressed, and 
where classical Aristotelian notions of love meet modern sexual perversions of 
a type of which Jane Austen never dreamed. It is, in short, a laboratory of 
love." It is; but is that so very bad? 
</P>
<P>
 And Feiler is not above indulging in a little love himself. Indeed, the most 
humorous parts of his book center on his search for a relationship, as he comes 
close to being involved with an appealing neighbor, falls for a Rhodes scholar 
from Oxford (only to be abandoned for his lack of originality) and at the last 
minute finds a date who transforms the May Ball that concludes his academic 
stay (May Balls, with typical Oxbridge obfuscation, actually take place in 
June) into a night of enchantment and romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Feiler's most serious critique centers on the source of Oxford and Cambridge's 
fame, their level of education. For places that nurtured, among others, John 
Milton, Isaac Newton, Stephen Hawking and the current President of the United 
States, that is quite an indictment. Education in both universities is based on 
the in-depth study of one subject and this centers on a weekly "supervision" or 
"tutorial" in which a student meets alone, or with one other student, with his 
professor to present a paper and prepare his work for the week ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Feiler is outraged by this system. "The myth in Cambridge is that students 
participate equally in their one-on-one tuition," he writes. "The reality is 
that only one side usually gets to speak. Exceptions to this formula are so 
rare that when a student does speak up in class and breaks down the invisible 
barrier, the incident becomes, in an academic sort of way, exciting." How 
vastly we differ. Of all the things I remember best about Cambridge, it is 
these private sessions, passionate discussions that would often continue for 
hours, sometimes well into the night. In retrospect, I marvel at the tolerance 
most of my tutors showed for the simplistic and under-informed ideas of their 
pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambridge is, in truth, two places: the city of spires and dreams and the 
quest for knowledge -- the one that I've looked back on with so much love for 
the past several years -- and the stultifying remnant of a monastic, 
class-bound life that was the essence of the university when it was founded in 
1209. Feiler's perspective is to stress the latter; and yet, with all his 
conviction, he never managed to make me forget the former.

RICHARD EDER: THE RIOT THAT FOUND ITS THRENODY; THE BREAD OF TIME: TOWARD AN 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, BY PHILIP LEVINE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $23; 296 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't understand. I don't understand," Federico Garcia Lorca exclaimed when 
he arrived in New York. Out of the bewildered encounter between the finely 
surreal singer of slain gypsies and flowers that bleed, and Manhattan's stink 
and clangor, came "Poet in New York." A poet can write out of any state of 
spirit as long as he trusts it. Lorca trusted his dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 And he taught Philip Levine to trust his. Levine came to poetry in the course 
of a dozen years alternately spent studying and working in the hot-metal 
foundries of Detroit's auto industry. Illegitimate, not knowing who his father 
was, raised in near-poverty by a keen-spirited mother, he wore his blue collar 
with pride; particularly when he took a course from the languidly patrician 
Robert Lowell, whom he loathed. He also wore it with a sense of artistic 
constriction. Had he lived in the '30s, he might have settled into Socialist 
Realism. In the supremely disengaged '50s, his proletarian condition, leftist 
convictions and passion for the old Spanish Republic had no place to lodge. But 
there was more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
 After working the overnight shift at Chevrolet Gear & Axle, he would try to 
write, he tells us in one of these autobiographical essays. It didn't work. 
What stopped him was not weariness or unfashionability. It was his own 
sensibility. How could you write poetry about the gritty reality of America's 
working life? His rage was rhetoric-sized but he despised rhetoric. He loved 
Whitman, but there can be no other Whitman. He loved Keats, Stevens, William 
Carlos Williams and the fine, shining craft. 
</P>
<P>
 In this doubt, he tells us, he came upon "Poet in New York." Outrage shatters 
the sheer heaviness of things -- derricks, subways, office-buildings -- and the 
heaviness of outrage is lifted, in turn, by the childlike joyfulness of Lorca's 
imagery. "A wooden wind from the south," Levine quotes from a dockside passage, 
"slanting through the black mire/ spits on the broken boats and drives tacks 
into shoulders./ A south wind that carries/ tusks, sunflowers, alphabets,/ and 
a battery with drowned wasps." 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in poetry written in English had I found such a direct confrontation of 
one image with another or heard such violence held in abeyance and enclosed in 
so perfect a musical form," Levine writes. "What in my work had been chaotic 
rant was in his a stately threnody circling around a center of riot." It 
validated Levine's own rioting center; it told him that he might find a 
threnody of his own to circle it. It took years, he tells us. It was achieved 
-- though he doesn't tell us -- in his great collection "What Work Is," 
published two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces in "The Bread of Time" are a series of experiments in remembering 
rather than a whole organized act of memory. In suggesting the present 
simultaneity of discrete past images, Levine sometimes introduces bits that 
don't very clearly fit. He can strut his blue collar, as in his mockery of a 
young academic who "pranced before us reading some sprightly little paper for 
'Notes and Queries.' " He prefers bowling, he lets us know. 
</P>
<P>
 His wandering method works perfectly, though, in his portrait of his mother. 
She lived in Europe for a while, worked for years and in near-poverty in 
Detroit to raise her children and, when they were grown, skipped to California. 
Philip visits her when she is 80; she is sardonic and free. She shows an odd 
familiarity with the Italian poet Gabriele d'Annunzio -- Levine pauses to 
wonder if he could be his father -- and translates one of his poems for him. 
"It's a lot worse than it sounds," she assures him. "It loses a lot in the 
original." Truly, a poet's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 After sketching a mannered professor who taught him James Joyce at college, 
Levine touches upon various aspects of his own life and his growing sense of 
aging. Suddenly the professor is back, no longer caricatured but a contemporary 
in Levine's own autumnal process. The professor ends his course with Joyce's 
injunction that a reader should spend a lifetime reading what it took him, 
Joyce, a lifetime to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am that reader," Professor Prescott tells his departing students, "and I 
can tell you that it was a wasted life." 
</P>
<P>
 The three best pieces are about Levine's poetic mentors. He portrays John 
Berryman as a man stretched past his own long gawkiness in his passion to 
impart what poetry must be. His voice went so high that "it seemed that only a 
dog could hear it." His class was a battlefield; Berryman would tear the poems 
apart or praise them; either way, the students were goaded to make them better. 
"Levine, this will never do," still rings in the writer's ears, along with, 
"One must be ruthless with one's own writing or someone else will" and -- when 
one student turned in a magnificent sonnet -- "Say that better in 1,000 words 
and you're a genius." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's young passion for the Spanish Republic led him to spend a sabbatical, 
years later, in Barcelona. He evokes the mid-'60s when the Franco regime still 
oppressed, but with a shaky hand. There is a wonderful encounter with two 
members of the once-feared Guardia Civil taking refuge from the rain in a bar. 
One of them showed Levine a cork stuck in the muzzle of his carbine to keep the 
water out, and launched into a sardonic political skit: "This is what they have 
given me to defend the sacred shores of Spain from the communist fleet. I 
haven't a chance. The string on the cork is broken; one shot and I'm through." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of his sketch comes the shadowy figure of Antonio Machado, modern Spain's 
greatest poet. Levine takes Spanish lessons from a young poet; he in turn 
introduces his pupil to Machado's grave, seemingly plain and magically haunted 
work. It has all but defied translation. Levine's efforts to translate a poem, 
and his irritation over a set of translations by Robert Bly, produce a 
comically frank image of a poet's work and prickles. Finally there is a 
beautiful tribute -- virtually a prose poem -- to Machado's spiritual oneness 
with the gaunt landscape of Castille. Levine calls it "soul" and his writing 
strips the word of millennia of lofty and sentimental associations and delivers 
it plain. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the key word in his portrait of Ivor Winters. Freed from factory 
work by a fellowship to Stanford, Levine spent a year studying with the bristly 
and resolutely unfashionable poet and critic. In almost every respect they were 
opposites. Levine was young and new; Winters was old and even his 
contemporaries considered him a stylistic reactionary. Levine depicts a man 
whose passionate attachment to what he considered real poetry -- he insisted 
that an obscure Georgian poet, T. Sturge Moore, was superior to Yeats -- had 
isolated him both aesthetically and personally. Yet Levine manages to let us 
see what burned beneath the crust. Through long afternoons Winters read old 
French and Breton poetry to him, laying out imagery, metrics, etymology. In the 
passion for craft it recalled Berryman; and in another way it recalled Machado. 
"Philip," Winters told him once, "we must never lie or we shall lose our soul.

WOMEN AND CHILDREN LAST; NEXT TIME SHE'LL BE DEAD: BATTERING AND HOW TO STOP 
IT, BY ANN JONES (BEACON PRESS: $22; 288 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kim Wozencraft, Kim Wozencraft is the author of two novels, Rush, and most 
recently, Notes From the County Club, the story of a woman incarcerated in the 
psychiatric unit of a federal prison as she awaits trial for the murder of her 
abusive husband. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Count to 12. Another woman has just been beaten by her spouse or lover or ex. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Jones, author previously of "Women Who Kill," doesn't like the term 
domestic violence. In her new book, "Next Time She'll Be Dead: Battering and 
How to Stop It," she describes it as "one of those gray phrases, beloved of 
bureaucracy, designed to give people a way of talking about a topic with out 
seeing what's really going on." What atrocities have been obfuscated by the 
euphemism domestic violence ? Here are a few: assault, battery, rape, 
kidnaping, captivity. Torture and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 These offenses (except perhaps for rape), if committed on the streets by one 
man against another, or by a stranger upon a woman or child, in all likelihood 
would be vigorously prosecuted. But traditionally, a man's home is his castle, 
and what he does to his wife and children in the privacy of his own home is his 
own business. "Written by men for men," Jones tells us, "the law is designed to 
protect men from the power of the state and adjudicate conflicts between men, 
to preserve order in a society of men." Women and children first? Not when it 
comes to the right to live free from bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
 In media reports, should a case be so gruesome as to merit the attention of 
the Fourth Estate, women "experience battering. They suffer abuse. They undergo 
assault. Rarely in the authoritative literature does a man hit a woman: in the 
gut, for instance, or the face, with his fist, hard -- hard enough to split her 
lip, loosen her teeth, break her nose, lace her eyeball with a red web of 
ruptured veins -- hard enough to make the blood run down the page. In real life 
it happens all the time." The language of the reports themselves places blame 
for the attack on the victim, refusing even to acknowledge that there must have 
been someone on the scene to do the hitting, kicking, punching, spitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The "passive voice of the journalists" is but a reflection of another kind of 
passivity. The police stand idly by, often refusing to arrest when a man beats 
his wife or ex-wife, his girlfriend or ex-girlfriend. Even in localities that 
compel police officers to do so by enacting mandatory arrest laws, there are 
cops who will face disciplinary action rather than arrest a man who is beating 
up his wife. This sudden and highly unusual passivity on the part of the police 
is often reinforced by the courts, who will tell the bruised and battered woman 
standing before the bench asking for a restraining order to go home and try to 
work things out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some judges just don't like the idea of breaking up a family, even when 
husband is breaking his wife's bones. Jones tells us that " . . . more than 
half the women assaulted are injured, and at least 25% of them seek medical 
treatment. Ten percent of the injured visit hospital emergency rooms and many 
others visit private physicians to have their wounds dressed, their broken 
bones set, their injuries treated. . . . Of women requiring emergency surgery, 
one in five was battered, according to one study; one in two, according to 
another. Battering accounts for half of all cases of alcoholism in women. It 
accounts for half of all rapes of women over the age 30. . . . Battering is a 
cause of one-quarter of suicide attempts by all women, and one-half of suicide 
attempts by black women. And the Journal of the American Medical Assn. reports: 
'Approximately 37% of obstetric patients, across class, race and educational 
lines, are physically abused while pregnant.' Among the results: 'placental 
separation, antepartum hemorrhage, fetal fractures, rupture of the uterus, 
liver, or spleen, and pre-term labor.' Pre-term labor, of course, may mean 
spontaneous abortion or miscarriage." 
</P>
<P>
 The carnage Jones documents in "Next Time She'll Be Dead," and the lack of 
concern, not to mention assistance, on the part of those institutions that are 
supposedly in place to help battered women, are enough to make us lose hope. We 
learn that from 1967 to 1973, "battering men killed 17,500 women and children 
in the United States. To grasp the enormity of that figure consider that only a 
little more than twice as many men -- 39,000 to be exact -- were killed during 
the same period in combat in Vietnam. Thankfully the war in Vietnam ended, but 
the count of women injured and killed by men on the home front continues. In 
1991 more than 21,000 domestic assaults, rapes, and murders were reported to 
the police every week." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not simply a book of horrifying statistics. Jones introduces 
herself to us as the victim of an abusive, battering father. "My father was a 
drunk," she says, "a wife beater, and a child abuser. That's never the whole 
story of course, so he was also other things: a modestly successful 
businessman, a civic leader, a war hero, an athlete, a prize-winning angler, a 
churchgoer, a tenor, a patriot, a Republican, a baseball fan, a formidable 
player of gin rummy. And more important, a delightful and funny man. Of all my 
family, all now long gone, it's my father I miss." 
</P>
<P>
 Though her righteous anger at the "simplistic, regimented, confrontational, 
adversarial, and overly technical -- in a word, macho" nature of the law and at 
those who only pretend to enforce it is present in every sentence, Jones does 
not seem to be writing for vengeance or out of any man-hating impulse. What she 
deplores is something many men also abhor: male violence against women and 
children, and the inertia that has infected each and every institution that 
could possibly do something to reduce that violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Assumptions about the "typical" battered woman are many, fed to us by 
psychologists and sociologists trying to prove their theories or make quick 
money on a self-help book, and almost always wrong. All battered women are not 
passive. Most make multiple attempts to escape the men who are beating them; 
they continue to try to get away until they succeed or are killed by the men 
who "love" them to death. Jones draws an important distinction between 
passivity and powerlessness. "Powerlessness is a political condition, while 
passivity is a strategy adopted by the powerless to survive." Not all battered 
women lack jobs or education: Battering cuts a swath across socioeconomic 
lines. The sole characteristic battered women share is that they are women. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the batterers? Are they, as they and many psychologists claim, 
victims of their own lack of control? Willing, but unable to stop themselves? 
Jones tells us "it's vital to understand that battering is not a series of 
isolated blow-ups. It is a process of deliberate intimidation intended to 
coerce the victim to do the will of the victimizer. The batterer is not just 
losing his temper, not just suffering from stress, not just manifesting 
'insecurity.' . . . These are excuses for the violence. . . . Batterers can be 
perfectly agreeable, straightforward, or conciliatory to police officers, 
bosses, neighbors, co-workers, or friends when they think it's in their best 
interests. . . . No, the violent man is not out of control. He is a man at work 
on his own agenda, which is to train 'his' woman to be what he wants her to be, 
and only what he wants her to be, all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no set of psychological characteristics which predestines a woman 
to a life of being battered, and no set from which the "experts" might properly 
determine which boys will grow up to be batterers, what are we to make of all 
the male violence being heaped on women? Jones asks, "Could it be that battered 
women have some function, some role or social utility we haven't taken into 
account? . . . What are battered women for?" Battered women, she concludes, 
"are to sexism what the poor are to capitalism -- always with us. They are a 
source of cheap labor and sexual service to those with the power to buy and 
control them, a 'problem' for the righteous to lament, a topic to provide 
employment for academic researchers, a sponge to soak up the surplus violence 
of men, a conduit to carry off the political energy of other women who must 
care for them, an exemplum of what awaits all women who don't behave as 
prescribed, and a pariah group to amplify by contrast our good opinion of 
ourselves. And for all their social utility, they remain largely, and 
conveniently, invisible." 
</P>
<P>
 There are suggestions, in the final chapter, for reducing or even, ideally, 
ending the violence, for doing away with battered women not by ignoring their 
plight until the men who love them shoot them or stab them or bludgeon them to 
death, but by making changes in policy and in judgment that include new 
legislation, education of health care professionals, clergy, and teachers, and 
money for the shelter network. Print and broadcast journalists should lose the 
"sexist cliches," stop talking about the spurned lovers, fits of rage and 
despair. Look at it objectively. A man beat a woman. That's assault and 
battery. Arrest him and prosecute him and hope the court gives him jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look at our priorities. The Federal Bureau of Prisons admits that 95% 
of its prisoners are nonviolent. Get them into alternative punishment programs 
and make room for the men who are beating, maiming and killing women. Another 
good way to free up prison cells to make room for the violent would be to 
release the thousands of women who are currently locked up because the police 
and the courts and the doctors and the clergy left them, alone and terrified, 
to defend themselves against men who were trying to kill them.

COVER STORY: THE REINCARNATION OF EDITH ANN; LILY TOMLIN'S PROBLEM CHILD GOES 
IN SEARCH OF HERSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 She's cute. She's inquisitive. She's precocious. She lisps. She's honest. And 
she always says what's on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Ann is one of Lily Tomlin's most beloved creations and on her mind a lot 
these days, even though she won't perform the adorable little girl in concert 
any more. "You just reach a point," Tomlin, 54, says matter-of-factly. "You 
feel a little peculiar sitting up in the chair trying to be 5 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
 But Edith Ann lives, thanks to the magic of animation. And that's the 
truthhhhh . 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Ann is the star of two new ABC prime-time specials. The first, "Edith 
Ann -- A Few Pieces of the Puzzle," premieres Tuesday. The second, "Homeless Go 
Home," in which Edith befriends a bag lady, is scheduled to air later this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Tomlin provides the voice of Edith Ann. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pieces of the Puzzle" finds the precocious little girl, nicknamed "No Neck" 
by her schoolmates, feeling unloved and unwanted on her birthday. In fact, none 
of her family has remembered it. Her father, Dirk, an unemployed, recovering 
alcoholic, is off in his own dream world. Her mother, Anna, is busy with her 
job as an airport security guard. Her older sister Irene loves rock 'n' roll 
more than her anything else. And forget about Edith's baby brother, Vic. The 
two simply hate each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Edith Ann's school chums at Edgeville Elementary are bugging her. Only 
after having a heart-to-heart talk with her school psychologist, Dr. Maria 
Lopez, does Edith Ann fit together "a few pieces of the puzzle" of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipping on a soda at a Los Feliz restaurant, the Tony-, Emmy- and Grammy 
Award-winning actress explains that she and her longtime collaborator, 
writer-director Jane Wagner ("The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the 
Universe"), first came up with the idea of animating Edith Ann about 15 years 
ago. Wagner even wrote a treatment, but the two didn't seriously pursue selling 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The first artist to animate Edith Ann was Tomlin's friend, the late Richard 
Amsel. "He was a big Edith fan and he was also a Disney fan. He could draw, but 
he couldn't animate so he taught himself how to animate. He did about a minute 
and half of Edith and he filmed me first on 8 millimeter," Tomlin recalls. "It 
was just so adorable. I don't know where that film is. It was real appealing. 
It was just in her little voice." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, after Tomlin and Wagner received a letter from an executive 
at Hanna-Barbera, they became serious about the Edith Ann project. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so enthusiastic," Tomlin says. "He persuaded us to come and take a 
meeting. We spent like six months talking to him about whether or not to 
animate Edith ..." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the concepts was quite right, so Tomlin and Wagner started going to 
animation festivals. "For a while we wanted to do it in model animation like 
'The Nightmare Before Christmas.' At one point, we built Edith's house and a 
lot of models. We built them in our garage and we hired some animators, some 
very good people. None of this really worked out the way we wanted it," Tomlin 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a year ago, when they met Hollywood-based animators Arlene Klasky and 
Gabor Csupo, who previously worked on "The Simpsons," and the animated 
"Rugrats," the popular Nickelodeon cartoon. "We felt really good about them and 
we made a partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert immediately gave the go-ahead for the 
project after meeting with Tomlin and Wagner. "He loved the scripts and just 
went for them like that. I don't know what his exact words were, but he said, 
'I don't want to rush this because I think this could be something terrific,' " 
Tomlin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin and Wagner were very involved in the production, even collaborating 
with character-design artists to not only bring Edith Ann to life but also to 
help realize the characters Edith talked about in her monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just started drawing different styles," Tomlin says. "You kind of tell 
them what you liked and what you didn't. We already knew how Edith had to look. 
She's not stylized in some extreme way and she vaguely resembles me doing 
Edith." 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. Klasky-Csupo studied Tomlin doing Edith Ann more than 20 
years ago on "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the family dog, Hug the Pug, went through various permutations. "I 
actually went to a photo session at Greg Gorman's studio," Tomlin recalls. "He 
had a little French bulldog. I think that's what they are called. I took a 
Polaroid of the dog and took it back to one of the character designers. He 
started modifying the dog because I liked the way the dog looked so much." 
</P>
<P>
 The animators also subtly wove real photographs into the animation. "Because 
it's all about Edith's emotional life, you really want people to get involved, 
get caught up in it and really believe in everything she's feeling and going 
through," Tomlin explains. "I think it's really an effective thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The photos inject a touch of reality. "I don't think the average viewer will 
even notice it immediately," Tomlin says. "I think it's affecting in some way. 
Sometimes, the sky is real and there are textures that are real that have been 
scanned into the computer. If you look at the table top in the kitchen, it's 
like a Formica table top. It has real depth to it, but it is elusive. The 
cartoon of milk is real and sometimes it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin is thrilled with the end result. "It's all the things we would want 
something to be," she enthuses. "We wanted it to be funny. We wanted it to be 
instructive and inspiring. We want it to be entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 And now Tomlin and Wagner hope it will become a weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are primed for that," Tomlin says. "That's what we've worked for." 
</P>
<P>
 "Edith Ann -- A Few Pieces of the Puzzle" airs Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.

TRUST ME ON THIS; NO HAPPY ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Mark I. Pinsky is a Times staff writer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old, academic history of an obscure 19th-Century uprising might not 
spring to mind as the ideal traveling companion. But I have found that in a 
decade of annual visits to Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, each accompanied by a 
different book about the Maya and their ancient civilization, nothing has 
affected me as indelibly as Nelson Reed's "The Caste War of Yucatan" (Stanford 
University Press). And, as with the best travel guides, I strongly suspect that 
an armchair traveler would be equally impressed, especially in light of the 
recent armed uprising of Maya peasants in neighboring Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's account is admittedly a bloody Baedeker. "There should be enough 
battles in this book for anyone's taste," Reed notes whimsically in the 
introduction, "but readers must be warned that the shooting doesn't start until 
Chapter 3." 
</P>
<P>
 In January of 1847, the Maya rose against their European masters, called 
Creoles, in a six-day eruption of urban warfare and mob violence that rivaled 
in its savagery the worst of the French revolution's Reign of Terror. The 
incident, in the city of Valladolid, sparked a revolt known as "The War of 
Castes" that lasted 65 years and cost more than 200,000 lives. Barely mentioned 
in Yucatan's tourist literature or development brochures -- or even Mexican 
textbooks, which consider it a minor sideshow to the nation's history -- this 
story can easily escape even a regular visitor to the peninsula's ruins and 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 With Reed's book in hand, I saw many of the ruins and cities I thought I knew 
well in a profoundly different, sometimes disturbing, light. But the darker 
prism of "The Caste War" only deepens a traveler's appreciation, providing 
unexpected insight into the psyche of the enigmatic Maya and their modern 
descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have consumed Reed's work -- and "consume" is the way most describe 
their reading experience -- it is impossible to view the modern Maya is 
precisely the same way. This is especially true for me on those not infrequent 
occasions when an Maya slips from a jungle trail on the road, machete slung on 
his belt, from some back-country, slash-and-burn rancho in the interior. For 
this history is more than just a picturesque background: His grandfather might 
have fought in a rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
 Yucatan's three preeminent cities -- Valladolid, Merida and Campeche -- had 
for years after Mexican independence from Spain in 1821 been jockeying for 
power. In internecine skirmishes, the cities' Creole elites fought each other 
and, in various combinations, the central government in Mexico City. Weary of 
doing the battling themselves, the Europeans raised militias from local Maya, 
over whom they claimed lordship, treating the Mayas as slaves, serfs and, 
finally, as cannon fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 After one skirmish between rival municipal militias, a company of Maya 
soldiers marched on Valladolid, flushed with success. In the city, which banned 
both Mayas and mixed bloods from its center, the Maya began to celebrate with 
the local brew, aguardiente, and then ran amok, massacring the local Creoles 
and hacking to death their own light-skinned officers. The battle cry of the 
warriors in breechclout, echoing Paris' sans-culottes, was: "Kill everyone in 
trousers!" 
</P>
<P>
 Several months after the Valladolid rising, a full-fledged rebellion exploded 
in the nearby town of Tepich. It was an epic struggle -- at one point in the 
war the rebels had captured nearly the entire peninsula, to the gates of Merida 
and Campeche in the west. But with total victory in sight, they decided it was 
time to go home to plant maize. Even after several military and political 
disasters and numerous plots and betrayals led to their ultimate "pacification" 
around 1910, the rebels managed to hang on to Yucatan's Caribbean coastal 
jungle -- much of what became the unassimilated Mexican state of Quintana Roo. 
</P>
<P>
 For modern travelers to the area, most of whom are drawn to ancient Maya ruins 
like those of Chichen Itza and Tulum, touring with "The Caste War" in hand adds 
another dimension. Even a favorite tourist haunt like Isla Mujeres, the sleepy 
village off the coast of Cancun, was settled by descendants of frightened 
Creoles who fled their haciendas on the mainland during the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 The chill I have experienced on visits to Chichen Itza I long supposed was due 
to all the blood in the ground at the spiritual center, which I always took to 
be ritual, symbolic and ancient: Here, more than a thousand years ago, Maya 
priests ripped the still beating hearts from captives atop pyramids, and threw 
bejeweled young people into the sacred cenote. But these were not the only 
sacrifices. During the Caste War, hundreds of Mexican prisoners were massacred 
by rebels beneath the stone arch of the nearby hacienda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caste War rebels became masterful guerrillas, early practitioners of 
biological warfare and superb tacticians. They poisoned wells in abandoned 
villages in the path of their advancing enemies by tossing in clothes from dead 
cholera victims; dipped thorn bush branches in the decaying bodies of foxes and 
left them for the barefoot Creole soldiers; dug concealed pits above sharpened 
stakes; and learned to advance before gunfire by lying on their backs and 
rolling large stones with their feet toward the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 On a larger scale, the rebels exploited differences among their white 
opponents -- including Yucatan's inter-city rivalries -- and took advantage of 
geopolitical events that distracted the attention of the central government: 
the Mexican-American War; Napoleon III's invasion of Mexico; and Mexican 
designs on neighboring British Honduras, now Belize. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also American military involvement, almost all of it opposed to the 
Maya rebels, in the persons of freebooting veterans of the Mexican and Civil 
War. When the Caste War capital of Chan Santa Cruz fell to the Mexican 
government in 1901, Edward Thompson, the American consul to Yucatan, wrote to 
his superior, an assistant secretary of state: "The reconquering of this 
territory is of importance to the United States for it means the opening of 
large tracts of land containing mahogany, cedar logwood and sapote. It has been 
a tantalizing proposition to many Americans, but until now the obstacles have 
been hard to surmount. Those obstacles will soon not exist." Sure enough, two 
years later J. Pierpont Morgan, Cyrus McCormick and the Deering brothers formed 
International Harvester, and before long the cordage of Yucatan's sisal crop 
was controlled by the "Twine Trust." 
</P>
<P>
 In light of this history, I wonder how that Mayan standing by the side of the 
jungle road, machete in his belt, sees me. Am I equally the heir of the 
American soldiers of fortune and economic imperialists, as he is the heir of 
heroic rebels? Does he see me as just the latest in a long line of Yankee 
visitors to the neighborhood who have come to loot archeological sites, exploit 
natural resources, "save" souls, subvert the government or administer 
well-meaning but ineffectual aid programs? 
</P>
<P>
 It is tempting to distance myself from this legacy by simply romanticizing the 
Caste War, simplifying the struggle and elevating the rebels to Spartacus 
status. Walking the crumbling walls of Tulum, an ancient Maya city overlooking 
the Caribbean Sea, lolling on its sheltered beach, climbing the temple that 
faces the sea -- from which two lights marked the passage through the reef to 
ocean-going canoes -- I think of the beleaguered Mayan rebels in the final 
stages of their revolt, defending the last pockets of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Caste War" was published in 1964 by Stanford University Press, and has 
sold steadily since then. In the U.S., it is used as the standard college text 
on the war. There have been eight Spanish language editions published in 
Mexico, where it is also still considered the definitive work, although one 
reviewer in Merida charged the book was "anti-white," Reed told me in a 
telephone interview from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, a twice-wounded veteran of Gen. George Patton's Third Army and winner of 
the Bronze Star in World War II, wandered into Yucatan in 1948 while on summer 
vacation from Washington University. It was in the town of Bacalar, he wrote in 
the forward, that he was inspired to write what has become the classic work on 
the subject. 
</P>

 "I was surprised to find the overgrown ruins of a Spanish colonial town, 
including a church and moated fortress picturesquely situated on a hill above a 
lake," he wrote. "A few people lived there, and a missionary priest had 
partially repaired the church, but street after street of roofless buildings 
stood as evidence of its past. In answer to my questions, I was told that the 
place had been destroyed by Indians in something called the War of the Castes."

 At the time, Reed was at a crossroad in his life, studying painting before he 
was expected to join the family business in St. Louis. Captivated by the 
history he stumbled across, he began 15 years of research into the Maya 
uprising. He taught himself Spanish, haunted archives in Mexico and Belize and 
traveled by bus, mule and canoe to interview survivors of the rebellion and 
their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 After writing "The Caste War," Reed spent the next 25 years with Reed Oil 
Rubber Co. He also worked on a number of archeological digs in the United 
States and, as a part-time research associate at Washington University, 
lectured to college classes. He retired from the family firm in 1991, a year 
after publishing "Family Papers," a study of his colonial Virginia forebears. 
Now, at 67, he is at work on a novel based on the life of Gonzalo Guerrero, a 
shipwrecked 16th-Century Spaniard who became a Mayan chief famed for battling 
invading Conquistadors on the Yucatan coast. 
</P>
<P>
 About seven years ago, Reed made his last visit to Yucatan, invited by the 
governor of Quintana Roo State to a conference on the Caste War held in the 
capital of Chetumal. During the conference, Reed said, incendiary pamphlets in 
the Maya language were slipped under hotel room doors by local communists, who 
claimed kinship with the Caste War rebels, appropriating it as part of their 
own revolutionary legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not those communist guerrillas were the rightful standard-bearers 
of the Caste War rebels is debatable, but what is certain is that the old 
revolutionary spirit has not been extinguished in Yucatan. In the villages of 
the interior, the Maya have been left to govern their own day-to-days lives. 
Over the past decade, the Maya's insurgency has been most broadly manifested by 
electoral opposition to Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
known by its Spanish initials as the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 This is in marked contrast to the Maya peasants of Chiapas, about 1,000 of 
whom mounted an armed insurgency on New Year's Day, which cost more than 100 
lives, but not before seizing and occupying eight cities and town before it was 
crushed by the Mexican army. As recently as December, the Maya of Yucatan 
demonstrated in large numbers in Merida, protesting what they said was the 
PRI's widespread fraud at the polls during recent state elections: The heirs of 
their Creole masters had triumphed again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caste War combined the worst aspects of race, class and communal 
struggles. With barbarism on both sides, quarter was rarely asked and rarely 
given. In its set-piece battles, with artillery used by both sides and 
village-by-village campaigns decided by machete, the war was reminiscent of 
better-known, late 18th-Century peasant uprisings. In its brutality, the Caste 
War rivaled 20th-Century European civil wars in Spain, Greece and the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a human tragedy, of course, for everyone involved," Reed said. "There 
was no happy ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Trust Me on This is an occasional feature in which writers make a case for 
that forgotten, obscure or unsung book that they put in everyone's hands with 
the words: "Read this. You'll love it. Trust me on this." "The Caste War of 
Yucatan" is available in paperback from Stanford University Press.

NO ART TO MURDER

<P>
 So Wendy Lesser would have us believe that we view true-life murders as artful 
theater and any given murderer as "the lead actor in a tragedy" ("Homicidal 
Tendencies," Dec. 12). I don't think so.Lesser is glorifying these acts of 
cowardly violence, thrusting the scum who perpetrate them into the limelight 
while the victims become only nameless, faceless statistics. This is not a 
science project we're talking about here; it's coldblooded murder.

 It is almost five years since I lost my companion to a murderer. It's 
revolting to think that someone like Lesser would have been entertained by the 
evening-news footage of the police carrying him away in a body bag. Or that her 
unappeasable curiosity would have led her to devour the unfair and distorted 
newspaper articles devoted to his brutal killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder is neither mysterious nor fascinating -- nor something that can be 
admired for its curious craft by any compassionate human being.

PURVEYORS OF HATE

<TEXT>

 Why don't society and its media have the collective nerve to look at other 
"hate groups" in our community with the same harsh and critically analytical 
light used to inspect the groups dealt with in your article ("Marketing Hate," 
by Sarah Henry, Dec. 12)? Such an analysis should include groups and their 
leadership with points of view that are opposite to those in the article, as 
well as some in the current music and entertainment media that seem so 
insulated. Why are some forms of hate so hypocritically and politically 
untouchable?

 Aaron Betsky's "Future World" tour of Las Vegas ("Wizardry of Odds," Dec. 12) 
ran aground in suggesting the desert playground as some sort of model for our 
failing cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas-style urban solutions meet the particular needs of casino owners 
trying to attract money into their establishments but do little to help that 
city's real problems.As Betsky himself notes, Las Vegas tends to actively 
exclude certain elements -- well-serviced housing corridors, the homeless and 
children -- that don't fit neatly between its faux historical imagery and 
gambling dens. This sort of urbanism is close to virtual reality, minimizing 
our culture's problems while manufacturing glossy facades and artificial 
histories to keep our senses overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 As we enter the next millennium, we need to identify an authentic, expressive 
and egalitarian urban culture that isn't merely fueled by escapist fantasies.

 Las Vegas is an architectural wonder, but visitors get a quick cold shower in 
reality when they leave the Strip and drive downtown. The impoverished area in 
between consists largely of small motels, wedding chapels and tiny businesses 
and appears particularly dangerous at night. Unfortunately, fancy architecture, 
gleaming slot machines and high-tech video arcades haven't smoothed out the 
economic inequalities that exist in every city on the planet.

EVOLUTION OF A CHILD ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Giving birth to Edith Ann was a labor of love for Lily Tomlin, who introduced 
the inquisitive, opinionated little girl more than 20 years ago on the classic 
TV series "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In." 
</P>
<P>
 When Tomlin joined the hit NBC show in late 1969, she brought along numerous 
characters she had honed in comedy clubs, including her most popular -- the 
obnoxious telephone operator Ernestine. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Tomlin acknowledges, Ernestine probably landed her the job on 
"Laugh-In." 
</P>
<P>
 "They hadn't seen me do Ernestine specifically, but Judy Carne was leaving the 
show and she did that switchboard thing saying, 'Beautiful downtown Burbank.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They had heard I did a telephone operator. Someone had seen me do it in a 
club. I went to see (producer) George Schlatter and I got the job." 
</P>
<P>
 After doing the series for a half season, Tomlin went on tour with Dan Rowan 
and Dick Martin. "Ernestine was immensely popular, like overnight," she 
recalls. "They took out three acts: me and Johnny Brown and another comedy 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 That summer, Tomlin began working on Edith Ann. "I wanted to do a little girl. 
I used to improv with the audiences. I would say, 'I'm working on this little 
girl and just ask me questions.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This method of creating Edith Ann, she says, "looked a lot riskier than it was 
because people basically ask children the same questions: 'What do you want to 
be when you grow up? Do you have a lot of brothers and sisters?' Most of the 
questions were condescending. All I would have to do was to be honest. They 
would ask, 'Where do babies come from?,' and you just tell them. Of course, 
they're screaming (with laughter)." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin also developed while on tour Edith Ann's distinct froggy voice with the 
noticeable lisp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, you find a voice for it and it happens. You start internalizing 
it and you start behaving and then," Tomlin states in her best Edith Ann, "it 
comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned to "Laugh-In" that fall she brought three new characters to 
audition for producer Schlatter. "I brought Edith Ann, Susie Sorority and Tony, 
the '50s teen-ager. George didn't get the '50s. He didn't think it was worth 
doing. He didn't like Edith, but he loved Susie, because it was Susie Sorority 
of the Silent Majority. That was like a real catch phrase." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin told Schlatter she would do Susie if she was allowed to do Edith Ann. 
Schlatter agreed and even gave Tomlin Edith's Ann catch phrase: "That's the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had met a little girl in Pennsylvania who had that speech impediment," 
Tomlin explains. "A lot of kids have it at 4 or 5. Their tongues are too big 
for their mouth, so whenever they say a word that ends in 'th,' their tongue 
protrudes and they blow a soft raspberry. I was using that impediment, but I 
didn't have a catch phrase. George coined the phrase." 
</P>
<P>
 Though everyone fondly remembers Edith Ann observing the world from a 
gigantic-size rocking chair, when Tomlin first began doing Edith on the series 
she didn't have that prop. "I needed a big prop, so I used an old refrigerator 
box and I just stuck my head out." 
</P>
<P>
 Much to her surprise, Edith Ann quickly captured the imagination of audiences, 
although "nobody (on the show) liked her," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tomlin can't blame them. She doesn't like to see the early incarnations of 
Edith Ann, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see her on 'Laugh-In,' I'm horrified. I can't believe it. I don't know 
how I ever had a career. I just grew so much from 1970 to '74. Somehow, God put 
the nation into a kind of comatose state while Edith was on, so they thought 
they liked her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had our 'Laugh-In' reunions, I begged them not to run any footage of 
her because she's so far from what I wanted her to be. I had to use my own hair 
then. What you are seeing is someone working this character right out in front 
of the national audience. When I did her on my specials, then I began to be 
happy with her and the way she looked." 
</P>
<P>
 And whatever happened to Edith Ann's rocking chair? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sitting on my patio," Tomlin says with a smile. "I was so happy when 
they were going to build me the chair because it cost a lot. When I left 
'Laugh-In,' they gave it to me. I have preserved it carefully all of these 
years." SUSAN KING

 BASEBALL'S GOLDEN AGE: The Photographs of Charles M. Conlon by Neal McCabe and 
Constance McCabe (Harry N. Abrams Inc.: $39.95; 198 pp;). Baseball has a 
concern for and connection with its history that other sports cannot manage, 
and these 205 images, extracted from a collection of 8,000 and newly printed 
from original negatives, bring that past to life with a dignity and gravity 
that is something to see.Taken by Charles M. Conlon, a newspaper proofreader 
whose hobby it was to photograph the players for Spalding baseball guides from 
1904 to 1942, these pictures exude an immediacy and naturalness that makes us 
feel that we've actually met the legends who stare out at us. Though his shot 
of a baleful Ty Cobb sliding into third is considered one of the greatest of 
sports action photos, Conlon's forte was the portrait and through his lens we 
can glimpse the self-confidence of Lou Gehrig, the mythological strength of 
Honus Wagner, the gravity of a business-suited Connie Mack and the mad gleam of 
Rube Waddell, facing the world with a tiny glove and a smile. Co-author Neal 
McCabe, who wrote the excellent captions, may sound hyperbolic when he likens 
Conlon to the great French photographer Eugene Atget because "like Atget, he 
left us the definitive visual record of the place he loved," but turning the 
pages of this haunting book makes the comparison seem Conlon's due. Kenneth 
Turan

 THE SOLOIST by Mark Salzman. (Random House: 21; 272 pp.) Reinhart Sundheimer 
was a child prodigy, a cellist who, at age 18, developed a hearing problem that 
affected his sense of pitch and ruined his career.From this point on, he 
practiced obsessively and isolated himself from intimate relationships. By the 
time we meet him at age 36, teaching music at a university in Los Angeles, he 
is one of those doughnut characters whose life has no center. He functions, and 
the details are all in place, but what's missing is what makes him interesting. 
'Round about the same time life throws smug Reinhart two curve balls: he is 
called to jury duty on the case of a young man accused of murdering a Buddhist 
monk; and the mother of a 6-year-old Korean boy with a genius for the cello but 
not much else going for him in the way of personal charm insists that Reinhart 
give her son lessons. The boy's talent is so startling that Reinhart cannot 
refuse. Now the novel weaves gracefully between the trial, childhood memories, 
the pursuit of music and what it means to teach. The man sitting passively in 
the courtroom while he is tried for murdering the Buddha is a walking mirror 
for the obsessive cellist, as is the lonely little Korean boy. Yet in this book 
of revelations, Reinhart's missing piece falls very calmly into place. He gets 
a cat, he plays the cello naked, he stops practicing, he allows music to give 
him pleasure. Salzman is a very pure, straightforward writer, with a poet's use 
of memory and metaphor.

 EXIT INTO HISTORY: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europe by Eva Hoffman. 
(Viking: $23; 410 pp.) In 1989, Hoffman, author of "Lost in Translation: A Life 
in a New Language," and all-around book person, gets it into her head to visit 
Poland, the country she was born in, and to witness history in the making in 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria as well.She talks to many people 
in each country, mostly book people -- writers, publishers etc. -- but also 
people on the street, in factories and in small villages. She visits first in 
1989-90, then returns to each country a year later. Hoffman is far more 
interested in how people live and how their lives have changed than she is in 
clearly outlining the political changes in each country. While trying to sort 
out Polish anti-semitism, Hoffman remembers that as a child one would never 
wear a yarmulke in public, while "the current wave of anti-Semitism, in the 
virtual absence of actual targets, seems to thrive on uncertainty and 
vagueness-like a transference neurosis, in which a free-floating anxiety is 
trying, rather impotently, to find an object and a cause." She writes that the 
Czechs, in the new Eastern Europe, are going to have to start "deconstructing 
themselves" in their "exit from isolation"; the Hungarians, with their 
melancholic, heroic natures, will have to shake the schizophrenia that is the 
result of decades of lying and dodging; the Romanians will have to rise above 
the terrible humiliations of Ceausescu; and in Bulgaria, where Hoffman finds 
the greatest continuity between generations and a strong faith still in 
communism, the Bulgarians will have to trade some of their idealism for a more 
"individualistic, multivalent" approach to the world.

 THE PROLIFIC AND THE DEVOURER by W.H. Auden. (Ecco: $18; 101 pp.) Auden began 
this book of reflections on art and politics and religion in the spring of 1939 
and abandoned it in September of that year, a month in which it must have been 
somewhat difficult to expound on art and politics and religion.He was, at the 
time, thinking through his rejection of Marxism, his acceptance of Christianity 
and his rejection of the idea that artists ought to have anything whatsoever to 
do with politics. In other words, as Edward Mendelson writes in the preface, a 
turn from optimism to pessimism. "My political eduction," Auden writes, "began 
at the age of 7 when I was sent to boardingschool. Every English boy of the 
middle class spends five years as a member of a primitive tribe ruled by 
benevolent or malignant demons, and then another five years as a citizen of a 
totalitarian state." In Auden's September, 1939, schema there are, in good 
totalitarian tradition, two human types, labeled from Blake's "Marriage of 
Heaven and Hell": the prolific: artists, farmers, skilled workers, scientists, 
cooks, innkeepers doctors teachers and athletes; and then there are devourers 
(parasites): judges, policemen, critics and politicos. Now look, this is Auden 
and it's the autumn of 1939, when good and evil were rising so rapidly to the 
surface of life that thinking in this A-B-C way over a glass of absinthe or 
something probably made sense. "The dilemma," he writes, "that to fight Fascism 
you have to become Fascist yourself is now pretty generally realized." The 
prolific and the devourer. Readers, choose your weapons.

 MAIDEN VOYAGES: The Writings of Women Travelers edited by Mary Morris. 
(Vintage: $14; 439 pp.) There you are, in the dining car, a light supper, 
reading the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, written in 1717 in Turkey, to 
her friends back in London.Or Isabelle Eberhardt, who died in 1904 at age 28 in 
a flash flood at Ain Sefra, writing about her travels in North Africa: "I feel 
lonely without Ouiha, and cannot stand the boredom." Or Box-Car Bertha, "hobo 
for 15 years, a sister of the road," who's excerpt from "Sister of the Road" 
begins: "So I knew he was tired of me, or had another woman, or both, and when

 KEY WEST TALES by John Hersey. (Knopf: $22; 227 pp.) John Hersey was born in 
China in 1914, and died in Key West in March of 1993.He was an elegant man; 
Hemingway, Capote, Cheever and Updike all rolled into one, and these final 
stories are his goodby to a place that he loved and that served up strange 
characters, a rebellious history and an ample underbelly for his writing. But 
the very best story in here has little to do with Key West, could happen 
anywhere, and does. "Get Up, Sweet Slug-a-Bed" is about about a good friend 
dying of AIDS, a once powerful and egocentric man who for decades kept alive a 
slow-burning, unrequited and unspoken passion for a sixth-grade classmate. All 
the details of his care and passage are here: the family that is so 
pathetically and inexcusably out of it, the friends that want to do the right 
thing but trespass on Billy's dignity again and again, the overly 
(pathologically so) solicitous around-the-clock nurse; all the people that walk 
away with pieces of the patient's very large life until there's almost nothing 
left. You may notice with this and other Hersey stories that you rarely put it 
down in the middle; the very accuracy of his reporting -- relationships as they 
evolve and dissolve, characters that march blindly to their fate, moral 
questions not so much debated as traversed -- gives a seamlessness and 
inevitability to his plots (as in "The Wedding Dress," in which a woman marries 
a windsurfer who, guess what, would rather be windsurfing).

 ANIMAL HAPPINESS by Vicki Hearne. (HarperCollins: $20; 256 pp.) Vicki Hearne, 
animal trainer, poet and philosopher, has been writing delightfully and with 
much delight about animals for decades.In the proud tradition of James Thurber 
she pauses not a moment in her assumption that humans were put on the planet to 
live up to the expectations and high moral standards of dogs. If 
anthropomorphizing were a crime, Vicki Hearne would need a very good lawyer, 
for her characters speak, admonish, reprimand and teach by example. Bookish 
types, she asserts late in the book, often make the mistake of trying to 
mystify animals, thinking that "like lovers and gold," they are "more precious 
when uninterpretable." Take Arrow, a service dog from Venice, Calif.: "When you 
do make the grade and a dog like Arrow becomes willing to talk to you, that too 
goes straight to the heart, and stays there," or Jack, the philosopher's cat, 
who accuses his owner of "trying to do philosophy with him," while the "whole 
point of being a cat is that you don't descend to such nonsensical behavior." 
There's Peppy the wonder horse, George the Samoyed or "nordic nerd," Scrapper, 
the lion who died of a broken heart ("You have a brokenhearted dog or horse, 
you can turn the situation round at almost any stage. But once a lion's heart 
is broke, then that's what you've got. A brokenhearted lion."), and my 
favorite, a Pakistani frog ("a clear eloquent color, somewhere between green 
and brown, that spoke of the coherence of the quest"), who dies mesmerized by 
his reflection in a bathroom tile. "After all," writes Hearne, "we remember 
Narcissus not for his looks but for his looking."

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; DISNEY CHANNEL CASTS A NEW SPELL 
OVER THE 'WILD SWANS' FABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Handsome princes were often the rescuers in the earliest days of fairy tales. 
Not so in Hans Christian Andersen's The Wild Swans, an early coup for feminism 
thanks to its young protagonist, Princess Elise, who saves her brothers as well 
as her father's kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 A new version of the fable, which was animated by Klassika Studios in Moscow, 
premieres on the Disney Channel this week as part of its "Stories to Remember" 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Sigourney Weaver narrates and lends her voice to more than a dozen 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Klassika's "The Snow Queen," which aired on Disney last year, "The Wild 
Swans" centers on the heroic deeds of its female lead. In the beginning, 
everything is right in Princess Elise's perfect world, where she lives 
comfortably with her brothers and father, the king. Then the proverbial wicked 
stepmother enters the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The new queen, who doubles as an evil sorceress, is determined to get rid of 
the king's kids. While the king is away, she banishes Elise to the home of a 
peasant family and turns the boys into wild swans, who fly far away from the 
kingdom. When the lonely Elise learns of her brothers' transformation, she is 
determined to break the spell and reunite her family. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Wild Swans' is a story that touches my heart and says things that I 
would like my children to understand," notes producer Joshua Greene. "The 
Russian artists who did the show felt the same way. Good stories do that; they 
cross all cultural boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, vice president and producer of Lightyear Entertainment, went to Russia 
in 1990 looking for animators when he found what he calls "renegade animators," 
former staffers of government animation shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The animators "were looking to start their own cooperative and to make films 
for children that said something, just like I was," Greene recalls. Greene and 
Lightyear helped the animators establish Klassika, and the two companies began 
collaborating. The studio was built in southern Moscow during the production of 
"The Snow Queen." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Klassika) really deserves all the credit," he says. "All we did is give them 
some money, equipment and story. They did all the work." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wild Swans" airs Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. on the Disney Channel. For ages 2 
to 10. MORE FAMILY SHOWS 
</P>
<P>
 Party on, Nicksters. Roundhouse (Sunday 7:30-8 p.m. Nickelodeon) this week 
offers a sketch called "Wayne's World Anonymous Youth," a support group for 
"Wayne's World" addicts. There's also a bit about a boy who gets in trouble 
just so his parents will pay attention to him; a look at the "Encyclopedia 
Cheatanica" reference set for plagiarists; "Tried-It" chewing gum; and the 
songs "Detention Row Blues," "Toe Jam," and "Love Has No Voice." For ages 2 to 
8.  
</P>
<P>
 This week marks the cable premiere of Disney's 1992 movie The Mighty Ducks 
(Sunday 7-8:30 p.m. Disney). Emilio Estevez is an aggressive trial lawyer who 
fulfills a community service sentence by coaching a misfit peewee hockey team. 
He rallies the players together and gives them the confidence to skate all the 
way to the state championships. For ages 4 and up.  
</P>
<P>
 Alice takes a stand for women's rights in Adventures in Wonderland's "Odd 
Woman Out" (Wednesday 6:30-7 p.m. Disney). Alice and the Red Queen join forces 
to fool the lodge brothers of the all-male "Oddballs" into changing their 
antiquated rules and admitting their first female member. For ages 4 to 10.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BOTTOM LINE; CHANGE FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGE

 In a time of dwindling corporate donations, fund-raising activists are forced 
to get creative. And they are finding that people are more likely to surrender 
their nickels, dimes and quarters to familiar collection contraptions -- 
parking meters and bus-fare boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began with Norman Gershenz, a conservation biologist and member of the 
San Francisco Zoo animal-keeper staff. "I wanted to do something to preserve 
entire ecosystems," says Gershenz. "I realized that if each person who cared 
about wildlife conservation donated just one nickel, the collective impact 
would be great." So he installed a Conservation Parking Meter at the zoo to 
raise money for the Ecosystem Survival Plan, which he founded in 1987. ESP is a 
consortium of zoos, aquariums and wildlife groups that helps save endangered 
habitats around the world. Now more than 30 zoos (though not the L.A. or San 
Diego zoos) and aquariums have the meters. The Nature Company also has them at 
all 10 of its Southern California stores and most of its other 150 locations. 
The meters so far have raked in more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If small change can help save rain forests, why can't it help fund AIDS 
projects? That thought occurred last March to Rick R. Prickett, marketing 
director of the San Diego Theatre League, after he spotted one of the 
Conservation Meters. So Prickett founded Care Fare, a registered charity that 
has placed about 20 refurbished bus-fare boxes at various spots around town to 
collect donations for several AIDS-related organizations. Donations are nearing 
$20,000. "The Care Fare boxes reach an entirely new group of people," says 
Prickett, "and the boxes do their job quietly." Pam Dixon

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; OFF THE DEEP END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Underwater, I gaze at the word deep on the side of the pool. It is a moment of 
ecstasy. It's hard to believe it's really happening. After a lifetime of 
hydrophobia, I am in the deep end of a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 I am here thanks to Paul Lennnon, head of the Glendale-based Adult Aquaphobic 
Swim Centers of Southern California. A former competitive swimmer and 
agoraphobic, he is the perfect teacher for anyone afraid of the water. "An 
aquaphobic feels out of control in the water," he says. "Their muscles become 
flexed, ready for action. This works against them." 
</P>
<P>
 It is early one Sunday morning at the Glendale YMCA. My first class. I'm 
terrified, but as Lennon speaks, my heart and stomach gradually unclench. He 
tells the 15 of us about his victory over agoraphobia, his love for the water. 
He speaks of water lyrically, as "luscious" and "creamy" and "sensual." He says 
we, too, will learn the joy of being in the water. He encourages us to describe 
the root of our fears. We become a little world of people sharing a secret, of 
being outsiders at pool parties, at the beach, watching others splash and laugh 
and play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conventional training," Lennon says, "teaches locomotion, how to get from 
Point A to Point B in a very limited, tense way. I want to make it enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
 Into the water. Lennon keeps the pool at a womb-like 92 degrees, and lessons 
are two hours long, time enough to adapt to what we all see as a hostile 
environment. We learn "passive" stroke techniques, "allowing the water to do 
the work," and use supporting devices Lennon has developed, like grab rails and 
vertical poles. Fears melt away. I float on my back in my first lesson. A small 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just a few weeks later, I am flipping onto my back, my front, spinning, 
gliding, floating. In the deep end. Swimming. Unafraid. Ruth Shaer

DARK CORNERS OF THE CITY; BARCELONA: JEWS, TRANSVESTITES, AND AN OLYMPIC 
SEASON, BY RICHARD SCHWEID (TEN SPEED PRESS: $16.95, HARDCOVER; $9.95, PAPER; 
205 PAGES.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Colman Andrews, Colman Andrews, a frequent visitor to Barcelona, is the 
author of Catalan Cuisine (Atheneum/Collier Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sketching a portrait of Barcelona at least partly in terms of its Jewish and 
transvestite populations, as Richard Schweid does in his colorful, quirky new 
book about the city, is not such a strange idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Homage to Barcelona," the Irish writer Colm Toibin tells of seeing a 
transvestite discussing her domestic life with conventional housewives in a 
neighborhood bread shop one morning. They talked absolutely naturally to her, 
he notes, "as though she were one of themselves." When she left, there was not 
a snigger or murmur of disapproval. Transvestites, Toibin realized, "were a 
part of the city's fabric, its sexual heritage." Indeed, they are highly 
visible in the Catalan capital, and seem genuinely appreciated in many 
quarters. When Robert Hughes, in his own "Barcelona," observes the stylish 
transvestite prostitutes working behind the University of Barcelona, one of his 
Catalan friends adds admiringly, " Son arquitectes " -- "They're architects." 
This is high praise indeed in the city of Gaudi and Bofill. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Barcelona's Jewish population, which is minute, its very lack of 
visibility says something about the city -- and not something good. A Jewish 
community was founded here in the 2nd Century, and remained a vital part of 
Barcelona's artistic, scientific and mercantile life for the next thousand 
years or so. At one point, as much as 10% of the local population was Jewish. 
In 1391, though -- a century before the formal expulsion of Jews from Spain by 
Ferdinand and Isabella -- anti-Jewish riots swept Spain, and those in Barcelona 
were particularly violent. Christians sacked the city's Call or Jewish quarter, 
driving out or murdering most of its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews didn't come back to Barcelona in any number until the late 1920s, after 
the Spanish dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera had offered citizenship to all 
returning Sephardic emigrants. (Sephardim are the children of the Spanish 
diaspora, Sepharadh being the Hebrew word for Spain .) 
</P>
<P>
 Today the city's Jewish community numbers about 4,000 -- more like 
one-six-hundred-and-fiftieth of the total population than one-tenth. 
Ironically, though -- and this is a point Schweid misses -- it has become 
fashionable for Barcelonans to honor Judaism and laud Jewish contributions to 
the city in recent years -- not necessarily out of good will, but as a way of 
stressing a distinctly non-Moorish element of Catalonia's heritage, and thus 
emphasizing still further its cultural independence from the rest of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweid, a Tennessee-based journalist whose previous books are "Hot Peppers" 
and "Catfish and the Delta" (both also published by Ten Speed), is not a 
particularly elegant writer -- a fact suggested even by his title, which is 
innocent of both rhythm and apparent irony. His text is salted with unfortunate 
metaphor (he calls Barcelona "a visual repast to walk through," which sounds 
rather messy) and tortured locution ("Over the years, the drug problem had been 
treated from both the legalize-it and outlaw-it perspective"). 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he has a keen eye, deftly capturing disparate facets of the 
city's personality -- facets by no means restricted to his title subjects -- in 
anecdotes and apercu. In one touching passage, for instance, he watches a young 
girl leaving a park with her mother. She has been playing there with her 
granddaughter, and as she departs, he clowns for her, in a way, thinks Schweid, 
that seems to plead, "Remember me, remember me." 
</P>
<P>
 Schweid is obviously a good listener, too, drawing out his subjects, often 
coaxing them to illuminate dark corners of their city -- whether it's the young 
transvestite prostitute who likes to dress up for "the aesthetic," (but whom 
Schweid finds wearing unlaced Nike knock-offs instead of his usual high heels, 
because his feet are swelling and he doesn't want to register with the 
authorities to receive medical care), or the 91-year-old Turkish Sephardim who 
recalls the Barcelona of the '30s, when on the Saturday before Easter, "there 
was not (an apartment) on this block where a woman didn't come out on the 
balcony beating on a pot and calling, 'Kill the Jews, kill the Jews.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The third element of Schweid's title, the Olympics, doesn't seem to interest 
him as much as the first two. A thick volume could be written on the '92 Games 
-- a volume full of intrigue and absurdity, populated as richly with buffoons 
and petty villains as with great athletes -- but this isn't it by a long shot. 
Schweid devotes comparatively few pages to the subject, discusses it without 
the insight he applies elsewhere and doesn't even always get his facts right. 
It wasn't Barcelona Mayor Pasqual (here misspelled Pasquall ) Maragall who 
announced that the city would host the event, for example; it was the 
International Olympic Committee, issuing a statement from Lausanne on Oct. 17, 
1986. And the city's vast urban renewal program wasn't launched by that 
announcement, but had begun, with a billion-plus-dollar plan for a series of 
new "espais urbans" or urban spaces, in 1980. It almost feels as if Schweid 
stuck in the Olympics stuff to give some measure of timeliness to his book -- 
and might have preferred to concentrate on the Jews and transvestites.

 That raises a larger question, though: Why Jews and transvestites in the first 
place? Sure, they're representative of certain aspects of the city -- but why 
concentrate on those aspects? Is Schweid Jewish himself, or gay? Why was he 
attracted to these two segments of society and not two others? What does he 
think they tell us about the place that we wouldn't learn from a book on, say, 
its Muslims and lesbians -- or for that matter taxi drivers and fishmongers? If 
it's not a strange idea to concentrate on the people he does, it's not an 
obvious one either. An author can define his own terms, but he needs to make 
his case.

PALM LATITUDES: IN EXCESS; TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT 
</P>

 It began, for me, like this: As I nearly always do when dining out, I ordered 
an iced tea. The waiter brought it to me and I took a hearty gulp.It nearly 
came back up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waiter," I said, beckoning. "Excuse me, but there's something wrong with this 
tea. It tastes like something got into it. May I have another one?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir. Certainly." 
</P>
<P>
 But the next one was no better. The taste was, I came to find out, 
intentional. It was, in fact, that malevolent brew that has slowly been 
invading hundreds of local restaurants, from the Cheesecake Factory to Four 
Seasons -- the dreaded passion-fruit-flavored Paradise Tropical Tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if folks want to drink this stuff and enjoy it, I'm happy for them. 
Believe me, this is not a flame against Paradise Tropical Tea drinkers. This is 
a flame against the restaurants that do not clearly identify the beverages they 
serve. If restaurants list "iced tea" in the menu, they should offer iced tea, 
not iced Paradise Tropical Tea. 
</P>
<P>
 As an expatriate New Orleanian who grew up drinking gallons per week of the 
real thing, I just can't stand this stuff. And I can't believe I am alone in 
this. All I ask is that restaurants offer a choice. I may have to keep a 
Thermos of Luzianne or Barry's in my trunk in case of emergencies . . . sigh.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; IMMATERIAL GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Ehrman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there a swatch of Material Girl trivia too insignificant for a true-blue 
Madonnaphile to receive without a hearty squeal? Laurie Pike doesn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the former KTTV entertainment reporter is bringing Madonna minutiae 
into your living room via public-access TV. That's right, fans, airing on a 
cable channel near you, it's a whole show . . . "All About Madonna!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever gotten the feeling that there's just not enough Madonna to go 
around?" Pike asked in the first segment of "All About Madonna." "I feel that 
way all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Her shows valiantly try to keep pace with the demand. A club kid who once 
danced next to Madonna tells his story! An exclusive interview with an author 
who sold film rights for his book to Madonna's production company! And there's 
an "All About Madonna" scoop -- a never-before-heard Madonna single, "We Live 
in a House," recorded when she sang with a group called "The Spinal Root Gang." 
There's also an interview with one of the band members, who reveals that 
Madonna may have walked off with his grandmother's antique radio! 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal with the Madonna show," Pike says, "was to make the stupidest public 
access show ever." It's not really about Madonna, she says. "It's about public 
access, about talk shows and about how sick fans are." 
</P>
<P>
 "The question was if anyone was going to take it seriously and I think they 
have," says the cheeky hostess, who nonetheless insists that she is "a total 
Madonna fan." 
</P>
<P>
 The four "All About Madonna" segments already taped will be airing until the 
end of February on various cable systems in Southern California as well as in 
14 cities in other areas. After that, Pike says, fans will have to fend for 
themselves. "I'm kind of sick of Madonna at this point," she says. Mark Ehrman

GROWING UP ON THE HOME TURF OF MURDER, INC.; THE VILLE: COPS AND KIDS IN URBAN 
AMERICA, BY GREG DONALDSON (TICKNOR & FIELDS: $22.95; 401 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Randolph Bates, Bates' recent nonfiction book is Rings: On the Life and 
Family of a Southern Fighter (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), a white writer's 
10-year witness of the experience of a black family from a New Orleans housing 
project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brownsville and East New York neighborhoods of Brooklyn exact an 
experience that remains foreign to much of the public. This is true despite the 
national media attention attracted by fatal shootings by teen-agers of 
teen-agers and a teacher at Brownsville's main high school. It's true even 
though facets of Brownsville (and comparable neighborhoods) are so influential 
among the young that advantaged kids from the suburbs to the heartland affect 
its quick-triggered talk and loose gangsta attire -- baggy fabric that in 
Brownsville often conceals firearms or shoplifted clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferating children-with-guns culture of Brownsville is one of our 
corrosive open secrets; it's mythicized and marketed, but it isn't widely 
understood. Greg Donaldson, a teaching veteran of Brooklyn's roughest schools, 
has written articles about the area and ridden at all hours with its police. In 
"The Ville: Cops and Kids in Urban America," he takes us on an eloquent journey 
throughout Brownsville and makes us begin to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 The antagonist in these pages is "a system that is content to allow levels of 
joblessness, despair, and violence . . . that are destroying a generation of 
African Americans." Occupied with this "loss of young lives," Donaldson 
documents the social forces that transformed Brownsville from the ambitious 
Jewish community it was in the first half of the century. But even in the 1920s 
and '30s, Brownsville was dangerous, home turf of Murder Inc. and an area that 
Jews labored to leave. Along with gerrymandering, deindustrialization and the 
mushrooming of housing projects, designed in the '40s and '50s "for the working 
poor . . . (but) filled up with the unemployed," Brownsville suffered, in the 
'60s, "the scourge of heroin" and "the living dead who scratched like chickens" 
through the burn-out surrounding its projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson explains that for kids who "grew up in a festering world of 
syringes, dope buys, strangers, and stupefied parents, the second wave was 
AIDS. . . . The third wave, crack, blew the doors down. Into the chaos rolled 
cars loaded with weapons purchased from gun stores in Virginia, brown boxes 
packed with guns delivered by mail order." Now, in "the fresh hell of the gun," 
50,000 people inhabit the projects of Brownsville and East New York. As many as 
90% of the youth there are jobless, their dreams grounded in the two square 
miles that also are home to the highest concentrations of methadone clinics, 
homeless shelters and homicides in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Donaldson is learned about these conditions, he doesn't seek to 
inform primarily in the ways of standard scholarship. Instead, working "on that 
excruciating line between officers of the law and young men of the streets," he 
sets out to dispel "cardboard images" on both sides of the line and to humanize 
public perceptions of these kids' and cops' personal struggles and warfare with 
each other. He successfully realizes these large-hearted hopes by portraying an 
unspecified recent year -- summer 1991 to summer 1992 -- in the lives of an 
array of Brownsville's cops, crack dealers, working mothers and grandmothers, 
teachers and many of its very young males who succumb to the acute pressure to 
carry guns to protect themselves and command respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition of recurring narratives in Donaldson's account defies 
expectations of simple dramatic tension. That is as it should be. The 
loose-threaded tapestry of the narration aptly reflects the blurred scramble 
for recognition in the Ville itself. There is a central pair of stories, though 
-- about two young men who do not meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharron Corley is a high school student and a member of the LoLifes, a gang 
identified by its passion for "boosting" and wearing Polo fashions. Gary Lemite 
is a young Housing cop and one of the few blacks on duty in these projects; he 
is eager to do the job and advance himself and his family. Sharron, like his 
girlfriends and other peers, has been thoroughly seduced by the "mad American 
marketing machine that trumpets, 'Get things, get money and don't settle for 
second best' (and) makes ambition a religion" -- especially for those such as 
Sharron who have no "access to the legitimate hierarchy." Donaldson's depiction 
of Sharron yields a close look at this dreary seduction. 
</P>
<P>
 But though Sharron has his vapid traits and fantasies of spotlighted acclaim, 
he is no mere bubble-head. It is engrossing to follow him as -- brave and 
afraid -- he cultivates the image of one who "gets paid" (has authority) and 
tries to steer a correct course through the lethal nuances of the streets, in 
schools and on Riker's Island. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gary Lemite, Donaldson portrays an equally insistent, if not greater, will 
to succeed. Guided by more staid conventions of the American dream, Gary seeks 
all the overtime he can earn in hopes of buying a house for his wife, who is 
white, and their small children. But Gary also likes the sometimes cowboyish 
action of collaring "perps" (perpetrators). We see him on his way to becoming 
the most decorated PSA cop in 1992. We also see him almost lose his family in 
his zeal for the job. In our final view of Gary, a man not given to making much 
of color, we see him shaken by covert racism directed at him by some of his 
fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson's characterizations of Sharron and Gary and his cameos of many 
others are balanced, and sympathetic without being sentimental. He is 
uncondescendingly deft at showing inner contradictions, and he gives virtually 
everyone a human face. 
</P>
<P>
 So intimate are facets of these portraits that readers may well want to know 
more about relations between Donaldson, who is white, and his subjects. There 
is clearly a powerful further story within the personal reserve imposed by his 
third-person point of view. Yet Donaldson has more than earned the right to be 
judged solely on the basis of the story he chose to tell. This is because his 
occasional omniscient projections, even in bedrooms, are sensible, and unlike 
woodenly executed but similarly well-intended chronicles with which "The Ville" 
will be compared, each of Donaldson's pages demonstrates that this man can 
write. His ear, timing and command of scene and understatement are true. Along 
with large and small gems of description throughout, there are masterful fluid 
sections that could also stand as set-pieces. For instance, there is an account 
of Old-Timer's Week, when aging former residents return to the Brownsville 
community "with epic dignity and uncommon good cheer" to share what "they live 
from," the kinds of memories that youths "who skulk around the edges of the 
proceedings . . . looking to make their mark . . . out of the line of fire, 
will never have." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a three-page portrait of Gita Malave as she goes through a typical 
winter day on the subways, at an eight-hour clerical job, at the hospital for a 
visit and then at night school. With these words, Donaldson leaves Gita finally 
home for the night with her two youngest children: 
</P>
<P>
 "Victories do not come in clusters in Brownsville. There is no clear line of 
progress, no inspiring line of development. Everyone, it seems, is fighting 
alone. Gita is going to graduate with an associate's degree in legal studies if 
it kills her. Then she will hope to find a better job. But her children are not 
galvanized by her feats of faith and endurance. They will not surpass her and 
head off to four-year colleges. . . . The pressures here are too great for that 
kind of momentum to build. Instead the victories are like sparks in a meadow; 
they flash and burn out. Nevertheless, her family is intact, there is no gunman 
stalking her (incarcerated) son, no police officers pounding on her door. She 
is not complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Various locations -- like the Ville as a whole -- take on the presences of 
characters: PSA 2, certain buildings in the projects and "Jeff," Thomas 
Jefferson High, the huge school where "there is not one white child." At Jeff 
we meet a dynamic teacher, Sharon King, and its principal Carol Beck, who was 
featured on 60 minutes. Beck takes Jeff's students on retreats and dreams of 
building a dormitory for the ones who need shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 While describing one of Beck's esteem-reinforcing cotillions, Donaldson 
convincingly identifies disillusion, not lack of motivation, as the source of 
poor success rates among African-American students. And his reflection on 
Jeff's 1992 graduating class, 60% of it Caribbean, underscores a plight unique 
to African Americans, "who have been passed by immigrant group after immigrant 
group, (and) are being passed again. This time . . . by an almost invisible 
contingent, one that looks like them but has come from . . . cultures that were 
not exposed to such high levels of racism. 'We just didn't have so many white 
folks around growing up,' the Jamaican Sharon King says. 'We made decisions on 
our own.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Donaldson walks the razor edge between disclosure and what Carol 
Beck had in mind, when following a killing at Jeff, she refused to "whore . . . 
sorrow" and verbally spanked a "Geraldo" producer whose manner displayed "a 
cockiness that reveals how many things he has not felt": "You cannot get into 
the psyche of the black and Hispanic man. As a people, we are through with the 
talk show. . . . You want to show a picture that says, 'This is what the mother 
of a child who has been killed looks like.' I ain't about this anymore. Where 
is the benefit, the intellectual growth, that is going to come out of that? . . 
. I'm not telling you about my pain anymore. It's tragic, yes. But do I need to 
share this with the white middle class? No. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Greg Donaldson doesn't mistake this righteous no as applicable to 
his intentions in "The Ville." He may not know all the psychic intricacies of 
street men of color -- nor does he pretend to -- but he knows plenty about both 
their circumstances and their psychology and he knows that, in the interest of 
everyone, this measured knowledge must be accessible to the middle class. At 
considerable risk, he has made that happen and given our wounded society a book 
that is smart, noble and potentially restorative. Read it. We need to. And it 
deserves to get paid.

 IF WISHES WERE HORSES by Loretta Gage, D. V. M. & Nancy Gage (St. Martin's 
Press: $4.99; 295 pp.) . The odds were against Loretta Gage when she entered 
Colorado State University's College of Veterinary Medicine: She was older than 
most of the other students and her initial application had been rejected. Her 
reflections on how learning anatomy altered her attitudes toward animals and 
her descriptions of treatments are entertaining and instructive. This otherwise 
engaging narrative is marred by the unpleasant intrusion of sexism: When Gage 
doesn't get along with male students, she blames their "testosterone levels;" 
when her female colleagues become equally disagreeable, she doesn't cite PMS as 
the cause.

 WHO CARES WHAT I THINK? American Teens Talk About Their Lives and Their 
Country edited by Marcia Thompson (Close Up Publications, 44 Canal Center 
Plaza, Alexandria, Va. 22314: $10.95; 204 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original). Sixteen teen-agers offer their thoughts about life in contemporary 
America in these short interviews. Despite economic, political and ethnic 
differences, most of the young men and women share a surprising number of 
opinions: They cherish freedom of speech and the right to vote, yet feel the 
federal government has little, if any, impact on their lives. This small 
sampling could scarcely be described as a portrait of a generation, but it 
could spur discussions in homes and classrooms.

 NATURAL HIGH by John P. Wiley Jr. (University of New England Press: $12.95; 
121 pp., paperback original). In these brief essays about nature, Wiley 
stresses the importance and pleasure of observing what goes on around us: 
"Learning to see is partly remembering to look, and partly bringing what we 
know to what we are looking at." But seeing brings an awareness that even 
trivial acts can tax resources and generate pollution: Turning off a lamp or 
running errands on foot can help ease the strain on the beleaguered 
environment. Wiley calls these actions "voting with our feet," and reading his 
prose is like taking a stroll with a knowledgeable friend.

 LISTENING TO OURSELVES: More Stories From "The Sound of Writing" edited by 
Alan Cheuse & Caroline Marshall (Anchor: $12; 296 pp., paperback original). 
Billed as "America's only short story magazine of the air," the popular 
National Public Radio program presents new works by respected authors. The 
stories vary widely in tone and subject: Elizabeth Winthrop reflects on 
intergenerational conflicts in "Golden Darters"; Tobias Wolff's "Mortals" 
captures the angry embarrassment of a cub reporter who's been fired for 
publishing the obituary of a living person; Elena Castedo describes the fears 
of a Latino maid in "The White Bedspread." This enjoyable anthology shows that 
"Sound" has replaced the now-defunct magazines that once presented quality 
contemporary fiction.

 MOUNT VERNON: The Civil War Years: The Presence of a Lady by Dorothy Troth 
Muir (The Mount Vernon Ladies' Assn., Mount Vernon, Va . 22121: $10.95; 136 
pp., paperback original). In 1860, the women of the United States, represented 
by the Mount Vernon Ladies' Assn., purchased George Washington's estate to 
preserve for future generations. When the Civil War broke out, the members of 
the association agreed that "the presence of a lady" was the best way to ensure 
the safety of the historic site. Sarah Tracy, secretary to the regent of the 
association, spent the war there with a chaperon, a handyman and a few 
servants. Although several major battles (1st Manassas, Antietam Creek, Bull 
Run) were fought near Mount Vernon, both sides respected its absolute 
neutrality. Compiled from letters and diaries, this charming chronicle presents 
a vivid account of one woman's courage, and a little-known chapter in American 
history.

 OBASAN by Joy Kogawa (Anchor: $9; 300 pp.) and ITSUKA by Joy Kogawa (Anchor: 
$9; 334 pp.). Kogawa's semi-autobiographical novels trace the internment of 
Japanese-Canadians during World War II and their subsequent struggle for 
redress."Obasan" (a respectful term for aunt), introduces the reader to Naomi 
Nakane and her prosperous family. Forced to leave their home in Vancouver, the 
Nakanes are sent to a series of inland camps and abandoned villages. Their only 
crime is their Asian ancestry, "the hair shirt of ethnicity." Left in the care 
of her aged aunt, Naomi witnesses the painful disintegration of the people she 
loves. "Itsuka" ("Someday") traces the gradual return to a semblance of normal 
life after the War. Kogawa shows the reader the frustration of the Nakanes with 
Caucasians who see only skin color and refuse to distinguish soldiers of the 
Imperial Army from fellow-citizens of Japanese descent. In eloquent, 
understated prose, she depicts the long battle for vindication, despite 
internecine quarrels and cultural biases.

FEASTING WITH STIEGLITZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a dinner game in which participants are invited to select a companion 
from history. Now, 90 years after Camera Notes ceased publication, a 
conversation with its editor, Alfred Stieglitz, might be entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Camera Notes, published quarterly from July, 1897 through July, 1903 in 
editions of 1,000 copies, was the pulpit from which Stieglitz praised amateur 
photography as a fine art. Through articles and essays written by contributing 
photographers, art critics and Stieglitz himself, the message was repeated and 
reinforced: " . . . the camera, properly guided, is capable of art -- real art 
-- there is no longer a doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Peterson's new book, "Alfred Stieglitz's Camera Notes" (The 
Minneapolis Institute of Arts/W.W. Norton: $39.95; 204 pp.) is more like a 
weekend retreat than a mere evening with the opinionated editor of "The 
Official Organ of the Camera Club of N.Y." Peterson is associate curator of 
photography at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Like a docent, he leads us 
through careful examinations of the history and politics of the club and its 
influential publication. His book reproduces all 91 photogravure images from 
Camera Notes (in half-tones now), and also includes thumbnails of the 267 
half-tones that Stieglitz selected to further make his point. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, chronicling Stieglitz's philosophic evolution, observes "the 
necessity of emotion in pictorial photographs . . . (is the) element that 
distinguishes an artistic print from the factual, everyday photograph so common 
in the popular press." To be fine art, photographs must result from subjective 
responses of their makers to their subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Camera Club was made up of amateurs not wholly convinced of 
Stieglitz's lofty direction. Dissent in the ranks in late 1900 put Stieglitz on 
the defensive. For the next two years, the narrow minds of the club closed in 
on him, and in his July, 1902 issue, he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 With a tight group of full-time photographers of better-than-amateur skills, 
he founded the Photo Secession and a new magazine, Camera Work. With the Photo 
Secession, photography as art would veer further from the factual everyday 
image. Over a dinner today, Stieglitz's observations on contemporary fine art 
photography and on photo-realist painting would be fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson prepared this book for the traveling show organized by the 
Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The show visits Phoenix, June through August, 
1994, and Santa Barbara, February through April, 1996. There viewers can see 
firsthand the pictorial work Alfred Stieglitz propounded. Until then, Christian 
Peterson's book is a terrific way to spend a weekend. Randy Leffingwell

THE SAINTS PRESERVE HIM  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Griffin, who reviewed our book "Saints Preserve Us" on Oct. 31, 1993, 
did not seem to like it -- which is his right. But when he suggests that we 
"confabulate(d) with a little fancy and fable," and that we "assigned Saints . 
. . as patrons," he manages simultaneously to miss our point and reveal his own 
ignorance. Confabulating and assigning were precisely what we did not do. 
However disinclined he may have been to "put any credence at all" in our 
bibliography, had Griffin taken the trouble to consult even a single text of 
the "hagiography" of which he is so famously fond -- for example, "Butler's 
Lives of the Patron Saints" -- he would have found that the three examples of 
patronage he explicitly calls into question (Joseph of Cupertino, of 
astronauts; Zita, of domestic servants; Onuphrius, of weavers) are all 
absolutely authentic, sanctioned by Catholic tradition, and still popular among 
the faithful of the world (if not of Griffin's immediate acquaintance). Your 
reviewer may be "not without humor when it comes to hagiography" (if he does 
say so himself). But he is without qualification . . . or a clue.

 SEAN KELLY, NEW YORK COMMANDERS IN POST-WAR POLAND 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure that the Los Angeles Times will want to correct a major inaccuracy in 
Bettyann Kevles' review of my "An Eye for an Eye" (View Book Review, Dec. 23). 
I never suggest that 75% of the "factotums" in the Office of State Security in 
Poland in 1945 were Jews. I do say that Jacob Berman, the chief of the office, 
and all or almost all the department chiefs were Jews, something that scholars 
have known since the 1940s and '50s. I also say that 75% of the officers -- the 
lieutenants, captains and majors, including the director of the office, the 
director of prisons, and secretary of state security, and many camp commandants 
-- in the Polish province of Silesia were Jews, something I learned from the 
only source that would know it: the Jews themselves. Since they appointed the 
commandant at Lamsdorf (who hung out at the Jewish Club but said he was a 
Catholic) and since they often inspected the camp at Lamsdorf, Kevles is also 
wrong in saying that at Lamsdorf, "There is no evidence that Jews were involved 
at all." I'm sure Kevles wouldn't say that Germans weren't involved in the many 
camps that were run by Germans but staffed by Ukrainians like Ivan the 
Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevles says that the number of Jews in the Office of State Security was 1.7%. 
Her source, though she doesn't say so, is Boleslaw Bierut, the Communist 
president of Poland in 1945. Most scholars, of course, do not accept statistics 
of Bierut, Stalin and Mao. To begin with, how did Bierut calculate it? Almost 
all the Jews in the office changed their names to Polish ones like Tadeusz 
Zaleswski, Bolek Jurkowski and Stanislaw Niegoslawski, and some, when they 
died, were even buried in Catholic cemeteries. They never told Boleslaw Bierut 
or anyone in the office except other Jews that they were Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the German prisoners. Twice, Kevles calls them German war criminals, 
but, as I say in "An Eye for an Eye," fewer than 1% were ever convicted of war 
crimes and 99% were innocent civilians. 
</P>

 JOHN SACK, NEW YORK LOVE MAKES THE WORLD SPIN 
</P>
<P>
 In one shattering month, Dec., 1993, it has been breathily, clinically, 
earnestly, gleefully, delicately, above all understandingly disclosed to this 
innocent old man that Daphne du Maurier and Gertrude Lawrence were lovers, that 
Danny Kaye and Olivier "had a fling," that Benjamin Britten . . . that Aaron 
Copland . . . that John Maynard Keynes. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I guess I knew, but at least I never blabbed. Please tell me you 
"understand."

<P>
 FRED SCIFERS, DOWNEY A THRILLER FOR THINKERS 
</P>
<P>
 With all due respect to John Schulian's accomplishments as a writer for 
superior TV shows, I can't help but wonder if his taste has terminally tottered 
when it comes to his review of Lawrence Block's latest Scudder novel, "The 
Devil Knows You're Dead" (Dec. 12, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting that the book is deliberately "noirish," that is to say, dark, moody 
and intelligent, Schulian is disappointed because sleuth Scudder is found only 
in psychological jeopardy and not physical trial. What Schulian forgets is that 
the keenest suspense is psychological. 
</P>
<P>
 Few authors can create the textured terrain of a Block or a Burke, and damn 
few authors (or their editors) have the courage to break free of the smothering 
conventions of the genre. The reading audience for those few writers who 
clearly are writing literature and not just forgettable potboilers will be 
smaller than it should be. But without the energized, courageous reachings 
within the art of storytelling, we stay at the pointless level of the overfed 
and dull. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the comment that perhaps Block doesn't do enough self-promotion, I 
counted the number of appearances on his recent book tour: 53. Makes me tired 
of thinking of it. If his audience is smaller than it should be, it's because 
he's smarter than he should be for America's brows. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers, go get his book. He deserves your purchase, you deserve his gifts.

WHERE'S THE MAGIC?; CAST A SPELL, BY BETTE PESETSKY (HARCOURT BRACE JOVANOVICH: 
$21.95; 195 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In Raemunde Howard, the "Miz Magic" of Bette Pesetsky's fifth novel, "Cast a 
Spell," Pesetsky has created an appealing, maligned protagonist. The people 
surrounding Raemunde seem driven to hurt her and damage her reputation, from 
her cousin Carrie who is trying to research and publish an expose about her to 
the adults who neglected or exploited her when she was a girl. Raemunde, 
pronounced Ray-mund-day, or Rae for short, is appealing because she doesn't 
seem to bear grudges, is not egotistical, but is single-minded, professional 
and sincere in her devotion to magic. She has pursued a career as a magician 
despite opposition since she was a young child, and has prevailed to become a 
television success beloved by children. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel quickly raises the following questions: Why is Carrie after Rae? 
What damaging secret from Rae's past does Carrie think she will uncover? Who is 
the mysterious male sleuth also making inquiries about Rae, and what is his 
motivation? 
</P>
<P>
 We soon learn that Rae, born to unmarried parents in 1952, was abandoned, 
first as a baby by her mother and then by her father and stepmother when she 
was 11. Courtesy of Child Welfare, she then arrived at her stingy, mean and 
ailing grandmother Minnie Howard's large and gloomy New York apartment. Here 
she grew up with her cousins Carrie and Lila, whose father had died and their 
mother gone crazy with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions soon multiply: What happened to Rae's parents? What has recently 
motivated her to place ads in newspapers seeking news of her father? Why do so 
many people object to this undertaking? What responses has she received? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, we also learn that Rae has been married three times -- to Whalen 
Clarke, a handsome, well-bred WASP who had once dated Carrie; to amusing, ugly 
Leo Littweiler, Rae's best friend as a teen-ager and now a Hollywood success; 
and to academic Peter Anson, orderly and protective, whose wife she still is. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie's motivations quickly become apparent: her need for money, her envy of 
Rae's success and her anger at her for supposedly stealing Whalen. The answers 
to the other questions, however, are not forthcoming. Pesetsky hints of 
solutions to the mysteries she weaves when Rae discovers in her early 20s that 
her grandmother had secretly been sending her father money. But this clue never 
leads to anything. The problem is that Pesetsky sets up expectations, but she 
doesn't deliver on them. She blazes trails that go nowhere. She teases her 
readers, even omitting a confrontation between Carrie and Rae. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel begins with a series of letters that reveal Carrie's plaintive 
coaxing and awkward efforts to interest her dubious publisher. Soon the novel 
becomes a narrative told by Carrie, Rae or the omniscient narrator. These 
changes occur suddenly, without transition, and it's often hard to tell who the 
speaker is, since there is little differentiation between the voices. The novel 
moves confusingly back and forth in time so that it's often hard to place when 
an event is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 If on the grand scale Pesetsky disappoints, there are compensations. She's a 
witty writer, with the ability to deliver a judgment or coin a phrase. Of an 
artist, Rae observes, "He is a salon painter. He does the perfection of 
unreality." 
</P>
<P>
 Pesetsky's descriptions of food are praiseworthy. Since the story "Ulcer" in 
her first book, "Stories Up to a Point" (1982), she has, in her attention to 
what her characters eat, granted to food its crucial place in human life. In 
"Cast a Spell" are a number of appealing descriptions of food, particularly of 
deli meals: "Caraway-seeded rye bread, roughly cut. A trembling embankment of 
pickles. Moist pepper-speckled coleslaw, potato salad sprinkled with Hungarian 
paprika." 
</P>
<P>
 What is most interesting about the novel are Rae's pronouncements about her 
profession. "People misunderstand what a true magician is. They confuse those 
skills with the role of seance-holders, oracles, fortune-tellers. You can learn 
to be a magician." "Conjuring -- the true art, the making of magic -- came to 
me when I was very young. I knew all the basics -- the rope tricks with 
clothesline, the seesaw, the magic box, the dropping coin. I learned that 
behind every trick, every effect was the explanation. And knowing that made me 
a realist at an early age." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these sparkling moments, "Cast a Spell" founders on its false leads 
and becomes a series of episodes and digressions. It's full of tricks, but 
lacking in magic.

STYLE: FASHION; MODERN TRANSLATIONS

<P>
By MICHAEL EISENHOWER

<TEXT>
<P>
 We all know a classic when we see one: The '57 Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eames armchair. The Waring blender. From the synthesis of style and 
function spring instant icons that constantly redefine each object.It isn't any 
different in the fashion world, where no self-respecting closet would be 
without a white shirt, a navy blazer or a trench coat. For men, there might be 
a denim jacket and a pair of high-tops stashed alongside; for women, a little 
black dress and a string of pearls. But if fashion classics are, by definition, 
always in vogue, it's partly because they actually endure by evolving. Each 
season, designers play with shapes, fabrics and details as they reinterpret 
wardrobe essentials of the past to fit the present. And in the spirit of 
creative experimentation, easy Velcro fasteners replace buttons and zippers, 
sturdy vinyl and Lycra sub for leather and knits, and seams and other 
structural underpinnings turn inside out to serve as decoration. Who says you 
can't make a good thing better? MICHAEL EISENHOWER

STYLE: DESIGN; DOMESTIC AFFAIRS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Europeans have long savored much about everyday life; they approach even 
humdrum tasks -- cooking, cleaning, eating -- with great style and wit. 
Americans, too, are cultivating an appreciation for the elegantly functional, 
investing in items that are handsome, useful and -- when appropriate -- 
amusing. So it's a happy circumstance that more designers around the world are 
packing ingenuity and good looks into objects we take for granted yet couldn't 
live without. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, for instance, a fly swatter made not of pastel plastic and painted 
wire but smooth polyester strands and stainless steel. A humble household 
fixture once relegated to the utility closet becomes attractive enough to 
display. Other updated classics include a toilet scrubber that comes in its own 
sleek, easy-to-clean aluminum-and-glass container, a wastepaper basket with 
expandable accordion pleats and a pen blown from glass that has 16 tiny grooves 
to hold a page's worth of ink. 
</P>
<P>
 On the food front, well-designed objects address practical needs -- a glass 
pitcher with an outer pocket to keep ice and liquids separate. They provide 
multicultural solutions -- eating utensils that serve as, depending on which 
end you grip, chopsticks or a fork and knife. And they can be whimsical -- 
magnetic salt and pepper shakers that swing around a metal pole like a pair of 
circus acrobats, adding flavor and fun to meals. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to good design, there's little room for the cluttered or clumsy. 
By the same token, all the style in the world won't make a whit of difference 
if something doesn't perform as it should. As Marsha Armitage, product buyer 
for the Museum of Modern Art gift shop and catalogue, puts it: "I look for a 
simple, clean product that does the job, and if it has anything to offer me 
other than functionality, it should be beautiful in its simplicity." SUSAN

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: TOUGH SLEDDING FOR ACE 
WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to writing from personal experience, veteran screenwriter John 
Michael Hayes ("Rear Window," "Peyton Place") has gone the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the main character Will Stoneman in Disney's new release "Iron Will," 
Hayes says he faced huge odds in getting his story to the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 For Stoneman, 17, it is a treacherous, 522-mile cross-country dog sled race 
from Winnipeg, Canada, to St. Paul, Minn., in the dead of 1917's brutal winter. 
For Hayes, 74, it was not only resurrecting a film career that had been in 
mothballs for 30 years, it was getting a project that he began in 1971 finally 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a film studies professor at Dartmouth College, Hayes was one of the 
highest-paid screenwriters of his day, penning such other Alfred Hitchcock 
classics as "To Catch a Thief," "The Trouble With Harry" and "The Man Who Knew 
Too Much," plus "The Children's Hour," "Butterfield 8" and "The Carpetbaggers." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Hayes muses, "Hollywood has changed a lot and I guess you forget when 
you've been away for awhile." He said "Iron Will's" $17-million budget was "14 
times what it cost to make 'Rear Window' (in 1954)." He says he would have 
preferred to see a big star in the film, but allows that "the story is the star 
of this picture." As for Jeff Arch and Djordje Milicevic, who share screenplay 
credits, Hayes says they were brought in to "Disney-ize" the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for "Iron Will" came from a 1917 newspaper article about a dog-sled 
race. Bing Crosby Productions hired Hayes to write the script in 1972. It would 
take another 21 years to get the movie made after it was optioned by several 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining Hitchcock ("He was an enigma"), Hayes had been a newspaper 
reporter lured to radio drama in Cincinnati and eventually Hollywood in the 
1940s. His film breakthrough came in 1952 from Universal Pictures with such 
films as "Red Ball Express," starring Sidney Poitier, and "Torch Song" starring 
Joan Crawford. A year later he got the call from Hitchcock -- who had been a 
fan of his "Suspense" radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was working on 'Dial M for Murder,' his last picture for Warner Bros. 
Paramount told him he could come over there and make pictures if he could get a 
screenplay out of a little story called 'Rear Window,' " says Hayes, noting 
he's now working on a remake of the classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes' last major film was "Nevada Smith" in 1965. After signing a lucrative 
10-year contract with Embassy Pictures -- which did him no good after the 
studio was sold to Avco Pictures -- he tried writing for TV but eventually gave 
up and moved to Hanover, N.H., home of Dartmouth, where he began teaching 
permanently in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never gave up on "Iron Will." Said Hayes: "I wanted to tell a story 
about a young man against impossible odds, man against the elements."

DREAM GRILL; ENTER THROUGH AN ALLEY, PAST A MAHOGANY BAR, INTO ANOTHER WORLD -- 
ALMOST IN ANOTHER ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to the Grill," says the dapper maitre d', ushering you past a polished 
mahogany bar into a large room with a high, coffered ceiling, 
turn-of-the-century brass lamps with soothing green glass shades and darker 
green leather booths. The setting could be a classic American grill in 
Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco. The era: the '30s or '40s. But it's early 
1994, and we're just off Rodeo Drive, where a permanent layer of Giorgio 
perfume hangs in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet somehow I'm sneaking a peek to see if Nick and Nora of "The Thin Man" 
films are at the next table. And I'm wishing I had worn a hat. At the very 
least, I could order a martini. I do. It's perfect. Our waiter, an older man 
with a professional demeanor, slips us a small plate of sauteed sweet peppers, 
red and green. In his white jacket, he seems as solicitous as an old-fashioned 
family doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Shall we have a fat golden oval of crab cake packed solid with fresh crab? 
Half a dozen oysters on the half shell? Steamed littleneck clams heaped high in 
the bowl and served in a lemony broth accented with bay leaf and a slice of 
lemon? Meaty, coral-streaked shrimp and a great version of the requisite ruddy 
sauce take shrimp cocktail well beyond the cliche. I could make an entire meal 
of the splendid steak tartare, which comes to the table faultlessly seasoned, 
with plenty of hot toast to spread it on. (A good many of the appetizers can 
also be ordered in main-course sizes.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare to find a place that does equally well with seafood and with meat, 
but that is the case here. Regulars know to reserve their orders of pan-fried 
soft-shell crabs and platters of sweet, firm-fleshed Florida stone crab claws 
in season. And if John Dory is on the menu, order the big filet of this 
flavorful fish topped simply with a lemon butter. 
</P>
<P>
 The steaks are impressive cuts of prime, well-marbled meat that tastes the way 
steaks used to taste. The T-bone could feed two, but when it comes to the New 
York steak topped with crushed black peppercorns, bacon and caramelized onions, 
I'll eat all 16 ounces by myself, thank you very much. For hard-core 
carnivores, choosing is a real difficulty. The double lamb chops are among the 
best I've ever tasted; add some creamed spinach and a plate of the frilly fried 
onions and shoestring potatoes, and go directly to heaven. Top-quality meat 
makes all the difference with the burger, too, a mix of chuck and prime 
sirloin. Even the pickle seems to have a superior pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 Let other restaurants occupy the cutting edge. The Grill keeps to a steady 
course. The food is all familiar fare. No need to ask the waiter to translate a 
thing. What's unusual is the polished execution, breathing new life into these 
old standards. Take a classic dish such as liver and onions. The delicate 
calf's liver, smothered in silky, caramelized onions and crisp, smoky bacon, 
would convert any die-hard liver-hater. The benchmark corned-beef hash is an 
utterly seductive plate of diced, lean corned beef, fried potatoes and bits of 
browned onion cushioning two perfectly poached eggs. The portion, however, is 
dauntingly large, and I flag before the finish. The waiter comes back. "Didn't 
you like it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I did. It's just too much for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he replies, "is not a restaurant for the fainthearted." 
</P>
<P>
 I've had to cry uncle more than once, departing ignominiously with my little 
doggie bag. So I began to count how many others leave in the same fix, and I'd 
say the figure is roughly 50%. When partners Bob Spivak, Mike Weinstock and 
Dick Shapiro first talked about opening a restaurant together, it was the 
height of nouvelle cuisine -- little portions, big prices. They decided to 
provide the antidote: honest, straightforward, traditional American grill 
served with a generous hand. They spent time at the venerable Tadich Grill and 
Jack's restaurant in San Francisco, and Spivak visited 57 New York 
establishments with vintage bars in three days. The illusion of age and 
tradition in the restaurant they created is so good, it's hard to believe that 
Jan. 31 is only the Grill's 10th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The courteous, thoroughly professional service seems to date from another era. 
They don't overbook; they don't punish you for being late; they don't suggest 
you're wrong when you're right about a corked wine. The entire restaurant 
functions like a well-maintained machine. John Sola, the chef who opened the 
Grill, is still executive chef. Maitre d' Allan Ludwig has been on board since 
Day 1.  
</P>
<P>
 The one place the Grill disappoints is in the desserts. The much-touted apple 
pie is a tall wedge of finely sliced apples without much flavor. The 
raisin-studded rice pudding is pedestrian, and the hot-fudge-sundae sauce is 
more like hot chocolate than fudge. If you can pass on the desserts (and not 
many people can make it that far anyway), the Grill offers an immensely 
satisfying restaurant experience. And it's actually quiet enough to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grill, 9560 Dayton Way, Beverly Hills; (310) 276-0615. Open for lunch and 
dinner Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking in evening; street and 
lot parking during the day. All major credit cards accepted. Lunch for two, 
food only, $40 to $65; dinner for two, food only, $40 to $95.

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the English tradition, steak off the grill calls for claret, which at the 
Grill means something like 1985 Chateau Talbot, $55, a decent wine that should 
work with the beef. Or try 1989 Chateau Greysac, a modest but decently rich red 
at $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most Californians prefer something brawnier, such as domestic Cabernet 
Sauvignon. The Grill offers two dozen Cabernets: Best bets are 1988 Silver Oak 
"Bonny's Vineyard," $35, or 1989 Caymus, $35. 
</P>
<P>
 To accompany seafood, the best values in whites include 1990 Ferrari-Carano 
Fume Blanc, $19, and 1989 Grgich Hills Fume Blanc, $19.  
</P>
<P>
 One final sleeper here is Iron Horse Brut, a sublime sparkling wine, which at 
$30 is a good buy and works well as a Chardonnay substitute for leaner dishes.

STAGE WATCH: LIFE SEEMS A CABARET FOR SUSAN DIETZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any list of producers from L.A.'s theater boom of the '80s must include Joe 
Stern, Bill Bushnell and Susan Dietz. Recently Stern returned to action at his 
Matrix Theatre, while Bushnell left L.A. altogether. Now it's Dietz's turn for 
an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The former artistic director of L.A. Stage Co. and co-director of the Pasadena 
Playhouse is, with partner Marilyn Shapiro, opening a cabaret in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-seat Tonto & Dietz will officially open on Jan. 28 with a four-weekend 
run of "An Off-Broadway Cabaret," starring Bonnie Franklin, Teri Ralston, Gary 
Sandy and Byron Nease. 
</P>
<P>
 But three other acts will actually precede the official opening: 
singer-songwriter Michele Brourman Wednesday and Jan. 26, piano satirist Dale 
Gonyea on Thursday, and singer Hattie Winston on Jan. 27. Amanda McBroom will 
sing on Feb. 7-8, and storyteller Paul Linke will perform a new show on Feb. 
14. Look for play and poetry readings and performers Steven Banks and Tony 
Abatemarco, said Dietz. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue is the former Breakin' Break Bistro, next door to the former Room 
for Theatre, in Gaslight Alley, 12747 Ventura Blvd. Dietz said she started her 
producing career in her living room, and this room is so small she feels as if 
she's back there "by way of Broadway" -- where she took the Pasadena Playhouse 
production of "Mail." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 'SUNSET' WATCH: They're ready for their sound check, Mr. Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 As "Sunset Boulevard" continues to break house records at the Shubert (a 
$854,111 gross for the week ending Jan. 9), recording begins Monday on a new 
"Sunset" album, starring the L.A. cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to do the L.A. album could mean there won't be a New York 
"Sunset" album when the show opens on Broadway in a year or so. Noting that the 
original London-cast double CD is still selling, a source close to the 
deal-making expressed doubt the market would support a third album. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "it was obvious we needed another recording" besides the London one, 
said a spokesman for producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, citing changes made 
in the score for the American production. The London recording "was not the 
definitive version." 
</P>
<P>
 A release date for the L.A. album hasn't been announced. It's not even certain 
the new album will include the entire score. A one-disc "highlights" album from 
Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera" has sold well, in addition to the 
complete 2-disc set. However, changes in the "Sunset" score since London may be 
considered extensive enough to justify a new release of the entire score. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 'PHANTOM' NORTH: Speaking of "The Phantom," parts of L.A.'s four-years-plus 
production survive in a San Francisco production of the same show: the set, 
adapted for the Curran Theatre; L.A.'s last Phantom, Davis Gaines; and a few 
other actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaines is elevating what is already a high-camp role to a new level here," 
wrote Steven Winn, the San Francisco Chronicle's critic. The show amassed $15 
million in advance ticket sales before it even opened last month.

TYING THE KNOT, FOR REAL

<P>
 The bells of last Christmas combined with wedding bells when "General 
Hospital" favorites Kristina Malandro (Felicia Jones) and Jack Wagner (who 
played Felicia's husband, Frisco, on "General Hospital") tied the marital knot 
in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 After deciding to take the big step, Malandro and Wagner flew in a chartered 
Lear jet to snow-covered Lake Tahoe, where they were married in a private 
ceremony. The duo then flew to Las Vegas, where they spent a romantic overnight 
honeymoon before returning to Los Angeles the next Sunday. Malandro had to 
report to the "General Hospital" set for work the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Petey, Malandro and Wagner's toddler, spent the weekend with his nanny while 
his parents exchanged vows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Film, television and theater actress Rosalind Cash is creating the contract 
role of Mary Mae Ward on "General Hospital" this month. Mary Mae is the former 
owner of an old house that was purchased by Laura and Luke Spencer (Genie 
Francis and Tony Geary). It seems that Mary Mae's vivid recollections of Port 
Charles at an earlier time will interest and surprise many of the town's 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 On the big screen, Cash had roles in the films "Buckaroo Banzai," "Amazing 
Grace," "The Omega Man" and "Uptown Saturday Night." Her TV credits include 
roles on "China Beach," "thirtysomething," "Cagney & Lacey" and "Hill Street 
Blues." Her theater credits are numerous, including work with the New York 
Shakespeare Festival, the La Jolla Playhouse and the Paoli Theatre in Rome. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 You might not have guessed this, but Deborah Adair (Kate Roberts on "Days of 
Our Lives") is a gourmet cook. Apparently the beautiful actress learned all her 
culinary tricks from her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child growing up, I was surrounded by fabulous cooks," says Adair. "I 
used to sit in my grandmother's kitchen, my mother's kitchen and my uncle's 
kitchen. I didn't know there was such a thing as bad cooking, until I left 
home. I thought everybody cooked well. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was a schoolteacher who worked horrendous hours," she continues. 
"Plus she had a horrendous commute. Yet she always managed to prepare a first, 
second and third course at every dinner. We'd usually start off with a lovely 
salad, followed by an entree and a dessert, which was usually fruit. My mother 
was very health-oriented. So we ate a lot of fish and low-fat meals." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her uncle taught Adair all about cosmopolitan cooking. "He used to 
send me recipes via the mail for different hors d'oeuvres and all kinds of 
fancy-shmansy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "And my grandmother, who was just my favorite person in the world, was a 
Southern cook, a farm cook," adds Adair. "She'd make spoon bread, corn pudding, 
fried chicken."

ON THE RECORD: SOLO VIOLINISTS PICK FROM 20TH-CENTURY CONCERTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's solo violinists -- and not within memory have there been so many 
proficient ones before the public -- are increasingly paying as much attention 
to 20th-Century concertos as to the handful of Romantic standards: a smart 
move, and not a risky one, what with the violin concertos of this century being 
so closely related to their 19th-Century antecedents. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern composers, and the violinists seeking out their services, haven't 
missed the point that the violin is a relatively immutable instrument, or that 
its players' demands haven't changed much during the centuries. It remains a 
singing instrument, and the violinist unconcerned with showing off that quality 
is a rarity. Take as an example the once off-putting Berg Concerto, which is 
everywhere these days, or the now frequently encountered Stravinsky Concerto, 
Shostakovich's First and Bartok's Second, which are no longer 
subscription-concert rarities. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to suggest that we are hearing vast numbers of brand-new 
concertos. The violin has yet to find its Rostropovich, who enriched not only 
his own but every cellist's repertory with the great amount of music he 
commissioned a couple of decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Stravinsky's chattery, cheeky exercise, however, has little to do with 
Romanticism. The solo may "sing," but in short-phrased opera buffa terms rather 
with the violin's traditional bel canto . 
</P>
<P>
 Its urchin spirit is captured to perfection by Canadian violinist Chantal 
Juillet, deftly seconded by the Montreal Symphony (of which she is a former 
concertmaster) under Charles Dutoit's sharp direction (London 436 8370). 
</P>
<P>
 But that's less than a third of the story. The sizable remainder of the disc 
is devoted to concertos of a different stripe, those of Polish composer Karol 
Szymanowski, his first from 1921, the second from 1931, the same year as 
Stravinsky's, which it resembles not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 is an eerily buzzing, swirling night-music affair that retains traces of 
Scriabin's mysticism -- but energized with a modern rhythmic feel -- while No. 
2 is darker, longer-lined, more discursive. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are compelling, strongly profiled creations, particularly in the hands of 
Juillet, with her sweetly elegant, seemingly slender tone and acute rhythmic 
sense. Dutoit and his orchestra are again strong partners in scores that 
intertwine solo and orchestra rather than making them competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 More traditionally Romantic, which is to say backward-looking, 20th-Century 
concertos are those of Elgar and Walton, the former dating from 1910, the 
latter, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 They are handsomely presented (on Collins 13382) by the excellent Italian 
violinist Salvatore Accardo, of whom we haven't heard nearly enough in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Accardo reaffirms his standing among the thinking virtuosi, kicking the hardly 
self-propelling lines of Elgar's beefy concerto into motion without slighting 
its majestic lyricism, while supplying the rhythmic backbone to prevent 
Walton's schmaltz from turning into a sentimental wallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hickox and the London Symphony provide model, assertive support 
(Collins 13382). 
</P>
<P>
 The Violin Concerto of Benjamin Britten was written in 1938, when his music 
had not as yet settled into a perceptibly personal style. Strong, often 
gripping stuff nonetheless, with its faintly Mediterranean turns of phrase the 
composer ascribed to his reactions to the Spanish Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 The soloist is Lorraine McAslan, about whom the recording's notes tell us 
nothing (Collins 13012). Whoever she may be, McAslan makes a strong case for an 
elusive work with her supple, clean and dynamically nuanced playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her collaborators are the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Steuart 
Bedford, who also provide the sturdy framework for soloist Joanna MacGregor in 
Britten's rather too insistently chipper Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 The most swooningly lush of all violin concertos may well be Samuel Barber's 
1941 delectable concoction, which is given the performance of a lifetime -- 
impetuous, grandly lyrical, propulsive -- by the then-18-year-old Anne Akiko 
Meyers in a 1988 recording only now generally available (RPO Impact 5002). 
</P>
<P>
 The Barber is coupled with Meyers' equally confident playing of Bruch's 
G-minor Concerto, and both are accorded affectionate, shapely backing by the 
Royal Philharmonic under Christopher Seaman.

POP EYE: REASSESSING THE LABELS AFTER A RECORD YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bold, intoxicating sound you're hearing in the music business in these 
early weeks of the new year is the sonic boom of change. Thanks to the 
information revolution, fads and fashions -- and genuine shifts in musical 
taste -- sweep through each new wave of pop fans as fast as you can say 
"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang." 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative-rock poster-badboy Eddie Vedder was on the cover of Time before 
people finished arguing about what alternative meant. Snoop Doggy Dogg made the 
cover of Newsweek before his album even came out, then topped the charts as 
pundits brooded about the cultural impact of his violent, misogynistic lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to talk real impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of last year's Top 30 selling albums -- records that all sold at least 1.5 
million copies -- were from artists who didn't even have a record contract in 
1990. Tiny independent Priority Records, which lives on rap's razor edge, had a 
bigger market share than the EMI Records Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a new burst of energy from the "Lollapalooza" generation -- and an 
ever-increasing profit margin on CDs -- the music biz is more than ever the 
money biz, with all sorts of labels reporting record earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes industry execs bullish about 1994 is that this sweeping pop 
revolution has been a bloodless coup, with little of the nasty generational 
strife (Stones vs. "The Sound of Music," Sex Pistols vs. Boring Old Rockers) of 
previous breaks with the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Young shared the stage with Pearl Jam. Bono crooned with Sinatra. For 
gosh sakes, Cher flirted with Beavis and Butt-head! 
</P>
<P>
 This wealth of cross-fertilization has launched a flood of marketing-driven 
Big Event albums -- something we'll continue to see in '94. Why make a live 
album when you can revamp your old hits with an MTV-endorsed "Unplugged" album? 
If you have stars, hitch them to a concept: Send Streisand back to Broadway. 
Got a Meat Loaf album? Call it "Bat Out of Hell II." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesson for '94: Most of the Big Event bonanzas capitalized on the 
mystique of an artist, not the talent. But with a wealth of fans eagerly 
exploring the brave new world of rap and "Lollapalooza" rock, there may be room 
in pop's Big Tent for everybody in the coming months, whether it's the 
scorched-earth rock of Rage Against the Machine, the creamy pop of Anita Baker 
or the first gangsta-rap Big Event -- a Dr. Dre-Ice Cube reunion album. 
</P>
<P>
 For a glimpse at who's hot -- and who's not -- at the start of the year, here 
is Pop Eye's annual Record Company Scorecard, which analyzes the performance of 
the industry's six major distribution conglomerates, with individual listings 
for labels with the most distinct identities. The evaluations are based on 
interviews with key industry figures, who graded companies on both image and 
performance. BMG 
</P>
<P>
 Arista: If the industry had a lifetime achievement award, this would be the 
year to give it to Clive Davis, a brilliant record executive who would probably 
earn more accolades if he weren't always patting himself on the back. Thanks to 
another 5.5 million sales from the "Bodyguard" soundtrack and a huge record 
from Kenny G, the label had two of the year's top three albums while racking up 
enormous country success with Alan Jackson and Brooks & Dunn. Arista's hot 
LaFace team scored with Toni Braxton, the year's biggest-selling female 
vocalist after Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. The label's '94 
priorities include Sarah McLachlan, Crash Test Dummies and a classic Big Event: 
an Aretha Franklin hits package that includes a LaFace-produced remake of 
"Natural Woman" with 'Retha, Bonnie Raitt and Gloria Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 RCA: Another dreary year for a label whose A&R staff might have better luck 
signing a hit rock band by holding a raffle. RCA's one success was SWV, a 
double-platinum En Vogue knock-off that is hard to imagine as an act with 
longevity. Meanwhile, in the midst of the biggest country boom ever, RCA's 
Nashville roster looks weaker than ever. The big test for '94: the label's 
just-released ZZ Top album, the first result of a $35-million signing gamble. 
Is it any wonder many of RCA's top execs are floating their resumes? MCA 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen: This highly regarded label bounced back late in the year, launching a 
respectable follow-up to Nirvana's groundbreaking "Nevermind" album, cashing in 
on Beavis and Butt-head and -- can you say meal ticket ? -- selling a whopping 
2.5 million new Aerosmith records. That should make up for its Coverdale-Page 
letdown and Guns N' Roses' sputtering "The Spaghetti Incident?" album. Not to 
worry: The label is this close to breaking the highly touted Counting Crows, 
with a crowd of rookie-of-the-year candidates, including Hole and Beck, on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA: Each year, unable to break a new rock band, MCA tries to invent one. 
1992's attempt -- a Spinal Tap reunion -- flopped. But in 1993, MCA Music 
Entertainment Group Chairman Al Teller executed a stroke of marketing wizardry 
-- a sequel to Meat Loaf's "Bat Out of Hell" album that has already hit 2.6 
million in sales. Add to that MCA's impressive roster of country hitsters (Reba 
McEntire, Wynonna Judd, George Strait and Vince Gill), a surprise hit from 
urban crooners Shai and continued sales from Mary J. Blige and you hardly worry 
about a flop from Bell Biv DeVoe or the defection of Tom Petty to Warner Bros. 
Now MCA's newly overhauled rock A&R team needs to prove that it can compete for 
new talent with such hot labels as Epic and Interscope. '94 Big Event: A 
"Rhythm Country and Blues" duet album that marries the label's Nashville stars 
with R&B heavyweights (sample matchup: Trisha Yearwood and Aaron Neville). 
Polygram  
</P>
<P>
 A&M: While its image has dulled in recent years, it did yeoman work breaking 
the Gin Blossoms, squeezing almost 2 million in sales out of an artsy Sting 
album and re-signing Bryan Adams, who came through with a million-selling hits 
package. If touted rock contenders Soundgarden finally bust out this year, A&M 
will be riding high again. If not, critics will be focusing on the negatives -- 
like why LaFace has delivered huge urban pop hits to Arista while Jimmy Jam and 
Terry Lewis' Perspective label hasn't produced a true star yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury: It was big news when the bottom fell out of British rock -- and bad 
news for Mercury, which had banked on a bunch of young Brit bands, none of 
which have made a dent here yet. The label's hits came from Billy Ray Cyrus, 
who bolstered an aging Nashville roster, and Tony Toni Tone, who almost went 
platinum. Bon Jovi may still sell a ton of records overseas, but in America 
he's a fading star, like label-mate John Mellencamp. Mercury is still a label 
in need of an infusion of energy -- or vision. Among its challenges: Can it 
make Vanessa Williams the next Mariah Carey? Can it somehow transform Bon Jovi 
into a pop balladeer? And can it ever get any money back from its pricey Lionel 
Richie deal? 
</P>
<P>
 PolyGram Label Group: Island is the real performer here, perhaps the 
industry's most promising small-roster label. U2 defended its rock throne, 
selling 1.8 million "Zooropa" albums (and another 500,000 "Achtung Baby" 
records). The Cranberries came out of nowhere to sell a million albums. 
Thirteen years after his death, Bob Marley's "Legend" album still sells 680,000 
albums a year. And who wouldn't love to have a host of acclaimed up-and-comers 
like PM Dawn (who sold 525,000 albums) and PJ Harvey? Sony  
</P>
<P>
 Columbia: Finally supplanting Warner Bros. as the stretch limo of the record 
business, Sony, as redesigned by COO Thomas D. Mottola doesn't just go for hits 
-- it hits home runs. A model of corporate efficiency under chairman Don 
Ienner, Columbia sustains its superstars at impressive sales levels while also 
launching "Lollapalooza"-generation acts. The result? Huge sales from Mariah 
Carey and Michael Bolton, the biggest albums in a decade from Billy Joel and 
Barbra Streisand, a big breakthrough from Soul Asylum, plus cutting-edge rap 
success from Cypress Hill and Onyx (and that's not counting Pink Floyd, which 
easily sells a million catalogue albums every year). Even a mud-slinging 
lawsuit with George Michael has done little to soil the label's reputation as 
today's reigning hit factory, which comes into '94 with a new Alice in Chains 
EP on the way and break-out releases from rapper Domino and rockers Cry of 
Love. 
</P>
<P>
 Epic: Blessed with a savvy young A&R staff and promotion smarts, chairman Dave 
Glew's label is pound-for-pound the best place for breaking pop and rock acts 
-- whether it's Pearl Jam, whose two albums sold a whopping 6 million albums 
last year, or the Spin Doctors, whose 1992 debut racked up another 2.5 million 
in sales. Add a big hit from Sade, a monster "Sleepless in Seattle" soundtrack 
and another 1.3 million from Michael Jackson's "Dangerous," and Epic scored six 
of the Top 50 selling albums of the year, a figure matched only by Columbia. 
The label's '94 priorities include the touted Rage Against the Machine as well 
as Celine Dion and the Indigo Girls, both showing higher profiles after recent 
hit singles from the Epic Soundtrax label, another example of the label's 
marketing synergy savvy. Thorn-EMI 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol: No one's taken a wrecking ball to the Capitol Tower. But otherwise 
everything is different here, starting at the top, where president Hale Milgrim 
was abruptly ousted in May and replaced by Geffen A&R exec Gary Gersh, who has 
made huge trims in the label's roster, abolished the black music division and 
brought in a cadre of sharp lieutenants. Both Milgrim and Gersh can claim 
credit for breaking Blind Melon, whose success was followed by a Big Event 
"Duets" album from Frank Sinatra, a Duran Duran comeback, and enough sales of 
Garth Brooks' Liberty albums to fill the Tower from top to bottom. With a new 
album due from Bonnie Raitt and make-or-break records from the Beastie Boys and 
Richard Marx on the way, Gersh has the daunting task of redefining Capitol in 
an era where everyone expects instant results. 
</P>
<P>
 EMI Records Group: Charles Koppelman, who runs Thorn-EMI's North American 
record division, wanted a high profile and now he has one -- as the successor 
to Irving Azoff as the most disliked mogul in the business. Last year wasn't 
much to boast about, with EMI's biggest hits coming from a forgettable pop 
crooner (Jon Secada) and a children's TV icon (Barney). Unable to sustain Jesus 
Jones, unable to revive Billy Idol, EMI has earned a reputation for 
overspending on lightweight artists (like Joshua Kadison) and high-salaried 
executives who seem to travel everywhere by chauffeured Bentley. The year's 
biggest blunder: Trying to cash in on Arrested Development with a quickie 
"Unplugged" album instead of setting up the rap group's second album. Koppelman 
deserves total credit for Capitol's Sinatra coup, but without a credible A&R 
staff don't expect much action here, especially with such '94 priorities as an 
album of Elvis Costello songs from Tasmin Archer and a new release from -- 
yikes! -- Vanilla Ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin: Paula who ? With or without an Abdul, Virgin re-established itself as 
an industry presence -- and EMI's big moneymaker -- with a brilliantly marketed 
Janet Jackson album (her Rolling Stone cover pose was the sexiest media come-on 
since Sharon Stone uncrossed her legs). Other triumphs included huge 
breakthrough records from Smashing Pumpkins and Lenny Kravitz. The label's big 
challenge this year will be getting something back from its investment in the 
Rolling Stones, reviving Steve Winwood's career, pushing Guns N' Roses 
guitarist Gilby Clarke's solo album and breaking singer Sam Phillips. Time 
Warner  
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Group: With a new, youth-oriented artist roster and an energetic new 
label president in Danny Goldberg, Atlantic has finally shed its old 
rock-warhorse image. At 2.7 million, the Stone Temple Pilots were the year's 
best-selling new rock band, while Atlantic's Nashville wing scored the two 
biggest country debuts with John Michael Montgomery and Confederate Railroad. 
The East/West subsidiary also contributed to the mix with a surprise hit from 
Snow, while Atlantic's acquisition of Rhino Records provided an opportunity to 
repackage and market its valuable catalogue. This year the label's priorities 
include Juliana Hatfield and the Lemonheads, along with a big push for Tori 
Amos and Pantera. 
</P>
<P>
 Elektra: With its marketing and promotion departments adjusting to big 
changes, it was an up-and-down year here. The label's only new million-selling 
album came from Silk, though 10,000 Maniacs sold 1.7 million copies of their 
last two records, boding well for Natalie Merchant's solo career. Otherwise the 
big moneymaker was Metallica, which sold a spectacular 2.5 million catalogue 
albums plus 350,000 new box sets list-priced at $89. This made up for Elektra's 
fumbling the ball with Natalie Cole, whose follow-up to "Unforgettable" went 
nowhere. That leaves plenty of challenges: Can Elektra take the Breeders over 
the top? Is there any life left in the post-Vince Neil Motley Crue? And can 
Anita Baker fans be persuaded to buy the real thing, not one of her many 
imitators? 
</P>
<P>
 Interscope: With label chief Jimmy Iovine providing both energy and focus, 
this label exploded in '93, launching the year's two biggest (and 
controversial) rap artists, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose albums combined 
to sell over 5.2 million copies. On top of that, Interscope hit paydirt with 4 
Non Blondes, selling 1.2 million of the group's debut album. What to do for an 
encore? This year the label will work its blue-chip stable of cutting-edge rock 
contenders, going for the gold with Primus, Nine Inch Nails, Helmet and Possum 
Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.: Maybe it's time for Warners to get the Keith Richards treatment 
-- an infusion of new blood. With its deep artist roster and executive 
stability, the Mo Ostin-led label has long been the industry's blue-chip stock. 
But it's nowhere near as aggressive as Sony's hard-charging labels, and in '93 
the seams started to show. The label slumped in both urban and country (where 
only Dwight Yoakam hit the million-sales mark) and went another year without 
breaking any of its young critics'-darling bands. To make money, Warners relied 
on aging superstars Eric Clapton and Rod Stewart, who both had huge "Unplugged" 
albums, while Giant Records finally made its presence felt with its "Common 
Thread" collection of country stars' versions of Eagles songs. With its Rick 
Rubin-led American Records making news only by staging a mock funeral for its 
old name, Warners focuses its '94 hopes on Morrissey, an Elvis Costello & the 
Attractions reunion and New Age harpist Lorena McKennitt.

POP MUSIC CHARTS: PULLED UP BY A THREAD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trisha Yearwood's "Song Remembers When" is a big seller (No. 8) on The Times' 
Southern California album chart partly because of another album, "Common 
Thread: Songs of the Eagles." Exposure on this country-chart topper (she sings 
"New Kid in Town") has beefed up her fan base. George Strait is doing something 
Garth Brooks used to do, with several albums in the country Top 10. Strait's 
"Easy Come Easy Go" is No. 6 and his "Pure Country" is No. 10. Celine Dion's 
"Power of Love" is powering its way up the pop singles chart, debuting at No.

CNN'S 60 MINUTES; THE NEWS NETWORK EXPANDS ITS DOCUMENTARY 'SHOWCASE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT WILLIAMS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you'd care to watch CNN put its best foot forward, tune in on Sunday nights 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "CNN Presents," the Cable News Network's "marquee" documentary, which 
premiered as a monthly show last March, has gone weekly as a one-hour, 
one-theme program airing Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a showcase for CNN in the same way that '60 Minutes' is a 
showcase for CBS," says Bob Furnad, CNN's executive vice president and 
executive producer, who developed the show with its executive producer, Scott 
Woelfel. 
</P>
<P>
 Furnad says CNN always intended to make the show a weekly feature: "1993 was 
more seeing what we could do ... seeing if we had the staff and the wherewithal 
-- the talent -- to go weekly." 
</P>
<P>
 CNN has redirected the efforts of its special units. "For instance," Furnad 
says, "the Special Assignments Unit had been doing a weekly piece every Monday, 
in addition to two or three one-hour specials during the year. 'We've dropped 
the weekly piece and concentrated toward a dozen one-hour pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, CNN will continue to combine special units -- as it did for the 
1993 report, "Swords to Plowshares," in which CNN's science and business units 
teamed up on a story about the conversion of U.S. and Soviet war economies to 
peace economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that the combined units actually enjoyed working together and 
produced a hell of an hour," Furnad says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its premiere, "CNN Presents" has boosted ratings in its various time 
slots by 29%, according to CNN figures. But it hasn't found the larger 
audiences Furnad believes are available. 
</P>
<P>
 That's part of the reason for the Sunday night time slot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last summer, during the Mississippi River flooding, our environmental unit 
did a dynamite hour on the environmental consequences, but it got little 
audience because folks didn't know it was there," Furnad says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of criticism from the networks and other critics who say we do 
great on breaking news but we lack depth," he says. "Well, we do have depth, 
but people haven't been able to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 The anchor desk will rotate among four of CNN's principal anchors: Susan Rook, 
Frank Sesno, Bernard Shaw and Judy Woodruff. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, "CNN Presents' " first hour looked at "TV 2000," the present and 
the promise of its own medium, where technologies are converging on an 
"interactive TV" -- a hybrid of computer, telephone and cable box. 
</P>
<P>
 Rook directed viewers through the products and services already available "on" 
television or in it, with reports from CNN science correspondent Miles O'Brien 
and "Showbiz Today" anchor Jim Moret. 
</P>
<P>
 Next among the 34 shows slated for 1994 was "The Battle of the Sexes," which 
aired last week, when anchor Woodruff and sports anchor Nick Charles examined 
college sports, where the dollars-and-cents gender gap between men and women 
persists. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, CNN's Peter Arnett reports from Afghanistan on how suspects in the 
World Trade Center bombing allegedly were trained by a CIA-backed political 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Other topics include genetic engineering, behind the scenes at the Academy 
Awards, the proliferation of legalized gambling, slavery, fan violence, Eastern 
Europe five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and unequal U.S. education 
40 years after the Supreme Court's Brown vs. the Board of Education ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you took one hour of the week and said, 'This is the most important hour 
of the network, and this is an hour that's going to be our signature, and put 
your creative nickels into it, as well as your actual nickels, this is what you 
would get," Furnad says. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why it's different, dramatic and bolder than what we've been doing," 
he says. "These are 1990s documentaries. They're good television, and they're 
good journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 "CNN Presents" airs Sundays at 6 p.m.

RESTAURANT NEWS: EVERY LITTLE CHEESE SEEMS TO SCREAM LOUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owning one of the fastest-growing Italian restaurant chains in Southern 
California isn't enough for Bill Chait. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are always plenty of hungry customers milling about his 12 
Louise's Trattorias, he knows the food could be better. After all, it was Chait 
who in 1988 opened the upscale Beverly Restaurant and Market, where superchef 
Lydia Shire (now in Boston) turned out lobster club sandwiches and bread was 
flown in from France. (The place was a critical success, but it failed from a 
business standpoint.) 
</P>
<P>
 This year Chait and his partner, Howard Weinberg, are going to expand out of 
state (Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Columbus, Indianapolis, eventually New York 
City). And they've learned a few things since they took over the original 
Louise's in 1985. They plan to keep the prices and the 6 1/2-ounce pasta 
portions, but now will get serious about the food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been agonizing over this for about three years," says Chait. His goal 
is to serve simpler food with better ingredients. "We probably make the food 
more complex than it has to be."  
</P>
<P>
 His first priority was to hire a consultant who really knows Italian food. 
After months of searching, Chait hired restaurateur Mauro Vincenti, who owns 
Rex Il Ristorante in downtown Los Angeles and Pazzia on La Cienega. Vincenti 
will keep his restaurants and consult at Louise's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We operate at a $12 check average per person and some of his checks at Rex 
can be almost $100 per person," says Chait. "You wouldn't think the twain would 
meet, but they do. More than anything it's upgrading the product and then using 
it more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 At this moment, the two are happily driving around Italy shopping. They are 
buying Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, Parma ham, cases of extra virgin olive oil. 
"There are about 100 different varieties of olive oil," says Chait. "Unless you 
have a firm understanding of the source, you don't know what you are getting. 
We want to break bread with the people where the food comes from."  
</P>
<P>
 "Louise's has the buying power that a single restaurant doesn't have," adds 
Vincenti, "and now I have that buying power. I can buy 1,000 wheels of cheese 
instead of 5 or 10 or 20. Now I can put my hand on the table and say, ' This is 
going to be the price.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Chait and Vincenti also went chef shopping. They plan to bring one of Italy's 
top chefs back with them. "It's not a guest-chef deal," says Chait, who won't 
give the new chef's name until the deal is firm. "We are going to create an 
ongoing consulting agreement where he comes over for a few months out of the 
year and works in all of the restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 And will Louise's customers even notice a difference in the food? "My 
experience has been people are wedded to the way they are getting things so it 
will take a lot of time to adjust," says Chait. The new menu will be in effect 
in May. "But the day we start using Reggiano in a dish instead of the domestic 
cheese we've been using, there will be a big flavor difference. I can't imagine 
anyone saying, 'Gee, this doesn't taste good.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 HOG HEAVEN: How much would you tip for a burger and fries? At Thunder 
Roadhouse, it's not unusual for customers to leave 30% or even more. But don't 
get the idea that L.A. diners are big tippers. It's just that the boutique 
biker restaurant is dimly lit and its hard to read the fine print on the check: 
A 15% service charge is automatically added to the bill. And no one bothers to 
mention it when they hand it to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 15% service charge is separated out in the itemized guest check, 
it's not on the credit card slip. But there is a space left to add an 
additional tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our credit card vouchers are not set up (to itemize the service charge)," 
says manager Andrew Burton, "but we wrote it on the menu, and it's itemized on 
the guest check." According to Burton, Thunder Roadhouse began adding on a 
European-style service charge about three weeks after the restaurant opened 
last year because many of its customers are European tourists and they weren't 
tipping. "We can't have our servers working for minimum wage."

 OPENINGS: Another Jerry's Famous Deli opens in Beverly Hills on Tuesday. . . . 
Nick Nickolas, who owns restaurants in Hawaii, Chicago and Boca Raton, has now 
opened Nick's Miami Beach, the largest restaurant in America. The $7-million, 
30,000-square-foot restaurant/nightclub seats 1,000. The eclectic menu features 
fresh fish and seafood with the average dinner check in the $28 to $34 range. . 
. . Irwins Grill, which closed in 1989, has reopened in its former location on 
5th and Spring in downtown Los Angeles. . . . A third Corleone's has opened on 
Rose Avenue in Venice (the others are on Melrose in Los Angeles and in West 
Hollywood on Sunset).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 STILL OPEN: Although it was reported in this column that Trigo had closed, 
general manager Robert G. Yeager informs us the West Hollywood restaurant is 
still going strong and has even expanded its menu.

BASINGER VS. 'HELENA': THE VERDICTS ARE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Is She the Villain -- or a Victim," by Judy Brennan (Jan. 2): 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that after receiving a unanimous jury verdict in Superior 
Court we are now compelled to defend ourselves in the media against Kim 
Basinger's attempt to justify her irresponsible and unprofessional conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger did not just "consider taking the role" of Helena, as your article 
states. She committed herself legally and morally both orally and in writing, 
according to a jury of her peers. Her breach and subsequent denial of this 
agreement are what landed her in her current situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stardom in Hollywood carries numerous benefits, including wealth and power -- 
the power to command a cover story in the Sunday Calendar section, one that is 
no more than slick PR. With that power many stars forget that they must abide 
by the same rules that govern all people. Although they are seldom called to 
task for their transgressions, in this case one was. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we to sympathize with Basinger as a victim? How about the producers of 
"Boxing Helena," who have devoted years of their lives and are now being forced 
to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to stand up for their rights? After 
winning a hard-fought battle in court, we continue to be denied the amends 
Basinger should make -- an apology and a check. 
</P>
<P>
 To respond to all of the calculated, one-sided inaccuracies in the article 
would require more space than the article itself, and frankly few people, we 
expect, would have the patience to revisit them point by point. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say that Main Line Pictures has no desire to interfere with 
Basinger's family plans. We simply seek to be paid what we are owed. Basinger 
and her attorneys are distorting the truth to sensationalize, to create 
unwarranted sympathy for Basinger and to attempt to avoid her obligation to pay 
her debts to not only Main Line Pictures but all of her other legitimate 
creditors.

</P>
<P>
 Having been the presiding juror for the Kim Basinger-Main Line Pictures case, 
I feel obligated to point out some misconceptions in your article. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Basinger's self-proclaimed innocence was, quite simply, contrary 
to the evidence presented, which ultimately resulted in the verdict of the 
jury. The decision was unanimous. Furthermore, you mention that Basinger never 
signed a long-form acting agreement, but what you neglected to mention is that 
she never signed seven of the long-form agreements (contracts) for her previous 
nine movies! 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the assertion that the jury ignored the court's instruction 
regarding damages is simply not true. The difficulty of estimating damages lies 
in the believability of "expert" witnesses. Not surprisingly, the experts were 
on opposite sides of the spectrum when estimating the possible net profits from 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement attributed to juror Chawn Sanders -- that she didn't understand 
how the jurors could be invited to the premiere of a movie that the producer 
didn't have enough money to complete -- is absurd. The jury viewed the movie as 
evidence! 
</P>
<P>
 The assertion that the judge did not allow Basinger's attorneys to provide 
evidence with respect to industry practices is hogwash. Both sides spent a 
great deal of time explaining how Hollywood operates. I learned enough about 
the business to know that I chose the right career path. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, I would like to comment on the actions of the court clerk. In my 
opinion, her actions, however inappropriate they may have been, simply have no 
bearing on the case. Her actions happened long after the trial was over. The 
jury never had any knowledge of the clerk's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 I still believe that the jury's decision was correct, and that the judgment 
for damages was fair.

 If Hollywood has a blacklist, this so-called producer Carl Mazzocone should 
top it. Basinger has been done a great injustice by some greedy wanna-be, who 
didn't have the guts to sue Madonna (she has so many millions she would've 
chewed him up and spit him out). 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer-producer, you learn rather quickly in this town that a so-called 
deal isn't a deal until it's signed, sealed and delivered. One day you have a 
major star, production company and major studio interested in your film, and 
the next week or month, you're back to square one. A gamble you take, and pay 
for, just by being in this business. When things fall through, you pick up and 
start over again. 
</P>
<P>
 What this guy has done to screenwriters and producers is make it harder than 
hell to get a star to commit to your project. He's not only robbed Basinger of 
millions, but he's robbed other up-and-coming writers and producers of their 
opportunities. It's a shame. And it's a shame that our judicial system is so 
star-struck that it can't deal in the realities of filmmaking and how the deal 
is really made. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger was just doing what hundreds of major stars have done for years: She 
believed in a project and wanted to be involved but after serious thought and 
discussion with her representation decided it was not the best thing for her to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 I've got news for Mazzocone: "Boxing Helena," Basinger starring or not, would 
not have made him anywhere near $8 million. It lost money because it wasn't a 
good film. Not even the great publicity and hype he created with the case could 
get people to go see it.

 I read with interest and delight about the decision against Basinger. I assume 
this means that I, as an actress, can sue all of the producers, directors or 
production companies that have verbally promised me roles, only to renege once 
Demi-Julia-Jodie-Michelle became affordable or available. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, I could start with the director who promised me that big role in . 
. . well, there's too many to even begin, and besides, I'm not sure it works 
both ways. However, now that I think I understand the judicial system, the 
possibilities seem limitless. I and thousands of other actresses stand to make 
millions, n'est-ce pas ? Perhaps Carl Mazzocone's attorneys would represent us, 
on a pro-quid basis, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the ultimate outcome, I'm quite certain that Basinger is absolutely 
thrilled that 1993, the so-called Year of the Woman, has finally come to a 
screeching halt.

<P>
 I do not profess to understand the legal nuances of the Basinger case, but I 
do know that I became a fan of hers last spring, when amid all of her trials 
and tribulation, Basinger took the time to personally write a letter of 
congratulations to the Taft High School academic decathlon team. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she lives in Woodland Hills, she expressed her pride in the 
accomplishments of her "home" school, the value and worth of academic studies 
and the importance of acknowledging Taft's success. For that I commend her -- 
along with the good sense in trying to extricate herself from a ridiculous

 I found your one-sided article on Basinger to be utterly ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 You gleefully pointed out that "Boxing Helena" bombed at the box office, in a 
ruthless attack against director Jennifer Lynch and Main Line Pictures, as if 
they were the villains. They had all legal right to sue Basinger for breach of 
contract; the fact that Basinger is famous does not give her the right to break 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Basinger's tacky comment about Lynch and Main Line being "wanna-bes" 
concerning Hollywood, let me remind her that she hasn't had a box-office hit in 
years. So I guess that qualifies her as a "has-been," right?

 I can't believe that so many words were wasted on an article about Basinger. 
She's overhyped and under-talented, and her marrying Alec Baldwin was the 
biggest so-what of '93. I think she and Hollywood are definitely overestimating 
her popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 With some irreplaceable losses in '93, your first cover of '94 could have been 
put to much better use.

 I was surprised to read in your profile of Kim Basinger that she is still 
puzzled why her actions infringed the rights of producer Carl Mazzocone. One 
would think that after sitting through the trial she would understand the legal 
principles involved even if she did not agree with the jury's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 This case sets no legal precedents. The producer sued for breach of a written 
contract in the form of a letter deal memo. While the attorneys were 
negotiating the terms of the long-form contract, which would spell out the 
details, Basinger changed her mind and reneged on the deal. Mazzocone then did 
something that is rare in Hollywood -- he sued a star. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood today there are many producers with scripts chasing a limited 
number of stars. Stars are sought because the companies that finance movies 
believe that a star's involvement will reduce financial risk (a questionable 
assumption) and help distribute and market a film. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the stars, and their agents, largely determine which projects get 
made. Producers ardently flatter, cajole and woo stars to obtain their 
participation. Perhaps that is why some stars come to believe that the ordinary 
rules of commerce don't apply to them. MARK LITWAK

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; 'IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT'S' DENISE NICHOLAS FINDS THE 
POSITIVE IN PAST AND PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite her current visibility on "In the Heat of the Night," Denise Nicholas 
says that fans always want to talk about her past -- specifically, "Room 222." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicholas, who played counselor Liz McIntyre on ABC's landmark "Room 222" 
series from 1969 to 1974, doesn't mind. " 'Room 222" had a positive attitude 
about an integrated high school with an integrated teaching staff," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Integration is also a crucial element to her "Heat" role. For three seasons 
she has played City Councilwoman Harriet DeLong, the love interest of Carroll 
O'Connor's Sheriff Bill Gillespie. Marriage is rumored to be in their future. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 98% of our mail is positive," she says, "but since it's about an 
interracial romance and we shoot in Covington, Ga. (the show is set in 
Mississippi), there have been some negatives." 
</P>
<P>
 She cites the experience of the show's prop man in a small gun store on 
location. He "was told -- in no uncertain terms -- that the 'fan' was not happy 
about the direction the show was going in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Nicholas says, "People in real life are much farther along than they are 
on television. Interracial romance is not that shocking to anybody. Daytime 
soaps deal in it heavily. It's not really new business. As an actor and 
traveling around, I'm really actually surprised at the joy that people seem to 
find in talking about it. People get giddy almost over it and say, 'Keep it 
up!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas, a native of Detroit, developed an early interest in the stage. She 
performed with a theatrical group throughout Mississippi and Louisiana during 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to New York, she worked off-Broadway before landing a role in "Room 
222." The Emmy Award-winning series, which she says was a product of the 
turbulent '60s, offered "hope, right there on nighttime TV, that it would all 
work out. It dealt with the issues of the day and there hadn't been too many 
shows that did that before then." 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite role, however, was opposite Bill Cosby in the Sidney 
Poitier-directed "Let's Do It Again" in 1975. "I crack myself up in that 
movie," she says, giggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Other movie roles include another Cosby vehicle, "Ghost Dad," which Poitier 
also directed. Nicholas also guest-starred in "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper," "The 
Cosby Show" and its spinoff, "A Different World." 
</P>
<P>
 She's been nominated for three NAACP Image awards for her "Heat" role, and won 
four NAACP Image awards for her performances in two Poitier films ("Let's Do It 
Again" and "Piece of the Action"), as well as for guest-starring roles on 
"Police Story" and "The Paper Chase." She'll be a presenter at this year's 26th 
annual show, which airs Jan. 22 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas has authored six episodes of "In the Heat of the Night." This season 
she's written one script and collaborated with O'Connor, who is also executive 
producer, on another to air later in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, she's working on a screenplay that incorporates her favorite 
aspects of film: politics and romance. Moreover, Nicholas hopes that her 
writing credits will prove her abilities to other producers who might give her 
the same opportunity O'Connor has. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the thing to do is to convince the industry that it's a general talent I 
have and that I can write for other things," she says. "That's the thing about 
this business, you're always convincing other people you can do things other 
than what you are doing at that moment." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Heat of the Night" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on CBS. Repeats air daily 
at 3 p.m. on KTLA and at 6 p.m. on KTTY. "The 26th Annual NAACP Image Awards" 
airs Jan. 22 at 11:30 p.m. on NBC.

PROFILE; THE CAB DRIVER WITHIN; GEORGE CARLIN PLAYS A VERSION OF HIMSELF IN A 
NEW FOX SITCOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another popular stand-up comedian has ventured into the world of TV sitcom. 
But he's not just another stand-up. The venerable George Carlin bows as the 
star and co-executive producer of his new comedy series, simply titled "The 
George Carlin Show," premiering Sunday on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Carlin about the genesis of the series and he gives what he calls "a 
many-layered answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlin, 56, has wanted to be an actor since he was a kid growing up on New 
York City's Upper West Side. His idols were movie clowns Danny Kaye and Bob 
Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was acting," explains Carlin, relaxing behind the desk of his 
comfortable production office in Brentwood. "I wanted to be an actor, so I 
(thought) I would become a deejay, a comedian and then they would let me be an 
actor. That was my childhood trilogy of what would happen. My life would have 
three stages." 
</P>
<P>
 Radio and stand-up came easily to Carlin. The acting didn't. "In the late 
'60s, I got a chance to do (the TV series) 'That Girl' and a movie with Doris 
Day called 'With Six You Get Eggroll.' I did auditions and screen tests." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Carlin admits, he was horrible -- nervous and filled with anxiety. "I 
didn't know how to do it," he says. "I had no experience or training. I saw 
that dream ending." 
</P>
<P>
 But as his acting ambitions evaporated, Carlin's stand-up career took off. By 
the late '60s, he left mainstream comedy and cultivated his outsider personae 
-- "my sort of out-of-step malcontent; my outlaw self, which I really had been 
most of my life. I let my hair grow. I got into what people call counterculture 
comedy, but actually it's just personal comedy with political overtones. That 
made me a big success. It was on my own terms. The acting thing was put way 
over on the side." 
</P>
<P>
 By the late '70s, Carlin was receiving "vague" offers to do TV series. But he 
turned them down, opting to do cutting-edge, uncensored comedy specials for 
HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to have anything to do with commercial TV," he says. "I 
had a career that was different. I had an attitude about commercial TV and 
sitcoms." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, Carlin was becoming more comfortable with the idea of giving 
acting another try. "I am feeling maybe I am a little more down the road 
personally and internally and some of the blocks will be gone. I will be able 
to act. Let me try to put that acting thing to work. So eventually 'Outrageous 
Fortune,' 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' and 'The Prince of Tides' came 
along. And I feel comfortable with this. Certainly I can hold my own." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1991, he even joined the cast of the popular PBS children's 
series "Shining Time Station" in the role of the diminutive Mr. Conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these parts will turn into bigger parts in the movies," Carlin 
recalls. "I am still thinking like a child. Now, they will give me second and 
third leads. I can be a funny sidekick and then I'll get my own movie." 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't work out that way. "They found me to be a very acceptable 
marquee bit player, almost a glorified cameo. They didn't want to offer me 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Carlin did two more critically acclaimed HBO specials. His 
last one, the in-your-face, outrageous "Jammin' in New York," garnered amazing 
reviews and ratings. Carlin subsequently received a CableACE award and an Emmy 
nomination for the 1992 show. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (special) kicks me up to a higher gear," Carlin says. "And for the past 
four or five years since Fox began, they have been coming to me to do a show, a 
sitcom. My reaction was similar to my old reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the years went by, Carlin says, "the offers keep getting a little 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Fox threw the name of producer-writer Sam Simon into the mix. 
Simon was involved with the TV classics 'Taxi," "Cheers," "The Tracey Ullman 
Show" and "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very smart and funny," Carlin says. "He didn't necessarily want to do 
anything. He had left 'The Simpsons' and didn't have the desire to do anything 
immediately. So here we were, two people who don't want to anything. Fox 
thought, 'Let's put these two guys together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carlin knew what elements he didn't want in the series. "We knew it wasn't 
going to have a living room in it. No kids. No neighbor that doesn't knock. No 
working mom. No single dad. No widows from another continent. None of that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But what co-executive producer Simon created for Carlin is a variation of his 
famous malcontent character. Carlin's George O'Grady is a middle-aged, 
part-time New York cab driver and philosopher who lives in a working-class 
neighborhood on the Upper West Side. His favorite hangout is a rundown 
neighborhood tavern where his friends love to listen to his opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 The series is "very close to my own inner truth," Carlin says. "He's one of 
the people I might've become in my life if I'd stayed in the neighborhood. We 
all have alternative lives we might've led. It just fit right." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Carlin doesn't feel like the outsider. "One of the interesting 
things about being an outsider is the longing to belong. It's a paradox. All of 
my life, there's been a need to belong to something and be recognized. I've 
joined a kind of club. I've joined the network commercial TV club and in a way, 
there's more respectability." 
</P>
<P>
 "The George Carlin Show" premieres Sunday at 9:30 p.m. on Fox.

ON THE SET; BASED ON THE BIZARRE; ABC ADAPTS STORY OF FBI AGENT WHO ROMANCES 
AND THEN KILLS HIS INFORMANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plot of Monday's ABC movie "Betrayed by Love" is so bizarre and sordid, it 
could only be based on fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Avery (Steven Weber), a handsome, ambitious, married FBI agent, has a 
torrid affair with his key informant, Deanne (Patricia Arquette). When she 
becomes pregnant with his child, Avery sees his life and career unraveling 
before his eyes. In a rage, he strangles Deanne, hides her in the trunk of his 
car and then throws her nude body off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 No one believes Avery murdered Deanne except her older married sister Dana 
(Mare Winningham), who goes on a one-woman crusade to bring Avery to justice. 
The FBI agent on whom Avery's character is based is serving out a 16-year 
sentence in a federal prison and eligible for parole in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Arquette, Rosanna's baby sister who starred in the 1993 features "Ethan Frome" 
and "True Romance," doesn't think "Betrayed by Love" is the typical true-life 
TV-movie fare audiences seem to crave. Besides, Arquette has a special fondness 
for TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something I loved about TV when I was little," she says, puffing on a 
cigarette in an empty set at the Don Carlos Studios in Dwntown Los Angeles, 
where the production is filming this day. "We would say: 'Let's wait up and see 
the movie-of-the-week.' It was very exciting. It was a big deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia, though, wasn't the only reason Arquette was drawn to the project. 
"First of all, it's well-written," she says shyly. "It has really good dialogue 
that was interesting to me." 
</P>
<P>
 She also "felt" for Deanne. "I wanted her story to be told, but in a realistic 
way because she is a real person. You know, she does things that are not 'good' 
or 'attractive.' She is confusing, but she's a real person. What it boils down 
to is that it's never OK to kill someone." 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a little bit of Deanne in Arquette. "Yet I know with my moral 
code, certain things could drive me to murder. She's somebody who has a really 
hard life and not a good situation and is looking for something more. She has 
two kids and lives with her ex-husband. She's collecting welfare from two 
different states." 
</P>
<P>
 And Deanne, who feels trapped in her small Southern hometown (the real events 
occurred in Kentucky), is something of a free spirit. "She has her own 
sexuality. It's not really acceptable in this society. She wants more. The man 
she falls in love with, he is also very forward-motivated, too. I think that is 
attractive for her to meet a man who is looking for more in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Arquette, executive producer Edgar Scherick was impressed with Alan 
Sharpe's script. But primarily he fell in love with Deanne. "She has such a 
devil-may-care attitude about everything," he says. "She had an essential 
honesty about her own needs. She seemed like an essentially honest, desirably 
funny kind of tragic kind of character." 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy Award-winning Winningham ("Amber Waves") was eager to work with 
Arquette because she'd been a fan since Arquette's role as a pregnant wife in 
Sean Penn's 1991 film "The Indian Runner." 
</P>
<P>
 But Winningham almost didn't do the film because it was a fact-based drama. "I 
have a hate-hate relationship with true stories," she explains between takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Winningham got her first taste of docudrama when she starred 
in the ABC movie "Love and Lies," in which she played an undercover cop who 
falls for the man she's trying to send to jail. Though she vowed then she'd 
never do another drama of that genre, Winningham liked the "Love and Lies" 
script, which also was written by Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That had some of the best writing I have ever had the opportunity to act. 
When I heard he wrote this, I was interested." 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, Winningham says, true-life stories wouldn't become TV 
movies. "People are making money. It's not the people who are selling 
themselves. I understand their reasons for that, but there are all sorts of 
people who are brought (into the project). I had a little bit of a close 
encounter (with the real person) on 'Love and Lies.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She avoided talking or meeting with the real Dana. "I'm sure something would 
give me the willies and I would question why I did it. If I talked to somebody, 
somebody would end up saying: 'I had no say in my life being exploited this 
way.' I personally would just go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Arquette, though, did as much research as she could. "I would have liked to 
have done a lot more, but I wasn't allowed for legal reasons," she says. "I 
care a lot about it being a real story. Not that I wanted to do a docudrama and 
run around saying everything exactly the same. But it's nice to check things 
out as much as you can, so that you can explore and get a feeling of someone's 
spirit, someone's heart. Why they needed what they needed. What they looked at 
in the morning when they woke up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Betrayed by Love" airs Monday at 9 p.m. on ABC.

RETRO; MAKING HEADROOM FOR MAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bravo has gone to the Max. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable channel started airing repeats this month of "Max Headroom," the 
innovative 14-part series that originally appeared on ABC in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Max Headroom" is the second cult series resurrected by Bravo. Last year it 
gave new life to David Lynch's 1990-92 "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the future, "Max Headroom" finds the world to be a pretty grim place. 
Crime, corruption and television are everywhere. More than 4,000 channels are 
battling for viewers. Television is such a force, it's illegal to turn off 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Max Headroom, a computer-generated character on Channel 23, who pops up 
on the screen at any time to make sarcastic comments. Max, played by Canadian 
actor Matt Frewer, is the creation of a young computer genius named Bryce 
(Chris Young), who models him after the station's ace reporter, Edison Carter 
(also played by Frewer). Amanda Pays ("The Flash") plays Theora Jones, Carter's 
beautiful assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Frewer, who went on to star in the sitcoms "Doctor, Doctor" and "Shaky 
Ground," hasn't seen the series since it went off the air because of poor 
ratings on Oct. 16, 1987. "I try not to watch things I have done in the past," 
he says. "I think it is a good idea to move on. I don't begrudge the 'Max 
Headroom' phase because it was obviously a wonderful thing to do and an amazing 
opportunity to be able to come to the States with it, playing a dual lead in 
the series. Also, the character seemed to carve out its little niche in TV 
history. I am very proud." 
</P>
<P>
 His association with Max Headroom actually began in England in 1984. Frewer 
had studied acting there and was working in London's West End theater district. 
His career changed radically when he was hired by Chrysalis Records to play 
Max, a computerized veejay who would introduce the record label's videos. Max 
became so popular, he was given his own irreverent talk show (seen in the 
United States on premium cable's Cinemax). Before getting his own U.S. series, 
Max became a spokesman for Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Frewer says, people think Max really was computer generated -- 
"just a cartoon." In England, Frewer was encouraged not to leak anything to the 
press on how Max was created. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, like, dazzle them with a little bit of fancy footwork that it was 
created by a computer generator and effects, just to kind of blanket the fact 
there was a guy under there. Eventually, that became more and more difficult to 
do. In England, I was going through a 4 1/2-hour makeup process and over here, 
it was 2-1/2 hours. It became a strict case of credit where credit was due. I 
wanted to come out of the rubber closet, as it were. So I hired a publicist!"

 In hindsight, Frewer believes the U.S. series was probably ahead of its time. 
"It seemed to spawn a few shows, and the looks of a few shows that seemed to 
take a leaf out of the 'Max Headroom' book. 'Max Headroom' took a leaf out of 
'Blade Runner's' book. I think 'Max' was a fairly dangerous thing to have on 
the networks' doorstep. All power to ABC for being brave enough to put it on 
because it was about a TV network. We were definitely tipping the hat of what 
was going on at the networks at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Max Headroom" airs Fridays at 5 p.m. and repeats Sundays at 7 p.m. on Bravo.

THE ENGLISH VARIETY OF SMOKE AND FOG: SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Business section article "The Spin Doctors: Flywheels Seen as Key to a 
Practical Electric Vehicle" (Jan. 6) suggests that the word smog was invented 
in the L.A. Basin. If so, then it was certainly coined independently in London 
and was current at least as early as just after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Smog was the contraction of smoke and fog. When a good London fog coincided 
with an inversion layer, and the smoke from power stations, locomotives and the 
then-ubiquitous domestic open-grate coal fires could not escape, the result was 
a black, acrid atmosphere. The so-called killer smog of 1952, which lasted 
nearly a week, was blamed for some 4,000 deaths and resulted in legislation 
making the greater London area a smoke-free zone. London is now free from smog, 
English variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, our chemically different smog from quite different causes is 
much less easy to get rid of.

PATENT RE-EXAMINATION OF COMPTON'S CLARIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is intense industry and media interest ("Government to Re-Examine Patent 
Award to Compton's," Dec. 17) in my decision to order a re-examination of a 
patent awarded to Compton's New Media in August, and I would like to make sure 
everyone is clear about why my decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimedia industry's reaction to Compton's multimedia patent did not spur 
re-examination of the patent.Rather, the industry reaction led to a review of 
the patent. 
</P>
<P>
 During the review, prior art (any invention or publicly available information 
in the field of the invention) was found that had not been considered during 
the first examination of the patent. It was on the basis of this newly 
discovered prior art that I determined a re-examination was in order. 
</P>
<P>
 In the story on the re-examination, your reporter quotes me as saying that 
"the Bush people said that there was no problem, but there clearly is a problem 
with the Compton's multimedia patent." This is not an accurate statement, as 
the Compton patent was awarded after the Bush Administration had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 What I was telling the reporter was that the Bush Administration had no 
problem overall with the issuance of patents for computer software-related 
inventions. I believe there are concerns regarding these inventions that need 
to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to do this, the Patent and Trademark Office is sponsoring public 
hearings in January in California (Jan. 26-27, San Jose Convention Center) and 
in February in Virginia to seek input on whether changes in the framework of 
intellectual property laws used to protect software are appropriate. All 
interested parties are invited to testify and-or supply written comments.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: SECOND -- EVEN THIRD -- THOUGHTS ON CIRCUMCISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before our child was born, my husband and I had some pretty spirited 
"discussions" about circumcision. In fact, that was how I persuaded him we 
needed to know the sex of our baby. If we were bringing home a boy, I reasoned, 
we would require several months to duke out our circumcision dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 The debates went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Me: "We aren't Jewish, we aren't Muslim. We have no religious or cultural 
reasons for circumcising." 
</P>
<P>
 Him: "But he would be different. All the other children would laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Me: "Lots of kids are uncircumcised these days. Anyhow, you don't think we can 
raise a child to accept a minor difference like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Him: "But he wouldn't look like me. That could be traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Me: "You don't think snipping off his foreskin without anesthesia is 
traumatic?"  
</P>
<P>
 And so on, back and forth, until we got the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I recently received a letter from John, a 47-year-old Burbank accountant. His 
letter was in response to a column about Lorena Bobbitt, who cut off her 
husband's penis last June. He also enclosed a news story about a local woman 
who had castrated her husband with shears as he slept. John underlined what the 
prosecutor in that case said: that malicious mutilation of men's sexual organs 
probably happens more often than we know. 
</P>
<P>
 To John's way of thinking, malicious mutilation includes circumcision. He 
recently notified the Santa Monica hospital where he was born in 1946 that he 
is filing a claim for unspecified damages because of the suffering caused by 
his circumcision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is child abuse to mutilate," John said. "Nobody asked me for my consent, 
hence the claim for damages. . . . I have suffered severe emotional distress as 
a result of my mutilation." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital does not comment on pending claims. But a risk management 
consultant familiar with the law said adult patients have a year from the date 
of the incident or the date of its discovery to file a claim, while children 
have until the age of 19. Neither would appear to cover John's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 John reached his conclusions about circumcision alone, unaware of the avid and 
growing anti-circumcision movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-circumcision activists such as Marilyn Milos -- who founded the San 
Anselmo, Calif.-based National Organization of Circumcision Information 
Resource Centers (NOCIRC) -- maintain that foreskin is healthy, sexually 
functioning tissue; that cutting it away is painful and violent, can lead to 
infection and other complications, and is morally wrong because a baby cannot 
give consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Circumcision, Milos said, "is where sex and violence meet for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 40% of baby boys 
nationwide are left intact. Worldwide, the figure is 85%. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys who are not circumcised for religious reasons are usually circumcised for 
cultural reasons -- it has been routine in this country for 50 years -- or 
because their parents believe circumcision is healthier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although for a time the health issue was dismissed, recent studies show that 
uncircumcised males may experience greater risk of urinary tract infections 
during the first year of life, although such infections are easily treated with 
antibiotics. Although penile cancer is quite rare, it is more common in 
uncircumcised men. Also, studies looking at a higher incidence of cervical 
cancer in women whose partners are uncircumcised are inconclusive, according to 
the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the academy recommended against routine circumcisions as medically 
unnecessary during the '70s and '80s, it shifted into neutral in 1989. Now it 
maintains that the decision is up to parents, who should be fully informed of 
the pros and cons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It might be tempting to dismiss guys like John as men's movement extremists 
who are whining about something they should just get over. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is difficult to feel that way after talking to R. Wayne Griffiths, a 
soft-spoken 60-year-old construction inspector in Concord, Calif. Four years 
ago, he founded RECAP, a support and information group for men interested in 
restoring their foreskins. Although some have referred to men such as Griffiths 
as "foreskin fundamentalists," there is nothing preachy about his tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out trying to get converts," Griffiths said. "We just provide 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring foreskin can be done in a few ways. Griffiths used a technique 
called "taping and traction," in which the skin of the shaft is stretched over 
the glans over a period of several months. The same results can be accomplished 
with surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he reversed his circumcision, Griffiths said he always felt "very 
naked." His skin was often chafed, underwear was uncomfortable. And sex, he 
said, "was a labor . . . and there was not much feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few weeks of the reversal, he said, his skin had become more 
sensitive. When I asked if that had made a difference in his sex life -- and 
bear in mind that he's been married 30 years -- he exclaimed: "Oh wow! Yes! It 
was just delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I am whole again." 
</P>
<P>
 How can you argue with that?

GALLERY: SOLO PURSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saxophonist Hank Crawford once paid photographer Paula Ross the ultimate 
compliment: "Your camera is your ax." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Paula Ross' work -- like Sarah Vaughn caught holding the last note of 
her last performance -- is a sentimental ode to an era slowly shimmering out of 
focus.Her hand-colored photos of jazz musicians and torch-song divas frozen in 
the drama of performance are her attempt to document not simply the music, but 
the emotions that accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody to replace the sound," Ross says. "Photos are one of the few 
things to keep them alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross has kept jazzmen's hours for as long as she can remember. When she was 8 
and living in New Jersey, she was up all night listening to Symphony Sid. By 
14, she was making the rounds of New York's jazz rooms with her "very hip" 
boyfriend. Although it wasn't until she moved to Venice in 1986 that she began 
taking her camera to clubs, it now seems only fitting that she's up till all 
hours bent over images of her heroes: "There is just me and the silence and 
these people." 
</P>
<P>
 The process is more staining than painting, says Ross, who works transparent 
photo-oils into the print's emulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I'm working on the print with my fingers, I feel I make a spiritual 
connection with that person." The colors, she says, "just come from the 
memories. Tones I've seen from the past. The culmination is what they inspire." 
</P>
<P>
 People ask all the time how can she " just " shoot jazz. "The '50s were when I 
grew up. And these are the musicians who sustained me. This is like my band," 
she says. "And when the musicians like my work, I know I'm on it. " LYNELL

CAMARADERIE IN BEING 'VICTIMS OF LOVE'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now I think I understand why so many women run to Cro-Magnon jerks even though 
they profess to yearn for loving, secure, strong-yet-vulnerable, sensitive men 
("Loves Me, Loves Me Not!" Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 The ladies want something to complain about when they're with their 
girlfriends.If all her friends are "victims of love," a woman will feel like a 
nun in a nudist camp if her guy isn't a jerk and she's actually happy.  
</P>
<P>
 Will a woman risk alienating her girlfriends and losing their support in their 
all-guys-are-jerks sorority to have a healthy, wonderful and satisfying 
relationship with a guy who adores her? Or will she continue to date turds she 
and her girlfriends can whine about? 
</P>
<P>
 For every woman who whines about what primates all her boyfriends have been, 
there are 100 guys waiting to fulfill her dreams of Mr. Right. But, nahhh. 
She'd probably find them too boring.

everything -- every idea, every person. It seems to me that it's time to get 
back to what counts. And that's doing a job well, caring for others and 
children. Maybe it's just that I like looking in the national mirror, 
television, and seeing us young again."

COMPUTERS WON'T TAKE A BYTE OUT OF RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The Era of Fragments" (Jan. 2), I feel the need to comment on 
something often heard in the glowing talk about communication via computer 
network. Howard Reingold of the Whole Earth Review repeats the overly 
optimistic view that computers are "a healing tool in our increasingly 
fragmented society." 
</P>
<P>
 Racism and bigotry divide our society, and we should not look to computers nor 
put our hopes in them for answers. The bigot and racist will not gain 
enlightenment by going on-line. Those who accept people will continue to do so 
by computer and in person. Those who are prejudiced will not be convinced of 
their antisocial behavior or compelled to change it by communicating via modem. 
</P>
<P>
 Only face-to-face human interaction with those unlike ourselves can bring a 
true understanding to the closed-minded in our midst.

THE AUTHOR DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was truly rich reading David Streitfeld's article on the continuing 
controversy that surrounds Carlin Romano's book review in the Nation of 
Catharine MacKinnon's latest work of psycho-fiction ("Does Rape in Words Equal 
Rape in Deed?" Jan. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of MacKinnon's shock and outrage at Romano's essay is too sweet, as 
it comes from a woman who has branded the producers of erotica as "Nazis" and 
attacked feminists who oppose her censorship as "Uncle Toms." 
</P>
<P>
 MacKinnon has used words to inflict ridicule, injury and hate upon people too 
many times to count. Her protest reeks of an intellectual terrorist crying foul 
on the front lines.

 Rapists should be executed. Women who cut off men's penises should be hanged. 
And the editors who caused Catharine MacKinnon's book, "Only Words," to be 
reviewed should be put in stocks and pelted with water-filled condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The intelligent thing to do with a book that has a premise as ridiculous as 
hers is to ignore it.

FINDING THE GOOD IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a contrast. In two days you feature the columns by Robin Abcarian ("Just 
When You Think You're Not Afraid of Los Angeles," Jan. 5) and Beverly Beyette 
("All About Sue and Jay's Excellent Midlife Adventure," Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Abcarian heard gunfire on New Year's Eve and recites the many incidents of 
crime in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she drives a circuitous route avoiding Lincoln Boulevard, rarely goes to 
her local market and is afraid to vote in person or attend a community meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue and Jay German moved from Mar Vista to West Adams, met their neighbors, 
and have Easter egg hunts and block parties. 
</P>
<P>
 When they hear a police helicopter, they go outside to see if everyone is all 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, they enjoy their urban neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin, take it from a 63-year-old lifelong resident of another Los Angeles 
inner-city neighborhood, Silver Lake: While all large, diverse American cities 
are dangerous, they are also vibrant and endlessly fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, there are millions of people living in cities who have never been 
robbed, never been mugged and never been shot at, and these people go out every 
day and talk to their neighbors, enjoy the sunshine and participate in the life 
of the city.

 The fine white sand stretches for 75 yards. Two stone formations nudging into 
the water form a secluded cove where the bluest water imaginable laps lazily 
against the beach. Above the cove, groves of olive trees stretch toward the 
heavens. The turquoise sky is cloudless. The golden sun is beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 I close my eyes, tip my head back in the cool, crystal-clear water and for a 
moment think, "This must be Greece. Where's my ouzo?" But as I pop my head 
above a gentle wave, my eyes open on a ruggedly beautiful land that nonetheless 
has symbolized isolation and political tyranny for nearly 50 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Albania.  
</P>
<P>
 The world's most Communist nation -- and Europe's last unbeaten tourist path 
-- only recently opened its crumbling doors to outsiders for the first time 
since World War II. Even my pristine beach, where I am virtually alone, even 
though it's one of the most beautiful in Europe, displays reminders of 
Albania's bleak history. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting above the rocks, like heavily armed sentries, are two round, 
steel-reinforced concrete machine-gun bunkers. Enver Hoxha, the Stalinist 
dictator who ruled Albania with an iron fist from 1944 until his death in 1985, 
had 600,000 such bunkers scattered throughout the country to protect against 
outsiders. Any outsiders. Albania was the world's first officially atheist 
state, a nation so Communist it broke ties with the Soviet Union and China for 
what Hoxha called "revisionism."  
</P>
<P>
 No citizen could leave; no one except Albanians and an occasional Communist 
dignitary could enter. "There were two jails," says Gezim Karapici, a professor 
at the Polytechnic University of Tirana, in the Albanian capital. "One 
materialistic prison, and the other was the border of Albania."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That, finally, has changed. After massive civil unrest two years ago against 
Ramiz Alia, Hoxha's successor, the Communist government fell in open elections. 
The Democratic Party took over in the summer of 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 It also took over massive problems, but Karapici is one of many Albanians who 
sees a way out through tourism. He says Albania's beaches are better than 
anything in Greece. The mountain scenery as stunning as anywhere in southern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 I tend to agree. Albania can be a tourist attraction. (But, make no mistake, 
it isn't yet.) In a world where McDonald's are popping up around Red Square, 
Albania is one of the last bastions of unspoiled beauty. I've seen many 
versions of beauty spoiled, and a few slivers of real paradise, in my travels. 
But Albania had always been a strange obsession. When people would ask why I've 
always wanted to see it, I always replied, "How much do you know about 
Albania?" Their usual response: "Nothing."  
</P>
<P>
 That's why I went. Of the 44 countries I've visited as an adult, I found 
Albania by far the most fascinating, the most unspoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 But to find paradise, be prepared to find hardship. In Albania, natural 
splendor crashes head on with poverty unmatched anywhere in Europe. Beautiful 
beaches lie below crumbling, dank villages. Spectacular mountains rise over 
broken-down hotels. Emerald rivers are reached only by narrow, dangerous, 
pock-marked roads. Undeterred, the new minister of tourism, Edmond Spaho, 
declares, "Tourism is one of the priorities of the government."  
</P>
<P>
 Spaho is short and stocky with a mop of dark, curly hair and very tired eyes. 
He's slumped in his chair. He looks like the guy who was assigned to rebuild 
Rome. In Albania's first year after Communism in 1991, he says, 25,000 
"tourists" visited. That includes foreign investors, professors and foreign-aid 
officials. It does not include anyone off an American Express bus. In a week's 
stay in June of last year, I saw one other tourist: an Englishman visiting a 
woman working with disabled children in Korce, near Greece.  
</P>
<P>
 So why bother visiting Albania, roughly the size of Maryland and squeezed 
between Serbia and Greece? 
</P>
<P>
 Hoxha didn't leave Albania many gifts, but Mother Nature did.  
</P>
<P>
 Start with that secluded cove I occupied on the Ionian Sea near the village of 
Lukove in southern Albania, and two more untouched, white-sand beaches a few 
miles north. Southern Albania looks like Greece when Odysseus -- not Norwegian 
Cruise Lines -- sailed its islands. From the coast road high above, the sand 
stretches like a white rope for about three miles. There are no hotels. No 
houses. No souvenir stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed McCuskey, chairman of the board of TransMark International, a Texas-based 
development firm, wants to invest $20 million in Albania's dormant oil 
industry. He was visiting Albania for his fourth time in a year when I met him 
in Tirana's Hotel Dajti, through the American husband of the interpreter I had 
hired. "As you see the country," McCuskey says, "think of the trip from the 
Maui airport to Kaanapali Beach. Look at the terrain of this country and don't 
think you aren't seeing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Albania has more variety than Maui. I take a two-hour ferry ride up the 
Drini River to the village of Fierze. Water, smooth as green glass, curls 
through a deep canyon lined with nothing but trees and craggy cliffs. That's 
it. No restaurants. No boat docks. No water-skiers. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 After docking in Fierze, my driver precariously conducts myself and two others 
-- interpreter Arta Dervishi and her American-born husband, Terry Cooper -- 
along a mountain road for two hours. Without them, I might not have been able 
to see Albania's true beauty, because traveling independently through this 
still-bedraggled country is extremely difficult. From my home in Denver, it 
took three weeks of digging just to find anyone in America who had visited 
Albania. Finally, I came across Jack Morrison, the owner of a California-based 
adventure travel company, who, even though I planned to travel independently of 
a tour group, helped me arrange for a driver and interpreter.  
</P>
<P>
 But back to our mountain drive. From my high-ground vantage point, I gaze down 
and see the Valbones River, an offshoot of the Drini. The Valbones looks like a 
Swiss tourist poster. Slicing through this canyon in a series of inviting 
rapids, it's the most beautiful aquamarine river I've ever seen, and on a 
93-degree day too much to resist. We park the car, scramble down a gravel cliff 
and plunge into cool, rushing ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 The day isn't through. Another hour's drive leads us to the town of Valbona. 
Here, about five miles from the savagery in Serbia, the Albanian Alps are 
spectacular. The village of 800 is nestled in a semicircle of 8,000-foot 
mountains towering above the town. This is tribal country. For centuries, 
Albanian ethnic groups used the mountains to fend off attacks by Romans, Turks, 
Bulgars and Byzantines. Even Hoxha failed to crush these fierce people. I meet 
Cel Hysi, a deeply-tanned, 26-year-old with bushy black hair, a goatee and 
wild, piercing eyes. He looks like someone who rode with Genghis Khan.  
</P>
<P>
 He invites us through a wire fence toward his house, a small stone compound 
with brightly colored, hand-woven rugs scattered in the immaculate living room. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Over homemade bread and boreck , an Albanian staple made from dough, eggs and 
cheese, he tells how his brother-in-law is in jail for shooting another 
tribesman during a blood feud. Hysi has other problems. And his problems are 
also problems for Albanian tourism. Hysi is a waiter at the Valbona Hotel a few 
meters from his house. The Valbona has been closed for four months. Only 5 
years old, its windows have boards on them. Dirt covers the floors inside. The 
yellow paint is already peeling. The new government, strapped for money when 
the Communists left office, stopped funding the hotel.  
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to the state of Albania's tourist infrastructure when I 
visited last spring. The existing hotels were probably the worst I'd ever seen. 
Buses ran less frequently than the toilets, which wasn't often enough, and 
Dodger Stadium seemed to have more restaurants than Tirana. Every structure 
seemed to be either crumbling, peeling or broken. The carcasses of broken-down 
factories littered the countryside. Since foreign currency is accepted more 
than the Albanian lek, I walked around for a week with $800 in American cash in 
my money belt. Albania's most expensive lodging, Tirana's Hotel Dajti, charges 
$70 for a single, $90 for a double and hot water is irregular. In fact, water 
is irregular. One visitor told me he had water for exactly four hours a day. 
Down the street at Hotel Drini, the hallway was locked from the inside by a 
beat-up glass door. I had to wake a tenant to let me in the hall so I could see 
a room. There seemed to be no water there either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early in my visit, my driver took me to Gjirokaster, Hoxha's hometown in 
southern Albania. The charming cobblestone-covered village overlooks the wide 
green valley below. A castle rises over the city. An art gallery has friendly 
local artists who are eager to discuss their work. Gjirokaster is a budding 
tourist center, but unfortunately in the Hotel Cajupi, a squadron of flies 
greeted me in the lobby. I dragged my index finger along the second floor, and 
it came up pitch-black. Cost: $29 for a double with no bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I'm sure I would have survived any of these establishments, and 
subsequent reports from travelers indicate that things are improving steadily, 
I had made other arrangements. My interpreter asked a family in her Tirana 
neighborhood if they would move out of their modest apartment and live with 
relatives for the week. I paid them $25 a night, nearly the equivalent of an 
Albanian's average monthly salary of $35.  
</P>
<P>
 I did stay in one hotel, the best I saw in the country, the Butrinti, in the 
southern Albanian city of Sarande. Just off the coast from Sarande is the 
tourist-crawling Greek island of Corfu, yet the Butrinti's 90 rooms were half 
empty the night I stayed there. "We don't get so many people," desk clerk 
Fatbardha Cako says. "I've been with tourists coming from Corfu, and many don't 
know anything about Albania. Many are afraid because Yugoslavia is so near."  
</P>
<P>
 No matter. It isn't easy getting to Sarande, anyway. Traveling in Albania can 
be expensive and dangerous, hence the advisability of a driver. One bus a day 
leaves Tirana for Sarande, 200 miles to the south. One a day leaves for Bajram 
Curri near the Drini in the north. Only one bus a week travels the beautiful 
coast road. None would dare take the poorly maintained mountain road we took 
into the Albanian Alps.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the one main road that runs through Albania is badly in need of repair. 
It has been for, oh, about 2,000 years. That's because it is the same one the 
Romans used to invade Greece. The road my driver took to reach the beautiful 
beach near Lukove was a 30-minute zigzag from the coast road down a gravel goat 
path. The buses that do run are about half the size of a school bus, many with 
windows long ago broken out. Late arrivals hang from the side by a single hand. 
The good news is that the 10-hour drive to Sarande costs only $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchhiking is impractical since the Communist regime banned all private 
automobiles, and though they're now allowed, they're few and far between. The 
Albanian language still has no term for "traffic jam." For example, one 
Thursday at lunch hour, I walk down the middle of six-lane Stalin Boulevard, 
Tirana's main drag. In my path are only four cars. In Albania, horse-drawn 
carts are still king of the road.  
</P>
<P>
 And renting a car is exorbitant. Hertz has an office in Tirana but charges 
$680 a week or $45.50 a day, plus 38 cents a kilometer. My driver, Sefer 
Cenoimeri, was a former driver for the Communist government. I paid him $420 
for the week, and it was worth every penny.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eating in Albania is enjoyable but frustrating. Until a year ago, restaurants 
in Tirana didn't even have signs. You had to know someone who knew where to go. 
Today, signs advertise restaurants but there aren't many. None lines Skanderbeg 
Square, Tirana's huge central gathering place. But Albanian food is delicious 
and the nation's best bargain. Rarely will a full meal top $10.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ottoman Empire, its capital in what is now Istanbul, controlled Albania 
from 1479 until 1912, and Albanian food greatly resembles Turkey's. Shish kebab 
is a staple as is qofte , a delicious spiced meatball. Raki , a savage Albanian 
whiskey, is served with most meals. It's also safe to drink tap water -- which 
comes from the mountains that cover three-quarters of Albania.  
</P>
<P>
 But Albanians don't eat out much. They can't. When the Communist government 
fell, the oppressive yoke of manual labor dropped. With unemployment benefits 
guaranteeing 80% of their paycheck, thousands quit their jobs, and today 
unemployment hovers around 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 The new government's resources are limited. But there is hope. The people 
aren't depressed. Despite a mailed warning from the U.S. State Department that 
"robbery, mugging and pickpocketing is a problem" in Albania, I found the 
Albanians' friendliness unmatched anywhere in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 People, including soldiers, stopped me on the street to take their pictures. 
They didn't want money. They didn't want a snapshot. They just wanted to see a 
camera work. Communication isn't a big problem. English is the Albanians' 
second language.  
</P>
<P>
 Albania's innocent look as it opens its arms to outsiders adds to its charm. 
In one week, I sunbathed on a deserted beach, broke bread with a mountain 
tribesman, heard prison stories from hunger strikers, matched raki shots with 
an 82-year-old farmer, bathed in a mountain stream and posed on a tank I found 
stalled on the highway.  
</P>
<P>
 And then I wonder. Would all this be possible after a McDonald's is built in 
Skanderbeg Square? GUIDEBOOK

TRAVEL INSIDER: SHOULD DISASTERS HALT TRAVEL TO AUSTRALIA OR PUERTO RICO?; 
OUTLOOK: WILDFIRES AND A MASSIVE OIL SPILL HAVE LEFT RESORT AREAS DAMAGED BUT 
NOT OFF-LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Australia-bound? Proceed with caution, and expect a substantial portion of the 
national parkland to be black and crunchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Puerto Rico? Don't cancel your plans, but if your arrival date is in the next 
week or two, prepare for the sight of oil-spill cleanup crews along the 
island's most prominent mile and a half of beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 From any angle, the images of last week's fires in New South Wales and oil 
spill off Puerto Rico were troubling. Authorities say that some of the affected 
territory, most notably Australia's Royal National Park, may not be the same 
for generations. And as of this writing, on Wednesday, scores of fires were 
still burning, many still out of control. But if you're a traveler already 
holding tickets to either accident-marred destination -- or if you're 
contemplating a trip to those locales -- take a much closer look before you 
abandon plans. Along with the devastation in Australia, you're likely to find 
some reassuring news about most of the country's top tourist attractions. In 
Puerto Rico, the spill trouble is much milder, the recovery projections 
quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 The bush fires in southeast Australia -- more than 150 of them, more than half 
attributed to arsonists -- began to break out in the first days of this month. 
About 1.5 million acres of grassland and forest in the state of New South Wales 
have burned. Some flames rose in Sydney's suburbs, destroying more than 200 
homes, killing four people. But downtown Sydney, its picturesque harbor, bridge 
and opera house all escaped damage. Airline schedules are normal, and though 
highway access and rail service were curtailed during the worst of the fires, 
authorities said all those routes should be functioning as normal by now. 
(Australia's three other most visible destinations lie well clear of the 
afflicted area: Ayers Rock, about 1,000 miles to the northwest; the Great 
Barrier Reef, about 600 miles north at its southernmost point; Melbourne, about 
400 miles southwest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among wilderness destinations outside Sydney, however, the damage is 
considerable. About two dozen of the 70 national parks in the state closed 
during the fires, either because of immediate flames or to reduce fire risks 
posed by 100-degree temperatures and 60 m.p.h. winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime casualty -- 98% charred -- was the 37,099-acre Royal National Park, 
a retreat of cliff-top hiking paths, surfing beaches and river rowboating about 
20 miles south of Sydney. Ken Ayres, a district manager for the Wildlife 
Service there, told the Associated Press that "the park will start growing with 
the first rain, but it will be generations before it returns to what it was." 
Royal is the world's second oldest national park, predated only by Yellowstone 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Mountains, a popular destination about 30 miles northwest of Sydney, 
were blackened in the Grose Valley area and many others; as of Tuesday, fire 
had reached an estimated 250,000 acres of the 2 million acres in the area's 
several national parks. But one of that area's most popular tourist spots, the 
Three Sisters rock formation and Echo Point lookout, was unaffected. 
Authorities said bus tours to the Three Sisters and other attractions are still 
being offered, but off-road tours and other activities in the park system were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said fire also affected parts of Morton National Park, a 
377,931-acre preserve that guidebook authors John and Monica Chapman say 
includes "the best bushwalking in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 (More information on Australia is available from the Australian Tourist 
Commission, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles 90067 (telephone 
310- 552-1988) or the Australian Consulate, 611 N. Larchmont Blvd., Los Angeles 
90004 (tel. 213-469-4300). 
</P>
<P>
 In Puerto Rico, the trouble began Jan. 7 when the barge Morris J. Berman hit a 
coral reef and spilled 750,000 gallons of heating oil, coating an estimated 20 
square miles of ocean. Cleanup operations collected a large share of the spill, 
but the damaged areas included Puerto Rico's most visible beaches -- the 
Condado area near San Juan. There, the spill fouled six miles of shoreline, 
including a 1.5-mile stretch of beaches that serve the island's primary group 
of international hotels, now in their peak tourist season.  
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities said the odor of petroleum lifted in the first few days, and 
estimated that the beach cleanup would take two to three weeks. The nearest 
hotels to the spill, the landmark Caribe Hilton and the Art Deco Radisson 
Normandie, pledged free transportation to other beaches. (Puerto Rico has some 
258 miles of beaches.) The neighboring Condado Plaza, Regency, Condado Beach 
and La Concha hotels made similar offers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan is a busy stop for Miami-based cruise ship traffic, and its port lies 
within walking distance of the oil-stained beaches. But Lawrence Fishkin, 
president of The Cruise Line, a clearinghouse of information on the industry, 
said the spill and cleanup have had no effect on ship schedules.

Co., P.O. Box 025268, Dept. H, Miami, Fla. 33102 (tel. 800-223-6530 or

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; IDYLL UNTOURS HAS BROCHURE FOR '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Idyll Untours, which arranges three-week apartment stays in Europe for 
Americans, has come out with its 1994 brochure featuring a new Dutch Untour 
with an optional week in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Idyll has about 200 apartments in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, 
Austria and Switzerland, and Prague, Budapest and Vienna.Travelers are met at 
the airport, delivered to their dwellings, briefed on train and bus schedules 
and provided with maps and rail passes.  
</P>
<P>
 Untour prices, which include round-trip air fare, vary according to season and 
the number in the party. For example, the cost of the Classic Austrian Untour 
ranges from $1,461 per person for a party of six traveling in shoulder seasons 
to $1,958 per person for a party of two traveling in peak summer months. 
However, Hal Taussig, founder of Idyll, says prices dropped this year, partly 
because of unfavorable 1993 currency rates.  
</P>

WEEKEND ESCAPE: BAJA CALIFORNIA; THE GOLF OF MEXICO; THREE SPORTING FRIENDS 
SWING SOUTH TO TWO SEASIDE LINKS WITH UNCROWDED FAIRWAYS, SPECTACULAR VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID MORGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Morgan is a news editor for The Times' 
Sports section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We leave the South Bay at the crack of dawn one Monday. A sunrise, a few cups 
of coffee, and 2 1/2 hours later we're at the U.S.-Mexico border. It goes even 
more quickly from there. Thirteen minutes and 12 miles down the road we are at 
our destination, the first cars in the parking lot. After a few minutes to 
collect ourselves, we are set to begin the real journey. 
</P>
<P>
 We are on the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
 We have come to Baja to play golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Mucho golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Really. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first power-golf outing for my group, but it is our first such 
extended venture into Baja. My fellow sports journalists on this trip are Rod 
Millie, an editor for the The Times' Valley edition, and Dave Strege, who 
covers the Rams for the Orange County Register. Rod and I are fairly evenly 
matched. Dave is a player whose handicap borders on single digits. He gives Rod 
and me a good example to follow, which we rarely seem to do.  
</P>
<P>
 The next 33 hours will consist of 54 holes over two spectacular oceanside 
courses, a sumptuous dinner, a generous sampling of our favorite cantina's 
inventory, and a night's stay at a hotel overlooking a vast stretch of beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, urban golfers, it doesn't get much better than this. One Baja club pro 
estimates his course averaged 160 players a day during the active summer 
months; the other course might not have had that much traffic during an entire 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 Not that these courses, which officially opened in August, are trying to keep 
their existence a secret. If you've been to Baja in the past year or so, 
chances are you've seen the giant roadside billboards along the Highway 1 toll 
road south from Tijuana. "Meet our challenge," proposes an advertisement for 
Real del Mar Golf Club, just 12 miles south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try to keep your eye on the ball," encourages a huge billboard for Bajamar, 
50 miles south of the border. Another Bajamar billboard boasts the course is 
"much like Pebble Beach . . . in 1918." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happy to report there is some truth in advertising. Real del Mar, easily 
accessible with its own exits from the toll road, certainly provides a 
challenge. Designed by Mexican architect Pedro Guereca, it is a course rich in 
character. The contours of the hilly terrain are fully utilized, resulting in a 
layout with spectacular views and demanding golf holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The par-72 course isn't especially long -- 6,400 yards from the "tips," 
(championship tees), as described in eloquent golfese by assistant pro George 
Petro -- but there is a premium on accuracy. The fairways are narrow and a 
wayward shot is likely to end up either on an inaccessible bluff or in a 
virtually unplayable lie in a preponderance of landscaped flower beds. Real del 
Mar's signature hole is the par-5, double-dogleg 17th, which beckons wickedly 
from its island green in the middle of a pond near the entrance to the course. 
The well-groomed greens are a little slower than you would expect at most 
California courses of this quality, but the putting lines are true, unlike my 
putting itself. At $39, the green fees are a good value, and the amenities are 
outstanding: pro shop, an alfresco bar and eating area adjacent to the 
clubhouse, and a refreshment cart (with soft drinks, beer and a margarita or 
other mixed drink if the quality of your golfing calls for it) that caters to 
golfers on the course. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the first group to tee off, and after 36 holes of inspiring, sometimes 
perspiring golf, we are the last group off the course. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it wasn't all golf and no play. On to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For our layover between courses, there are countless places we could stay. 
Real del Mar is only minutes south of Tijuana and Rosarito Beach is nearby to 
the south. The course advertises a hotel package with a resort in Rosarito 
that, for $69, includes two rounds of golf and one night's lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for us, there is only one place to stay in Baja: La Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty miles south of the border, the oceanside hotel and restaurant is hardly 
a well-kept secret. There are no phones, but that is about all it lacks. It 
sits above a wide stretch of beach, and a dining veranda affords a cozy vantage 
point from which to see the coastline. Rooms are available from $46. The 
monotonous sound of waves crashing at the shore is as intoxicating as anything 
served in the well-stocked bar (except, perhaps, the $1 margaritas). 
</P>
<P>
 It's first-come, first-served, and on a holiday or busy weekend the 30 or so 
rooms can go in a hurry. Because there is no phone, reservations are available 
only by mail. But in my dozen or so visits to La Fonda, I've been shut out only 
once -- on a Memorial Day weekend several years ago. But this is a Monday night 
and we have our pick of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 After the daylong appetizer of golf, we opt for the patio overlooking the 
beach, and gorge on black sea bass, stuffed calamari and wine. But much of our 
conversation over dinner and drinks that evening is about Real del Mar. We have 
doubts that the next day's course, Bajamar, can match up to the new kid on the 
block. I will have to find out on my own. My friends leave in the morning to 
return to work, and I make the six-mile trip south to Bajamar. The toll road 
winds through hillside along the coast and it is a particularly clear and crisp 
morning. Ideal conditions for golf.  
</P>
<P>
 With no other development in the vicinity, the Bajamar grounds are easily 
spotted to the west from the highway. There is a guarded entrance to the 
resort, and a long, curving, cut-stone road serves as a runway that leads the 
mile or so toward the beach, then south past condominiums and housing 
developments to the hotel and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Real del Mar, Bajamar officially opened in August (after a two-year 
renovation). At 6,800 yards, the par-71 course is 400 yards longer than Real 
del Mar, but given the constant ocean breeze, it plays much longer than that. I 
tour the first six holes quickly before I see another group on the course. 
Because I am playing alone, they allow me to play through on the next tee. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I make the turn I have already, in the last two days, played 45 
holes of golf on what I consider to be scenic and challenging courses. 
</P>
<P>
 But what awaits will make my jaw drop. Simply put, the back nine at Bajamar is 
stunning. Nine golf holes along the edge of an escarpment overlooking the 
Pacific. I don't know whether to golf, stare, take pictures or bask in the sun. 
I do a little of each, mesmerized by 180-degree ocean views, feeling a million 
miles removed from the world -- and liking the feeling. Starting at the 14th 
hole, what was an ocean breeze seems more like a gale. Now, the course plays 
dead into the wind. That's said to be the prevailing condition. It is too 
beautiful to anguish over. 
</P>
<P>
 I play the final three holes behind a twosome -- the first time in two days 
I've had golfers in front for more than one hole. I birdie the 17th, missing a 
hole-in-one by less than two feet. (Just as well. No one would have believed me 
anyway.) 
</P>
<P>
 I bogey the last, finishing the round in 2 1/2 hours. As I return to the 
clubhouse, it occurs to me that I have rarely felt such contentment after a 
round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Bajamar is a developing resort. It has a hotel, restaurant and bar. Room rates 
range from $50 to $135. Greens fees are $40, $30 for hotel guests. These rates, 
part of a grand-opening package, are scheduled to double in February. 
Thirty-three hours and 54 holes after arriving, I get in my Honda CRX and head 
for home. There is still the matter of the border crossing to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
 After a wait of about 30 minutes , a U.S. border inspector motions my car to 
his booth. Looking at the long line of cars behind me, he asks the usual 
questions: Where have I been and what have I been doing. I tell him. Somewhat 
skeptically, he looks me in the eye. "So, you live in Redondo Beach and you 
came all the way to Baja to golf?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yep. And I won't be back soon enough. Budget for One 
</P>
<P>

THE MATURE TRAVELER: STEEP DISCOUNTS IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of San Francisco, a favorite destination of senior travelers, is now 
offering a number of attractive discounts for museums, hotels and various forms 
of transportation. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Maritime Museum Assn. has two exhibits at Fisherman's Wharf 
dedicated to the preservation of America's maritime heritage. One is the 
Maritime National Historic Park that includes two tall ships, a ferryboat, a 
schooner and a classic car collection. The $3 admission fee is waived for 
seniors over age 62. The second exhibit features the World War II submarine, 
the USS Pampanito, and includes a self-guided tour demonstrating what life was 
like aboard that submarine, and telling the story of how it sunk six Japanese 
submarines. The regular $4 admission is reduced to $1 for seniors over 62. For 
brochures, write NMMA, Presidio of San Francisco, Building 275, Crissy Field, 
San Francisco 94129-9906; telephone (415) 929-0202. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Academy of Sciences in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park is composed of 
three popular sites: the Natural History Museum, the Steinhart Aquarium and the 
Morrison Planetarium. One admission price provides access to the academy for 
seniors over 64. The regular entry of $7 is discounted to $4. For a brochure, 
write to the California Academy of Sciences, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco 
94118. 
</P>
<P>
 A ride on San Francisco's municipal bus system, known as Muny, costs $1 except 
for seniors over 65, for whom the price is reduced to 35. Cable car fare is 
reduced one-third, from $3 to $2. The wide-ranging rapid transit system (BART) 
that covers San Francisco and its peninsula to the south, plus East Bay 
communities such as Oakland and Richmond, offers a booklet of tickets worth $16 
for $1.60 for travelers over 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Bay Area hotels offer discounts to mature travelers: 
</P>
<P>
 The Grant Plaza Hotel is at the entrance to San Francisco's Chinatown, one 
block from the city's financial district near restaurants, shopping and the 
cable car. The Plaza is a good buy for seniors over 55, who get a room with a 
double or twin bed for $39 per night (regular rate $52 and $55). (800) 
472-6899. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde Park Suites at Fisherman's Wharf is offering a "suite deal" that provides 
guests with discounts based on their ages, at the rate of $1 off for each year 
of age if they plan their visit so that they arrive within five days before or 
after their birthday. For example, a guest age 65 would receive a $65 discount 
from the room rate. Any guest age 100 or older stays free. Regular rates for a 
one-bedroom suite range from $165 to $190 (prices do not reflect birthday 
discounts). The offer is valid until June 30, with proof of birthday at 
check-in. (800) 227-3608. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kimco Management Co. group of West Coast hotels, most of them in the San 
Francisco area, caters to the senior market. Many Kimco hotels are older, 
landmark-type hotels that have been completely redecorated with working 
fireplaces and antique furnishings. Most have cable TV, VCRs, writing desks and 
other amenities. They are smaller, intimate lodgings with between 100 and 200 
rooms. Senior rates are generally valid for AARP members or guests 55 or older. 
Among them are:

TAKING THE KIDS: FUN VACATION? PLAN ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few days before Christmas, Sue Tober got on the phone and completed most of 
the reservations for her family's three-week trip out West. They're going in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started planning as soon as we got back from vacation last summer," says 
Tober, an accountant who lives in Portsmouth, N.H. She booked her first 
reservation, for Yosemite National Park, an entire year ahead. The Tobers' 
complete itinerary now is tidily stored in a file in their home computer -- 
eight months before they'll even pack a suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not as crazy as it sounds. By now the summer is already booked at 
Yosemite, a park spokesman reports. Many resorts will sell out for next 
Christmas by the end of March. And unless you're very lucky, it's already too 
late to get your first choice for spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are so caught up in their hectic day-to-day lives that they don't 
plan that far in advance," says Theresa Detchemendy, president of the San 
Francisco-based family travel agency Rascals in Paradise (call 800-U-RASCAL). 
"Then they're disappointed and frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 To get the best rates, the best rooms and, at peak times, the preferred 
destinations, there's no way around it: You've got to plan ahead. This is 
particularly true when you're talking about such popular but isolated 
destinations as Yosemite or the Grand Canyon, which gets hundreds of inquiries 
for every available hotel room in prime season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that people know everything here is done a year in advance," 
says Maureen Oltrogge, a spokesman for the Grand Canyon National Park, which 
probably will be busier than ever this year as it celebrates its 75th 
anniversary. People book mule trips into the canyon two years ahead. Her tip: 
Call in the winter months. (For information on all of the national parks, call 
the National Park Service in Washington at 202-208-4747. Another resource: the 
newly redesigned National Park Foundation's "Complete Guide to America's 
National Parks," $14.95 at bookstores or by calling 800-533-6478.) 
</P>
<P>
 I know how you feel: You don't know what you're doing for dinner tomorrow much 
less what you'll want to do next August or next Christmas. But I'll bet you've 
got some ideas of things you'd like to do -- and can afford. Your kids have got 
even more thoughts on the subject. You may have a job that requires you to take 
vacation at a certain time or at least to plan for your absence. The airlines 
are tantalizing you with their latest bargain fares. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So go ahead. Take advantage of these winter evenings and weekends to start 
planning. Whatever you decide to do in the end, the planning will pay off. You 
may discover that your kids' idea of fun is a lot different than you think. You 
may stumble on some bargains. At the very least, you won't be stuck -- as was 
Maureen Oltrogge one summer -- without a hotel room anywhere in the vicinity. 
"We slept in the van," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, you'll have some fun with the kids exploring new places 
without even leaving your family room. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the winter, you want to think about long days and happy times. People get 
as much pleasure out of planning as out of going," suggests Barbara Mars, who 
with her husband owns the West Coast's largest travel bookstore, the California 
Map & Travel Center in Santa Monica. (You can order from 8,000 titles by 
calling 310-829-6277.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you're considering a big trip or a simple week at the beach, some 
planning can make the trip a lot better all around. Just ask educator Lucinda 
Lee Katz. When her family headed to Washington, D.C., they winged it. "And we 
spent a lot of time in the hotel room calling places and trying to figure out 
what we were going to do," says Katz, director of the University of Chicago 
Laboratory School. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disappointing, they couldn't get tickets to some of the places they 
most wanted to see, such as the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've planned, you can give the children the best activities the area 
has to offer and you're not fighting about what to do. It takes away stress and 
the feeling that you're not in control," says Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tobers, meanwhile, are happily counting down to August. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month.

HIKING: BIG SUR: THE VIEW FROM MT. MANUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arguably the best view of Big Sur can be found from one of the many automobile 
turnouts along California 1. These vista points offer glimpses of the region's 
dramatic cliffs and the tempestuous Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want to see the whole of Big Sur -- that is to say, the Ventana 
Wilderness and the Santa Lucia Mountains and the deep blue ocean that 
stretches, it seems, all the way to China -- you have to take a hike. Such a 
broad panorama is the hiker's reward for reaching the summit of Mt. Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hikers say the view from Mt. Manuel is Big Sur's best. Others make a case 
for the vista from Junipero Serra Peak, which they say offers far-reaching 
views east to the Central Valley and, on especially clear days, the High 
Sierra. I've never much enjoyed the brutal, shadeless trek to the top of 
Junipero Serra, and have never been lucky enough to stand on its summit on a 
day sufficiently clear to see any Sierra peaks. So I side with the Manuel 
boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 From atop Mt. Manuel, you get a panorama of Ventana Wilderness peaks, Pt. Sur 
and the most dramatic of coastlines: in short, the heart of Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Manuel Trail isn't as inspiring as its summit views, but it definitely has 
its moments. En route are a wonderful oak woodland and a stand of redwood. Mt. 
Manuel does not hoard all of its views atop its summit, however; the hiker will 
find many inspiring vistas from the trail at lower elevations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Manuel Trail climbs at a fairly steep -- though not severe -- gradient. 
It's definitely a heart-pounding aerobic workout. The path is a bit 
brush-crowded in places but otherwise is in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The colder months (November-May) are best for the trek up Mt. Manuel. More 
than half of the trail crosses exposed, chamiso-clad slopes. No water is 
available en route, so make sure you carry plenty -- at least a quart per 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: Make your way to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, just 
off California 1, some 65 miles north of Hearst Castle and 30 miles south of 
Carmel. A mile south of the state park is a multi-agency information center 
that includes Caltrans, the U.S. Forest Service and California Parks. Stop by 
to get the latest road and trail conditions, as well as to obtain maps and 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 From the state park entrance station ($6 day-use fee), drive past the Big Sur 
Lodge and bear left on the park road leading to the picnic areas. Drive to the 
picnic ground at road's end, where you'll see the signed trail head for Mt. 
Manuel and other park trails. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Follow the park's paved service road for the five-minute walk to 
Homestead Cabin. Homesteader John Pfeiffer and his family settled on the north 
side of the Big Sur River in 1884. 
</P>
<P>
 From the cabin (definitely cramped quarters), join signed Oak Grove Trail, 
which ascends past oaks and over-brushy slopes. A mellow half-mile climb brings 
you to the signed junction with Mt. Manuel Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear right and tackle six switchbacks that climb coastal, scrub-dotted slopes. 
Reward for this steep bit of zigging and zagging is your first coastal view. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more compelling, as you climb east, is the sight and (in the wet season) 
the thunderous sound of the Big Sur River. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no sign announces your entrance, you do indeed enter the Ventana 
Wilderness. Periodic relief from the hot, chamiso-clad slopes comes in the form 
of a number of delightful gullies filled with shade-providing oaks, maples, 
bays and sycamores. 
</P>
<P>
 About three miles from the trail head, the path heads into a magical and 
rather mixed-up forest of live oak and madrone, tanbark oak and redwood. It's 
the kind of dark (but not gloomy), fern-filled area where fairy tales take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the forest behind, you resume ascending brushy slopes for another 
quarter-mile to a ravine watered by a seasonal creek. Just past the creek 
crossing, a short side trail leads a few paces to a spring. Only in the very 
wettest winters does the spring flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you contour around dry slopes, getting yucca-framed views of the coast to 
the southwest, and the Big Sur landmark Ventana Double Cone to the northeast. 
After some more climbing past chamiso, ceanothus, toyon, yerba santa and other 
members of the chaparral community, you enter an oak woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 You emerge from the woods onto a ridge that offers coastal views. Ahead is a 
white reflector that marks Mt. Manuel's viewpoint. The final stretch of trail 
zigzags up the mountain, then climbs through some Coulter pine to the 
viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy your time at the top, particularly at the viewpoint, which offers better 
vistas than the actual top of Mt. Manuel directly to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Manuel Trail continues another 13 miles, passing a number of trail camps 
on the way to Bottcher's Gap, but you'll return for the summit the way you 
came. Mt. Manuel Trail Where: Los Padres National Forest, Big Sur Distance: 10 
miles round trip, with 3,100-foot elevation gain. Terrain: Steep Santa Lucia 
Mountains, oak forest, redwoods. Highlights: One of Big Sur's best viewpoints. 
Degree of difficulty: Strenuous. Precautions: There are ticks in the chaparral; 
check your clothing. For more information: Contact Big Sur Station No. 1, Big 
Sur, Calif. 93920, (408) 667-2315.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: SAN DIEGO; SCALING BACK?; FROM ENSENADA FOOD STANDS TO 
WHITE-TABLECLOTH OLD TOWN RESTAURANTS, THE FISH TACOS HERE ARE ORIGINAL, 
DELICIOUSLY VARIED AND CHEAP

<P>
 This city can't compete with the big boys on the culinary front, but one food 
item has swept over town like a tsunami: fresh fish tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout San Diego County -- from the port of Oceanside to the heart of Old 
Town San Diego -- this Mexican-style fast-food has been transformed from simple 
fare of batter-fried fish into tacos filled with grilled salmon or scallops, 
and even a pan-Pacific version of seared ahi tuna. The establishments that 
serve them are as varied and eclectic as the food, ranging from elegant 
restaurants to fish markets that vend carryout as sort of an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish tacos probably originated among the fishermen of San Felipe, a Mexican 
town on the Gulf of California, where the local people roll up freshly caught 
fish inside their daily tacos, rather than using expensive cuts of meat. The 
idea swept across the Baja Peninsula like an incoming tide, and fish tacos are 
seen in towns along the Pacific Coast, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for many visitors, myself among them, no trip to the bustling port of 
Ensenada would be complete without a fresh taco de pescado prepared at one of 
the stands framing the entrance to the Mercado Negro, the city's waterfront 
fish market. My alfresco snack usually turns into a seafood binge, as I savor 
the first, then a second and sometimes even a third warm corn tortilla stuffed 
with flaky chunks of the day's selection of fish that has been batter-fried and 
topped with shredded cabbage, mayonnaise and homemade salsa. On other 
occasions, I opt for a more elaborate shrimp or squid taco smothered under a 
thick layer of picante homemade salsa and a squeeze of fresh lime. Luckily, 
these tasty fish tacos soon jumped the border, and I can now duplicate the 
experience in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent fish taco tour of the county, here are a few suggestions for 
some of the best around: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In North County, the Oceanside Harbor provides a lovely seaside stop off busy 
Interstate 5. Barely a few hundred yards off the freeway, diners seated outside 
the Rockin' Baja Lobster Bar and Grill are entertained by graceful brown 
pelicans that make dramatic swoops over the picturesque marina. Since its 
opening in 1992, Rockin' Baja Lobster has been a magnet for airborne, as well 
as landlocked, seafood fanciers. As its name implies, the restaurant built its 
reputation on lobster served Mexican-style. Owner Rick DiRienzo took his 
inspiration from numerous trips to the fishing village of Puerto Nuevo south of 
Tijuana, where a profusion of family restaurants specialize in locally caught 
lobster accompanied by warm tortillas, rice and refried beans. In 1983, 
DiRienzo and his brother introduced the same concept at their first restaurant, 
The Old Bonita Store in San Diego's South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea proved an instant success, and they replicated the menu at the 
Rockin' Baja Lobster Bar and Grill, in the shadow of the Oceanside lighthouse. 
At the harbor-side restaurant, which is embraced by a lively, hip, denim-clad 
crowd (although families are a presence, too, because the prices are so good), 
a Tacos de Pescado dinner ($7.95) is large enough to feed two people, with two 
flour tortillas bulging with chunks of marinated and grilled mahi-mahi, as many 
refried beans as you can handle, a tasty helping of Mexican rice and a crisp 
and fresh Caesar-style salad. Warm flour tortillas and a spicy honey-chili 
butter complete the meal. The restaurant's signature Tacos del Patron ($8.95), 
a trio of oversize tacos, are equally as mouthwatering. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge here is to bring an appetite hearty enough to consume the large 
lobster taco, the shrimp taco and the grilled carne asada taco with all the 
trimmings, all at one sitting. Shrimp tacos ($5.95), three to an order and 
bursting with small gulf shrimp, shredded cabbage and a light creamy sauce, are 
suited to lighter eaters. The salsa bar features six different fresh salsas, an 
unusual jicama-papaya combination among them, ranging in intensity from mild to 
explosive. The Rockin' Baja Lobster Bar and Grill concept is so successful in 
San Diego County that a second Rockin' Baja Lobster opened in Newport Beach in 
December. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Vista, a short drive inland from Oceanside, fish tacos are a popular item 
on the menu at La Paloma, a lively restaurant specializing in unusual Mexican 
dishes. Owner Bob Cherry prepares his lightly pan-fried fish tacos with 
farm-raised tilapia, and smothers them in a light yogurt sauce and shredded 
cabbage ($6.95). La Paloma's reputation extends far beyond Vista thanks to the 
Shrimp and Lobster Fajitas ($14.95), served as meat fajitas would be, sizzling 
hot on their metal platter. For this memorable specialty, Cherry, who uses only 
olive oil in his cooking, stir-fries strips of red and green bell peppers, 
sliced onion, large chunks of lobster and medium-size gulf shrimp, then seasons 
them with his own 14-spice blend. Fresh tortilla chips with a chunky salsa, a 
large stack of warm flour tortillas and a small bowl of superbly seasoned black 
beans are all part of the flavorful package. (An equally good reason to place 
Vista on your "gourmet" itinerary is the bountiful Saturday morning farmer's 
market located on the block adjoining La Paloma.) 
</P>

 Off Poinsettia Drive in Carlsbad, Pelly's Fish Market and Cafe has earned high 
ratings locally for its wide selection of fresh seafood, and also for its 
terrific fish tacos. Throughout the day, tables outside the market and cafe are 
covered with paper plates, mounded with tacos of grilled mahi-mahi, mako shark, 
sea bass or halibut, depending upon the catch of the day. I'm enamored of 
Pelly's, where each piece of fish is dredged in seasoned bread crumbs, then 
seared on a hot griddle before joining Pelly's excellent vinegar-accented 
cabbage slaw, chunky salsa fresca and spicy yogurt sauce inside a warm corn 
tortilla (a la carte fish taco, $2.75, or shrimp taco, $3.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Further south, Las Olas Mexican Restaurant, in the community of Cardiff by the 
Sea, offers a beautiful view of the Pacific -- certainly worth the price of the 
food in and of itself -- but the tacos are great, too. The tiled takeout 
counter lined with bar stools provides a good vantage point for observing the 
lively crowd of beach habitues, as well as for viewing the waves crashing on 
the sliver of beach across U.S. 101. The menu at Las Olas (Spanish for "the 
waves") features a large fish burrito of deliciously moist, charbroiled 
mahi-mahi ($4.25) hidden under a mound of shredded cabbage and topped with a 
flavorful yogurt salsa, an exciting salsa picante and globs of fresh guacamole. 
The Baja-style fish taco, here made with batter-dipped cod fried to a golden 
crispness, proved equally as flavorful ($2.25). 
</P>
<P>
 Cast aside paper wrappers and beach gear, and make room for fresh linen 
napkins and an upscale dress code (business dress is common) at Cafe Pacifica 
in San Diego's Old Town. The hip eatery, sandwiched between a massage therapist 
and Old Town's historic El Camino Santo cemetery, is known for its imaginative 
menu featuring a blend of California and Pacific Rim cuisines. As an added 
attraction, patrons enjoying a business lunch on the upper level of the dining 
room can sometimes watch archeologists dust off newly discovered relics. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed under "Cafe Specialties," the Mexican Corona Beer and Chili Marinated 
Swordfish Tacos with jicama salsa ($6.40) have come a long way from the taco's 
batter-fried debut in Baja California. Here, the artfully arranged plate 
includes two large pieces of grilled swordfish inside warm corn tortillas with 
the obligatory topping of shredded lettuce, a helping of expertly prepared 
black beans and a small container of delectable tomatillo sauce. The Cafe's 
palate-tingling salsa combines diced tomatoes with crunchy pieces of jicama, 
serrano chiles and fresh cilantro. (The tacos are only served at lunch.) 
</P>
<P>
 The same owners have stretched the concept even further at the Pacifica Del 
Mar restaurant in the seaside community of Del Mar. The Takoshimi of Peppered 
Hawaiian Ahi, a Pacific Rim creation, has been a signature dish at that 
location since the restaurant opened. Chic diners gather on a beautiful terrace 
to dine on this California-style combination of Asian and Mexican ingredients 
featuring seared ahi tuna rubbed with Oriental seasonings wedged inside two 
miniature taco shells standing upright in a small mound of sticky rice. Thin 
ribbons of carrots and beets complete the East/West tableau ($9.80 on the 
dinner menu). 
</P>
<P>

 Midway between Sea World and the Cabrillo National Monument, two of San 
Diego's most popular tourist attractions, Point Loma Seafoods perches on the 
edge of Shelter Island. "We started out in 1963 as a smokehouse for the 
fishermen who came off the fishing boats with their catch," explains John 
Christianson, who owns the popular store with his brother Jack. Thirty years 
later, Point Loma Seafoods is still the place to frequent for hickory-smoked 
fish. In addition, the market's takeout facility offers a wide selection of 
seafood specialties, from chowder to ceviche. For a delicious meal on the run, 
however, nothing beats the Taquito Plate ($4.59). Indeed, the three crunchy, 
cigar-shaped taquitos filled with flaky Alaskan cod and sprinkled with finely 
shredded Jack and Cheddar cheeses could easily turn into an addiction. The 
accompanying salsa, chunky with fresh tomatoes, lingers deliciously on the 
palate, and like the crisp cabbage slaw, is a treasured family recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The first chain to stake its reputation solely on fish tacos was Rubio's Home 
of the Fish Taco, widely acknowledged as the local originator of this 
Mexican-inspired fast-food. Ralph Rubio and his siblings Richard, Robert and 
Gloria, started the company in 1983 with help from their Mexican-born father 
Ray -- an idea inspired by visits to San Felipe. Rubio and his relatives pooled 
their resources and opened in a failing hamburger stand in Pacific Beach. 
"Business was slow because no one had a clue what a fish taco was," Rubio said. 
The big break came when the second Rubio's opened near San Diego State 
University. "Fish tacos were a college fad at first, but soon we attracted 
families and senior citizens. That was the beginning of the Rubio's Home of the 
Fish Taco chain," Rubio said. The taco's origins are still obvious throughout 
each of the 14 Rubio's restaurants, which makes a nod to its Baja origins by 
writing menu items in English and in Spanish, and with festive and soulfully 
authentic Mexican music. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Rubio's stuck strictly to tradition when it came to fish 
tacos. And that tradition dictated, Ralph Rubio said, fish fried in batter, as 
it's done at Mexican taco stands -- not sauteed or steamed -- and wrapped in a 
soft corn tortilla and topped with a mayonnaise-based sauce, shredded cabbage, 
fresh salsa and a squeeze of lime. But the chain now offers a HealthMex menu, 
which includes as an alternative, low-fat specialties such as a Grilled Mahi 
Fish Taco ($2.30) topped with Rubio's fresh cilantro-flavored salsa. On the 
regular menu, Rubio's No. 5 combination includes a hefty fish burrito topped 
with globs of fresh guacamole and salsa wrapped in a flour tortilla, as well as 
an authentic Baja-style fish taco, a handful of hot tortilla chips and 
traditional-style refried beans ($3.95). 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the proliferation of the La Salsa chain's cheery fast-food 
spots testifies to the increasing popularity of fish tacos. What started out as 
a small, neighborhood taco shop in Los Angeles in 1979 has grown to 34 La 
Salsas stretching from San Diego to Montreal. La Salsa serves up several 
varieties of tacos -- among them a delightful mahi-mahi taco ($1.25), which 
makes a great and inexpensive snack for eating on the run, especially when 
topped with one of the pungent salsas from the self-service salsa bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two establishments don't really make a chain, anyone riding the wave 
of San Diego's fish taco scene seems to slide into Fins sooner or later. Tacos 
and a liberal touch of humor characterize the menu of these small, funky 
eateries. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu at Fins is liberally sprinkled with surf-speak and references to 
K-38, a popular surfing spot south of Ensenada. Shrimp burritos and shrimp 
tacos don't get much better than they do at Fins. The La Jolla combination ($5) 
pairs a small fish taco with what is referred to as an "awesome" burrito 
bulging with no less than four whole batter-fried shrimp, along with finely 
shredded cabbage, black beans, fresh cilantro and chopped onion, bound with a 
tangy yogurt-and-mayonnaise concoction and Fins' tasty salsa. Crisp tortilla 
chips, hot out of the fryer, round off the tempting combination. The Pescado 
Mas Fina ($1.84), listed as "the Nirvana of Fish tacos," is chock-full of 
batter-fried Alaskan pollock, guacamole and shredded cheese. The "bar" salsa, 
which patrons are invited to sample on the side, is worthy of note for the 
exquisitely fiery blend of four types of roasted chiles enhanced with fresh 
cilantro and spices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fish taco craze is even catching the attention of long-established 
restaurants. Several branches of Anthony's have long graced the San Diego 
dining scene. Craig Ghio, a third-generation restaurateur, presides over seven 
restaurants, including the formal Anthony's Star of the Sea (at several 
locations) and the latest spinoff, Senor Pesca, which shares an entrance with 
Anthony's in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 At Senor Pesca, amusing fake palm trees, rock music and the dried palm fronds 
that fringe the open kitchen imbue the restaurant with a touch of beach-resort 
whimsy. So do the upscale tacos of fresh salmon, ahi, swordfish and even 
scallops, which are all seasoned with a secret blend of Mexican spices, then 
broiled or grilled, rather than deep-fried. Senor Pesca's extensive seafood 
listing features daily specials and at least two dozen different kinds of tacos 
with fillings as varied as lightly grilled yet deliciously moist salmon ($2.25) 
to tacos of tender, lightly browned scallops ($1.95) served with a generous 
dollop of fresh guacamole and, if desired, a small container of fresh salsa 
from the self-service salsa bar. GUIDEBOOK

 Adventure outfitters are no slouches when it comes to innovation -- as their 
mushrooming numbers (more than 5,000 at my last count) would seem to prove. And 
1994 promises to be a full year. Slick new catalogues from dozens of companies 
have been weighing in weekly, with hundreds of domestic and international 
itineraries ranging from the merely vigorous to Iron Man endurance tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Take an easy hike or climb a killer mountain, paddle along gentle ripples or 
crash through raging rapids. And when it comes to bedding down for the night, 
snuggle under the covers at a posh inn, or find a relatively soft piece of 
ground in a wilderness survival hut. 
</P>
<P>
 A few things are missing this year in the adventure travel universe. 
Expeditions for active travelers mirror the changing world, and several 
once-popular destinations have become out-of-bounds because of internal strife 
and political upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 Say goodby for now to Rwanda, where the famous mountain gorillas and their 
dwindling habitat are hostage to fierce civil war, and research and visitor 
programs have been suspended. Ditto for Egypt, which has had the Nile and 
pyramids virtually to itself as attacks on Westerners by Muslim fundamentalists 
continue to keep the country off the tourist map. Peru, meanwhile, remains 
iffy, despite government progress in neutralizing political terrorism by 
guerrillas who have frightened away potential pilgrims to Machu Picchu and 
environs.  
</P>
<P>
 But some locales long considered taboo are opening up, and adventure companies 
are moving in to provide options. Gorilla seekers can visit the big apes in 
Zaire. Ancient ruins in Belize and nearby Tikal, Guatemala, offer a rich 
setting for archeology buffs disinclined to venture into the Middle East. 
Villages in northern Vietnam now welcome trekkers who might formerly have 
favored Peru.  
</P>
<P>
 On tamer fronts, companies are offering new twists on familiar themes. Already 
cycled California's Napa-Sonoma wine country? How about doing it again on a 
bicycle built for two? Spent a fortune attending Rio's elaborately 
choreographed Carnival? Why not experience a more soulful version in Bahia, 
where the Brazilian pre-Lenten festival was born? Had your fill of trendy 
European resorts, such as Spain's over-developed Costa del Sol? Head instead to 
the country's untrammeled north, where a hike amid the peaks and valleys of the 
stunning Picos de Europa mountains will be infinitely more refreshing than 
sunburn on a crowded southern beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Want more? Kayak around Australia's Great Barrier Reef, or try a women-only 
(if you are) cross-country ski adventure in Yellowstone National Park or 
rock-climbing excursion in California's Joshua Tree National Monument.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I've watched, fascinated, as adventure travel has grown from a handful of 
companies set up for group trips 15 years ago, to the current thousands of 
outfitters. And I've taken dozens of adventure trips. The following eight trips 
are new excursions from some of the most experienced outfitters in the field, 
all with reputations for delivering full value for your vacation dollar. Many 
of the itineraries are substitutes for locales no longer available. 
</P>
<P>
 Except where indicated, prices listed are per person, double occupancy and do 
not include air fare. Some meals and hotel nights also may cost extra, so check 
in advance with the outfitter: 
</P>
<P>
 Gorillas of Zaire and Uganda wildlife: Brad Goodhart, who has been leading 
natural history trips to Africa for 20 years, will guide a maximum of 11 
individuals on treks among the gorillas of Zaire's Virunga National Park and 
Bukima wildlife sanctuary during a 20-day exploratory safari run by Wilderness 
Travel of Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also will visit that country's Pygmy community in the Ituri rain 
forest, and chimpanzee colonies in Tongo. In neighboring Uganda, peaceful after 
long years of civil strife under former president Idi Amin, the group will tour 
game parks and waterfalls, and take a launch trip among the hippos of the 
Kasinga Channel. Accommodations range from camping to basic hotel rooms. 
Participants should be in good physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Jungles, reefs and ruins in Belize and Guatemala: Butterfield & Robinson, a 
Canadian company that specializes in upscale walking and cycling trips at an 
easy pace, has introduced a hiking, canoeing and snorkeling trip to Belize that 
includes an excursion over the border into Guatemala to explore the 
2,000-year-old ruins of Tikal, the most celebrated Mayan archeological site. 
Participants spend two nights at the luxe jungle lodge, Chaa Creek Cottages, 
where they can canoe Chaa Creek, explore the rain forest with a local medicine 
woman who uses jungle plants for their curative powers, and tour Belize's Mayan 
ruins at Xunantunich. After driving to Tikal and spending the night at the 
archeological site in the rustic Jungle Lodge, the group flies to Belize's 
northwest, spending two days at a private nature reserve known for its bird 
life. The last three days are spent at Blackbird Caye in the country's Turneffe 
Islands, for swimming, snorkeling and kayaking around Belize's 195-mile barrier 
reef, the longest coral reef in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Trekking in northern Vietnam: A maximum of 15 participants will explore the 
farming villages and mountain reserves west of Hanoi during two-week treks run 
by InnerAsia Expeditions, a San Francisco company that emphasizes cultural 
interaction. Village-to-village hikes (about four to six hours a day) are along 
rice paddies and up forested hills, with accommodations in traditional bamboo 
village long houses and tents. Luggage and other heavy gear is carried by 
porters. While the United States still does not have formal diplomatic 
relations with Vietnam, private individuals are free to visit, and tourism has 
been growing steadily since the country opened its doors to Western vacationers 
in the late 1980s.

 Tandem biking across the U.S.: Backroads, which runs bike tours throughout the 
United States and abroad, has created new five- and six-day tandem-only bike 
trips. Rent one from Backroads or bring your own. The trips are meant to appeal 
to couples and others who think they might enjoy pedaling in pairs. Both inn 
stays and camping trips are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Among destinations included in the tandem program are California's wine 
country, southeastern Vermont, the Oregon coast, Colorado's San Juan Mountains 
and coastal Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking the mountains of northern Spain: Mountain Travel/Sobek, the country's 
largest adventure outfitter, has designed a trip to northern Spain that 
combines treks amid the jagged peaks and narrow canyons of the Picos de Europa 
mountains, 20 miles from the Atlantic Coast, with hikes through oak and pine 
forests, and visits to seaside fishing villages. The group also will explore 
some of the key religious and historical sights in this relatively untouristed 
region of Spain. Accommodations are in rustic mountain huts and simple country 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival like a native in Bahia: Brazil Nuts, a Connecticut company that is 
much respected for its music and cultural tours of Brazil, is embarking on its 
second annual Carnival in Bahia program, which offers participants a chance to 
experience the annual pre-Lenten extravaganza in its Brazilian birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawling along the Atlantic coast of the state of Bahia, a two-hour flight 
from Rio, the city of Salvador was Brazil's original colonial capital. It was 
also the point of entry for 3.5 million slaves, mostly from Angola and West 
Africa, between the 16th and 19th centuries. They labored in the sugar 
plantations and mines of the emerging colony, and today their descendants still 
occupy the town of narrow cobbled streets, whitewashed houses with red tile 
roofs and stunning seaside stretches. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival here is in the streets, where groups of celebrators, called blocos , 
dance and sing behind bands playing atop giant flatbed trucks. This people's 
party is a far cry from the expensive, restrictive celebrations in Rio's 
Sambadrome and private clubs. Participants in Brazil Nuts' "Carnival Like a 
Native" tour get to march with one of Salvador's blocos, and are given costumes 
for the occasion. While this trip is not designed as an escorted group tour, 
the company does provide a representative at each hotel to assist participants 
with arrangements and handle any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Diving and kayaking Australia's Great Barrier Reef: REI, a Washington 
cooperative that is a major manufacturer and distributor of outdoor gear, 
several years ago began offering rugged adventure trips. The company's 
excursion to northeastern Australia's Great Barrier Reef includes diving, 
snorkeling and kayaking around the world's largest barrier reef, using a 
65-foot motor/sailing ketch as a base. The group also will explore the inland 
Eungella rain forest. Scuba novices can take an introductory dive course at an 
extra price. 
</P>
<P>
 Women-only, skiing Yellowstone or rock climbing in California: Woodswomen, a 
Minnesota company created to help women gain self-confidence and practical 
wilderness skills, runs outdoor adventures year-round, mainly in the West and 
Midwest. Among upcoming trips are a cross-country ski excursion to Yellowstone 
National Park, which is overrun with tourists come summer, but blissfully 
peaceful in winter, and a rock-climbing program amid the desert landscape of 
California's Joshua Tree National Monument. (The trip is geared to novice and 
intermediate rock climbers.) The emphasis in all Woodswomen trips is on 
self-improvement and teamwork, with guides specifically trained to help women 
conquer fears about traveling alone and coping with nature. GUIDEBOOK

CRUISE VIEWS: COSTA ROMANTIC BOASTS A SLEEK ITALIAN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an intensive three-year introduction of two brand-new and fully 
reconstructed vessels on existing hulls, Costa finally seems to have gotten the 
knack of things with its newest, the 1,350-passenger CostaRomantica, which made 
its debut in the Caribbean in late November. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the line's four new ships -- the CostaClassica, CostaRomantica and 
CostaAllegra -- are sailing the Caribbean on seven-night cruises this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romantica is sister ship to the CostaClassica. The Classica came out in 
1992 to a "thumbs down" reaction from many early passengers, hampered by a 
massive advertising campaign touting a new "EuroLuxe" style instead of Costa's 
longtime "Cruising Italian Style" theme, corny but successful in North America 
for its flirtatious Italian waiters, toga parties, strolling musicians and lots 
of pizza and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 So repeat passengers boarded the Classica and searched in vain for familiar 
Italian waiters, many of whom had been replaced by stewards of various 
nationalities in a cost-cutting move. (On the Romantica, only 120 crew members 
out of 650 are Italians, "but they are all Italians at heart," says Costa 
Cruises president Dino Schibuola.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, first-time passengers who read "EuroLuxe" to mean cushy and 
enveloping luxury in the style of Royal Viking or Crystal Harmony, expressed 
dismay at the ship's austere design and acres of bare marble floors in the 
dining room and public areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Romantica, while nearly identical to its sister ship, comes across as 
chic and understated rather than pretentious, as the Classica seemed with its 
white plaster statues surrounded by potted palms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italian Style by Design" is the line's newest slogan, emphasizing the 
architecture and decor of the ships. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dining-room floor on the Romantic is still bare marble, the clatter 
has been cut down somewhat by a new ceiling design, and the staff seems to drop 
fewer dishes than before. The ship's chief steward praised the sanitary quality 
of marble as compared to carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Oversized portholes, which are used instead of windows in the cabins and 
on-board shops, add a stylish note, while several large but light kinetic 
sculptures bring in the requisite touch of modern art. 
</P>
<P>
 For spa and beauty fans, the Caracalla Spa is lavishly designed, with massage 
and treatment rooms with windows open to the sea, steam baths, two saunas and 
full beauty services. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool deck is beautiful, with pale blue-and-white-striped cushions on the 
lounge chairs, natural teak decking, sidewalk-cafe chairs of cream wicker and 
chrome under umbrellas, and "cocoon" cabana chairs of wicker lined with striped 
cushions -- great for reading or quiet tete-a-tetes. There's also a jogging 
track on the top deck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diva Disco doubles as a daytime observation lounge high atop the ship, and 
there's a second pool on the stern with terraced galleries of sunbathing spots 
and four Jacuzzis. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate smoking and nonsmoking reading rooms/libraries and card/game rooms 
are also on board, along with spacious meeting rooms for groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renaissance-style show lounge offers good sight lines from most areas 
(except behind support posts) and is completely nonsmoking, a boon, we would 
think, to both audience and performers. Smoking and nonsmoking areas throughout 
the ship are well marked. 
</P>
<P>
 The production shows, which originate in Britain, are handsomely presented 
with lavish costumes and accomplished dancers but seem very dated compared to 
some of the shows Carnival and Royal Caribbean are presenting now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the inaugural sailing, the staff still seemed to be adjusting from Europe 
to America. At the buffet on boarding day, iced tea was an unknown commodity, 
which perplexed passengers on a sweltering Florida afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 As on the Classica, the executive chef is Austrian rather than Italian, and 
the pizza -- back by popular demand -- is more Pillsbury than Pisa. Other 
dishes are more successful, especially some of the vegetarian dishes and the 
breads. 
</P>
<P>
 The service staff is nicely uniformed and eager to please, although 
English-as-a-second-language classes could be recommended for many of them. 
Room service orders in particular tended to get confused on the inaugural 
sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 We ordered a big breakfast one morning by circling items on the printed card 
-- poached eggs and corned beef hash, a herb omelet with sausage, two tomato 
juices and two teas -- for 8 a.m. We ended up at 8:30 with two teas and place 
settings for two, but only one tiny omelet and a single glass of juice, which 
we divided daintily when nothing more materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are all matters that can be corrected. The important things about 
the Romantica are its handsome cabins and beautiful public rooms, and its 
clean, stylish look that is a wonderful antidote to today's glitzy mega-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabins have elegant burled briarwood Italian furniture and plenty of hanging 
and storage spaces, plus personal safes. White marble counters and built-in 
hair dryers are in all bathrooms, but in the suites, space is grander with two 
basins in the marble counter and separate Jacuzzi tub and stall shower. The art 
and graphics throughout the cabins utilize fabric wall hangings with Italian 
scenes or abstract designs. Cabin TVs play feature films throughout the day and 
evening on a published schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several inside cabins are designed for wheelchair access, with extra-wide 
doors, bathrooms with pull-down shower seats and generous turning space. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with 10 veranda suites as on the Classica, the Romantica has added a 
deck of 24 suites with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The suites are 
especially comfortable and appealing and have trundle beds for passengers 
traveling with children. 
</P>
<P>
 The suites with veranda are 580 square feet, while standard outside cabins are 
200 square feet and inside standards 175 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Brochure prices for the CostaRomantica seven-day cruises range from $795 per 
person, double occupancy, for an inside cabin with upper and lower berths, to a 
top of $2,995 per person, double occupancy, for a suite. Fares vary by season, 
and do offer a discount for early bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romantica alternates eastern and western Caribbean itineraries from Miami, 
calling in San Juan, St. Thomas, Casa de Campo (Dominican Republic) and Nassau 
on the eastern leg; Ocho Rios, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel and Grand Cayman on 
the western itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Classica sails from San Juan on a southern Caribbean itinerary, calling at 
St. Maarten, Martinique, Barbados, St. Thomas and Casa de Campo. The Allegra 
alternates eastern and western Caribbean itineraries from Miami, San Juan, St. 
Thomas, Casa de Campo and Nassau on the eastern leg, and Ocho Rios, Playa del 
Carmen, Cozumel and Grand Cayman on the western route.

BEST OF BERLIN FOR YOUNG TRAVELERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Berlin Wall fell in early November, 1989, Berlin's east and west 
sections were rejoined to create the third-largest city in Europe, with a 
population of about 3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a city whose history attracts curious travelers, but it's also a city 
struggling with tremendous changes. To make visits easier for independent 
budget travelers, there's a free 160-page booklet called "Berlin for Young 
People." 
</P>
<P>
 Due to its decades of division, Berlin has two of almost everything. There are 
two zoos, two main opera houses, two clusters of major museums, two commercial 
centers and two theater districts. There are also three international airports 
and five railway stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The unified Berlin actually has more museums than either London or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also boasts KaDeWe, Europe's largest department store; a zoological 
garden (Zoologischer Garten) with one of the largest zoos in the world, housing 
11,000 animals of nearly 1,600 species, plus a three-story aquarium, and one of 
the most abundant botanic gardens (Botanischer Garten) in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berlin for Young People" is designed to help travelers quickly find their way 
around the city, while getting more than just a superficial impression. It 
covers transportation options, budget accommodation suggestions, do-it-yourself 
tours, sightseeing attractions, entertainment, dining, shopping, open-air 
markets and emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 This publication is designed to help travelers enjoy the city without paying 
prime prices. For example, the guide advises that many major theaters will sell 
reduced-price tickets to students with identification one-half hour before show 
time (assuming tickets are still available). 
</P>
<P>
 The guide provides maps and route suggestions for tours by foot or by public 
bus, ranging from one to five hours. You'll even find suggestions on which 
buildings offer good panoramic views. For example, Television Tower, a focal 
point of the former East Berlin, has a viewing platform and cafe near the 
600-foot level. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggested sights include Checkpoint Charlie, where there's a permanent 
exhibit on the Berlin Wall; Charlottenburg Palace, the former residence of the 
Prussian royalty, which now houses a number of museums; Kurfurstendamm, the 
city's main boulevard that is lined with cafes, boutiques and prestigious 
stores, and the Brandenburg Gate, which today is a symbol of German unity. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet does carry this warning: "Colorful and exciting though Berlin 
night life may be, it does no harm to be a little watchful in the nocturnal 
jungle of the big city. Along with the many creative aspects, there are also 
the darker sides of a metropolis: the drug scene and violence. It's better 
simply to avoid areas, pubs, clubs and other places where you don't feel quite 
at ease." 
</P>
<P>
 When you're ready to leave Berlin, the guide lists Mitfahrzentralen, or ride 
centers, that can help arrange transportation to other cities in cars driven by 
private citizens. It's a form of car-pooling that links passengers with 
drivers. You share fuel costs with the driver and pay a fee. It's cheaper than 
traveling by bus, and gives visitors a chance to get to know residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For copies of "Berlin for Young People" (available in English or French), 
inquire at Berlin Tourist Information offices. You can find them at the Europa 
Center (ground floor, entrance on Budapester Strasse); at the Alexanderplatz TV 
Tower and at the Bahnhof Zoo Railway Station. All offices are open daily.

<P>
 In your excellent article "The Y Option" (Dec. 19), you neglected to mention 
the YMCA International House, 1 Orchard Road, Singapore 0923. Located in the 
heart of the financial/shopping district, the International House offers clean, 
comfortable rooms for about $55. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms have air conditioning, bathroom, television, maid service and the 
McDonald's in the lobby even offers free room service! 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the International House has a large pool and fitness room. Buses 
and subways come and go practically from the front step. And the YMCA takes 
reservations by phone (011-65-337-3444). This is more of a necessity than a 
convenience, for the International House is often booked a month in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore hotels boast occupancy rates of 80% or better year-round, pushing 
the average hotel room cost well over $100 a night. The YMCA International 
House is virtually the only hotel offering comfort and convenience at such an 
affordable price.

 Although I enjoyed the complimentary article on Santa Paula by Paul Dean 
("Weekend Escape," Dec. 5), I was annoyed by the repeated use of my lady to 
describe the female companion. My lady denotes to me, and possibly to many 
other readers, ownership or possession. I felt this description of the woman 
friend, albeit chivalrous, was inappropriate and detracted from an otherwise 
fine report.

 Frosene Papahronis of Fullerton spent three years working and traveling

of her favorites. "Taking pictures of people is the best," she says. "I liked 
this one so much that I blew it up to put on the wall. It captures the ornate

PAKISTAN, INDIA NEGOTIATE AND TENSIONS ESCALATE; SOUTH ASIA: THE TWO COUNTRIES 
TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF KASHMIR, THEN LAUNCH INTO A WAR OF WORDS. NEITHER SIDE 
TRULY WANTS A SOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jennifer Griffin, Jennifer Griffin, a contributor to the Asian Wall Street 
Journal and the London Observer, has written extensively on Asian affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their differences include a decade-old war atop a Himalayanglacier, 
accusations of cross-border terrorism and the specter of human-rights 
violations by the Indian army in what Pakistan has termed "occupied Kashmir." 
Neither side is without obstinate views on these issues. Indeed, neither side 
has softened its stance since partition and the end of British colonialism in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks earlier this month between the two countries' foreign secretaries 
resulted in little progress. But it was the first time in 14 months that India 
and Pakistan have agreed to sit down and talk about their differences -- and 
the first time Kashmir was on the agenda. With each side adhering to its 
long-held stance on Kashmir, it became evident that neither has the political 
will or domestic strength required to end the low-intensity battle between 
India's armed forces and the Muslim Kashmiris, whose fight for independence 
intensified in 1990. An estimated 8,300 people have died in the conflict in the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot pronounce that this (territory) is part of India and still say 
that we want to negotiate," said Shaharyar M. Khan, the Pakistani foreign 
minister two days after the talks. In his office is a life-sized portrait of 
Pakistan's founding father, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who first proposed partition 
from India and the creation of a Muslim state. "How can you begin to negotiate 
if the other party says this territory is non-negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Indian officials contend that Kashmir -- the northwest mountainous region 
given to India by the Maharajah Hari Singh in 1947 -- is an integral part of 
India. The conflict, they say, represents a domestic law-and-order problem. 
They accuse Pakistan of aiding the militants. In response, Pakistani leaders 
claim that the people of Kashmir must decide in a plebiscite whether they want 
to remain with India or become a part of Pakistan, as envisioned by the 1949 
U.N. resolutions on the settlement of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 With little new to say, the talks seemed doomed from the start. Public 
statements issued from Islamabad before the meeting came across as 
antagonistic. Senate resolutions virtually tied the hands of Pakistan's 
negotiators. "An impression was created that the obituary of the talks was 
being written before they were even held," said India's High Commissioner to 
Pakistan, S.K. Lambah. "In spite of that we decided to go ahead with the 
talks." 
</P>
<P>
 At a joint news conference, the foreign secretaries proclaimed the talks a 
small step forward in Indo-Pak relations. Within a week, however, a war of 
words erupted across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao said, in reference to Pakistan, that India 
was ready to combat any external threat at any time. Pakistan's foreign 
minister, Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali, warned that a nuclear war might engulf South 
Asia if Pakistan's territorial dispute with India weren't resolved. 
Negotiations seemed only to inflame tensions between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did India and Pakistan agree to talks on Kashmir? Both sides apparently 
agreed to meet to appease growing international pressure. India wants a 
permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. Instigating talks with Pakistan 
would show the international organization that it is serious about defusing the 
tension in Kashmir, where it is accused of violating human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan wants to improve relations with the United States. Late last year, it 
agreed to withdraw a U.N. resolution criticizing India's human-rights 
violations in Kashmir, and to talk with India, at the behest of the United 
States. In October, 1990, the United States froze relations, along with aid, to 
Pakistan when it became apparent that Pakistan was capable of building a 
nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States sees a solution to Kashmir as a first step toward solving 
nuclear non-proliferation in the region. Pakistan agrees the two issues are 
related. "We feel insecure, because we are the smaller of the two, and for 40 
years we have gotten the short end of the stick. If Kashmir is settled, then 
this issue of non-proliferation is easy to solve," said Pakistan's High 
Commissioner to India Riaz Khokar. "Our insecurity results because of our fear 
of India. We have a major problem that is outstanding with them." 
</P>
<P>
 But India does not want to see the nuclear issue linked to negotiations on 
Kashmir. It would not view a Pakistan offer to allow inspections of its nuclear 
plants as a concession, according to senior Pakistani officials. India needs to 
maintain its nuclear threat to balance power with China to its north. If 
Pakistan agrees to inspections, India also might be pressured to agree to 
inspections with no guarantee that China will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason for the hardening of positions after the recent talks was a 
concern for public opinion back home. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto received 
heat from her opposition in Parliament for agreeing to withdraw the U.N. 
resolution against India and sit down to talks. The Muslim League began a 
campaign to paint her fledgling government as having betrayed the people of 
Kashmir and sacrificing Pakistan's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks lack public support in Pakistan, where the issue of Kashmir is 
integrally linked to Pakistani national identity. The entire justification for 
partition rests on the premise that Muslims need a separate homeland to escape 
Hindu domination. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan's Senate passed a resolution, even before the foreign secretaries 
began talking, urging the government not to enter into any separate agreements 
on Siachen glacier, where thousands of Indian and Pakistani troops have been 
engaged in an expensive battle for more than a decade.  
</P>
<P>
 Each year, more soldiers die as a result of avalanches and frostbite than they 
do from enemy fire. Hopes were high that progress would be made on Siachen 
because both sides would benefit financially from ending this conflict, but now 
both sides are backtracking away from agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pakistan were serious about a breakthrough, it would be discussing 
independence as a third option for the Kashmiris, but Bhutto has made it clear 
there are only two options: integration with India or integration with 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Public outcry also would erupt in India should its negotiators concede 
anything on Kashmir. If India were to agree to a plebiscite in Kashmir, other 
separatist movements might gain momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 In both India and Pakistan the emotional attachment to Kashmir is too strong 
for any major progress to take place at the foreign-secretary level. At that 
level, the spotlight is on both parties to take a hard line. If the two sides 
had really wanted a breakthrough, more behind-the-scenes negotiations would 
have taken place at a lower level so that the foreign secretaries could simply 
finalize the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should the international community be concerned that the talks failed and 
that tensions are once again high between India and Pakistan? For one, the 
dispute remains a flash point with the potential for confrontation. Both sides 
have nuclear capability and, on more than one occasion, they have threatened 
nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, it seems unlikely that the two sides will return to the 
negotiating table. The tactics being used are designed to win support at home 
and abroad, not to resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pakistani foreign minister's statement that nuclear war could sweep Asia, 
should the conflict not be resolved, is designed to draw the United States and 
others into bilateral dispute and raise international concern about the plight 
of the Kashmiris. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, Bhutto plans to be in Switzerland, where she may lead a 
delegation to Geneva to table a resolution against India at a meeting of the 
U.N. Human-Rights Commission. Such a move may score points at home, but will 
speed resumption of talks between the two powers, which represent nearly 
one-fifth of the world's population. For this reason, we should be concerned.

HUBBLE -- FROM FIASCO TO SUBLIME; AFTER A TITANIC STRUGGLE, THERE'S A MARVELOUS 
WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has taken a while and cost a bundle, but the Hubble Space Telescope appears 
finally to be peering sharply into some of the far reaches of the universe and 
producing images of truly remarkable clarity, just as it was designed to do. 
Indeed, says Daniel S. Goldin, the administrator of NASA, "the spacecraft is 
operating beyond our ambition." While a lot more testing of the $1.5-billion 
orbiting telescope is still to be done, astronomers are excited by the early 
signs of success. 
</P>
<P>
 The shame is that the Hubble wasn't in the same condition when it was launched 
nearly four years ago. NASA thought it had a winner then, too. But two months 
after the launching, NASA had to admit that the telescope's 94.5-inch-diameter 
mirror had been improperly ground at the edges, a flaw that surely should have 
been found and rectified on the ground. It took the skills of seven astronauts 
aboard the space shuttle Endeavor to correct the Hubble's problems. Their 
tricky, $629-million rescue mission last month was a feat in itself, and it's a 
credit to those who designed and carried it out that it seems to have succeeded 
so well. 
</P>
<P>
 An orbiting observatory gets around the problem of atmospheric interference 
that Earth-based telescopes confront, making more detailed images of outer 
space possible. The Hubble, even in its flawed state, was able to send back 
images that could be strikingly enhanced by computers on the ground, but the 
sharper focus it's now expected to have will lead, Goldin promises, to 
discoveries that until now were beyond reach. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its key objectives will be to search for black holes, those theoretical 
points in the universe that are believed to be the remains of ancient stars 
that have collapsed into themselves, reducing enormous objects to diameters of 
perhaps only a few miles. A black hole, it's hypothesized, consists of matter 
so dense and thus of such powerful gravitational force that whatever is nearby, 
including other stars, is drawn into its center. Since not even light can 
escape from the gravitational grip of a black hole, its existence can only be 
inferred. The Hubble, among its other potential achievements, might finally 
provide the means for proving that these fascinating objects are in fact out 
there. Knowledge of the universe may at this moment stand on the threshold of a 
great expansion.

THE WEST AND BOSNIA, SERBIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial on Jan. 8, "The West and Bosnia: What Now?" correctly 
presented the stagnation our policy has taken in that region. Last year the 
United Nations voted to use air strikes to protect residents in Sarajevo if 
Serb shelling did not stop. Apparently, the Serbs have correctly determined 
that this was just an idle threat, as shelling of Sarajevo has resumed, and 
instead of hitting them with air strikes as promised, the U.S. and U.N. merely 
condemn them verbally. 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial advocates lifting the arms embargo against the Muslims. Clearly 
this seems like a fair thing to do, in light of the inequality of arms 
availability between Serbs and Muslims, but at the same time, this strategy is 
guaranteed to increase the fighting. Perhaps a better solution lies in more 
adequately cutting off arms to the Serbs. The international sanctions against 
Serbia are designed to do just that, but have failed miserably. The entire 
region is unstable, as surrounding countries brace for waves of Yugoslav 
refugees, but the ethnic Serbs are still receiving their supplies. Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic is demanding the sanctions be lifted, even as his 
troops are active in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic says he no longer supplies the Bosnian Serbs. The U.N. should demand 
that U.N. troops be placed on all Bosnia-Serbia border crossings in return for 
easing or lifting the sanctions. If Milosevic is serious about wanting to end 
the fighting, he should have no problem with this idea, and U.N. troops at 
these points could effectively cut off all military supplies.

 * If your Jan. 4 cartoon depicting a Serb sniper shooting a baby (Commentary, 
Pat Oliphant) did not deal with such a tragic matter, its poor taste would have 
been quite amusing. The cartoonists, of course, are entitled to their freedom 
of expression by the First Amendment. But actually, while your cartoonist was 
letting his imagination run wild, we received a news wire report from Serb 
Sarajevo of yet another instance in which the Muslim snipers killed a woman and 
wounded another person in the Serb district of Nedzarici. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslims fired artillery shells at the Serb civilian and military positions 
on Kasindolska Street (Sarajevo) as another "attempt to provoke Serb artillery 
counteraction, in order to accuse the Serbs of attacking civilian objects." 
Yet, the gullible (or malicious?) Western media report only the alleged Serbian 
shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet genocide which the U.N. sanctions are inflicting upon the 10 million 
innocent Serbian civilians also goes unreported. During my September trip to 
Serbia and Bosnia, I visited several hospitals and saw with my own eyes empty 
medicine cabinets, and talked to many exasperated doctors and desperate 
patients.

artillery barrages on Sarajevo again U.S. warplanes would attack their 
positions. Well, the Serbs are shelling and I see no air strikes against them. 
Have Clinton, the U.N. and all the major powers in Europe lost every shred of 
honor, dignity, morality and decency?

 It's as if they all stand on the bank of a river watching men, women and

 * Women are targets of rape and other equally heinous brutalities, domestic

genital mutilation is traditional in many Third World countries. In China and

 One man has his penis cut off and the media circus surrounding the entire

GARBAGE CAN BIDS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Garbage Cans Teach a Hard Lesson in City Hall Politics," Jan. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 She was the low bidder, a lawyer, and a businesswoman, and she would be 
building a factory in the distressed district of Councilwoman Rita Walters. She 
asked for help with the technical part of "doing business with City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilwoman's staff referred Catherine Bump to a former councilman. This 
expert, registered with the City Ethics Commission, asked for a free trip to 
Germany and $145,000 as his fee if she received the contract. She declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Her closest competitor employed another former councilman who picked Ms. 
Bump's bid apart and got her disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously the bid process in Los Angeles is riddled with a lot of little 
cheese holes that these slavering mice can crawl into. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, Big City, aren't you tired of all this? Rewrite your bid process. Refer 
bidders to the Purchasing Department for verification of their forms. 
Politicians should not be required. 
</P>
<P>
 CARTER DARNELL La Jolla I want to extend my compliments to The Times and to 
reporter Ted Rohrlich for the enlightening and revealing article, describing 
the process buying garbage cans in Los Angeles. However, Rohrlich's story 
instructs us that: 1) it's very dangerous to try to do business with the city 
without a "fixer"; 2) the "fixers" are (surprise!) retired politicians or 
others "close" to city government; 3) "fixers" make pretty big money and 4) the 
city is paying a hell of a lot more for garbage cans than anyone else in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The article does not indicate what kinds of bids the city is looking at in 
connection with its garbage can contract. But from the information supplied it 
appears that Ms. Bump's company -- presumably the low bidder -- is bidding 
pretty close to $54.50 per can. Mein Gott! Das ist ein wirlich Panzer ! -- as 
well it might have to be if it is to be picked up by mechanical arms of the 
city's garbage trucks. Today, I would have a very hard time spending more than 
$30 for the very best plastic garbage receptacle you can buy -- for only one -- 
not the half-million the city is contracting for! 
</P>
<P>
 The article demonstrates why it costs so much to run city government these 
days. I hope Mayor Richard Riordan can do something to change this, but 
frankly, even with the best efforts on his part, it will take several terms 
before he will be able to make a real difference.

THE MENENDEZ MURDER TRIAL: A CASE OF ALL OFFENSE, AND NO DEFENSE; LAW: ERIK'S 
LAWYER, LESLIE ABRAMSON, PROSECUTES, HIS SLAIN FATHER FOR INCEST, TYING THE 
JURY IN VISCERAL KNOTS. THE BIGGEST "WIN" SINCE THE DELOREAN CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner, former president of the Criminal 
Courts Bar Assn., has been counsel of record in 13 capital cases. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hung jury in the trial of Erik Menendez is the biggest "defense win" since 
Howard Weitzman kept John DeLorean out of jail for dope dealing nearly a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Menendez juries -- one for each brother -- were confronted with fact 
situations that did not compute. One story involved blood and money; the other, 
"dirty secrets." While Erik Menendez's jury was hearing testimony about 
cold-blooded murder, they were simultaneously watching a "loving mother" 
nurture her "adoring son" at counsel table. The set-up was the ultimate in 
cognitive dissonance. What Erik's jury witnessed at the defense table was so 
incongruous with what they were hearing from the prosecution that their data 
processing short-circuited. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with one exception, there is nothing about the Menendez brothers' case 
that makes it unique. We get a free peek at a highly dysfunctional, sexually 
eccentric rich family, but we got that a few years ago in the case of Klaus Von 
Bulow. Similarly, patricide, while infrequent, is not so unusual that it should 
obsessively captivate the public's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the Menendez case unique is a defense strategy of unmitigated 
chutzpah -- led by Leslie Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense conceded that Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, 
conceded that the brothers planned the a pre-homicides, conceded that the two 
executed planned cover-up of the shootings, and conceded that Lyle and Erik 
went on a spending spree after the slayings. One is reminded of the French 
general who sent off a communique to Napoleon: "Our flanks are broken, the 
center cannot hold. The time is ripe. We are going to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a murder trial of all offense. The prosecution served up the 
homicides of Jose and Kitty Menendez, and the defense chose to prosecute a dead 
man for incestuous pederasty. No one was defending. How was the prosecution 
supposed to disprove father-son incest, a crime that, by its nature, would 
require the utmost privacy because it violated the primary taboo of all 
cultures?  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the defense's sex-with-sons "charges" against Jose Menendez proved 
so bizarrely diverting that the jury deliberating Erik's case froze in visceral 
ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 35,000 lawyers in Los Angeles. Of them, there are perhaps 100 who 
possess the skills required to defend a death-penalty case. Of that number, 
perhaps 40 have what Tom Wolfe called "the right stuff": a combination of 
physical endurance, canny intellect, tactical brilliance and nerveless courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 40 with the right stuff, there are 39, then there is Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the small world where lawyers play for all the marbles -- and clients die 
if they lose -- Abramson is capital litigation's Chuck Yeager. When she is on 
stage, even her seen-and heard-it-all colleagues are awe-struck. Her 
performance in the Menendez brothers' murder trial was like watching the Navy's 
Blue Angels or the Air Force Thunderbirds -- the anticipation of a 600-mph 
wipeout, followed by dumbstruck amazement that she actually might pull it off 
without spreading hamburger all over the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
 I have known Abramson for 15 years, during which time we have been either 
staunch friends or staunch enemies, depending (mostly) on whether I agreed or 
disagreed with her on something of momentary importance. It is not difficult to 
be her admirer, but it requires the patience of Job and the endurance of Moses 
to be her friend. Abramson is a savant , as obsessed with criminal-defense law 
as Bobby Fischer was with chess, or Vladimir Horowitz with the piano. Anyone 
who does not see what she sees is, by her lights, a fool. At the moment, that 
no doubt includes Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, who is presiding over the Menendez 
brothers' trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many savants , Abramson can be an enormous pain outside her element; 
inside her element -- the courtroom -- she is a prosecutor's heart attack 
waiting to happen.  
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, Deputy D.A. Steve Barshop, a tough trial lawyer in his own 
right, found himself facing Abramson in a murder trial by day and a failing 
marriage by night. In a master stroke, Barshop hired Abramson as his divorce 
lawyer, thereby ethically compelling him to withdraw from prosecuting the 
murder case, and saddling his ex-wife with a nightmare. The move became a 
legend in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a great criminal lawyer shares much with becoming a great actor. The 
experiences and personality traits in the lawyer's inventory are called upon to 
make the current role believable to the audience -- in this case, the jury.  
</P>
<P>
 The summoning of past memories as tools of persuasion follow from years of 
daily practice in the art of public theatre, starting with dozens of 
misdemeanor trials as a public defender and arriving two decades later at the 
pinnacle where a single misstep means your client dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson brought to the Menendez stage her peerless form of empathy and her 
unrelenting volcanic rage. 
</P>
<P>
 When Abramson argued Erik's case to the jury, it was not Kitty Menendez who 
was Erik's mother, it was Leslie Abramson. Hers was not the argument of lawyer 
to fact-finder, but the far more primal defense of cubs by their mother. For 
Abramson, Lyle and Erik Menendez are a modern-day Romulus and Remus. Jose and 
Kitty Menendez were wolves -- not parents -- who needed killing because they 
had turned on "the boys" (who are, of course, men). Not Jose's and Kitty's 
boys. Leslie's boys. That is why she picked lint off Erik's sweaters, brought 
them cookies and jumped down the throat of anyone who questioned whether the 
defendants actually were molested. 
</P>
<P>
 To a number of her colleagues, this is Abramson's patented "act." But to those 
who watch her with some regularity, it would be more accurate to say that her 
virtual "adoption" of murder clients is a self-induced delusional state -- 
sustained not only by Abramson, but imposed on all around her, most especially 
the jury. In a way, watching Abramson try a death case is like watching Jack 
Nicholson act, and thinking, "Maybe he is that crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 In his numerous admonitions to Abramson to stop her "Jewish mother" schtick , 
the remark left unsaid by a sometimes droll Weisberg was, "Ms. Abramson, I 
believe your client has shown, in the most dramatic way possible, that he no 
longer needs a mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson's second quality is her unquenchable rage. A government that kills is 
uncivilized. To Abramson, "gas chamber" does not mean San Quentin; it means 
Auschwitz. People who want to put Abramson's clients into the gas chamber are 
not prosecutors, they are Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman's victory made him, in most lawyers' eyes, the lawyer of the '80s. 
Abramson's stunning victory may well make her the lawyer of the '90s.

 WARNING! In lieu of a U.S. Surgeon General's report, be advised that the 
following may occur while watching "Fool Moon," Bill Irwin and David Shiner's 
evening of inspired, wordless nonsense coming to the Doolittle Theatre on 
Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abdominal cramps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cracked ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tearing eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loosening and possible violent expulsion of false dentures. 
</P>
<P>
 These are, of course, manifestations of uncontrollable laughter. But there are 
other, surprisingly deep emotions generated by the show as well, owing most of 
all to the genius of clowning. It is an art that makes us children again, 
feeling everything in primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since 1990, when Shiner hired on for a U.S. tour with Le Cirque du 
Soleil, the only competition he and Irwin have had is with each other. Though 
Irwin has been in a number of movies ("Popeye," "Scenes From a Mall") and 
videos (Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy"), his greatest national claim 
to fame was his early '80s deconstructivist clown show "The Regard of Flight," 
in which a hat trick is no longer a hat trick but "a hat move , conducted in a 
formalist, postmodern context." 
</P>
<P>
 This did nothing, of course, to assuage his classic actor's panic at waking up 
in a bed onstage and not knowing where he is or who he's supposed to be. It 
did, however, lead to a five-year, $173,000 MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to HBO's airing of Le Cirque du Soleil, Shiner's severe, spidery, 
balefully impatient figure is becoming a widely known comic presence -- known 
but not assumed: He works with different audiences to different result, and 
there is no one who can match his talent for getting civilians colorfully into 
the act without humiliating them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how he does it," Irwin says. "He goes into a bit of a trance, 
and this mechanism kicks in where people trust themselves in his hands. He has 
this eerie ability to pick the right ones." Irwin added, ironically: "Maybe I 
shouldn't mention it. Half the people in L.A. who might want to see the show 
won't come now." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching them warm up for rehearsal onstage at the Doolittle was a bit like 
observing a spring season baseball battery loosening out their winter kinks: 
Shiner the lanky, string-bean pitcher, Irwin the comparatively burly catcher, 
each mirroring the motion of the other in silent harmony. Except of course 
they're in baggy pants, tuxedo tails and formal white sharp-collared shirts, 
and those silly, parabolic hats, the sight of which draws an involuntary smile 
as we remember them on the heads of the maniacal Marx Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how much you can forget in four months," Shiner said, looking 
like someone rousing from a deep slumber (he was in fact jet-lagged, having 
just flown in from his home in Munich). "It's like we never did this show 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming Los Angeles run is the first reincarnation of "Fool Moon" since 
its huge success in New York last winter, where it won the Outer Circle Critics 
and Drama Desk awards and was the object of considerable fuss when it turned 
out too uncategorizable for a Tony. The better critics -- the ones who don't 
rely on stock phrases -- had a tough time writing about it head-on. It isn't 
about gags or stupid human tricks; it's about self-recognition comically 
heightened. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was punishing to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to go back to New York someday, and there's talk of taking it to 
London," Shiner said. "But we can't do this show for any great length of time. 
For me, it isn't the physical part that's so wearing, it's the mental. The 
concentration is so intense that after a period of time I'm totally wiped out. 
I have nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to talk about," said Irwin, "but even though there's no dialogue, 
there is a language of the body that we've had a lot longer than the language 
of the brain and the tongue. We often say things we're unaware of. That's the 
joy of this show -- you have to keep working on it so that it doesn't get away 
from your life. On a good night it stays charged; you don't have to wait for 
the next joke, like a stand-up comedian. It happens at once." 
</P>
<P>
 As with most great comedy teams, there seems an inevitability about Irwin and 
Shiner together that begins with their contrasting look. Irwin's blue-eyed 
summery face is as open as a Kansas sky and he has the chunky, lived-in body of 
a farmhand. He is the sweet-tempered, eternal optimist. Shiner's whippet frame 
seems reduced to a filament of burning indignation; his dark, narrow gaze is 
permanently fixed in a laser-like glower of impatience. Onstage they are 
constantly outwitted by life's superior inventiveness, which inspires a heroic 
befuddlement in Irwin and only gives Shiner more reason to stew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like us to do a routine as vacuum cleaner salesmen," Shiner joked. "He'd 
love the job, running up stairs to people's houses to show them what the vacuum 
could do. Couldn't get enough of it. I'd hate the job, hate him, hate the 
vacuum cleaner and couldn't wait for the day to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of their stage demeanor is an expression of their real temperaments. Both 
are thoughtful, highly intelligent men. But where Irwin exudes the well-being 
of a ripe pumpkin, Shiner's restiveness suggests a continuing struggle with 
boredom. He has the hipster's edge in the classic sense -- a nose for danger. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's no wonder, considering his history. Shiner, 40, was born in Boston 
and has seven siblings. His father was a long-distance truck hauler before 
family demands necessitated a career change; his government work as a computer 
analyst took the family from Colorado to Virginia to Washington, D.C. Shiner 
apparently inherited his father's restlessness, which is central to the comic 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be a clown," he said earlier. "I saw a Jerry Lewis movie 
in school one afternoon when I was 10. I laughed my head off. 'It'd be so funny 
to be funny,' I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Shiner went ahead with a more-or-less conventional education. High School in 
Westminster, Colo., outside Denver; two years as a theater major at Christopher 
Newport College in Virginia (he also did a lot of community theater). He 
supported himself for a 10-year period, beginning in 1971, by building houses. 
Dutiful classroom studies in theater history, lighting and design were no 
substitute for the charge of performing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have had less pain and anguish if I'd gone the school route," he 
said, "but it just wasn't happening. I had a professor who said that everything 
in life takes place in a circle. One day in 1978 I saw a street mime in Boulder 
and realized there was nothing like the street scene. I fell in love with the 
whole idea of silent comedy, which goes back to Keaton and Chaplin. So much of 
the human spirit is based in the clown." 
</P>
<P>
 On a tip from a colleague, Shiner decided to work the streets of Paris, at 
just the age when it seemed the most exciting, daring thing a young artist 
could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had studied movement and dance, and was developing a technique based on 
character. But that character evolved. It started sweet but grew progressively 
more upset. The sweetness wasn't going anywhere. Whatever you're developing, 
you have to be aware of what's going on inside you." 
</P>
<P>
 Shiner was working the Beauborg district, which in the meantime began filling 
up with, as he puts it, "heavy cases." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were drunks, addicts, criminals, other artists you're competing with 
who aren't very friendly," he said. "You're always fighting the elements. It's 
rough territory, guerrilla theater. And remember, this is what you're doing to 
pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd realized after a week that just standing in front of people is crap. The 
act goes nowhere. I learned to work closely with people and got to a point 
where I could cross over barriers and fear, and also keep an audience. I like 
to show all sides of human nature, not just the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many people from different cultures. Working them was funny and 
unpredictable. They let you know right away if it's working, or if you're going 
too far. There was an aggressiveness in the street you never get in the 
theater. It keeps you alert to every opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 But the rawness that inspired Shiner eventually got out of hand. He was held 
up at gunpoint during a performance. He was beaten up more than once. "Some 
people take offense. Then there are people with no food. You can attract very 
marginal types who think you're one of them, only in costume." It was Shiner's 
misfortune to perform one afternoon when a man leaped to his death from the 
roof of the Pompidou Museum. The body smashed into the pavement right next to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never heard that story," Irwin said, when it came up before rehearsal. 
"What did you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What could I do?" Shiner replied. "I walked away. Who could go on after 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the low frequency of disgust that played across his face, you saw the comic 
tension at the heart of his act: He's fine-tuned, a violin. He can deal, but 
the world is too coarse a place for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiner worked several other European cities -- Rome, Florence, London and 
Munich -- before joining a small circus back in Paris and then catching the 
attention of Germany's national circus, Roncalli, which he played for a season. 
He later joined the Swiss circus, Knie, and also toured Europe in a two-man 
show with Rene Bazinet. It was at Roncalli that he met his future wife, Micaela 
Wengenroth, a dressage expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Cirque du Soleil brought Shiner back to the United States in 1990. Chances 
are he would not have returned on his own, though he often grew homesick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt American comedy had gone way off-track with the stand-up scene," he 
said. "Getting up onstage, talking about your personal problems. That's not 
creating an unusual figure you can watch and have a cathartic experience over, 
and if nothing else, have a good hard laugh, which is healing. The great clowns 
don't have to say a lot. They just walk onstage, and it happens."  
</P>
<P>
 But he knew and admired Irwin's work: "An innovator. You don't know what 
you're doing here, but you pull up your pants and get through. All he'll do is 
run over a crack, trip and fall, circle around and do it again. The next time, 
he stops and jumps over it. But then he forgets and trips again. It's that 
simple. The beauty of the clown is in revealing the aspects of ourselves so 
hard to express, the sensibility, the yearning. That's what he's about." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncategorizable is what Irwin is as well. Less Europe-oriented than Shiner, he 
has discouraged the clown tag, but only insofar as it spares him eager requests 
to play children's birthday parties. Like Shiner, however, his energies for, 
well, clowning, always exceeded his impulse to act (though he's done a number 
of straight theater pieces, including "The Seagull," "A Man's a Man" and the 
most recent Broadway production of "Waiting for Godot," with Robin Williams and 
Steve Martin). 
</P>
<P>
 "You might say that I'm stamped out of that which I'm making fun of," he once 
said. "I was always drawn to the structure of comedy and the formality of 
experimental stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-born Irwin, 43, is the son of a set designer. He studied theater 
at UCLA before moving over to CalArts when it was in Burbank, and it was there 
he met innovative director and theorist Herbert Blau. Irwin followed Blau to 
Oberlin College in Ohio as a teaching assistant, and then went out on his own, 
but never out of earshot of Blau's lament, "I always thought he should be an 
actor. He always thought he should be a clown." 
</P>
<P>
 But the energy of the theater is mostly in language, while the energy of 
clowning is largely in movement and spectacle -- and that's what Irwin finds 
the more direct and intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the discovery of moving your chin and shoulder in a certain way can 
suggest so much," he says. "There's a piece in the show which deals with an 
encounter between two businessman waiting for a bus. In how one rises and gets 
taller, or else gets smaller, you can see who's winning the argument that goes 
on between them. Being a performer is like being an athlete. On a good night 
you feel sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin went to clown school at Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus' 
winter headquarters in Florida. But the first circus experience he enjoyed on 
his own was in the Pickle Family Circus in San Francisco, a city that has 
understandable tolerance for the maverick indefinite, since it is so often 
shrouded in fog (he also worked with its ODC Dance Company, and won a National 
Endowment for the Arts Choreographer's Fellowship in 1983). 
</P>
<P>
 The MacArthur Fellowship gave him the chance mostly "to stand in front of a 
mirror, where you develop your ideas over long hours," and to go out and 
observe people and pick up the energies of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very smart in how they allocate the money. It's enough to live on, 
but not enough to support a theater," he said. "And I think they just choose 
workaholics. At any time during the fellowship, you're invited to Chicago to 
meet with the foundation people. But I don't think anyone ever goes. We're all 
too busy working." 
</P>
<P>
 It did allow him to develop his dance-video piece "Largely New York," in which 
he plays a character trapped in a TV monitor (the show played Broadway and 
earned five Tony nominations, among other awards). 
</P>
<P>
 If Shiner had known about Irwin, Irwin knew nothing about Shiner until he went 
to see Cirque du Soleil -- four times. "The energy. The continual nature of the 
laughter -- it was amazing. I took my mother and we looked at each other and 
said, 'This doesn't happen very often, does it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual friends kept urging them to meet. Shiner finally called when the show 
went to New York, where Irwin makes his base with his wife, Martha, and their 
3-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always one of two things when you first meet someone you admire," Irwin 
said. "It's either (rising haughtily) 'I don't want to know you,' or it's like 
two dogs sniffing." (Sniff, sniff.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We sniffed," Shiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to lunch but didn't eat much," Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't eat much?" Shiner asked, incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
 "The food wasn't very good," Irwin replied. "I remember we didn't know what 
made each other laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we kept saying, 'We've got to do something together, we've got to 
do something.' But we never decided what." 
</P>
<P>
 They were finally thrown together in earnest in 1992 when Sam Shepard invited 
them to Roswell, N.M., to improvise bits as two flea-bitten 1872 vaudeville 
comics in his upcoming movie "Silent Tongue." They found that they fell in sync 
so quickly that one of the sketches now in "Fool Moon" was first developed in 
10 minutes in a motel. The Red Clay Ramblers, a disarmingly raffish group of 
musical virtuosos, essential to "Fool Moon," are also in the movie, which 
should afford Shepard some small added tribute for theatrical midwifery. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Shiner and Irwin had been stretching out an hour of luxuriant inaction, 
sitting in the mostly empty theater. But now stagehand activity was beginning 
to pick up at the Doolittle, which meant that it was about time for them to get 
to work on a new and untested show opener. 
</P>
<P>
 They hadn't seen each other in months. Shiner, who looked like he has just 
dragged in from an all-night poker game, rose for an improbably Teutonic 
summing up: "The power of the clown appeals to the child and his innocence. I 
can always laugh at Bill. It's stupid, but it's innocent and naive. It appeals 
to a part of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin never took his eyes off the stage. "There's nothing simple about 
laughter," he said.;

ART; AND WHEN THEY WERE BAD . . . ; WITH HUMOR, SARCASM AND BRAZEN SEXUALITY,

 " Between two evils, I always pick the one I never tried before. " -- Mae West 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood steam queen who noted that good girls go to heaven but bad girls 
go everywhere seems to be the figurative godmother of a new art movement. 
</P>
<P>
 After two decades of serious thinking and writing on the subjects of feminism 
and post-modernism, hundreds of artists have decided that being a bad girl is a 
good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the premise of a bicoastal art exhibition organized by New York's New 
Museum director Marcia Tucker and San Francisco-based independent curator 
Marcia Tanner. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women noticed a widespread movement toward funny, sarcastic and 
brazenly sexual work being produced by an increasing number of artists -- women 
as well as men. The results of their collaboration are displayed in the 
two-part show titled "Bad Girls," whose first part is currently at the New 
Museum, and "Bad Girls West," opening Jan. 25 at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner explains "bad girl" art: 
</P>
<P>
 "What really distinguishes it from previous feminist work is the use of humor 
as a strategy of subversion. And it operates outside the bounds of feminine 
propriety. It is not ideological, though it is operating from a position of 
power and liberation." 
</P>
<P>
 As with so many projects in the women's art world, the exhibition evolved out 
of friendship and phone calls, in this case more than a year ago. Tucker 
plunged ahead to visit studios and commission work in New York, but Tanner 
found herself stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California is rife with bad girls (and boys) making good art, Tanner 
could not convince any venue in San Francisco to support such an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she wrote to her colleague Henry Hopkins, former director of the San 
Francisco Museum of Modern Art and now Director of the Wight Art Gallery at 
UCLA. He agreed to underwrite the controversial show with help from the 
California Arts Council and the UCLA Art Council. Tanner now thinks it was the 
optimum solution, since many works in the show explicitly confront stereotypes 
of women reinforced by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that so much of the show deals with perceptions of femininity makes 
its proximity to Hollywood with all the film and TV industries a wonderful 
place to be," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting the show in L.A. influenced Tanner's decision to choose many works 
dealing with pop culture and celebrity, such as Kathe Burkhart's frightening 
paintings of Elizabeth Taylor undergoing plastic surgery, Deborah Kass' 
Warholesque paintings of Barbra Streisand and Nancy Dwyer's sculpture of giant 
balloons spelling out an inflated "EGO." 
</P>
<P>
 What began as a relatively small show snowballed as the curators found more 
bad girls making art than they had initially suspected. "Once the word got out, 
we were inundated," says Tanner. "There was a tremendous amount of work, 
especially in Southern California. You could have filled the Cow Palace. This 
is a major social phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner selected work by 40 artists, including Judie Bamber, Kim Dingle, Lauren 
Lesko, Theresa Pendlebury, Megan Williams and Millie Wilson from L.A., and 
fairly established artists from New York, such as Marlene McCarty, Lorna 
Simpson and Rona Pondick. Pondick has roped together a pair of 13-foot-long 
double matresses and attached dozens of baby bottles filled with milky white or 
suspicious black liquids. Tanner refers to this sculpture as a "grotesque 
body," referring to messy physical and psychological concepts that confront the 
rationality of late modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the men are Jerome Caja from San Francisco and Ken Aptekar from New 
York. Aptekar parodies traditional interpretations of old master pictures by 
combining them with text etched on glass panels. Raphael's 16th-Century "St. 
George Fighting the Dragon" -- a knight in armor defending a damsel in distress 
-- is labelled "Job Security." 
</P>
<P>
 This mixture of known and lesser-known artist is purposeful. "I didn't want 
this to be a provincial show," explains Tanner. "I wanted it to be 
representative of the best work I could find. I thought it was important to 
present the West Coast artists in a larger context." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker decided to provide exposure to the largest possible number of 
lesser-known artists -- more than 90 are in her two-part show -- including many 
from the West Coast. Among the men featured are L.A.-based Dani Tull and Keith 
Boadwee. Tucker defends the joint decision to include men in the feminist 
exhibition: "Not only do I not think that people addressing the issues are not 
divided by age or race, they are not divided by gender either. Cary Leibowitz 
said that the men who are doing work in this area are trying to be good boys 
rather than bad girls!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker says the show came from her "lifetime commitment to feminism and of 
seeing a lot of work that was really good but that struck me as addressing the 
issues in a different way. The work had to be humorous and transgressive. Humor 
alone won't create the changes in perception that I'm interested in. And 
transgression alone might not. The combination is a double whammy in terms of 
feminist and gender issues. You can say very difficult things if you can make 
people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 She goes on to explain the shift in attitude: "When the women's movement 
emerged in New York in 1968, rage was attendant to it. There was a real fury 
over what had happened, at the agents of its happening and at ourselves for 
letting it happen. Now we're past the rage and into more of a refined tool for 
dismantling the master's house. Younger women have benefited. They can see the 
issues, but it's not the same as 25 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner adds that the title comes from the notion that women are redefining 
their own images and reclaiming language. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s, as the women's movement gained momentum, the term "girl" 
came to be considered pejorative in describing women over the age of 12. 
Picking up on the slang used by African American women, especially in music, 
the words bad and girl now mean good and friendly -- as in "Girl, you are bad 
!" 
</P>
<P>
 From a curatorial stance, Tanner says, "Bad Girls" is defined as the opposite 
of good girls, which is a patriarchally imposed definition. In the "Bad Girls" 
catalogue, she writes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Good girls . . . act feminine, i.e. modestly, quietly, in ways unthreatening 
to men. They put others' needs and wants first. They may wield power or be 
aggressive but covertly, through passive manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good girls don't talk openly about their own sexual proclivities and erotic 
fantasies, which are assumed to be heterosexual (male-centered). They don't 
forge their own persuasive, contradictarian language . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Since many men are alarmed by women with a sense of humor -- a live giveaway 
for a mind and passions of one's own -- good girls confine theirs . . . Good 
girls don't laugh in public, never loudly, and certainly not at anything dirty. 
. . . The 'bad girls' in these exhibitions flout all these precepts. . . . Not 
only are these artists disobeying explicit commandments enjoined by the fathers 
and handed down through the mothers' complicity, they're ignoring the entire 
myth of male hegemony, of paternal lawgivers in art and everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 In the catalogue, both curators have written clearly about the ideas behind 
"Bad Girls," yet the artists have thoughts of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. artist Judie Bamber was censored last spring when her vibrating vagina 
sculpture was covered after it offended a member of the Hollywood Arts Council 
in an ad hoc group show held at the defunct Newberry School of Beauty. This 
exhibition includes other sex-toy sculptures, as well as her paintings of 
beautiful B-movie vampires. The title of the series -- "How Do You Trust 
Someone Who Bleeds for Seven Days and Doesn't Die?" -- is an example of an 
offensive sexist joke that is reclaimed and invested with humor in its 
unexpected context. Bamber says, "When I think of bad girls, I think it means 
you take pleasure in your sexuality. I don't think that's a negative, but I 
think society thinks that it's bad. I guess I struggle with that connection, 
the whole assumption that because you make work about sex that you're available 
sexually. I can't wholeheartedly embrace it, but I accept the idea of turning 
it around." 
</P>
<P>
 New York artist Elizabeth Berdann is making her L.A. debut in this exhibition 
and having a concurrent solo show at the Ruth Bloom Gallery in Santa Monica. At 
the Wight Art Gallery, she has installed "Freak Show" -- 48 miniature paintings 
of female posteriors selected from pornographic advertisements and surrounded 
by leering slogans like "You won't believe your eyes." The companion 
installation at the New Museum is "The Topless Hall of Fame," tiny portraits of 
breasts and the names of the strippers who own them: "Dixie Dynamite" or 
"Montana Mounds." 
</P>
<P>
 "These represent the 'bad girls' of our culture," says Berdann. "I was struck 
by the similarity of the ads for pornography with 19th-Century circus 
advertising. A lot of the language was duplicated as though women were freaks 
men would come to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Dwyer designed the New York "Bad Girls" logo, a Cheshire cat smile. She 
is known for comical word play in her paintings and sculptures and, for the New 
Museum, she fabricated a series of chairs and hassocks shaped like the letters 
in "ha-ha-ha." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the elements in my work that are usually overlooked, or merely 
tolerated, in this show are celebrated," says Dwyer, "the rudeness, the humor, 
the literalness and the pleasure. I've spent a lot of time developing my work 
formally so I'm a good girl in the art world, but I've always had to satisfy 
the other side with humor." 
</P>
<P>
 And why humor? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's transgressive and anti-authoritarian," continues Dwyer. "It's 
hard to take a lot of the doctrines of art-making seriously after a while if 
it's clear that you and your (style of) work have been excluded. Also, humor is 
a way to ingratiate yourself in a world you don't feel comfortable in." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as comic Kate Clinton quips, "She who laughs, lasts." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bad Girls West" opens Jan. 25 at UCLA Wight Art Gallery. In conjunction 
with the exhibition will be a video program organized by New York video artist 
and filmmaker Cheryl Dunye, as well as a performance art series related to the 
exhibition. For further information, call (310) 825-9345.

MOVIES; THE AGE OF INSOLENCE

 Kalle Matso and Scott White, both 26, have been film critics for the Beach 
Reporter, a weekly newspaper, since August, 1992. In their column, "The Reel 
Deal," they chat back and forth about their opinions of the movies they're 
reviewing -- sort of a Siskel & Ebert for the twentysomething set -- though 
they would like it to be pointed out that they have not been to film school and 
don't profess to know more about movies than anyone else. Today's topic is the 
current debate raging through Hollywood: Are Generation X movie- g oers, weaned 
on MTV and Nike ads, physically addicted to films that are long on style and 
short on substance, and are studios pandering to them? And if so, does anybody 
care?  
</P>
<P>
 Kalle Matso: You know, people are always saying, "They don't make movies like 
they used to." My take on that is . . . duh. The technology has completely 
changed, and so has the audience. The real issue is are we hitting new lows in 
entertainment or reaching new highs? 
</P>
<P>
 Scott White: New lows. No doubt about it. As a self-loathing member of the 
much ballyhooed Generation X, I'm a testament to the negative effects of too 
much Diet Coke, MTV and Sega Genesis. If I go just one day without some 
kaleidoscopic visual input, my mother has to call the family internist. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Well, look, that's life. It's a cosmic law that everything gets faster 
and faster, and that applies to movies as well. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I know what the trends are, but because big studios target my 
demographic, great movies -- like "The Godfather" and "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest" -- are fewer and farther between. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: It sounds to me like you have some kind of sick fascination with the 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Oh, I can name some great modern movies. "Dances With Wolves" and "The 
Remains of the Day" are both fine films. My point is that the movie industry 
mirrors the times, and right now we are in an age where Howard Stern and Jerry 
Seinfeld top the nonfiction bestseller list, and there's more interest in who 
will replace Chevy Chase than there is in the fact that Roger Clinton has 
unlimited access to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: That's such a reactionary viewpoint. Every age decries the values of 
the younger generation. My father and his buddies were called "juvenile 
delinquents" for wearing red jackets after they saw "Rebel Without a Cause." I 
was labeled "not quite right" when, after seeing "Batman," I took to wearing a 
utility belt. What's the difference? 
</P>
<P>
 White: The difference is in the degree. Now, even people's reactions to movies 
are dumber and more self-destructive. Look at all these dolts daring cars to 
run them over after seeing it done in "The Program." I'd be very surprised if 
your dad or any of his buddies ever saw "The Grapes of Wrath" and thought it 
would be pretty cool to become oppressed migrant workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Matso: So would I, but Generation X doesn't have a monopoly on stupid 
audiences or stupid films. People talk wistfully about the era that produced 
"The Graduate" and forget that, right next door, Jane Fonda and a guy with 
wings were going at it on the set of "Barbarella." 
</P>
<P>
 White: But if they remade "Barbarella" with THX sound and Industrial Light and 
Magic special effects, it would probably be a serious contender for a People's 
Choice Award. With computer-generated animation, MTV-style camera work and a 
soundtrack by a couple of Seattle bands, they could make a PG-13 blockbuster 
based on the last days of Dylan Thomas. Most of the big movies of this age 
("Star Wars," "Terminator," "Jurassic Park"), sans technological advancements, 
would have been B-movies 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Great. I'm debating movies with one of the Monkey Wrench Gang. Look, 
you're never going to stop the progression of technology, and there's no reason 
to try unless you're a Pennsylvania Mennonite. More sophisticated movie-making 
techniques make for more sophisticated entertainment. Just be thankful that 
"Jurassic Park" was an amazingly realistic foray into the prehistoric era 
rather than 120 minutes of "The Land of the Lost." 
</P>
<P>
 White: But it's all technique now. "Jurassic Park" was impressive, but 
anything cerebral in the film was completely overshadowed by the highly 
provocative scene in which Laura Dern plunges her hands into a big pile of 
dinosaur doo-doo. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: I disagree. I came out of "Jurassic Park" asking myself lots of 
questions. How much do I really know about genetic engineering? Where do we 
draw the line between manipulating nature and playing God? Does Jeff Goldblum's 
chaos theory have any effect on keno?  
</P>
<P>
 White: I don't know. "Jurassic Park" might have inspired spirited discourse on 
the moral implications of cloning in Newsweek and Scientific American, but over 
at the Mann 6, the debate centered squarely on who would win in a fight: T. rex 
or Carl (The Truth) Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Look, I think you're searching for subtlety in all the wrong places. 
You should see one less flick a week and squeeze in a visit to the Getty 
Museum. Great movies that completely lack intellectual qualities are a staple 
of Hollywood filmmaking. Check out "Jaws," "Star Wars" and "Ghostbusters," 
great films mostly devoid of social commentary, unless you count the thematic 
motif in all three films -- that, in the end, evil will always get blown up. 
</P>
<P>
 White: But we've let fast and flashy movies -- like all three "Back to the 
Futures" -- define our theater experiences. We don't want movies to pose 
questions any more profound than "would going back in time and being able to 
predict future events help me meet babes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Challenging intellectual concepts are all well and good, but I can't 
tell you how stoked I was as a 14-year-old watching "Raiders of the Lost Ark" 
to forget, for at least two hours, that I was wearing headgear for my braces. I 
don't think there's any reason to apologize for creating good escapism. 
</P>
<P>
 White: The problem is that escapism is no longer a means to an end but an end 
in itself. At least past generations had a reason to escape; they were living 
under the threat of nuclear Armageddon. What are we worried about -- the future 
of GATT? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: C'mon. It doesn't take much for people to feel the need to escape. In 
fact, sometimes I need to escape from bad entertainment. It was absolutely 
essential for me to re-rent my favorite movie, "Witness," after sitting through 
four hours of the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I just think that our generation has defined itself by its ability to 
find various ways of avoiding responsibility. In their middle 20s, our parents 
went to John Wayne films to forget about house payments. I spend endless hours 
in coffee shops wondering why my mother insists on charging me a token rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Generation X doesn't avoid responsibility. I think we forget about it 
because today's entertainment is so good. I used to do small chores during 
television ads; now I stay put for fear of missing a new Miller Lite 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 White: I don't think entertainment is any better, just more ubiquitous, so 
that we actually get shocked if there's nothing captivating on the tube. In the 
past, if there was nothing good on TV, people would converse or read. Now, if 
all 50-plus channels fail, people panic and beeline to a video outlet, hoping 
that at least one of the "Police Academy" movies will still be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: We do have more entertainment options than any generation before us. I 
mean, I've been planning to buy a chess set for a while, but I figure why not 
wait until it comes out on virtual reality?  
</P>
<P>
 White: Your fascination with flash is exactly what I'm talking about, and it's 
reflected in the movies that Hollywood pumps out. Most Generation X moviegoers 
are hooked on fast-paced flicks and consider anything else a bad substitute. Of 
course, these are the movies that make the big bucks, which explains why George 
Lucas is poised to displace Italy in the Group of Seven while the maker of "The 
Wedding Banquet" can be seen holding a sign that says, "Will direct for food." 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: What are you telling me -- that soon it will be impossible to find 
movies that are out of the mainstream? 
</P>
<P>
 White: No, but there are a lot of us who love the medium of film and want 
desperately to kick the pulp habit, and it just seems that there are fewer and 
fewer movies that allow us to "go on the wagon" every once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: That I can agree with. There aren't enough movies made these days that 
explore the middle ground between compelling visuals and intriguing stories. 
There are some exceptions -- "Boyz N the Hood" and "Unforgiven," to name a 
couple -- but mostly the movie listings consist of "Wayne's World 2" playing 
right next to "The Piano." It's the restaurant equivalent of offering patrons 
either a chili dog or escargot. 
</P>
<P>
 White: It's either period pieces or pyrotechnics. I very much liked "The 
Remains of the Day" but, because my grandmother was unwilling to forgo her aqua 
therapy, was forced to see it alone. I had difficulty convincing friends my age 
to spend $7 to watch a sexually repressed British butler for 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Yeah. I was clearly the youngest person in the theater when I saw 
"Remains." And it was the same thing with "The Age of Innocence," a movie that, 
in my opinion, was extremely well made but had nothing to offer our generation. 
I guarantee that virtually no one in the 20th Century can empathize with a 
character that turns down Michelle Pfeiffer because of social pressures. If 
people want to get Generation X'ers into more thought-provoking movies, they 
should pick subjects that are more relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 White: What, like the upcoming "Beavis and Butt-head" and "Jerky Boys" 
projects? If the movie industry completely kowtows to our spiraling standards 
we'll end up with "Geraldo: The Movie." Doesn't it trouble you that challenging 
films are made almost exclusively by foreign and independent filmmakers or by 
directors who have more money than you can shake a stick at? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Not particularly. I think it's great that Steven Spielberg made 
"Schindler's List," a very heavy, black-and-white movie about the Holocaust. 
There's no way it will generate his usual gross, and I doubt that he'll be able 
to make much money on merchandising rights. 
</P>
<P>
 White: But only Spielberg can pull off a risky movie like that. He could make 
a megahit about philately. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: That's not true. Look at "Flesh and Bone," for example. Here's a movie 
billed as a thriller and yet only has five gunshots in the entire screenplay. 
It was a tight and deliberately slower-paced film. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Which no one saw. If you're going to make a movie that's driven more by 
the characters than by the action, the protagonist has got to do more than 
restock vending machines and stare cryptically at the open road. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: You're being a little harsh. "Flesh and Bone" was a good movie. 
</P>
<P>
 White: To you, maybe. To me it was a boring version of "The Hitcher." Still, I 
hope it encourages producers to sanction movies that aren't based on television 
sitcoms and don't have Roman numerals in the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Need I remind you that "The Godfather II" won an Academy Award for best 
picture? 
</P>
<P>
 White: Need I remind you that "Rocky IV" sucked even more than "The Exorcist 
III"? 
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Look, the bottom line is that you're worried for no reason. I think 
people have always had high- and low-road entertainment options.  
</P>
<P>
 White: I still think there are fewer and fewer exceptions to what is becoming 
an ever-hardening rule. Our generation demands films that fit easily into one 
of three categories: fast-paced, light or maudlin.  
</P>
<P>
 Matso: Let me just ask you one last question. Don't you think 
twentysomethings' demand for snappy and wisecracking cinema has also produced 
some good movies? I mean, in a less frenetic decade, the Coen brothers 
("Raising Arizona," "Miller's Crossing") would have been diagnosed with brain 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
 White: Sure. There's been some good stuff, and, yes, I'm certain that James 
Cameron's next movie will be a real joy ride. On the other hand, I'm equally 
certain that our generation is paying a price for its addiction to flash. Maybe 
it's because I have younger brothers who bring up the tail end of Generation X. 
I know for a fact there is only one way I could get them into an edifying film 
like "The Remains of the Day."  
</P>
<P>
 Matso: And that is? 
</P>
<P>
 White: I'd have to tell them that Merchant and Ivory, while famous for 
excellent adaptations of literary works, are also renowned for really bitchin' 
graphics.

 On Wednesday night, the first of William Shatner's science-fiction "TekWar" 
novels comes to life in a two-hour TV movie. Shatner directed, 
executive-produced and guest-stars in the $4.3-million production, which 
follows the quest of a former cop who escapes from a cryogenic prison in the 
year 2044 to prove his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "TekWar" is part of a $100-million investment by Universal Television in a 
weekly series of 24 TV movies, rotating among six franchises that include 
adaptations of the theatrical films "Smokey and the Bandit" and "Midnight Run." 
They are being marketed under the umbrella title of "Action Pack" and are 
promoted as loaded (at least by TV standards) with action and adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Wednesday, on another channel, brings the debut of the sci-fi 
series "Babylon 5," set on an outpost in space. And in the works for the next 
year are two romantic series from producer Aaron Spelling; "Lonesome Dove: The 
Series," inspired by Larry McMurtry's novels; "Robo-Cop: The Series," based on 
the feature films, Hulk Hogan in "Thunder in Paradise" and yet a third spinoff 
of "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want to watch any of these new programs, don't go looking for them 
on the traditional networks -- CBS, ABC or NBC -- or even the less traditional 
one, Fox. You will find them airing on a patchwork of TV stations across the 
country. Their emergence is not simply a boom in the first-run syndication 
market that earlier produced "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Kung Fu: The 
Legend Continues," but part of a seismic shift in the television landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of TV stations and producers of TV shows are forging new alliances 
and partnerships -- including a torrid race to establish a fifth commercial 
broadcast network -- to stay one step ahead of the avalanche of changes 
rumbling through the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of network newsmagazines ("60 Minutes," "Dateline NBC," 
"PrimeTime Live") and so-called reality shows ("Rescue 911," "Unsolved 
Mysteries") has significantly reduced the number of time periods available to 
drama producers, such as Hollywood's major studios. That figure may shrink even 
further under a recent court ruling that allows the networks to produce and own 
more of their own programming, rather than depend almost exclusively on outside 
suppliers for it. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the studios, syndication -- selling programs directly to individual 
stations rather than to the networks -- has grown from being a lucrative 
sideline endeavor to being crucial for survival. "Looking at the way the 
networks have the ability to produce their own products now, and the network 
schedules tightening because of newsmagazines, you don't really have to be 
pessimistic to project a time when it will become difficult to sell to the 
networks," said a senior executive at one of the major TV studios. "If you 
don't have a means to distribute your product, pretty soon you're not producing 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 TV stations, meanwhile, are welcoming their Hollywood suitors with open arms. 
With 500 cable channels and an information superhighway projected to be heading 
into America's living rooms in the next several years, local broadcast stations 
stand to become one small stop on a very large dial. They need an identity to 
stand out from the clutter -- the kind of identity provided by distinctive, 
original programming. 
</P>
<P>
 That non-network entertainment programming with network-sized budgets can 
succeed has been demonstrated most clearly by "Star Trek: The Next Generation," 
which Paramount launched in 1987. The studio followed up early last year with 
"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and a revival of "The Untouchables." At the same 
time, Warner Bros. created the Prime Time Entertainment Network to syndicate 
"Kung Fu: The Legend Continues" and "Time Trax," and this month is adding 
"Babylon 5." A host of independent producers struck gold in syndication with 
such series as "Baywatch," "Highlander" and "Renegade." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a dramatic new twist this time around. Independent stations are no 
longer just picking and choosing individual first-run programs to create their 
own prime-time lineup; they are increasingly willing to clear out entire 
evenings -- usually two-hour blocks in prime time -- for shows packaged and 
promoted together under a theme or a recognizable name, with national support 
from a major program supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.' Prime Time Entertainment Network, for example, will spend $20 
million marketing this season's schedule, which in addition to three series a 
week includes two two-hour TV movies and a miniseries. The marketing plan 
involves $1 million in advertisements on the cable channels USA, Nickelodeon, 
Comedy Central and the Sci-Fi Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Time Entertainment Network, the Disney Afternoon, Spelling Premiere 
Network and Family Network are all programming blocks being offered for sale to 
TV stations later this month in Florida at an annual convention of television 
programming executives. Spelling's attempt to target women with two hourlong 
romantic comedies in prime time next fall has received solid early support, 
with stations covering 63% of the country having already agreed to air it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most massive launch in the history of syndication may belong to 
Universal's "Action Pack" series. Six feature-film producers are creating 
two-dozen TV movies for a group of 137 stations that collectively reach 90% of 
the country. Every Wednesday night on KTLA-TV Channel 5 in Los Angeles, viewers 
can catch these revolving TV movie franchises, which are being supported 
nationally with a $15-million promotional bang. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them are spun off from Universal feature films, produced by the 
original directors of those films: George Gallo's bounty-hunting "Midnight Run" 
and Hal Needham's car-chase bonanza "Smokey and the Bandit." There's also a 
sword-and-sandal "Hercules" epic from "Darkman" director Sam Raimi; a 
martial-arts saga from Rob Cohen, who wrote and directed "Dragon: The Bruce Lee 
Story," and a science-fiction yarn from "Animal House" director John Landis 
about two friends who discover a spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal went with popular titles and genres to help reduce the financial 
risk inherent in producing for syndication. Without a network license fee, 
which usually covers 80% to 85% of a program's production budget, the 
syndicators are essentially handing the shows over to stations for free and 
recouping their costs by hawking advertising time -- a revenue source they give 
up when they license to the networks -- and selling the movies later in reruns 
and overseas. "In the two-hour form, we feel these adventures will have an 
aftermarket life even longer than one-hours, because they can live on for years 
in movie packages and videocassettes," said Universal Television senior vice 
president Dan Filie. He also expects to spin off the highest-rated movies into 
hourlong series. 
</P>
<P>
 There are advantages in syndication for the creative personnel, too. "Since 
this is done for syndication," said Needham, who shot his four "Bandit" movies 
over 72 days in North Carolina on a budget of $2.5 million each, "I didn't have 
to put up with the network sending me pink pages and orange pages and yellow 
pages of what to shoot and how to shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
 For independent station managers looking to increase the visibility and value 
of their TV stations, even better than the one-night-a-week promise of an 
"Action Pack" is the chance to become part of a national group of unified 
stations who have all agreed to air the same programming at the same time -- 
the way CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox do. Many independent stations doubled their value 
when they hooked up with the Fox network in the late 1980s -- and now Paramount 
and Warner Bros. are offering that opportunity to other independents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary advantage to being part of a network is having a moniker," said 
Rick Feldman, general manager of KCOP-TV Channel 13, part of the Chris-Craft 
station group that has joined with Paramount's station group to form the 
proposed Paramount Network. Assuming the venture gets off the ground, KCOP will 
have to abandon its logo, the Very Independent Channel 13, but Feldman doesn't 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to be part of a large, successful group that both advertisers and 
viewers know as a marketing entity," he said. "The power of that goes a long 
way, especially in promotion. In TV Guide, for instance, you'll see big stories 
about programming on a minuscule cable network that appeals to 0.2% of the 
population. But because they've got a publicity machine and a national reach, 
they get coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 The name has to mean something, however. Keith Samples heads up Rysher 
Entertainment, one of the industry's top syndicators. His upcoming series 
include "RoboCop" and "Thunder in Paradise," both recently cited as the hottest 
new one-hour prospects in a Broadcasting & Cable magazine survey of station 
managers, as well as "Lonesome Dove: The Series." 
</P>
<P>
 Samples considered forming his own network on the strength of his programming, 
but there's one problem:  
</P>
<P>
 "The Rysher name doesn't have the value for stations that a Warner Bros. or 
Paramount does, and justifiably so," Rysher said. "There's a perceived value at 
the station level in brand identification. Fox is a brand name, and it creates 
value for its stations. Stations say, 'If I can brand myself with a big studio 
name, somehow because of the history and diversity of product in the past, that 
will translate into the connotation of quality.' Obviously, we don't have that, 
so we can't sell that." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Fox, with its time-honored logo of searchlights cutting through the 
nighttime sky, both Warner Bros. and Paramount are massive studios with many 
holdings. Warner Bros. produces loads of children's animation for the Fox 
network, more network TV series than any other supplier in Hollywood, and led 
the movie industry in box-office grosses in 1993. Paramount, meanwhile, has 
earned the respect of TV stations across the country with the success of its 
"Star Trek" franchise, as well as such syndicated programs as "The Arsenio Hall 
Show" and "Entertainment Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 In a bitter battle, Warner Bros. and Paramount are racing desperately to sign 
TV stations, because realistically there are only enough remaining independent 
stations to reach perhaps 70% to 75% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at financial realities, only one network will launch," said Kerry 
McCluggage, chairman of Paramount Television Group. Paramount hopes to launch 
its network next January with two hours of prime-time programming two nights a 
week, before eventually expanding to seven nights, afternoons and late night. 
"Star Trek: Voyager" will serve as the bedrock of the network, which according 
to sources will heavily target young male viewers with a mix of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount network may hit a roadblock if Paramount Communications is 
purchased by the home-shopping cable network QVC, whose chairman, Barry Diller, 
was the chief architect of the Fox network and reportedly does not want to go 
through the process of forming another TV network. Nevertheless, Paramount is 
charging ahead with its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Paramount network has lined up enough broadcast stations to cover 
38% of the nation. In most of the markets where there is only one remaining 
independent station, Paramount has beaten Warner Bros. to the punch by signing 
that station first. One reason the Paramount network is attractive to station 
owners is because the stations are not being asked to pay any of their profits 
to the network, something Warner Bros. affiliates must do. The Paramount 
network and its station will simply split the advertising time, reflecting 
current syndication deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, like Warner Bros., hopes to have enough TV stations to reach 85% of 
the country before launch (CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox reach nearly 100%). To obtain 
that number, McCluggage has to sign a fair number of stations already 
affiliated with other networks -- he estimates 10% to 15% -- which will be 
allowed to run the Paramount programming whenever they want, thereby weakening 
the network because it may not be in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.' WB Network, scheduled to launch this summer with one night of 
original programming, will have a promotional advantage by running virtually 
all of its programming at the same time. It will follow in the footsteps of Fox 
by specifically targeting young viewers -- mostly with comedy, but also with 
light drama and reality programming. Young people are more willing to try 
something new, which makes them desirable to advertisers and more likely to 
sample a new network, said Jamie Kellner, the former president of Fox 
Broadcasting who now is at the helm of the Warner Bros. network. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan for Fox was very much like the plan for the ABC network when it was 
new," Kellner said. "New entrants into this business are kind of driven toward 
that younger demographic because they're not going to be able to compete on a 
household basis with the other networks. It's natural to try and attract a 
unique demo when your ratings are lower." 
</P>
<P>
 The WB Network, which includes the Tribune Broadcasting station group 
(including KTLA-TV Channel 5), has already lined up enough outlets to reach 
more than 70% of the country. Paramount executives aren't impressed, though, 
because the WB Network has developed a hybrid plan that will use both local 
broadcast stations and cable channels to form its network -- most notably 
Chicago superstation WGN to boost its coverage across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellner remains unswayed by the Paramount executives who have scoffed at his 
cable plan. "It's old-fashioned thinking to assume people will not watch any 
channel on their set where there's good programming and promotion," he said. 
"If there's anything we proved at Fox, it's that people don't watch networks -- 
they watch programs. We took weak UHF stations with no viewership, and seven 
years later they're competing toe to toe with big VHF stations with large 
network affiliations." 
</P>
<P>
 However the Paramount-Warner Bros. battle shakes out, viewers would seem to be 
the beneficiaries of this scramble to create more programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what Americans want: more original programs in prime time," Kellner 
said. "Four or five or even six networks are required to satisfy the diversity 
of the interest of American people today. I think it's a natural thing that has 
happened, and it had to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as many cable subscribers have complained, more TV is not necessarily 
better. 
</P>

 "With all these new venues opening up, the share of the marketplace will be 
lower," observed William Shatner. "And with that taking place, fewer people 
will see the programming, so less advertising dollars will be paid per minute, 
and the less money you will have in the budget to make more programming. And 
then fewer people will watch because the programming won't be as good. So it's 
a self-generating terrible situation, and the creators have to do their best to 
make every dollar count." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal's Filie acknowledges the risks but says the studios are compelled to 
follow the new paths that are opening to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a TV world beyond this one we know now, with a multi-channel cable 
universe. It's like 'Brigadoon' right now, and we have to peer into the mist to 
see it," Filie said. "Every day brings a transition from what TV has been, to 
what TV will become. I don't think anybody thought Fox would have made it. They 
seemed like they were going into the vinyl record business when CDs came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they designed a lean network for the '80s, and Warner Bros. and Paramount 
are trying to establish a lean network for the '90s. It all boils down to good 
product. Whatever form the marketplace takes, the gatekeeper will always be 
looking to form an alliance with companies who can produce good programming."

 In "SOME GOLDEN STATES," performance artist Tim Miller pretends to have sex 
with a huge plywood cutout of his beloved California. He spins yarns about gas 
station epiphanies, love on the beach and the hometown he and Richard Nixon 
shared, Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 In "STRETCH MARKS," Miller imagines a fiery plane crash on a mythical, magical 
Venice Beach not unlike the real Venice Beach near his home. And in 
"SEX/LOVE/STORIES," he recounts a weeklong vigil held to demand that an AIDS 
ward be built at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 These works were made in Los Angeles. They're about L.A. And they're part of a 
body of work that made this artist-activist a focus of national attention in 
1990 as one of the NEA Four, the group that sued the National Endowment for the 
Arts for rescinding its grants. But if you want to see them in L.A., the 
chances are, well, few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Miller has been living here since 1986 -- and co-founded Highways 
performance space, where he is still artistic director, in 1989 -- he has spent 
much of the time since then as an L.A. artist in absentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Miller spent more than 30 weeks living out of a suitcase, careening 
between such far-flung spots as Winnipeg, Canada, and Sydney, Australia, in the 
space of a few days, only to turn around and do a gig in, say, Glasgow, 
Scotland, or Louisville, Ky., before heading home just long enough to pat his 
dog, then shipping out once again. He spent more time in Britain than in L.A. 
last fall. And when Miller premieres a new work at Highways next month, it will 
mark his first local run in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much work on the road and it generally pays better," he says. "But 
if it were possible, I would like to strike more of a balance. I think L.A. is 
losing some major resources in terms of what might be contributed to the life 
of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Miller can't weigh in with that old saw about not being able to get 
arrested in his hometown. He's been booked for arrest at ACT UP and NEA 
censorship demonstrations plenty of times. But the lengths to which he and 
other L.A. artists must go to support their careers is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost is the matter of where they can perform. On one end of the 
scale, dance, music, performance and interdisciplinary art are seen in Los 
Angeles at such venues as the Music Center, the UCLA Center for the Performing 
Arts, the new Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, the Japanese American 
Cultural and Community Center and an array of university venues from Occidental 
to El Camino to Cal State L.A., which is completing a new complex of 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For emerging artists and others, the best bets are Highways, which is the 
busiest, and Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions. There are also several 
part-time spaces that occasionally present such work. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's actually a pretty limited map for such a big city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're lacking a middle range to fill that gap between LACE and Highways and 
UCLA," says Performance Exchange's Deborah Oliver, an L.A.-based booking agent 
and artist, referring primarily to venues for dance, performance and 
interdisciplinary work. "Where's that 400-seat hall? That's hard in terms of 
career development for artists. They have to get out of town (to work), and 
some don't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem applies to theater as well. While many of the major performing 
arts venues present a limited amount of theater -- and some small theaters such 
as the Fountain also present dance -- theater is divided between a few large 
producers such as the Taper, South Coast Rep and the Pasadena Playhouse and the 
many 99-or-less houses that dot the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming majority of the small theaters now function as full- or 
part-time rental facilities. And the larger Hollywood theaters such as the 
Pantages -- like the Wiltern and a few other venues for dance and performance 
-- charge rental fees that are usually too steep for all but touring companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important than the holes in the venue network, though, may be 
that through the 1980s many presenters held to a longstanding bias against 
hometown artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the National Task Force on Presenting and Touring the Performing Arts 
put it this way in a report titled "An American Dialogue": "Despite the bond of 
local artists to community, a bias often permeates the institutional attitude 
toward them -- as if, at home, they are somehow less creative, less worthy, 
less professional." But, the influential and controversial report concluded, 
"local artists represent a resource that our field cannot afford to squander." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, however, there have been at least two significant developments 
here in the years since "An American Dialogue": An increasing number of L.A. 
artists have garnered international attention and acclaim, and some of L.A.'s 
key presenters have made it a point to look homeward. 
</P>
<P>
 Performance art in particular, which has important roots in the feminist art 
movement that was centered here during the late 1970s, has become a choice 
export. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a cachet L.A. has as a center of performance art," says the Santa 
Monica-based Miller. "Internationally, there's a feeling that the engaged, 
socially contexted, hard-core performance is coming out of L.A., and that's 
reflected in a lot of international festivals right now." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent two-week period in London, for example, Los Angeles was 
represented by Miller, Michael Kearns, Denise Uyehara, Keith Antar Mason and 
choreographer Mehmet Sander. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Britain (last) fall, the majority of performers who were brought in for 
the National Review of Live Art were from Southern California," Miller says. 
"But most sponsors in L.A. are clueless about that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all are clueless. In fact, one of the most significant changes in the 
outlook in the past couple of years is that such larger venues as UCLA and the 
Japanese American Cultural and Community Center are leading the way in the 
other direction. There have also been significant supportive efforts by such 
presenters as Highways and California Plaza and independent producers like Neil 
Barclay. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, UCLA is presenting new works from Sander and performance artist 
Rachel Rosenthal. The 1993-94 season also includes performances by 13 
additional California groups or individual artists, as part of the center's 
"Gold Rush!" series. 
</P>
<P>
 This marks a change in policy since Michael Blachly was appointed director of 
UCLA's Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting last year we began to make a conscious effort to have artists from 
all genres represented and to make sure the balance was there with the rest of 
our program," he says. "It's an important statement to try to make for the 
artists in California." 
</P>
<P>
 The JACCC, under Director Gerald Yoshitomi, launched its "Celebrate 
California!" series in 1990, a programming effort specifically designed to 
reach out to a multicultural contingent of California artists. Under this 
rubric, the center has presented fare as diverse as El Teatro Campesino, the 
Los Angeles Chamber Ballet, soloists Nobuko Miyamoto, Dan Kwong and Amy Hill 
and comedy groups Culture Clash and Latins Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the prolonged recession may also be helping to shift presenting 
priorities toward home, making a virtue of necessity. The 1993 Los Angeles 
Festival, for example, recently found itself faced with a funding shortfall 
that caused it to cancel its plans to import many acts, turning instead to L.A. 
artists -- a move that pleased those who thought that that's what the festival 
should have been doing all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Presenters who do voice a commitment to California talent, few though they may 
be at this point, also see it as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who have a lot to offer need to include California artists so 
that artists can work in our state, but also so that they can begin to get more 
regional bookings, which will benefit the other Western states as well," 
Blachly says. 
</P>
<P>
 And the artists are understandably enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most positive thing I see in 1994 is UCLA getting involved more with 
local artists, supporting local companies," says Sander, who came to Los 
Angeles from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1987 and has been touring extensively in 
Europe lately. "Local artists should be able to be presented by local venues." 
</P>
<P>
 But you won't -- nor should you, say some -- necessarily find all presenters 
beating a path toward indigenous talent. Presenting is, after all, a business. 
And some -- particularly those who don't have a university structure to back 
them up -- say their task is to program what will sell, period. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to think of a spectrum of performing arts presenters, you'd find, 
on the most conservative end, those that don't have the support of a host 
institution, such as La Mirada," says California Presenters Inc. President Mark 
Cianca. "As you go more toward the fine arts end of the spectrum, (you find) 
those presenters who maintain a commitment to California artists because they 
see their work as the research-and-development end of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 For most, the trick is to strike a balance that allows them to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find a balancing of a commitment to California artists with a realism 
that says we have to watch the bottom line," says Cianca, who is also director 
of Arts & Lectures at UC Santa Cruz. "We present some engagements that will be 
more successful so that we can present some that are more challenging. Most of 
us try to present a blend. But for some, that's just not their mission." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Artists have their own stay-afloat strategies. Touring, in particular, 
continues to be a major source of employment, and annual regional and national 
booking conferences can be key to setting up out-of-town gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Southland presenters, managers and artists, for example, took part in 
last month's 37th annual Assn. of Performing Arts Presenters conference, the 
largest marketplace of its kind, which takes place every year at the New York 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big reason for artists to be there is we all go to see performances," 
Cianca says. "My biggest concern about California artists are the dance 
companies, who because of expense elect to stay home. It hurts them." 
</P>
<P>
 For young artists, such gatherings can offer an unusual opportunity to make 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, do L.A. artists have less access to touring or to the 
institutions that encourage it now?" Miller asks. "I've been touring 
internationally for 13 years, and two-thirds (of my dates) are return gigs. A 
lot of it was set up while I was still living in New York. Some people even now 
position me as a New York artist." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York bias may indeed persist. But, says Performance Exchange's Oliver, 
who was at December's APAP gathering, "Artists have to go and push themselves 
to these presenters on a national scale. This is a sad situation that 
presenters aren't exposed to enough of what's going on in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 These kinds of bookings aren't the only kind of touring. Theater director 
David Schweizer, who was tapped as a boy wonder in the early '70s by Robert 
Brustein and Joe Papp, has taken a different route. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to Los Angeles in the late '70s, he has become one of L.A.'s 
busiest directors -- if also one who seems to work here very little. Like 
Miller, he's had to spend a lot of time on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, I had already established relationships with companies and 
theaters around the country, so I was never beholden to the resources of L.A.," 
says Schweizer, speaking by phone from New York, where he's in previews for 
"Booth," a production starring Frank Langella. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweizer has also spent a considerable amount of time directing in Eastern 
Europe under the auspices of a U.S. Information Agency program launched in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially and artistically, Europe was wonderful," says the man who was 
just recently tapped to direct his first main-stage show at the Taper, Lisa 
Loomer's "The Waiting Room," expected within the next year. "It kept me aware 
that what I was doing had consequence, so then I could come back to L.A. and 
create my own consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of political upheaval in Europe, however, Schweizer's been 
stateside more: "In the last year or two, I have been trying to travel less, 
and it's been hard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller probably gets the prize for the most radical solution with his 
a-space-of-one's-own approach. He not only helped found Highways, but earlier, 
New York's PS 122 performance space as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very unusual in that I founded the two main performance centers in this 
country," he says. "Frankly, for an artist, it's the smartest thing you can do 
to nurture your work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I don't perform at Highways more than every year and a half or two 
years, I teach there and it's a place for me to articulate other concerns," 
Miller continues. "I'm a homebody and I like to perform (at PS 122 and 
Highways), in the same way that the Wooster Group almost never performs 
anywhere but the Performing Garage in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 And while not everyone will want to hang out his or her own shingle, more 
innovative companies and individuals are indeed doing a version of just that, 
turning away from depending solely on the major institutions. Not just Miller 
and the Wooster Group, but such artists and companies as the Hittite Empire, 
Michael Kearns and James Carroll Pickett's Artists Confronting AIDS, Alan 
Pulner and Theresa Chavez's About Productions and the Actors' Gang, which will 
open a new theater in Hollywood this year, are just a few of those who have set 
up production companies or theaters that allow them to work independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even such bold moves can leave artists feeling the energy drain for which 
Los Angeles has become known. 
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. problem with keeping artists is a thing of the spirit too," observes 
the veteran Schweizer. "The best thing about L.A. is the way it forces you to 
constantly motivate yourself. And the worst thing about L.A. is the way it 
forces you to constantly motivate yourself."

COVER STORY; MANAGING IN TURBULENT TIMES; AS PERSONAL MANAGER TO SOME OF 
HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST NAMES, SANDY GALLIN HAS EARNED A REP FOR KEEPING SECRETS 
AND DODGING THE SPOTLIGHT. NOW, THE TASK OF REBUILDING MICHAEL JACKSON'S IMAGE 
HAS FORCED HIM FRONT AND CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, Claudia Eller is The Times' movie editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lying on the floor of his posh, newly remodeled Fifth Avenue apartment 
overlooking Central Park while getting a shiatsu massage, Hollywood 
mega-manager Sandy Gallin tells a reporter on the phone that he is finally 
ready to step out of the background and talk about the crisis plaguing his 
superstar client Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me read you something," says Gallin, 53, who also represents such other 
pop icons as Dolly Parton and Neil Diamond. Reading an emotionally charged 
statement he has prepared for The Times in defense of Jackson -- who five 
months ago was accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy and now faces a civil 
lawsuit set to go to trial March 21 -- Gallin finally breaks his carefully 
cultivated low profile, saying, "I can no longer remain a silent witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over several weeks now I have watched in silent horror the press crucify and 
assassinate Michael's character without any solid evidence and with no response 
from his side," he reads. "Based on my very thorough and intimate knowledge of 
Michael's activities" and "insights into his character, I am convinced that 
Michael has done nothing that is illegal or immoral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael's innocent, open and childlike relationships with children may appear 
bizarre and strange to adults in our society who cannot conceive of any 
relationship without sexual connotations. . . . This is not a reflection of 
Michael's character; rather it is a symptom of the sexual phobias of our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin says the only reason for speaking up now is to help Jackson, not out of 
concern for his own image. "I don't think I would have been perceived badly, 
because I have a low profile," he says. "I stay in the background and my 
association with Michael is not that public." 
</P>
<P>
 He is certainly right about that. Unlike his two best friends, Barry Diller 
and David Geffen -- neither of whom can be said to be press shy -- Sandy Gallin 
has managed to keep his personal and professional lives out of the media 
spotlight during his 30-year career, particularly when it involves scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, for example, when his then-clients Rob Pilatus and Fab 
Morvan, better known as Milli Vanilli, were stripped of their Grammy after it 
was revealed that they did not sing on the hit album "Girl You Know It's True," 
Gallin and his management firm, Gallin Morey Associates, were barely mentioned 
in the flood of press accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller defends his friend's choice of a low-profile strategy: "The reason he's 
chosen this tack is to maintain his dignity." Referring to the Jackson crisis, 
Diller says: "In a situation which has become such a media circus, I think what 
he's decided is one more voice isn't going to do anyone any good. He decided 
that the only way to best serve his client was not to talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin says he has always preferred to stay in the background. "I am not a 
star, and I always thought someone I represented would think, 'Why am I not in 
these five pages . . . and why is my manager?' " 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Boston University in communications and the arts in 
1962, the Brooklyn-born and Long Island-bred Gallin, who had always been 
fascinated by show business ("I even wanted to be Barbra Streisand, Frank 
Sinatra, Dolly Parton -- a mega-star in every medium"), realized he was not 
destined for stardom. "It was the day of the pretty boy -- Ricky Nelson, 
Frankie Avalon, Fabian -- and I thought, 'I don't look like them. I am not 
going to make it, because I am not gorgeous.' So I decided I would go behind 
the camera. (Even then) I knew I wanted to be a manager and a producer." 
</P>
<P>
 The boyish-looking Gallin, with his cropped wavy brown hair, lively brown 
eyes, fit 5-foot-9 physique and expensive smile, could, in fact, be mistaken 
for a onetime teen idol. But in lieu of stardom, Gallin chose to transform the 
careers of the undiscovered into superstars, calling on his own strengths: an 
instinct for recognizing talent, hard-nosed negotiating skills, a bottomless 
schmooze capacity and, as one of his former associates put it, "an ability to 
understand the superstar mentality and subjugate his own ego." 
</P>
<P>
 While sometimes the lines are blurry between the duties of an agent and a 
manager, in general the agent negotiates deals for clients, while a manager 
supervises and helps forge a client's public-relations strategies and make 
career choices, and takes a more personal role in an entertainer's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the client as a business or industry," Gallin says, "and the 
manager becomes the chairman of the board. . . . You have to know the mind of 
the people you represent and become their alter ego. . . . I always try to put 
myself into their psyche and make decisions the way they would." Ultimately, he 
says, "all final decisions, no matter how big or small -- whether someone 
should do 'The Tonight Show' or commit to a world tour -- remain with the 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
 This philosophy has served him well over the years. Since becoming a personal 
manager in 1970, Gallin has helped to steer -- and in many cases launch -- the 
careers of Whoopi Goldberg, Richard Pryor, Cher, Lily Tomlin, Barbra Streisand, 
the Pointer Sisters, Patti LaBelle and Olivia Newton-John, as well as current 
clients, who include aspiring stars like Martin Lawrence and Johnny Gill. He 
also has tried to widen his Hollywood power base, with his 8-year-old 
partnership with Parton, in Sandollar Prods., a film and television production 
company that produced "Father of the Bride' and HBO's Oscar-winning AIDS 
documentary "Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt," as well as box-office 
flops like "Shining Through," "Straight Talk" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Jackson who is Gallin's highest-profile client -- and, currently, 
his highest-profile headache. It's safe to say that Gallin is facing the 
toughest gig of his career: rebuilding the image of the world's biggest and now 
most beleaguered pop star. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only a year ago that Gallin, who began working for Jackson in August, 
1990, persuaded the excruciatingly shy Jackson to try to transform his peculiar 
image. Gallin engineered the star's appearances on various televised award 
shows in early 1993, including the NAACP Image Awards, the American Music 
Awards and the Grammys, and booked him at President Clinton's pre-inaugural 
gala, the Super Bowl and finally an intimate televised interview with Oprah 
Winfrey, his first in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin says that as a result of those appearances, Jackson's "Dangerous" 
album, which had been out more than 18 months, shot up the Billboard charts 
from No. 143 to No. 9 and went on to outsell his "Bad" album worldwide. And of 
course, it was hardly a one-way street; a source close to Gallin speculates 
that the manager earns annual fees "in the seven figures" from Jackson alone. 
</P>
<P>
 While he may feel differently about it privately, Gallin is unwavering that 
Jackson's image will remake itself again: "When all of the facts come out and 
people find out how Michael was taken advantage of and extorted, I believe the 
public sympathy will be enormous toward him." 
</P>
<P>
 When the sex-abuse allegations first surfaced in mid-August, Gallin dismissed 
them as just another extortion attempt, of which Jackson, he says, is the 
target of "numerous" times a year because of his wealth. But the matter 
escalated, and Jackson has been under investigation by Los Angeles and Santa 
Barbara police, although there have been no criminal charges. Jackson is 
scheduled to be deposed Tuesday as part of the civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last five months, Gallin has let Jackson's high-powered attorneys 
and other handlers work the front lines, while he has quietly worked behind the 
scenes. Jackson's litigation attorney, Howard L. Weitzman, says Gallin has 
contributed to "every major decision" Jackson has made, including the live 
broadcast in December from his Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara, in which for 
the first time he pleaded his innocence publicly. Weitzman says he believes the 
appeal, which was largely Gallin's idea, "greatly enhanced (Jackson's) image." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Taylor, a good friend of Gallin's, and Jackson's closest confidant, 
says Gallin's support of Jackson has been invaluable. "He is the best possible 
friend Michael can have. He's shown such restraint and such care of Michael 
from the very onset." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor says that when Jackson became addicted to painkillers last fall, in 
part because of stress over the child-abuse allegations, Gallin insisted that 
Jackson's "Dangerous" world tour be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'It's going to cost a lot of money -- to hell with that, his health 
is more important." Gallin, Taylor adds, "was one of the only ones who really 
cared about Michael's well-being. Sandy and I have been the most blunt and 
honest and there for him." Both Taylor and Gallin flew overseas to be at 
Jackson's side at different times, before the tour was called off in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin has managed to stay at the top of his field at least in part by his 
discretion and fierce loyalty. His refusal to ever reveal a confidence has won 
him the trust of the rich and famous over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's quiet and keeps his nose out of things," said Mac Davis, who was 
Gallin's first client, in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin's former business associate Bill Sammeth, who now manages Cher and 
Olivia Newton-John -- both former Gallin clients -- says: "As a confidant, 
nobody is better. If you tell him something, it stays with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends try hard to pry good dish out of Gallin, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's totally worthless as a friend in that regard -- he won't talk about his 
clients," ribs writer Fran Lebowitz. "If I ever decide to go into show 
business, I'd know who I'd want to be my manager. I get more information out of 
the National Enquirer than Sandy." 
</P>

 Lebowitz recounted a recent weekend gathering at Calvin and Kelly Klein's 
beach house in East Hampton, Long Island, where she, Gallin, Diller and Geffen 
are frequent guests. Everybody was seated around the dinner table when a call 
came for Gallin from Jackson. Lebowitz says Gallin ducked into the bedroom, 
shut the door and emerged half an hour later. "We all tried to get him to talk 
about Michael Jackson . . . but he doesn't seem to enjoy telling secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 This quality is undoubtedly valued by the very private Jackson, who in a brief 
phone interview with The Times from Mexico City before the cancellation of his 
tour said Gallin's best attributes as a manager are "his competence, his 
loyalty and his honesty. Those three things you can't buy -- they're important 
to me. It's very important not only to be together professionally but to be 
comrades." 
</P>
<P>
 Landing Jackson as a client was clearly the biggest coup of Gallin's career 
and a nice gift from pal Geffen, who helped bring the two together. But it was 
the kind of signing Gallin no doubt expected to make one day. From childhood, 
Gallin says, "I always knew I was going to be successful." At age 4 he 
announced to his aunts that he was going to be the most successful person in 
entertainment, "and I talked in the millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 The sons of middle-class Jewish parents, young Albert Samuel Gallin and his 
older brother, Henry, moved from Brooklyn to Lawrence on Long Island, then the 
richest Jewish community in New York. "We lived like we were rich, but we were 
always living above our means," he says. He points to his magnificent Malibu 
beach house and says, "We lived in a house like this, where the gas would be 
turned off, the telephones would be turned off, the electricity would be turned 
off and the butcher would call to say, 'We just can't extend any more credit.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 When Sandy was 15, his father, Sidney, a high school dropout who became a 
builder, lost all his money. "My father was always a gambler, and always 
running around with other women. If he made $100,000, he'd spend $125,000." 
When Sidney Gallin had a stroke not long afterward, his siblings put him into 
bankruptcy, the big house and cars were sold to pay his debts, and the Gallins 
moved to an apartment. Sandy's mother, Florence, a housewife who hadn't worked 
outside the home, took a secretarial job to support the family. 
</P>
<P>
 That situation made a profound impression on the young Gallin. Gallin 
confesses to having had until very recently a deep-seated fear of ending up 
destitute, "sitting on a park bench waiting for the bus with a brown paper bag 
between my legs -- poor, penniless, homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from college, Gallin took a $50-a-week job working in the 
mail room of the New York office of General Artists Corp. (predecessor of 
International Creative Management). 
</P>
<P>
 "To deliver a letter to Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme's apartment or Paul 
Anka's -- I couldn't believe it. I was so happy and proud to be in the mail 
room," he recalls. He took a crash course in typing and shorthand, and after 
six weeks of sorting and delivering mail, he persuaded the secretary of 
powerhouse variety TV agent Tony Ford to quit her job and got himself hired as 
her replacement. Gallin began booking such TV game shows as "What's My Line?" 
and "To Tell the Truth" and worked on "The Ed Sullivan Show" -- for which he 
booked the Beatles in their 1964 American debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon promoted to full-fledged agent, Gallin signed a diverse group of clients 
like Cass Elliott, Richard Pryor, Joan Rivers, Dr. Joyce Brothers and Virginia 
Graham. He worked his way up through the agency's music, TV and packaging 
departments and became a senior vice president at age 28. In the mid-'60s, he 
was transferred to GAC's West Coast offices, a move he welcomed because he was 
a closeted homosexual. "I was afraid of being gay living in the same city as my 
brother and mother," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen, who briefly worked with Gallin at the agency, had proposed that the 
two go into business together in a record company and management firm. In a 
decision he has always regretted, Gallin turned Geffen down to become, in 1970, 
a manager with his distant cousin Raymond Katz, who represented such clients as 
Jackie Gleason, Merv Griffin and Jack Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The two remained partners in their firm, Katz Gallin, for 14 years, managing 
such clients as Parton, Tomlin, Rivers, Cher, Davis, Goldberg, Anthony Newley, 
Florence Henderson and the Osmonds, as well as producing a number of 
award-winning TV specials and shows. In 1984, the cousins had an acrimonious 
split over the allocation of fees, and Katz sued Gallin for taking clients 
Parton, Davis, Goldberg and the Pointer Sisters; the case was settled out of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin formed his own management company in 1985 with Jim Morey, a longtime 
manager and former partner at Katz Gallin. The same year saw the launch, with 
Parton, of Sandollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1985, Gallin had his one shot at stardom, hosting a short-lived NBC 
summer-replacement variety show called "Live and in Person," which quickly 
foundered, and also caused a major conflict with at least one client. "I didn't 
want a manager who was a performer, who would get on the phone and say, 'Sorry, 
I can't talk, I have to go on camera,"' says Rivers, who fired him shortly 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 That he never achieved stardom -- and has yet to become a movie mogul -- are 
two things that stick in Gallin's craw. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Rosenman, a onetime close pal of Gallin's who co-headed Sandollar's 
movie division for six years before leaving last June for Brillstein-Grey 
Entertainment, says: "Sandy always wanted to be a player in the motion picture 
business -- and he will. As a manager, depending on the viability and 
marketability of your clients, you're a player, but as a producer you're viable 
yourself only if you have a hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Future Sandollar projects include "I.Q.," a romantic comedy for Paramount to 
be directed by Fred Schepisi, and "Father's Little Dividend," a sequel to 
"Father of the Bride." Sandollar TV has two new on-air commitments: one for an 
NBC series starring Gaby Hoffmann, about a young girl growing up in St. Louis; 
the other a CBS series, "Dixie Fixin's," featuring Parton as the host of a 
cable-TV cooking show. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these ambitious plans -- and Gallin's hope to "raise the quality of 
the movies" -- he maintains that management remains his first priority. Parton, 
whom Gallin has handled since the early '70s, says, "Sandy is the greatest 
manager anyone can have." The fact, she points out, that "I can be best friends 
with someone managing my career and be in business with him has made it easier 
for me." Their close friendship, however, did not sit well with some of 
Gallin's other important clients, including Rivers and, reportedly, Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 "There've been some professional jealousies, and Sandy has lost some major 
clients because they feel he put me first," Parton says. "He doesn't put me 
before other people. . . . It just happens that I am his best friend and he is 
mine, and they were jealous because we have such a great and rare friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Diamond, who knew Gallin for several years before hiring him as his 
manager nine years ago, says that initially he was "a little nervous" about 
entering into a business relationship with a friend. But, he says: "It's worked 
out wonderfully. I don't do anything without getting his input on it." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of his clients, including Parton and Davis, credit Gallin with 
believing in their talent even before their careers took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from nothing -- making zip working for a (music) publishing company -- 
and within a year I was doing college concerts all over the country, TV, and 
had a hit record," recalls Davis, who met Gallin when he was a struggling 
songwriter. He later introduced Gallin to Parton, who was a struggling 
singer-songwriter herself. Shortly after signing with Gallin in 1974, she had 
her first crossover hit record, "Here You Come Again." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Klein, who is not a client but a close friend of Gallin's, recalls a 
night he spent with Gallin in L.A. five years ago, a day before checking 
himself into a rehab clinic in Minnesota: "I think of him as my brother. It was 
a difficult time for me, and just knowing he was there was all I needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a number of Gallin's ex-clients still keep in touch with him. Whoopi 
Goldberg, whom Gallin managed from 1983 to 1990, says: "He promotes you; he 
gave me all my good habits and good pointers on how to talk to people and how 
to deal in business." Now represented by Keith Addis, once a partner of Gallin 
and Morey's, Goldberg says the reason she fired Gallin was "very simple -- I 
outgrew Sandy and he outgrew me. He moved on to new folks like Michael." Once 
she won the best supporting actress Oscar for "Ghost," Goldberg says, her goal 
with Gallin had been achieved and "it was time to move on and explore some new 
avenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers too credits her former manager with "taking me from being an opening 
act in Vegas and guest on the (Johnny) Carson show, to a (headlining) act and 
doing concerts." And Tomlin, also a former client, says of Gallin: "He can just 
get you geared up for anything. When I was with him I even sang a duet with 
Barry Manilow," referring to a spoof of duet songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Morey, Gallin's management partner, who considers himself "a button-down, 
conservative person" compared to the "very flamboyantly" styled Gallin, says: 
"He gets some crazy ideas sometimes, but there may be one tiny aspect of a wild 
idea that becomes the driving force of a project. . . . We speak everyday at 
about 7:30 a.m. and Sandy will have an idea I think is pretty outlandish. By 
noon that idea doesn't seem so extraordinary, and by midafternoon, I'm on the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin does have his detractors, however, who are quick to say he can be 
ill-tempered, controlling and dismissive to people he thinks don't matter to 
him. He is also very hard on people who work for him and with him, which even 
he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is respectful to the people he likes, needs and perceives to have power, 
and he is rude and dismissive to people he cares little for," said a Hollywood 
executive who has done business with Gallin over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny Tim, a client from the GAC days, still harbors anger toward Gallin for 
snubbing him at Gallin's 1980 surprise birthday party. After being invited to 
perform at the L.A. party and traveling from New York by train, Tim remembers: 
"I said 'hello' to Mr. Gallin and he was absolutely not friendly. Not only did 
I get the cold shoulder from him, it was 'thank you and goodby.' . . . I never 
forgot it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin suggests that what may seem condescending is actually shyness. He does 
admit he has a hot temper (he claims it's more under control, after four years 
on Prozac) and can be impatient. He admits he once threw a desk at a secretary. 
He also acknowledges: "I am a perfectionist and expect it from others -- poor 
everyone around me." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't get an argument about that from some ex-employees. Barry Josephson, 
an executive vice president of production at Columbia Pictures who worked as a 
manager for Gallin from 1983 to 1988, says: "He's hard to work for, very 
demanding and goal oriented. It's trial by fire to work for him, but he's a 
winner, so when you graduate, you get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin's present employees are much more circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will only demand of you what he himself would do," says Sheila Gilles, who 
has been Gallin's assistant for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 That perfectionist nature extends from the elaborate homes in which Gallin has 
lived to his personal appearance. "I am fastidiously clean," he says, as if the 
eat-off-the-floor appearance of his house didn't say enough. "It's a good thing 
I'm not picking up your folder, your glasses and your tapes and putting them in 
the drawer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin's critics say he has lost many more high-profile clients than he has 
acquired, and that he is not the vital force with new talent that he once was. 
One highly placed record-industry source says: "He's had a big turnover of 
employees and artists. Why? It's a problem with the way he's structured his 
business -- he's always delegated other people to manage his acts. Put it this 
way: He's not on the tip of our tongues when we look for a manager for an act." 
</P>
<P>
 But even his detractors view Gallin as someone who yearns to belong and be 
loved. "Down deep, he's really a mensch -- a nice Jewish boy who won't 
consciously do anything immoral. He's competitive and self-absorbed, but 
basically he wants desperately to be liked," says someone who knows him well. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin, in fact, is candid about his self-absorption. His extensive plastic 
surgery and three manicures a week in the office are legendary. His other 
indulgences? "Collagen as often as needed and massages three to four times a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 His morning ritual includes yoga, meditation and working out with a personal 
trainer. And he is admittedly hypochondriacal and has a relentless fear of 
getting AIDS, though he continues to test negative. "I go get tested every time 
I get a cough, and my doctor says, 'I'm not doing this again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago Gallin had a different cause for worry. After discovering a lump 
under his arm, he learned he had cancer. While waiting to see if the cancer had 
spread -- it hadn't -- Gallin said he began to mediate and use visualization 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of his avowed gratitude to God for sparing his life, his morning 
ritual also includes putting on tefillin -- small leather boxes containing 
passages from the Old Testament that observant Jews don daily as part of the 
prayer ritual, along with a prayer shawl and yarmulke. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin's longtime friend Carole Bayer Sager says: "We all tease him about 
everything he's done -- his meditating, exercising, praying -- but this is 
something Sandy did way before it was fashionable." Bayer Sager, who met Gallin 
in New York in the '60s on a blind date that she remembers as a "dazed horror," 
says he "really tries to incorporate some spirituality into his rather hectic 
external lifestyle. He looks for some inner meaning or connection -- and I 
relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin's spiritual leanings seem in stark contrast to his more temporal, 
extravagant Hollywood lifestyle. Sources estimate Gallin's personal worth at 
$30 million, and say he makes $3 million to $7 million a year. While his wealth 
pales next to that of Geffen (whose personal fortune is about $1 billion) and 
Diller (whose QVC network is currently bidding about $10 billion for Paramount 
Communications), Gallin says he is grateful for what he has, though he wouldn't 
mind more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love if a little birdie would fly into my window with several hundred 
million dollars and lay it on the table right here. I live very big and spend a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallin's prize possession is the $13-million Cape Cod-style beach house he 
built in Malibu in 1991, where he spends nearly every weekend with Scott 
Bankston, 32, his lover of six years, who is a talent manager at Gallin Morey, 
and his three Boston terriers, Uggams, Mickey and Panda. (During the week they 
live in the Hollywood Hills, near Gallin's office.) 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent perfect day, Gallin sits on the veranda of the white clapboard 
house overlooking the Pacific, eating a lunch served by his cook. He is dressed 
in madras cotton shorts and forest-green T-shirt, relaxing in the luxurious 
surroundings, which, though lovely, are in fact more modest than the 
ostentatious Beverly Hills mansion Gallin previously lived in. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a ridiculous house," Gallin says. "I always dreamed of living in 
Hollywood and making it big, of knowing famous, influential people and stars 
and being in the loop. So I built this 17,000-square-foot house, and the night 
I moved into it and it took me 45 minutes to turn on all the lights, I knew I 
made a major error." 
</P>
<P>
 That mansion -- one of 11 houses that Gallin has built or remodeled -- was the 
site of his lavish Hollywood parties, which have been supplanted by a more 
low-key style of entertaining at the beach house. "As I've become more secure 
in myself, more spiritual, I need less of the outside accouterments to make me 
feel accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 That growing reliance on the spiritual can only help during his current 
crisis. Diller says Gallin "doesn't complain" about the emotional weight of the 
Jackson ordeal, but points out that "the fact that this has been an everyday 
crisis for so long, I think it's a real tear on somebody. . . . He may have 
great strength and reserve, but it can't be easy on him." Comparing Gallin's 
work to that of super-agent Michael Ovitz, Diller says, "No matter how good or 
strong you are at it, it's a truly stressful life, and therefore your life is 
subjugated to your clients.' "

LOVE GOD FROM HELL; THE MAN WHO BROUGHT YOU VIDEODATING HATES TO DATE, LOVES TO 
TAUNT AND HAS HIMSELF BEEN UNLUCKY IN LOVE. WOULD YOU BUY A RELATIONSHIP FROM 
JEFFREY ULLMAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, Amy Wallace is a Times staff writer. Her last article for the 
magazine was about gang-member-turned-hot-author Monster Kody Scott, Making 
Monster Huge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The big man with the heart-shaped cuff links sits in his spacious Encino 
office, a "Get-a-Woman-Flames-of-Desire" candle on his desk, a rubbing of 
Rudolph Valentino's headstone on his wall and two middle-aged businessmen in 
his clutches. The men have come to ask Jeffrey Ullman, the king of videodating, 
about buying a franchise. They have yellow legal pads on their laps, tassels on 
their loafers. Zany they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ullman, founder of the world's largest singles introduction service, can't 
help himself. Midway through a discussion of royalties and fees, he lets a 
phone call from his publicist divert him from the business at hand to a 
favorite topic: aphrodisiacs. He launches into a rapid-fire rant, pacing the 
room as he prattles on about ginseng syrup, bone marrow jelly and chestnuts 
steeped in Muscadet. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the no-nonsense Elizabethans, chestnuts -- being flatulent -- 
incite Venus," Ullman says, reading gleefully from a love potion cookbook. "I 
never heard of gas getting your rocks off! That's a good one!" 
</P>
<P>
 His guests swap terrified looks. And then, suddenly, Ullman's back on track. 
Las Vegas, he tells the businessmen, is on the smaller side, but it's ripe for 
the business of love. Salt Lake City, too. They're big on marriage in Utah. 
Plunk a franchise in there, Ullman says, hire a few Mormons and you'll never 
look back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any virgin area left in New Jersey?" asks one of the men, much relieved to be 
discussing the commercial, not the carnal, side of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope," says Ullman happily, biting into a turkey sandwich as he sketches out 
the geographical sweep of his growing empire, Great Expectations. But there's 
always Honolulu or Charlotte, he says. With the right management team, even 
Oklahoma City could be a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The men seem impressed. It looks as if Ullman has sold them on taking 
video-assisted coupling into the heartland. He talked tough and refused to 
bargain. He spoke their language -- the lexicon of the bottom line. But even as 
he cements the connection, he is compelled to test it one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching into his desk drawer, he pulls out two foil-wrapped packets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Condom?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 YOU MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD OF JEFFREY ULLMAN, BUT CHANCES ARE you've gotten his 
mail. "Where do You Go To Meet Quality Single People Like Yourself?" asks one 
Great Expectations direct-mail letter, which touts the merits of choosing a 
mate via videotape. "No more uncomfortable blind dates," the mailer promises. 
"No more wasted time in singles bars. No more losers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman is the man behind the pitch, which he has sent out 500 million times 
during the past decade. At 44, he leads the videodating industry, which he 
pioneered in his native Los Angeles in 1976. He and his franchisees own 45 
Great Expectations Centres in the United States and one in Mexico. His company, 
which claims to have more than 150,000 members, takes credit for thousands of 
marriages and grosses about $65 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 18 years, Ullman's invention has done more than change the way some 
heterosexuals get lucky. For better or worse, it has become an integral part of 
American culture. And Ullman, a fast-talking, self-described "social-change 
activist," is a big reason why. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman preaches the gospel of self-improvement, and he has a knack for turning 
almost any trend to his advantage. Feminism? It's made dating confusing, he 
says, all the more reason that singles need high-tech help. Yuppie materialism? 
People who work all the time, he says, need an efficient way to meet. AIDS? 
Casual sex is out, he says, marriage is in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to marry America," he says. "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Great Expectations comes in. Ullman says losers become winners 
simply by joining. Great Expectations members don't all find mates, he 
acknowledges. But at least they surmount what Ullman calls the biggest 
obstacle, "coming forward and saying, 'I'm ready.' " And at about $2,000 per 
three-year membership, that makes him a big winner as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman has become a millionaire by following his own advice. He never tries, 
he says, he does. He has little patience for weakness. He balks at timidity. He 
is an "emotional provocateur," he says, whose "involving confrontational" style 
forces people to realize their opportunities. But the self-anointed Love God 
has a problem. His in-your-face ethic has helped build a thriving business. And 
at times, it has also made him insufferable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman is a goofus. Once, when he needed to borrow $300,000, he wore a clear 
plastic tie filled with shredded dollar bills to a meeting with a banker. 
Another time, just for fun, he bit into a fake blood capsule and began frothing 
at the mouth and screaming. The nurses at the blood bank where he pulled this 
stunt are still talking about it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, Ullman-the-prankster shares a brain with Ullman-the-bully. He has made 
his employees cry -- a habit that once got him banned from visiting his 
centers. Years ago, he laid off his own mother. Then, after giving her another 
chance, he booted her again. "Ultimately, I had to say, 'You just don't get it, 
Mom. You're fired,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He was no easier on his sister, who until 1984 was a Great Expectations vice 
president. "She was excessively overweight," Ullman recalls. "I don't just mean 
overweight. I mean, her clothing, her hair, her nails -- she wouldn't wear 
hose. She was a lesbian! I didn't care about that, but it showed. " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ullman's sister calls him a "rage-o-holic." His longtime assistant 
calls him "very offensive." And his wives? Ullman may call himself an expert on 
courtship, they say, but his three marriages have faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to mean well, and he certainly does well. But whether Ullman is 
mean-spirited or merely tactless, whether he is driven by profit or a pure 
desire to join the world in wedlock, would you buy a relationship from this 
man? 
</P>
<P>
 TELEVISION TALK-SHOW HOST MONTEL WILLIAMS once asked Ullman: "Are you preying 
on the lonely people out there?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he shot back. "Just like restaurants prey on the hungry and doctors 
prey on the sick and talk-show hosts prey on the people who are too bored to 
read a book." 
</P>
<P>
 But restaurants sell food. Doctors sell medicine. What, exactly, is Ullman 
selling? 
</P>
<P>
 This weekday evening, the Great Expectations Centre in West Los Angeles is 
bustling with men and women. Many of them are attractive. All of them are 
available. But no one is making small talk. The place is hushed as they flip 
through three-ring binders containing thousands of all-important first 
impressions, otherwise known as Member Profiles.  
</P>
<P>
 The Member Profile -- a one-page autobiography, with photo -- is the backbone 
of the Great Expectations system. Like the label on a can of soup, it lists 
basic ingredients -- height, weight, religious preference -- and gives some 
qualitative data. Members briefly describe "Who I Am," "What I Like To Do" and 
"What I'm Looking For." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am as wild as they come," writes Alfonso, a fourth-grade teacher. Alan, a 
novelist and TV producer, promises that he's not "the kind of guy who keeps his 
emotions so subterranean you need to go spelunking to find them or a Rosetta 
stone to interpret them." Asked what she's looking for, a marriage counselor 
named Jody simply writes "a fireman." 
</P>
<P>
 If intrigued by a written profile, a member can cue up a video for closer 
inspection. There, Ullman promises a window into the soul. A video interview, 
he has said, "shows appearance, animation, personality, charm and all of the 
ambitions, desires, dreams, wants and needs which can be hidden in the ordinary 
social contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman may overstate. Despite his interviewers' attempts to prompt fascinating 
answers -- "When you meet that special woman," goes one interview question, 
"are you going to know it right off?" -- not everybody shines on videotape. And 
not everybody tells the truth. "One guy picked me. He said he was in PR. He 
said he was 5-foot-9," says Barbara Lakin, a photo editor at TriStar Pictures, 
who describes her recent one-year Great Expectations membership as "a joke." 
"It turned out he was a limo driver. And he was like 5-foot-3!" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's no denying that videotape can be very revealing. 
Alfonso-the-wild-man, for example, confesses on his video that he takes women 
to karaoke bars on the first date and that he would never, ever jump out of an 
airplane for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "People lie all the time," says Bonnie Beaux Fullerton, a Costa Mesa comedian 
who met her husband, a chemist, through Great Expectations. What's more, some 
folks just aren't themselves on videotape. "It's an unnatural thing for 
people," she says. "You'd see the little sweat balls on their upper lips." But 
Fullerton is definitely the consumer Ullman courts. "People join GE to meet 
someone, get married and have a family. That was my intention," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Victor Ramirez, a contract administrator who lives in Diamond Bar, felt the 
same way. Friends said he was too good a catch to need the help of an 
introduction service. But he wanted to get serious about his love life. The bar 
scene was inefficient. "I don't want a series of one-night stands," says 
Ramirez, who compared the price of a Great Expectations membership to "going 
out once a week to a nightclub, where I don't meet anybody." He concluded that 
videodating was more cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can screen women. And there are plenty," he says, flipping through a 
binder. Several weeks later, he is still flipping. "I've met 10 different women 
in 2 1/2 months," he says. "I'm getting what I want out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 How do you measure the success of such a system? If he fried fast food, Ullman 
says, he'd count burgers sold. Instead, he counts marriages. Metal on the 
finger is the ultimate goal, and Ullman employs two full-time coordinators of 
so-called "Success Stories" to track the nuptials.  
</P>
<P>
 Ullman believes that the number of weddings now tops 10,000, but because not 
all centers have kept continuous records, he can only provide the names of 
several thousand. He also offers no data on his rate of success; Ullman says he 
hasn't kept a total of how many people have joined Great Expectations, so it's 
impossible to do the math. 
</P>
<P>
 His statistics, or lack of them, may raise a few eyebrows. And then there's 
the matter of his own romantic record. Divorced twice, he separated from his 
third wife last fall. "I've been too willing to enter into marriage without 
carefully evaluating what was really there," he says. "I've been guilty of the 
following three things: 1) I can change her, 2) She will change or 3) I will 
change. Only a fool will follow those and I have been a thrice fool." 
</P>
<P>
 But all that is irrelevant, he insists, to the workings of Great Expectations. 
"There's an old line of 'Doctor, heal thyself.' (But) is Jeffrey Ullman 
hypocritical? The answer is no," he says. "I'm here to stimulate. I'm here to 
inform. I'm here to educate. But I'm not here to say, 'Follow me.' I don't say 
that." And therein lies Ullman's genius. While he markets himself as a 
modern-day Cupid (a mural on his boardroom ceiling features the winged cherub, 
topped with Ullman's 6-month-old face), he never guarantees love. "Great 
Expectations is not a 'just-add-water-for-an-instant-relationship' service," 
warns a guidebook for new members. "Used correctly, it provides wonderful 
results. Used incorrectly, it may not. . . . It's up to you what the results 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Ullman never says, "Follow me." He says: Pay me, then do your best. If you 
fail, you have only yourself to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 ULLMAN HAS A WACKY IDEA. LET'S CALL EX-WIFE NUMERO UNO, HE SAYS, punching the 
number of a San Francisco hospital into his speaker phone. Patrice Chapman, an 
executive secretary, answers on the first ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Department of surgery," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Ullman says, flashing a big grin. "I'm looking for a vasectomy. I know 
a big dick." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do, too," Chapman replies, not missing a beat. "Hi, Jeff." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman and Ullman were college sweethearts. They lived together in a commune 
in Berkeley, rallied in People's Park, marched against the Vietnam War. In 
1973, when they married in Rough and Ready (a town in California's Gold Country 
chosen for its weird name), Ullman arranged to capture his wedding on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 He first experimented with video while studying journalism at UC Berkeley. The 
technology was new -- the portable cameras were unwieldy, the quality was poor. 
But Ullman says he had a hunch that it could be used to help people solve their 
problems. Who wouldn't pay money for that? 
</P>
<P>
 He headed to the golf course. Want to fix that slice, he asked the guys on the 
green. For $25 an hour, he'd let them scrutinize themselves on instant replay. 
Tennis players, too, paid to watch themselves swing. The experiments weren't 
lucrative -- to make a living, Ullman was a traveling teflon salesman. But all 
the while, he was searching for a video niche. 
</P>
<P>
 At a dinner party in 1975, a friend helped him find it. Meeting men, she said, 
was a drag. Blind dates were too awkward. Chance encounters were too risky. 
"Well," Ullman blurted out, "advertise." And that's when it hit him. Why not 
use television, the most powerful advertising medium of all, to troll for 
mates? 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman was raised to be his brother's keeper, he says, to make a contribution, 
to do the right thing. As a child growing up in Los Angeles, he had wanted to 
be a doctor, a civil-rights lawyer, maybe even a congressman. But in video, he 
says, he found his true calling. "I realized it really wasn't politics for me," 
he says. "It was communication." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, with a start-up loan from his parents, Ullman's Great Expectations 
was born in a windowless office in Century City. It was to be a family project 
-- in fact, only Ullman's brother, Dana, never worked for the company. His 
father, Sandy, a pediatrician, came up with the name. His mother, Estelle, was 
his first employee -- though for the first lean year, she donated her time, 
mostly working one on one with members. Chapman, his bride, helped with the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 But just two years later, as his business grew, Ullman's marriage fell apart. 
The problem: She was "a hippie at heart," Chapman says, "not the least bit 
competitive or aggressive." And Ullman was fast becoming a relentless yuppie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Sharp (Member 1280) seemed different, Ullman says. They met when 
Sharp, a high school teacher, signed up with Great Expectations in 1978. A year 
later, they began dating. "Stephanie was a woman who accepted my business. I 
saw in her unadulterated, complete acceptance. I was enamored," he says. They 
married on Valentine's Day, 1981, and overnight, Sharp became more than just a 
wife. She was a marketer's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 She posed for promotional photos with Ullman. He mentioned her during his 
increasingly frequent television appearances. "Thousands of couples, including 
myself, have gotten married through Great Expectations," he told talk-show host 
Jane Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he would share the airwaves with Geraldo, Merv, Oprah, Phil and Sally, 
tossing off his spontaneous, over-the-top humor and advice that -- while 
sometimes unnerving in person -- made for undeniably snappy television. In 
1983, sales of Great Expectations franchises took off. Suddenly, Orange County, 
Mountain View and San Diego, which had sold in the late '70s, were joined by 
Houston, Portland, Chicago, Seattle and Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Ullman was experimenting with direct mail. These were "the 
golden years," he recalls, when the novelty of receiving unsolicited junk in 
the mailbox had not yet worn off. "Finally. An intelligent way to meet people," 
gushed one of the early mailers, which helped make him a millionaire.  
</P>
<P>
 But yet again, Ullman's financial successes were accompanied by personal 
problems. He and his mother were at odds. "My mother wanted to put her arms 
around the company," he says, recalling how she loved to help pair people up 
instead of letting the system work on its own. "In many ways, she throttled the 
company." After he fired her the second time, they did not speak for more than 
a year -- though they made peace before her death in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ullman went to war with his sister, Dyan. By all accounts, 
she was a great interviewer and saleswoman. Warm and funny, she relaxed Great 
Expectations members and made them feel at home. But since childhood she had 
been heavy, and that was something her big brother couldn't abide. "She was 
wonderful after you got to know her," Ullman says. "The problem is, you'd look 
at her and say, 'Oh, God!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dyan is now a successful businesswoman in her own right; she and her partner, 
Terri Levine, own Just In Case, a Santa Monica luggage store. A decade has 
passed since Dyan left Great Expectations, and during that time -- including a 
period when the siblings sought joint counseling -- she has come up with a 
theory about what makes her brother so fierce.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jeffrey doesn't think about how you're going to feel. He believes you should 
take care of your own feelings. He really does want you to be strong," she 
says, adding that he has always been this way, even as a child. "Sometimes he 
seems to be incredibly proud of being an asshole. Jeffrey would call it tough 
love. It just gets to a point where you say, 'Do I want to be loved that way?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Dyan was apparently not the only one asking that question. In 1989, Ullman's 
second wife filed for divorce. Sharp alleged, among other things, that Ullman 
was obsessed with polo -- they were members of the prestigious Santa Barbara 
Polo & Racquet Club. She said Ullman worked too much. She also accused him of 
physically abusing her, though she now says those charges were not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hired some cutthroat attorneys that put words in my mouth. That came from 
attorneys I ended up firing," she says. Now, Sharp says she and Ullman get 
along, sharing custody of their son, 10, and daughter, 9. "He's been a very, 
very good parent. He enjoys doing kid-like things." 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman sums up his second marriage this way: "I suffer from overconfidence. 
She suffers from underconfidence." And to hear him tell it, his third marriage 
-- to Robyn Santemire, whom he met when she worked as his personal assistant -- 
suffers from some of the same problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Ullman thinks he knows the problem with his love relationships. He has been 
"too entrepreneurial," he says, applying the same no-holds-barred, 
full-steam-ahead strategy to romance as he does to business.  
</P>
<P>
 "He puts 100% into everything. He invests fully," Keith Granirer, Great 
Expectations' chief financial/ operating officer, says of Ullman's personal 
life. He concurs. "I don't date," he says. "I marry." The owner of the world's 
biggest dating service doesn't like dating? "That's right," he says. "Margaret 
Mead was never really an aborigine, and look what she did." 
</P>
<P>
 But if his third marriage ends, Ullman says he is going to change his ways. 
"If there is a mind-set for the '90s, it's that anything can be accomplished 
with an intelligent plan," says one of his recent brochures. And Ullman's plan 
is to embrace his own method and put himself on the market. For the first time, 
he's going to join Great Expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE MAIL COMES A VIDEOTAPE LABELED "FOR MEN ONLY." IT IS AN infomercial for 
single men, hosted by a motivational speaker named Richard Gant. Ullman has 
just completed his latest infomercial, "Romance, Reality and Results," so he is 
eager to get a look at the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 He pops the tape into his office VCR and watches, amused, as Gant delivers his 
spiel to a group of well-coiffed young men. Suddenly, one man speaks directly 
to the camera. Gant's tips, he says, are especially designed for people whose " 
great expectations don't seem to pan out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman erupts at the mention of his company's name. "F--- you! F--- you!" he 
screams at the television, a big, incredulous smile on his face. "Who dresses 
you, bozo? Mr. Polyester?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman lives to be on top. And he works hard at staying there. He spares no 
expense to investigate even the least-threatening rival. Smaller videodating 
companies are his primary competitors, and there are more of them than you'd 
expect, all with optimistic names like Connections or Heart to Heart. But 
Ullman keeps an eye on all methods of pairing up, from personals listings to 
computer dating to old-fashioned matchmakers. He's been known to put on 
costumes to drop in on competitors. And he has proven himself a formidable and 
unforgiving opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 When VideoDate, one of Ullman's first rivals, went out of business, he stopped 
by its empty offices and ripped the nameplate off the door. He keeps the wooden 
plaque as a trophy. Since then, scores of other Great Expectations knockoffs 
have failed. And when they do, Ullman is often there to buy them out, merging 
their membership lists with his own.  
</P>
<P>
 He is driven by more than money. Sure, Ullman lives comfortably in the San 
Fernando Valley, drives a new Cadillac, takes expensive vacations and collects 
African art. But his boundless desire to grow bigger makes him reinvest much of 
what he makes. "His assets are all in this company," says Granirer, the 
company's financial officer. "It's not about money at all for him. It's about 
building this company." 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman has gone so far as to sue the state of New York, seeking to strike down 
an unusual law that places a $250 ceiling on fees charged by "social-referral" 
services. The cap has kept Great Expectations out of the Big Apple for too 
long, Ullman says. "I want a bite." 
</P>
<P>
 But he has learned that growth can be painful. Four years ago, his franchisees 
staged a revolt. They had paid as much as $55,000 apiece and were forking over 
as much as 10% of their returns every month. With the recession, increased 
competition and a hike in direct-mail postage rates, they said, Ullman was 
demanding too much. They threatened to strike and withhold their royalties.  
</P>
<P>
 Ullman was angry. Still, in a departure from his usual combativeness, he opted 
for compromise, reducing royalty fees to 8% and temporarily rebating 37.5% of 
that money to an advertising fund that serves all Great Expectations operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he still chafes at the memory. "They're quick to count my money," he 
says of his franchisees. "They paid -- are paying -- money to be part of a 
system. To get the best of the best. They forever shall pay." But he 
acknowledges that the mutiny forced Great Expectations to grow up: "It has 
absolutely proven to be a win/win for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has distanced himself more and more from the daily management 
of his company, preferring instead to act as Great Expectations' chief 
spokesman and marketing guru. When a Santa Monica bank came up with the ad 
slogan "We handle more zeros than a dating service," for example, Ullman 
organized a demonstration on its doorstep, handing out bumper stickers that 
proclaimed, "I'm no Zero." (This ploy won him a mention in the Wall Street 
Journal). 
</P>
<P>
 Great Expectations has prompted its share of spoofs. When Johnny Carson 
received a mailer at his Malibu home, he filled out the questionnaire live on 
the "Tonight Show." ("What am I looking for in a mate?" he asked Ed McMahon. 
"Someone who doesn't know the meaning of the word marriage .") And TV's "The 
Simpsons" invented "Low Expectations Dating Service," where members admit their 
flaws on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman loves the attention. He holds his head high. "Of course, it lends 
itself to cynicism. Like, 'Great Expectations are followed by profound 
despair,' " he says. "Well, yeah? So? We don't say, 'You pay your money and 
it's perfect.' We're not a matchmaker." 
</P>
<P>
 He reserves special scorn for matchmakers. He says their low-tech approach 
encourages singles to place too much trust in a stranger's instincts. "It's 
relationship fascism," he says, adding that matchmakers "give you their opinion 
of what you like. I believe, as a child of the '60s, you should have power." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Ullman has locked horns with a few marriage brokers. 
Christine O'Keefe, for example, a Beverly Hills matchmaker, former Great 
Expectations executive vice president and author of "How to Successfully Flirt, 
Date and Mate." Today, she says Ullman is among her dearest friends. But in 
1988, she sued him for, among other things, intentional infliction of emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 When she worked for Ullman, she says, he heaped such brutal verbal abuse on 
his employees that she forbade him to visit his own centers. "When he arrived 
on the scene, some people were just plain out frightened," she recalls. "He is 
a terror as the boss. If he ever chooses another occupation, he could apply to 
be a terrorist and get the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, O'Keefe too felt the sting of Ullman's wrath. He refused to give 
her her last paycheck. "He just said, 'Sue me,' " says O'Keefe, who says Ullman 
eventually paid her a settlement and then called her to patch things up. "He'll 
walk all over you and he won't even look back to see what he stepped on." 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Keefe, herself an ambitious businesswoman, still admires Ullman. "I give 
him credit. He does work his business." 
</P>
<P>
 Helena Amram isn't so forgiving. The self-described spouse-hunter, who claims 
to have arranged 8,000 marriages around the world, has loathed Ullman since 
1990, when New York state sued Amram for overcharging and engaging in 
fraudulent business practices. A Manhattan judge later ordered her to refund 
dissatisfied customers. At the time, TV's "A Current Affair" aired a story on 
the lawsuit and asked Ullman for comment. Never one to pull a punch, he called 
Amram "the Saddam Hussein of dating." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, at an L.A. trade show, Amram says Ullman added injury to insult 
by slapping her. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery charges and was 
sentenced to community service. Still, he says, Amram was asking for it. "She's 
less than one foot away from me, she spits at me -- a big loogie! -- right 
between the eyes," he groans. 
</P>
<P>
 Amram, a former gunboat sailor in the Israeli army who says her "high-class" 
clients pay as much as $50,000, maintains that she is too much of a lady to 
spit. In a civil suit filed in 1992, she claimed that Ullman's single slap 
shook loose her dental implants, made her deaf in one ear, damaged her marriage 
and hurt her business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is he to beat me up?" she asks, sitting in her posh office just a stone's 
throw from Rodeo Drive. "Jeffrey Ullman will pay, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Amram has joined forces with Larry Hash, an Anaheim used-car salesman and 
Great Expectations member who is also suing Ullman. Ullman punched Hash twice 
in 1991 while Hash was picketing with a sign: "I GOT RIPPED OFF BY GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS." (Ullman says the blows came after Hash whacked him with the 
sign.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hash and Amram have picketed Great Expectations together. And Amram has given 
Hash a free membership in her service -- though Hash reports that one recent 
date she arranged for him was "so far off it was ridiculous." Ullman cackles 
when he hears this news. "Larry is a loser in life," he says, and Amram is "the 
vilest." "I'm dealing with nuts," he says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS LATE SUMMER WHEN the Great Expectations family descends upon the 
wildflower-strewn mountains of Vail, Colo. The occasion: the annual franchisee 
conference, a once-a-year pep talk, strategy meeting and gripe session that 
this year draws about 80 Great Expectations franchise owners and employees from 
around North America.  
</P>
<P>
 At this four-day meeting, Ullman plans to declare war on bad service. His 
corporate staff has been preparing presentations for weeks. The Ballistic 
Service Training Series, for instance, will use a military theme to drive home 
the importance of serving clients better. ("I've got a strobe light and a 
recording of bombs exploding," explains the woman who thought up this gimmick. 
"It's going to be a major wake-up call.")  
</P>
<P>
 But before the shelling can begin, Ullman has a few things to get off his 
chest. "Many of you, I think, at times laugh at me in a very dispiriting and 
mocking way," he says at the opening session. " 'Who's that egotistical fool?' 
'Who's that guy who continues to put his name, picture and face on everything?' 
Well, it's the same guy who gets hate mail. It's the same guy who's been spit 
on by competitors (and) hit over the head by an angry member." 
</P>
<P>
 The franchisee/franchiser relationship, he continues, is very much like a 
marriage. If both partners don't pull their weight, there's bound to be 
trouble. "We're at a crossroads right now -- at a pivotal place," he tells his 
troops. He shifts gears to talk about the future, but he can't resist a final 
poke at the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in 1990 set our entire company back," he says, referring to the 
franchisee revolt. "It had to happen. I accept that. (But) it changed my life. 
Jeffrey Ullman is a different franchiser. I'm tougher. I'm wiser. I'm prepared 
to take Great Expectations into the 21st Century with all of you or with some 
of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, his tone thaws. He reaches behind him, beaming as he grabs a big, 
Styrofoam tombstone emblazoned with the letters, "GE R.I.P." "This could be 
(the future): GE Rest in Peace," he says. He means to deliver a cautionary 
message, but his giddy pride over his homemade prop is getting in the way. He 
holds up another faux headstone that says: "Negative Images of GE." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the grave I want to tap-dance on," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman has been thinking hard about the future, and he's got some big, big 
plans. Statistics indicate that by the year 2000, half of all Americans will be 
single. He wants to reach every last one of them, to come into their homes via 
cable hookups, to probe into untouched rural markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Great Expectations has inspired a syndicated television show, "Love 
Connection." (Ullman receives royalties of $9,000 a year). But national sweep 
has failed to satisfy him. There's the rest of the romantically undeveloped 
world to think about. Japan is intriguing. So is Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not all. Ullman dreams of expanding beyond singles, introducing his 
video networking capabilities to industry. "He who has information has power," 
he says. "We believe that if you knew who wanted to meet you for purposes of 
business that would be a very powerful thing." He doesn't want to say too much 
and tip off his competitors. But mark his words -- if anyone can pull it off, 
Great Expectations can. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a people broker, aren't we? That's really what we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lonely hearts are everywhere, and their pain is timeless. Vows will 
always be broken. Connections will always fail. The perfect mate will, for some 
people, always seem a heartbeat away. On that, Ullman can rely.

<P>
 Inside a ramshackle brown brick police station, Lt. Col. Mikhail Sergeivich 
Pertsev absorbs the latest news crackling over the police band. "A man with a 
submachine gun just threatened a man in a car," he says gloomily. "The man lost 
the car." 
</P>
<P>
 A carjacking? Where? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not far from here. An area that used to have a lot of construction. Huts were 
built for the workers to live in, and there was lots of fighting with knives." 
Pertsev pauses. "We call this district Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 As chief of one of Moscow's smaller police stations, in the northern part of 
the city, Pertsev seems to possess a bottomless store of good humor, which he 
needs. He presides over 110 officers -- "We should have 120, but no one wants 
to be a policeman anymore" -- and a fleet of seven squad cars, two of which 
don't work. "They are like the Aurora boat that started the Bolshevik 
Revolution and is now a museum in St. Petersburg," Pertsev says wryly. "They do 
not move." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind the desk in his no-frills office, Pertsev proudly hoists a 
brand new police radio. "It's a Motorola, and we have our American colleagues 
to thank for it," he notes. "Seven came last week. Unfortunately, we need 40 or 
50." Before the radios arrived, Pertsev's men relied on Hungarian-made sets. 
"The Hungarians probably felt hurt with us after 1956," he offers slyly. "Their 
radios only caused trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Immovable cars and balky radios are the least of the problems that dog 
Moscow's 100,000 officers. An escalating crime spree has exploded -- sometimes 
literally, with grenades -- throughout the streets of this city of 9 million. 
Cars disappear in the night, a new old-style mafia operates with reckless 
abandon, and guns abound, thanks to the disintegration of the Red Army, which 
has made stolen weapons commonplace on the black market. Even when a criminal 
is caught red-handed, police may have to let him go. Russia's criminal justice 
code, enacted in 1961, did not envision many of the new order's cunning crimes. 
Added to all this is a departmental reorganization that has blurred territorial 
boundaries, confusing just about everyone. "We are the only state system that 
has not collapsed," Pertsev laments. "But that isn't saying much."  
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Vershkov, a ruddy-cheeked lieutenant colonel in charge of press 
relations, shakes his head at the insanity of it all. "Every day, we have 
explosions, stolen autos, robberies, apartment assaults," he says, using the 
Russian vernacular for burglary. "Such things we have never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, last summer, a man in a policeman's uniform entered one of Moscow's 
new commercial banks, pretending to check out how the bank was performing its 
duties. Right behind him marched seven submachine-gun-toting accomplices. A 
four-hour standoff with the police ensued. The result: one cop dead, two others 
wounded, six suspects apprehended, two still at large, a police force -- and a 
city -- dumbfounded. "This was our first bank stickup," says one high-ranking 
police official. "The state took it very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But not as hard as the December murder of Nikolai P. Likhachev, chairman of 
the gigantic Rosselkhozbank, who was gunned down in his Moscow apartment -- one 
of 30 bank officials murdered last year. On the day of his funeral, banks and 
currency exchanges closed to protest the government's inability to protect 
them. Seizing the moment, hard-liner Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky raised crime to a 
political issue by blaming violence on people from former Soviet republics.  
</P>
<P>
 Before former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and then Boris N. 
Yeltsin, opened up Russia to a free-market economy, there had been no crime in 
Moscow, officially, because socialism was a perfect society. Well, maybe a 
little crime. Desperate for car parts, citizens routinely stole each other's 
windshield wipers, while party officials pocketed great gobs of state money, 
but otherwise there was little to steal. Now, with the influx of foreign hard 
currency and a proliferation of commercial ventures, Russians are experiencing 
one of the ancillary fruits of capitalism: big-time crime. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a growth industry. In the past few years, three tabloids have appeared, 
each dealing with only one subject -- crime -- which is often the lead story on 
TV news as well. This is understandable. During 1993, about 19,000 major crimes 
were committed in Moscow, compared to 302,000 in Los Angeles: While one in 11 
Angelenos was victimized, only one in about 500 Muscovites felt the sting of a 
major crime -- but that's a 39% increase over the same period in 1992. Still, 
while Los Angeles averaged 78 murders a month, Moscow averaged 100, up 55% from 
the previous year, and "heavy wounds," from which the victim may or may not 
eventually expire, were up 34%. Auto thefts, carjackings and car robberies are 
running at about 675 a month. When the year began, five or six cars were stolen 
a day; during one recent night in Moscow, 102 cars vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many auto thefts do you have in Los Angeles?" asks Vershkov, the press 
relations man. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 70,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Vershkov blinks. "Oh." 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've been at it longer." 
</P>
<P>
 More interesting are statistics involving police action. During 1993, they 
fired their guns on 1,358 occasions, while in Los Angeles, police used their 
weapons in only 144 incidents. "We are allowed to shoot at people if we order 
them to stop and they don't," explains Alexander Shestakov, 39, a veteran of 
the Moscow traffic police. "If a child has a gun and is a threat, I will have 
to use my gun. I will first shoot into the air. Then at his feet, legs or 
arms." Which explains why, a few months after the Rodney King beating incident, 
a member of a delegation of Russian police visiting Los Angeles told Chief 
Daryl F. Gates, "We don't understand all the fuss. In Russia, we would have 
just shot him." 
</P>
<P>
 Use-of-force definitions aside, the average Moscow policeman is much like an 
L.A. cop: overworked, underpaid, ill-equipped, outnumbered. The two departments 
even share a strategy: community-based policing. In Moscow, it exists in the 
form of one officer, called an uchastkovy , in each small police district, who 
is housed in a state-funded flat and whose job is to know his neighborhood. "He 
is supposed to know how people deal with each other, who drinks too much, who 
might be in need of medical help," says one official. "Most of the time, he 
stays in his office and people come to him, but he also makes the rounds. If a 
crime is committed, he is usually called in. He knows the people better than 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this coziness, relations with the community are, if possible, even 
worse than in Los Angeles. If some Angelenos call LAPD officers brutal, almost 
all Muscovites call their cops criminals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Money, money, money!" shouts Alex Belabin, my driver in Moscow, every time we 
pass a white-gloved traffic cop standing over some doomed motorist. It is a 
common sight. "Russian people hate the police," says Belabin with passion. 
"Every day, they pull me over. 'Hello, Alex!' Money, money, money!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fines for traffic infractions must be paid on the spot. If the motorist 
doesn't have the dough on him, the officer may follow him home to collect it or 
confiscate his license. But everyone knows you can buy your way out of almost 
any violation, even drunk driving, by slipping the cop several thousand rubles. 
Although this keeps the motorist's record blemish-free, Russians resent the 
practice and refer to traffic cops as milkmen -- people who milk the public.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have jokes about the police," says one young woman. "An officer tells his 
superior he's getting married, and he needs more money. The superior hands him 
a portable stop sign." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just the traffic cops who have their hands out. With the advent 
of commercial ventures come commercial bribes. A small-business owner without 
the thicket of proper licenses and state approvals can simply pay off an 
investigating officer to ignore the infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is news to Pertsev. "We have policemen who take bribes," he says 
with a weary shrug. "Things do not run too smoothly here." 
</P>
<P>
 SPACE IN MOSCOW IS SO TIGHT THAT POLICE STATIONS TURN UP IN THE oddest places. 
One I visited consumes half of an apartment building; another is located in a 
taxi park. Mikhail Pertsev's Khovrino Municipal Police Station is housed in a 
former school built in 1946. Dark, dank and dungeon-like, it's a prime example 
of Russia's crumbling infrastructure. Stairs are broken, floor tiles cracked; 
paint peels off walls; hallway ceilings are a mass of tangled wires. Many 
overhead fixtures lack bulbs; the bathroom is beyond description. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seems to faze Pertsev. "I work 12 hours a day," he says with 
feeling, "though two or three nights a week, I stay longer, till 1 or 3 in the 
morning, depending. I also work weekends. This summer, I was supposed to have 
50 days vacation. But after 20, I was relieved to be called back because of so 
much crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Pertsev, a stocky, dark-haired 43-year-old, tackles his job with an 
old-fashioned sense of pride and responsibility. The chunk of Moscow he watches 
over, a "sleeping district" of 70,000, is where he grew up and where he still 
resides with his wife and two sons. Thus, he knows where all the bodies are 
buried, or at least where they live. He feels protective toward his men -- even 
toward the neighborhood hooligans, some of whom he has helped find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as is true everywhere, the neighborhood has changed. Pertsev became a 
police officer in 1979, after serving six years in the Soviet military. "When I 
was young and lighter in weight, I could bring back five or six criminals at a 
time," he recalls. "I didn't need to carry a gun. They wouldn't resist me. Now, 
we all walk around with submachine guns." 
</P>
<P>
 On cue, two officers burst into Pertsev's office to show me. Each wears a 
helmet and, over his clothes, a bulletproof vest that seems a closer relation 
to knight's armor than to the light Kevlar vests common in America. Strapped to 
each belt is a 9-millimeter pistol. In their hands, Kalashnikov submachine 
guns. "Whenever we get a call that a crime is in progress, these are the men we 
send out," Pertsev says. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they use motorcycles? 
</P>
<P>
 Pertsev grins. "We have some, but they're old and can't be used in a chase." 
He jumps up. "Come, I'll show you around."  
</P>
<P>
 Pertsev flings open an office door and points to the desks, bragging that he 
bought them from an old hotel. Then, throwing open another door, he announces 
proudly, "This is our gym. Our officers built it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The drab room, maybe 15 feet by 10 feet, is two-thirds consumed by blue floor 
mats surrounded by ropes. A makeshift slant board, balanced on the seat of a 
broken-back chair, is crammed between two rusting sets of barbells. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets worse. The forensics lab, housed in a tiny, gray, damp room with a 
single fluorescent bulb, contains only an ancient photo enlarger. More 
sophisticated work, such as analyzing fingerprints, must be done at 
headquarters. In December, 1992, Pertsev's station was issued three new 
Russian-made Moskvitch police cars. "By January," he says, "we were making 
repairs." Although the cars are serviced at a friendly auto shop, where the 
owner charges for parts but not labor, Pertsev confesses, "After we use up our 
budget, we have to pay for parts out of our own pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 But -- how? Pertsev makes 150,000 rubles a month, about $150, although the 
steady decline of the ruble makes it worth less every week. In addition, 
because he has 20 years service (including his stint in the military), he is 
eligible to collect 25% of his pension, which amounts to another 7,000 rubles 
($7) a month. "A kilo of sausage costs 10,000 rubles," Pertsev says bleakly, 
"if it's good sausage." 
</P>
<P>
 He brightens. "But let's talk about crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in his office, Pertsev removes a VCR from a locked cabinet. He plugs it 
into the TV and pops in a cassette. A bright, clear tape shows officers 
searching 25 "mafia people" who had been brought in for questioning. Each of 
the bad guys wears a black leather jacket over a bulletproof vest. Many carry 
wads of U.S. dollars. One has several small metal balls -- "new armaments," 
Pertsev calls them -- that, if thrown at the right velocity and target (the 
forehead), can kill. Painstakingly, the officers study each man's passport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this one," Pertsev says, tapping the TV, as the camera focuses on the 
passport of a young, dark-haired man. Pertsev laughs. "The photo is of 
Yeltsin!"  
</P>
<P>
 Even with Pertsev's force doing its best to nail mafia hoods and everyday 
crooks, his men can't always put them in jail. Buying or carrying firearms is 
strictly illegal and is punishable by up to five years in jail. But proving 
possession is not a simple matter. "You catch a man with a submachine gun, and 
he says he found it on the street," Vladimir Vershkov says. "There is nothing 
we can do."  
</P>
<P>
 Auto thefts, one of the major sources of crime in Moscow, are also difficult 
to prosecute. If a criminal is caught driving a stolen car, he can simply say 
he "borrowed" it. Unless the police can find evidence of his intent to 
dismantle and resell it, at worst he'll have to pay a fine. "Recently, we saw a 
man stealing a car," Pertsev recounts. "We chased him and finally shot him in 
the arm. He was fined 900 rubles" -- less than a dollar.  
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, however, the man was part of a ring. Another man will change the 
numbers on the engine, another will provide false documents, a fourth will 
actually resell it. To get a conviction for theft, the police must implicate 
all of them. "Three years ago, the criminals started coming in from the 
southern republics or Caucasus," Pertsev says, echoing a typical Moscow 
explanation for the crime wave. "We have a Chechen mafia, a Georgian mafia, an 
Azerbaijan mafia. We call these people our black brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, these problems may be somewhat overblown. "The police probably forgot 
to tell you that it's not really the laws that are holding them back," says 
Sergei Litvinov, a former Siberian police detective who now works as an 
investigator in San Francisco. "Five or 10 years ago, when Russia had a 
conviction rate of 99%, they didn't need to collect evidence. Now, with the 
slight democratization that's going on, they must fingerprint and nail their 
case down. They're still not used to this. Like everything in Russia, the 
police are inefficient." 
</P>
<P>
 As the police try to cope with the underworld, their superiors are knotted in 
hierarchical problems. Since early 1991, Moscow's police have been pawns in a 
political game. Police chiefs and district lines were reshuffled at least five 
times, with the latest municipal government reorganization only producing more 
headaches. Formerly, each of Moscow's 182 police stations reported to one of 
the 33 municipal districts, which reported directly to headquarters. Now the 33 
districts have been reshaped into 10 sectors called okrugs , which has 
flummoxed just about everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing seems to mesh," says Vladimir Zolotnitzki, a lieutenant clutching an 
Ed McBain police novel, who works in public affairs at headquarters. "If a 
murder takes place, police will come from headquarters, from the okrug and the 
local police station. You have to call a prosecutor as well. But the 
prosecutors' districts are different from ours, and nobody knows which 
prosecutor to call." Arguments break out as some crimes attract police from two 
local stations -- or no one shows up at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the reorganization, Pertsev's station and four others reported to a 
district station; now 17 stations report to the local okrug . "When we have a 
meeting, 60 heads of departments come," Pertsev says. "The new system is like a 
monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding recruits to feed this monster isn't easy either. The department has 
numerous positions open that it cannot fill. The lure of becoming a police 
officer is fading fast. Not only can more money be made working security for 
private concerns, but the public's distrust of the police is hardly a major 
selling point. According to Pertsev, a policeman can equal a month's salary 
through bribes. "Even though I am shorthanded," he says, "I have fired five men 
for taking bribes and two for being drunk."  
</P>
<P>
 Later, Pertsev takes a tour of his district, a mix of quiet residential 
streets and bustling boulevards dotted with the usual stranded motorists 
staring vacantly under raised hoods at stalled engines. He stops at a local 
market, where individual sellers of produce and goods have set up stalls. 
Pertsev greets many vendors and the market manager by name, checking to make 
sure everything is OK. This is mafia territory, he points out, ripe for people 
with protection schemes.  
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks later, Pertsev pulls up in front of a kiosk. A sort of 
Russian-style 7-Eleven, kiosks have blossomed along boulevards under the new 
free-market economy. They are open all hours, sell everything from cigarettes 
to shoes and, like their American counterparts, are routinely held up. The week 
before, an armed robber busted into this one. One of the two owners wrestled 
the gun from the intruder and held him until the police came. The owner points 
to several bullet holes that bored into the ceiling during the struggle for the 
gun. "See?" he says with a grin. "We have a little bit of Los Angeles right in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 PETROVKA 38 -- POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- IS A YELLOW SIX-STORY BUILDING set 
behind a wrought-iron gate. It, too, is in need of repair. Long stretches of 
hallway are unaccountably dark, the elevator may or may not work. On a table in 
the bare lobby is a picture of a slain cop, killed several nights before by 
anti-Yeltsin demonstrators. A vase with several flowers stands beside the 
photograph.  
</P>
<P>
 Petrovka 38 contains administrative offices, forensics labs and some citywide 
units. In Room 335, heavyset Lt. Col. Anatoly Ilchenko, wearing a dark suit, 
dark shirt and dark tie, looks to be just what he is: deputy head of the 
organized crime department. "Moscow is like America in the '30s," he says. "I 
think."  
</P>
<P>
 Until 1989, Moscow police didn't have an organized-crime unit. But by last 
February, the unit had expanded into a full-fledged department, staffed by 20 
to 25 officers at each okrug and 500 more at headquarters. "One of the biggest 
problems," Ilchenko says, repeating what seems to be the party line, "is we 
have no legislation for organized crime. We need something like your RICO laws, 
which deal with the formation of criminal enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ilchenko dismisses newspaper reports of organized crime as grossly 
exaggerated, he concedes that, "While only 1% of all crime is mafia-related, 
most organized crime is not obvious. When people pay racketeers, they don't 
tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, almost everyone one encounters in Moscow has a mafia-type story. 
Especially kiosk owners. Rather than be robbed repeatedly, many pay protection 
money. Individuals who set up money-changing operations are also strong-armed. 
So are Moscow's 60 casinos. "We hire members of the OMON (Moscow's equivalent 
of SWAT) to man the front door," says Charles Pancoast, an American who is 
chief financial officer for the exclusive Casino Royale, an elegantly decorated 
club housed in the former residence of Czar Nicholas I. "Anyone who tries to 
mess with us will have to deal with them first." 
</P>
<P>
 More common is the story of Michael Boulygin, who has built a flourishing 
translation business for foreigners in need of English interpreters. A fellow 
he went to school with approached him: "You need protection," he told Boulygin. 
For 30,000 rubles a month ($30), this friend's "friends" would take care of any 
problems Boulygin might have. Says Boulygin's wife, Svetlana: "People don't 
trust the police. What these protection people are doing is taking over some 
functions the police can't handle. We don't mind paying." According to the 
police, even banks hire racketeers -- to find the criminals who steal their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, there was a national bank, which did business with the smaller 
state banks, and authorities knew exactly what to do if something went awry, 
which, of course, it never did. Russia now has 2,000 commercial banks, and 
their relations with state banks are not regulated. According to Vladimir 
Objedkov, head of the department of economic crime, "We don't know who's 
responsible for commercial banks. People are taking advantage of this 
confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 He is sitting on a dais, flanked by seven other police officials at the weekly 
press briefing at Petrovka 38. A dozen local print reporters are seated in the 
small auditorium, taking copious notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Objedkov delivers an anecdotal rundown of the recent crimes in his department. 
"Credit robbery is something new," he says. "A young entrepreneur will set up a 
company using false documents. He'll get credit from banks, then disappear, 
changing the money into hard currency and transferring it abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Objedkov goes on, the banker is in cahoots with the entrepreneur, 
accepting false documents knowingly for a piece of the profits. "But then," he 
says with a quick smile, "the Russians have always been very inventive." 
</P>
<P>
 And daring. A company called Finstrakh ran TV commercials with this message: 
"Invest your money with us. If you invest dollars, you'll see a 300% return in 
a year. If rubles, a 100% return." 
</P>
<P>
 People showed up at Finstrakh's offices in droves. That a small police unit of 
three officers was operating in the same building only made them feel safer. 
The Finstrakh people were clever: When one man arrived with 1.5 million rubles 
to invest, they turned him away. The thinking? Anyone with that much money 
would undoubtedly hire a racketeer to come after them when they absconded with 
the money. Which, of course, they did. 
</P>
<P>
 FROM THE BRIGHTLY LIT rooms of Petrovka 38's command center, a big room of 
telephone switchboards, the cops monitor the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "With our computer network, we can alert any police station or patrol car, 
individually or all at once," says Col. Alexander Denisov, the on-duty unit 
chief. "Within three or four minutes, a car can reach where the crime is 
committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we have 120 cars out from this, our central unit. All together, we 
can have 250 to 300 cars out." 
</P>
<P>
 It is noon, and, according to Denisov, 7,000 cops are on duty, including 
patrols, traffic police and detectives. An enormous relief map of Moscow covers 
the far wall. Small light bulbs indicate the positions of cars on duty. In the 
next room, two men sit behind a switchboard, receiving and relaying critical 
information. "We have direct communications with all okrugs and police cars," 
says Lt. Col. Victor Pospelov. "Also, we can contact the power supply service, 
the fire department and ambulances." 
</P>
<P>
 How many crimes today? 
</P>
<P>
 "Since midnight, one murder, one assault, one robbery and 45 car thefts, not 
counting fires or car accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's emergency response system is upstairs. Ten phone lines are hooked 
to 02, the Moscow equivalent of 911, staffed by 10 policewomen. "Men can't 
stand working here," Denisov volunteers. "But women are very good at it." Three 
of the women look up and smile agreeably. The typical cop seems either to come 
to his profession from the military or after studying at institutions like the 
Academy of Internal Affairs or the Militia Academy. Women are trained in 
non-physical work at the police academy, then carefully slotted into jobs that 
keep them behind desks. They operate the new computers that run fingerprints, 
while men are assigned to the crime scene to collect the fingerprints. When 
asked about this, Victor Petchnikov, the tall, curly-haired head of criminal 
police at one okrug , says with a patient smile, "The criminal police have no 
regular hours. Women need to be home to take care of their husbands and 
children. They prefer it." 
</P>
<P>
 So it is women who handle the 20,000 to 24,000 calls that are made to 02 each 
24 hours. Some calls are from people asking for information, but even so, 
Denisov boasts, all calls are handled efficiently and promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then how come people complain they can never get through?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Denisov smiles benignly. "Obviously, they have dialed the wrong number," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS 9 P.M. ON A CHILLY Moscow night as three patrol officers begin the final 
hours of their shift. In Moscow, cops go out in threes. All ride in the car 
with submachine guns in their laps. A call comes over the radio reporting that 
a man with a submachine gun and several automatic weapons is terrorizing 
someone in an apartment building. "Practically every day, criminals use 
automatic weapons," says Capt. Vladimir Kulkov, fingering his own. 
</P>
<P>
 These officers are part of a new unit that strictly does patrol duty. 
Surprisingly, their 2-year-old Moskvitch seems to function, and their working 
conditions seem superior to what I have so far seen. They work 12-hour shifts 
for two days, then have two days off. Their new station, now under 
construction, will contain a locker room, sauna, shower, gym, shooting range 
and garage.  
</P>
<P>
 They even have their own shrink. "We have a woman psychologist at our 
station," Jr. Lt. Nikolai Shliaptsev says. "Sometimes you feel tired, or 
something goes wrong. She knows when someone needs her. She makes you feel 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, patrol cars were assigned to each police station. "Now they 
have very few and are used mostly to respond to family disputes or burglaries," 
Shliaptsev says. "We assist them on the calls, but basically, we are out 
patrolling the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Their territory, just north of the city center, includes woodsy residential 
streets, from which cars are routinely stolen, as well as the Central 
Exhibition Center and a major metro stop ringed by numerous kiosks. Most are 
open until 11 p.m., some all night. "Before, nothing was open at this hour," 
Shliaptsev says. "The other night, we noticed two suspicious-looking men from 
the Caucasus. One started running. He had a submachine gun under his overcoat. 
We hauled them in." 
</P>
<P>
 But tonight is eerily quiet. "We arrested one hooligan for using four-letter 
words at a bus stop," Kulkov offers.  
</P>
<P>
 Great. All this crime in Moscow, and all they produce is one guy with a foul 
mouth? In truth, at that very moment, a crime was at least being discussed , I 
later learned. Five Brooklyn cops, in Moscow on an exchange program, were in a 
bar talking of a crime scene they had just witnessed. "There was a dead woman 
lying on the street," one officer noted. "Right out in front of a crowd, the 
cops lifted her skirt and shoved a rectal thermometer up her. You know, to 
gauge how long she'd been dead. We were shocked. Man, these Moscow cops can be 
cold."  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the three-man patrol stops at the side of a deserted road. Three 
doors pop open and each man lights a cigarette. No coffee? No doughnuts? 
</P>
<P>
 Shliaptsev laughs. "I don't know what you mean, doughnut . But for coffee, 
there's no place to stop. This isn't like America. A restaurant takes two 
hours."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite poor pay and growing crime, these officers seem content. "It's a job 
for a real man," Shliaptsev says. "If it's not us, then who will take the job?"

<P>
 I began to realize I was in trouble when my son, Farrell, rattled off the 
roster of the Seattle Mariners. He was 5 years old at the time and though he 
spoke with great conviction and authority, he was making up the names as he 
went along. Omar Francisco played shortstop. Danny Jessie Anderson was the 
clean-cut third baseman. The pitcher was none other than Tommy Murphy, a 
southpaw I suspect. And then there were those two baseball greats with similar 
names. Ken Groofy and Ken Groofyjunior. It took me a while to sort that one 
out. "That's Ken Griffey, Farrell. And his son's name is Ken Griffey Jr." I 
thought I had the right timbre in my voice, the tone that signals a certain 
inside knowledge. "No, Dad," Farrell politely corrected. "It's Ken Groofy and 
Ken Groofyjunior. They are ball whackers." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell is happy to permit me access to his active sports imagination, a world 
in which, during one phase, sumo wrestlers donned baseball togs for incredible 
power plays. And did you know that Michael Jordan, Ken Griffey Jr. and Shawn 
Kemp are all related? Not only that, they grew up together and they are all 
such splendid jumpers because they had a trampoline in the back yard when they 
were young. It was news to me. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Farrell's sports-mindedness comes so blindingly fast, the names 
sounding so incredibly authentic, that I have no idea any longer if what he's 
telling me is sports gospel or an act of vivid imagination. "The real tall guy 
on the 76ers? He's the one they call on to get the ball down when it gets stuck 
between the hoop and the backboard," Farrell says. I tend to nod my head at 
such things and grunt noncommittally, "no kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 Divorce has divided Farrell's world into two homes. During that half of the 
week he stays with me, I struggle to maintain the appearance of an abiding 
interest in sports. I have started reading the sports page, of all things, all 
that purple prose and hyperbole about the most astonishingly meaningless 
issues. Farrell is generous enough to share with me his monthly copy of the 
kids' version of Sports Illustrated. My vocabulary slowly expands. Phrases such 
as "clean-up batter" and "fielder's choice" trip off my tongue as though I 
might even know what they mean. 
</P>
<P>
 The day he asked me to name my favorite basketball team reminded me of how his 
mother must have felt when he asked her if Santa Claus was for real. I thought 
I might lie and be done with it -- say something such as the Seattle 
SuperSonics or the Phoenix Suns and skate on by. Instead, I told him the truth. 
"I really don't have a favorite team, Farrell. I've never really thought about 
it, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 His look wasn't exactly pitying. He simply stared at me in brown-eyed wonder 
as though seeing me for the first time. Then, dismissing the preceding 
absurdity, he asked me who my favorite basketball player was. I answered Dana 
Barros, of the Philadelphia 76ers, which had a ring of truth to it. I said I 
admired a guy shorter than I am who can jump higher than I am tall and who can 
hit three-point shots better than anyone else in the sport. "It just shows you 
what a lot of work can do, Farrell. Ol' Dana runs circles around guys much 
taller than he is. He doesn't know a thing about limitations. I bet he must 
practice all the time." I had been reading up, but I didn't let on. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell is now 8 years old, still young enough to think that his interests are 
universal. He is fascinated by sports, baseball and basketball most 
particularly. Therefore, I too must live and breathe in a world the center of 
which is occupied by athletes. My true nature, I fear, is just the opposite. I 
am neither a font of detailed sports information, nor a fusion reactor of 
sports enthusiasm. I just don't have the gene. Box scores could just as easily 
be boxcars for all I know. I'm not even sure what my lanky body feels like at a 
full run. I suppose I could turn that side of Farrell over to coaches and 
teachers. But I know that if I cut myself off from sports in my son's life, I 
cut myself off from him. I'd rather stop breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Participatory sports were never part of my father's life. He didn't have an 
old mitt kicking around. On crisp fall days he never picked up a football to 
toss in the yard. Unlike me, however, my father has always been something of a 
fan, which helps when I find myself fielding Farrell's jackhammer questions 
about teams and players. 
</P>
<P>
 I would go to University of Washington football games with my father and my 
maternal grandfather, Neal, when extra seats were available and a wiggly kid 
was welcome. My father was a faculty member and had season tickets. We would 
park on campus and hike over to the stadium, the crowd filling in around us, 
swallowing us in its sports fans' embrace. My family moved from Seattle to Los 
Angeles about the time I started high school. When Neal visited I would go to 
Dodger games with him. Neal knew a bad call when he saw one and never hesitated 
to rise to his feet with vocal indignation. This meant a string of astonishing 
expletives tightly structured around racial epithets, venereal disease and 
dubious parentage. Inevitably, he would stand there shoulder to shoulder with 
some other equally outraged fan who was yelling in Spanish. Then it would all 
die down and the two men, so vocally bonded, would laugh at each other, sit, 
and return to their own worlds. I would look on pleased to have witnessed the 
ritual, yet feeling somewhat forlorn for having been denied the deeper, inner, 
secret fan meaning of the passionate moment. I could see the boundary rising 
between my world and theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the great moments of Ingle family folklore is the time I pointed out to 
my father that he never threw a ball back and forth with me. I don't remember 
the actual event, though I suspect it happened during a flash-fire of 
adolescent rage. While it has become something of a family joke over the years, 
I have never felt inclined to chuckle right along. My father answered that he 
never threw a ball with me because if he had happened to catch the damn thing 
wrong and break a finger he'd be out of business as a dentist and then where'd 
we be? But he missed my point. 
</P>
<P>
 I played Little League baseball one season. I remember the reassurance of my 
father taking me to the big meeting, the one where we were all divided into 
teams and given hats and T-shirts and schedules. And then that was the end of 
it. He was too busy to participate any further, which is the truth. Our coach, 
a building contractor, was also too busy to show up for practice. A 
well-meaning high school kid filled in for him. The games were terrible. No one 
had any idea what to do. We lost every time. It was humiliating. And no one was 
there to help make sense of it all. I never went back. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that as a child I was never exposed to playing sports. Our 
neighborhood bordered a golf course and in the summer twilight that in Seattle 
lasts well after 9 o'clock, children from one end of the block to the other 
would converge and we would play baseball and touch football on the fairway, 
running pass patterns between groups of passing golfers. We'd shoot baskets 
together, the kids on the block, long games of H-O-R-S-E and around the world. 
But the neighborhood experience never extended into organized, school-based 
sports for me. It just never clicked. 
</P>
<P>
 The sports path I did choose was a curious one, and since there was no family 
connection to it, other than my own interest, I can't begin to explain how it 
occurred. The first magazine I ever subscribed to was Sports Afield. I was 
probably 9 years old and I engineered the subscription all on my own. If I had 
a sports hero as a kid, he was Jack O'Connor, mightiest of the American big 
game hunters. I saved up my allowance until I could secretly send away for a 
Sears Roebuck BB gun, and I caught hell from my mother when it arrived. Had my 
father not started to write a dental textbook (he continues to revise and 
upgrade it to this very day) and bought a piece of forest land and built a 
cabin for his reclusive scribblings, I probably would never have been allowed 
to own a .22 rifle or a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 We would spend long stretches of summer holidays out there, my father and I, 
he sitting in a chair on the deck writing in pencil on yellow legal pads, and 
me wandering the woods and shooting up trees, or exploring the creeks and 
coaxing trout to take first my worms, then my tied flies. It was as close as I 
could come as a kid to creating an outdoorsman's life, and I did it alone, for 
the most part. There were several occasions when we rose before dawn and drove 
over to the country dump with the 12-gauge to shoot at rats scuttling through 
cans and junked refrigerators. He remembers this as well as I do, which makes 
me think he appreciated his immersion into my world, short-lived though it may 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
 I know now that I could no more have converted him to my passions, to my path, 
than Farrell can transform me into the quintessential sports dad. I have come 
to believe that it doesn't matter what we do so much as that we do it together. 
I suspect that if my father were to appear on my doorstep with a couple of 
tickets, I wouldn't hesitate to go to the game, no matter what the game might 
be, and I would love every moment. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Farrell and I'd just like to say I must have a thousand Giants 
baseball cards and what I can't figure out is where they are from because -- 
you know, on the back? -- it doesn't say where the team is from. If you know, 
give me a call." 
</P>
<P>
 That last bit -- "if you know" -- that's a new wrinkle. A signal. He's 
catching on. He's getting wise to his faux sports dad. I called him at his 
mom's house, took a long shot, and told him that the Giants were from San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 At this level of psychic exchange, I can do my homework and keep pace, 
balancing nimbly between condescending phoniness and my sincere desire to 
please my son. But the second side of the dilemma, the physical side, remains 
thorny. Our task with each other is to find points of entry into each other's 
world. And I think Farrell senses this. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell gave me an oversized gray T-shirt for Christmas. On the back, in 
yellow and purple textile ink, he had drawn "U of" and on the front, a big "H" 
with a small "w" over the breast pocket, meaning University of Washington 
Huskies. Into the breast pocket he had stuffed a carefully folded dollar bill, 
largess from his paper route. For my part, I gave Farrell a Fiberglas bow with 
a 20-pound pull, a dozen target arrows, target, finger and wrist pads, and a 
quiver. In years to come, I'll consider giving him a .22. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting is a possibility. But he may find the whole thing revolting. Or 
boring. And then hunting isn't exactly something you do from fall to spring. It 
takes up a bunch of weekends, and then it's over for another year, to be 
replaced by fishing. Or skiing. I grew up skiing and probably skied as much as 
I did because my father enjoyed the outings. We did it together. But only for a 
time, only until my taste for speed left him far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 I see Farrell picking up speed every day. He lives in a world where he knows 
no limitations. Until he discovers otherwise, there's no reason he shouldn't 
believe in a possible career in professional basketball. Or maybe even that 
other sport he has explained to me in studied detail, the one played on ice 
that combines the best of hockey and basketball. I forget what it's called. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell's real sports career started with T-ball, back in the days when he 
referred to the process of connecting bat with ball as "ball whacking." He has 
since progressed to considerations of the power swing, owns his own metal bat 
and has very definite ideas about what is and is not a proper batting glove. 
And the hell of it is, the kid has a great, natural swing, the power rising up 
his spine out of his hips, through his shoulders, down his arms and right into 
his quickly snapping wrists. Those times I can actually throw a pitch across 
the plate, he nails the sucker, and off I lope to retrieve the ball. In his 
first season of Little League, his coach told him he had an arm most kids would 
die for. Which is true. Both powerful and, at times, startlingly accurate. He 
must get it from his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 I have watched Farrell's body change over the past few years, and with those 
changes have come natural increases in his ability to throw from third to first 
base, or to loop a basketball over the rim and into the net. I have watched 
sports dads live their sports lives over again through their sons. I don't have 
this problem. My thrills are more vicarious, simply watching my child learn to 
accomplish something that demands both concentration and physical coordination. 
Which is to say, I have been watching Farrell grow up and choose his own path. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching him grow also means letting go, and as I do, I can't help but wonder 
what will become of me when he realizes that I don't miss the greater majority 
of baskets out of politeness, that when he beats me at H-O-R-S-E, it isn't 
because I am throwing the game in his behalf. With luck, Farrell will admire me 
for doing the best I can. But the day will come when shooting hoops with a 
challenging group of like-minded kids will leave me in the lurch. I plan to be 
there leaning against the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 A cycle of emotional distancing exists among the generations of men in my 
family. It was true of my father and his father, becoming a model for how he 
would be a father to me. Who knows how many generations back it stretches, and 
even why? But part of becoming a father, I discovered over time, meant letting 
go of being a son. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I work at home and had the opportunity to raise my son through his first 
few years of life before he started punching that preschool time clock, I 
didn't feel inclined or persuaded to fall back on the model of fatherhood 
bestowed upon me. I have come to hope in these past eight years of Farrell's 
life that I can banish emotional distancing and reserve, to break the cycle, 
and let the boundaries of my life and my son's life wash over one another like 
great standing waves passing through a stadium audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was Farrell's age I connected with one pitch in practice. I remember 
smacking the ball out over the shortstop and making it to third base. I 
remember what that hit sounded like and felt like, both in my hands and in my 
heart. I remember that my father was not there. 
</P>
<P>
 Had I failed to join Farrell on the playing field, I don't think I would know 
how he has the strength within his young heart to keep working and working and 
working, whether that means trying to catch the pop-ups I have learned to throw 
without doing damage to my lower back, or hit the hoop from the foul line, 
grunting with every effort and launch of the basketball. He simply doesn't stop 
until he's about to drop. And usually by that time I have long since thrown in 
my towel. 
</P>
<P>
 We first made serious visits to the playfield when Farrell started T-ball. His 
mitt was small and the ball was soft. I was 43 the first year he played in 
Little League. The coach said he need a new glove, something bigger, more 
substantial. And I discovered that I needed a new glove, too. With hardball 
descended upon us, there could be no more bare-handed catching for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell picked out a Ken Griffey Jr. autographed model Little League-size mitt 
in black leather. I limited my choice to a Jose Canseco fielder's mitt and a 
Wade Boggs autographed model. Some dads no doubt check out the leather and the 
stitching and the size of the pocket or the length of the mitt. I settled on 
the Boggs because Boggs seems to be able to freely mix his sex life with his 
sense of humor while Canseco comes off as an overpaid blowhard. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell and I went straight from the sporting goods store to the park with our 
new mitts and a baseball. By late that afternoon, I discovered that both my 
right shoulder and my right elbow needed oiling. I also discovered that young 
boys break into tears when they miss a catch and get bonked in the face with a 
hardball. We sat on the grass together, Farrell in my lap, his arms around my 
neck, sobbing away the pain that was mostly frustration. I told him that it was 
probably as much my lousy throw at fault as it was his failure to hold his 
glove out with the fingers upright. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggested that if we kept working at it, we'd no doubt both get the hang of 
it.

JAZZ; SONGS IN THE KEY OF PHINEAS; FIVE DISCIPLES OF THE LATE, TROUBLED PIANO 
GENIUS GATHER FOR A CELEBRATORY SUMMIT RECORDING AND TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the last 20 years of his life, Phineas Newborn Jr. dropped in on the jazz 
world from time to time, but the image that prevails is of a man gone mad, one 
who sought refuge at the piano -- or at the bar -- from the voices in his head. 
It's not the image that contemporary players like James Williams want to see 
sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was such a complete player -- he understood the whole range of tempos," 
says Williams, a Memphis-born Newborn disciple. "What Count Basie was so good 
at -- and not coincidentally, Phineas was found by Basie -- was his ability to 
find the right tempo and all those nuances. (Phineas) creates different moods 
and atmospheres with a lot of charisma and charm without playing only the two 
tempos most piano players know -- slow and fast." 
</P>
<P>
 In many pianists' circles, Newborn is the grand master -- the one whose 
spectacular technical abilities were matched by his feeling for textures and 
colors, compositions and improvisations. Born in Memphis in 1931, his father 
was a drummer and bandleader; his brother, guitarist Calvin Newborn. In high 
school, Phineas Jr. played seven woodwinds and horns. One of the few major 
publications to take note of his talent, Esquire, ranked his 1956 performances 
up with the debuts of Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke in the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his 30th birthday, Newborn had toured the country, played Carnegie 
Hall, dueted regularly and scored a film with Charles Mingus and released nine 
albums. His pianist fans included Basie, Oscar Peterson and Teddy Wilson. 
Although jazz critics weren't putting him in the league of Art Tatum and Bud 
Powell, his fellow musicians were. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word genius -- I try not to use that -- but he was in every sense of the 
word, two times over," says pianist Harold Mabern, a fellow Memphian who knew 
Newborn as a teen-ager and remained a friend until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ideas were flawless. He overwhelmed me. His right hand would be going one 
way and the left hand the other. Everything was so orchestrated as if he was 
accompanying himself. . . . He had all the elements -- the skill of Bud Powell 
. . . the chording of Count Basie, the orchestral sweep of Erroll Garner and 
the classical sense of Ravel and Chopin. Even in his later years and even on 
his off nights." 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearly five years since Newborn's death in relative obscurity, his 
legacy is growing. Williams and Mabern will be spreading the Newborn gospel 
with one of the more novel jazz projects to arrive in years: five accomplished 
pianists -- four with connections to Memphis, all with ties to drummer Art 
Blakey and an affinity for Newborn -- gathering for a summit recording and 
monthlong tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Key Players" by the Contemporary Piano Ensemble, due in stores Tuesday on 
Columbia Records, features Williams, Mabern, Geoff Keezer, Mulgrew Miller and 
Donald Brown in quartet and solo settings backed by bassist Christian McBride 
and drummer Tony Reedus. The album features original compositions and standards 
that bring out the orchestral style that Newborn brought to modern jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The root for the session was a "Four Pianos for Phineas" tribute concert two 
years ago at the Montreal Jazz Festival that was followed by an album featuring 
each of the four key players in standard trio settings doing Newborn-related 
songs. Williams refers to "The Key Players" disc as a "nod" to Newborn, using 
his orchestral style as an impetus for the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea," says project coordinator Jonathan Poses, "is to bring Phineas' 
work to the fore not by doing his repertoire but by saying, 'These are his 
children.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In organizing the "Key Players" session, which was recorded last August, 
Williams asked each of the pianists to bring in material rather than rely on 
Newborn's compositions and interpretations. Despite it being Williams' baby, "I 
didn't want the record to have just one direction. I wanted to utilize 
everybody's skills as composers. That there be a mixture of moods and tempos 
was the only thing I asked for, along with thinking out a plan together to 
focus on improvisation." 
</P>
<P>
 The disc has a spry and jubilant tone throughout. The soloing is consistently 
full of contrasts: The players make short and sweet reflective statements, flow 
serenely along the keyboard in grand exhortations, and in one improvisational 
explosion, the quartet boils over into a coherent confluence. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 songs on the disc, Williams considers Ray Brown's "Up There" the 
"most Phineas" of the pieces. "There's an ensemble on the intro that we 
transcribed from the original record. We play it in octaves in unison. Just 
putting it together, I was amazed at how Phineas played this off the top of his 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' piano did a similar discourse on a recent night at the Bel Age 
Hotel, speaking the musical language of contemporary Southern churches, 1950s 
roadhouses, 1940s Manhattan be-bop and romantic swing that, if anything, 
suggested a walk on a rainy Parisian thoroughfare. Like his idol Newborn, 
Williams taps a deep well of sources at the base of which rests the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, New York Times critic Peter Watrous praised a Williams performance: 
"Everything he played was part of a blueprint, in which many of the distinct 
aspects of American musical culture were rounded up and put to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such critical acclaim, Williams, 42, has referred to himself as a 
member of the Lost Generation of jazz: too young to be connected to the birth 
of be-bop or swing; too old for the post-Marsalis Young Turk status that record 
companies adore. He has released only one album on a major jazz label as a 
leader. He taught at the Berklee School of Music; he introduced Wynton Marsalis 
to Art Blakey. (The esteemed band leader was the first artist to hire the 
trumpeter.) Too often he puts himself last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working with Milt Jackson," Williams says, recalling the 1979 job offer 
that would change his professional life, "and I got recommended to join 
(Blakey's) Jazz Messengers. I didn't have the confidence in my playing to say 
'yes,' but Milt encouraged me to do it. It was the best decision I've made 
musically because everything has come to me because of that association. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attitude, though, is typical of my generation -- to make the statement 
that I'm not ready yet. There was a real attitude shift in the '80s where 
everybody decided they were ready for anything. People don't say they're not 
ready for an engagement anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, whose production company, Fine As Production, is yet another tip of 
the hat to Newborn, has produced four albums for fellow key player Keezer. He 
said he intends to increase his visibility in the next two years through 
recordings with musicians such as Clark Terry and Lenny White, as well as his 
own sextet, the Intensive Care Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, however, is the Contemporary Piano Ensemble's 22-concert tour that 
starts in Binghamton, N.Y., on Feb. 2 and runs through March 5. Williams and 
Poses chose to bypass standard jazz venues and head for schools, museums and 
out-of-the-way towns such as Erie, Pa.; Fayetteville, Ark., and Beloit, Wis., 
with the intention of presenting master classes, lectures and demonstrations in 
addition to the concerts. The shows are a combination of solos, duos and the 
quartet, and the repertoire includes the songs from the disc, standards and a 
number of Newborn pieces. (There are no Southland shows on the schedule yet.) 
</P>
<P>
 Talks are under way to present the group at European and U.S. festivals, 
specifically, the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl and the Monterey 
Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the musicians spoke much of Newborn's later years other than to say 
his talent never left him. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, Newborn had the first of what were to be several nervous breakdowns 
and was hospitalized briefly in New York. He moved to Los Angeles soon after 
his release and recorded with virtually all the premier West Coast artists. But 
his health declined again and he spent 1967-69 in and out of the Brentwood 
Veterans Administration hospital before returning to Memphis in 1970. His 
health didn't improve in Memphis and he had lengthy stays in the hospital in 
1972 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day he was released from a hospital to a halfway house in 1975, he was 
beaten in an altercation that still remains mysterious and suffered severe 
injuries to his face, hands and arms. But soon after surgery, he recorded one 
of the fastest songs in his repertoire, "Out of This World," for his "Solo 
Piano" record. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late '70s, Newborn was recording and doing concerts again, returning to 
New York and Montreux where he received raves for his performances. 
Performances became sporadic the last nine years of his life until his death 
from cancer on May 26, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams never emphasizes notoriety, perhaps a lesson learned from Newborn's 
adverse reaction to the accolades that preceded him early in his career. 
Instead, Williams is grateful for opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a producer, I'm doing some esoteric projects -- and I'm still composing 
and working in other musicians' groups," he says. "I'm very fortunate that I'm 
able to make a living. And also, I'm able to say I've been associated with a 
few geniuses like Phineas and Dizzy Gillespie. How many people get to say they 
even knew one innovator in their lifetime?"

POP MUSIC; MORE THAN JUST A GROUP EFFORT?; WITH LENNON IN AND MCCARTNEY 
ELIGIBLE IN '96, OTHERS MAY MERIT ENTRY INTO ROCK'S HALL OF FAME AS BAND 
MEMBERS AND SOLOISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By electing John Lennon into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame even though he had 
already been inducted as a member of the Beatles, the organization's voters 
acted wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Lennon's post-Beatles work, from the raw urgency of 1970's "Plastic 
Ono Band" album to the graceful idealism of his 1971 "Imagine" single, ranks 
among the most distinguished ever in rock. 
</P>
<P>
 For that work alone, he deserves to be inducted during the hall's dinner 
ceremony on Wednesday in New York, where he will be admitted along with the 
Animals, the Band, Duane Eddy, the Grateful Dead, Elton John, Bob Marley and 
Rod Stewart. (Willie Dixon and Johnny Otis will also be inducted in special 
categories.) 
</P>
<P>
 The question raised by Lennon's double membership in the Hall of Fame is which 
other artists deserve to be saluted both as members of a group and as solo 
artists? 
</P>
<P>
 What about the other Beatles, especially Paul McCartney? 
</P>
<P>
 Or Eric Clapton and John Fogerty, who were inducted last year as members of 
Cream and Creedence Clearwater Revival, respectively? 
</P>
<P>
 Or Peter Gabriel, Don Henley and Sting, who will become eligible soon as 
members of their old bands and a few years later as solo artists? 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, voters should consider the artist's group and solo work 
separately, but it is often hard to draw a strict line, as an examination of 
the Hall of Fame merits of these and other double-membership candidates 
suggests: 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul McCartney -- Artists aren't eligible for Hall of Fame consideration 
until 25 years after the release of their first record, which is why McCartney 
wasn't eligible to join Lennon in this year's induction class -- Lennon's first 
solo album was released in 1968, two years before McCartney's. 
</P>
<P>
 So, should we expect to see McCartney inducted at 1996's Hall of Fame 
ceremony? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is obvious once you get past two factors that have caused 
McCartney's work to be underrated: His solo work doesn't measure up to Lennon's 
post-Beatles music in terms of social urgency or personal revelation, and he 
has been guilty of releasing too much mediocre product. 
</P>
<P>
 For every album of quality, such as 1973's "Band on the Run" or 1989's 
"Flowers in the Dirt," you find two or three albums so marginal that you can't 
imagine anyone with an ounce of artistic self-respect putting them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet McCartney -- like Lennon -- brought a winning blend of intimacy and craft 
to rock 'n' roll that gave him an influence and presence that transcended the 
Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 His '60s work with John, George and Ringo may have been more influential and 
inventive than anything that followed, but there was a consistency of vision 
that continued into the '70s and '80s in the key albums and hit singles like 
"Live and Let Die" and "Maybe I'm Amazed." 
</P>
<P>
 As such, his contribution to rock 'n' roll is too broad and enduring to be 
summarized simply by saying he was a member of the Beatles. By contrast, George 
Harrison and Ringo Starr do not assert a presence that stretches meaningfully 
beyond the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eric Clapton -- Without downgrading the importance of the Yardbirds and 
Cream, both of which made an immense contribution to rock in the mid-'60s by 
demonstrating the liberating qualities of sheer instrumental power, Clapton has 
had an even more distinguished career since he left those groups, both of which 
have been voted into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 While his subsequent career -- as leader of Derek & the Dominoes and as a solo 
artist -- has been decidedly uneven, the singer-guitarist has been for almost 
30 years a standard of integrity and grace. He too deserves to be voted in as a 
solo artist when he becomes eligible next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Fogerty and Pete Townshend -- As with McCartney and Clapton, there is 
more to the sum of Townshend's and Fogerty's musical contributions than can be 
comfortably or accurately summarized simply by declaring that they were members 
of the Who and Creedence Clearwater Revival, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 As songwriters, both artists injected rock 'n' roll with music that was 
original and purposeful, music that has served as inspiration for hundreds of 
bands, from punk to hard rock. In addition, their solo work -- from Townshend's 
late-'70s "Rough Mix" to Fogerty's mid-'80s "Centerfield" -- demonstrated that 
they could work at a high level outside the framework of their old bands. 
Townshend becomes eligible in 1997, Fogerty in '98. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don Henley -- The Eagles are a cinch to be voted into the Hall of Fame when 
the group becomes eligible, based on the durability of songs, including "Hotel 
California," that frequently defined the sociological currents of an era. 
Despite those high standards, Henley has done even more distinguished work on 
his own in songs like "The Boys of Summer" and "The End of the Innocence." 
He'll become eligible to be inducted with the Eagles in 1997 and on his own in, 
gulp, 2006. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peter Gabriel and Sting -- Though they'll be eligible as members of Genesis 
and the Police, respectively, neither group's body of work is substantial 
enough to guarantee them a place in the Hall of Fame. But both performers, who 
honed their artistic visions as solo artists, are odds-on favorites to be 
inducted when they become eligible in 2002 and 2010, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keith Richards and Mick Jagger -- As rock's larger-than-life renegades (and 
master songwriter-performers), Jagger and Richards are as irreplaceable a part 
of rock history as Lennon and McCartney. But their contributions to pop culture 
seem almost totally confined to their work together in the Rolling Stones. 
Jagger has made movies and both have made solo records, but none of it adds up 
to the magic of a single great Stones track. Eligibility years: 1995 for 
Jagger, 2013 for Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lou Reed -- Here's someone who may deserve double hall membership, but he 
may have to settle for induction as a solo artist, because the Velvet 
Underground -- his landmark band from the late '60s -- continues to be passed 
over by the judges. Reed, one of rock's greatest poets and most liberating 
figures, is eligible in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neil Young -- Here may be our second three-time inductee -- as a member of 
Buffalo Springfield, a member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and as a solo 
artist. Though short-lived, both groups brought a freshness of attitude and 
sound to rock that remains endearing. And Young's solo work -- from "Harvest" 
to "Harvest Moon" -- is among the most distinguished ever in rock. Eligibility: 
Springfield, now (already passed over); CSNY and solo, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what about 1993? 
</P>
<P>
 Which contemporary artists' chances of eventual Hall of Fame induction 
improved or decreased during the year? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some whose outlook brightened: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ice Cube -- The most gifted of all the West Coast rappers expanded his 
audience and his artistic range with "It Was a Good Day," a fantasy about a day 
in the 'hood when everything goes right. It was not only the year's most 
memorable single, but also a Top 20 pop hit. If this summer's planned pairing 
with producer Dr. Dre lives up to expectations, we could see another major jump 
in his Hall of Fame chances. As it is, his chances move up, from 30% last year 
to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Janet Jackson -- The hurdle here is that she's not really rock 'n' roll -- 
but neither were the Supremes, who joined the hall in 1988, and she's making 
records as seamless as the products of the great Motown machinery. From the 
lilt of "That's the Way Love Goes" to the romantic sheen of "Always," Jackson 
demonstrated in the "janet." album a sense of pop determination and craft that 
suggests she'll be around for the long haul. Up from 10% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Metallica -- You saw a measure of the fans' loyalty to this band late last 
year when its holiday gift box sold more than 350,000 copies -- despite an 
$89.99 price tag. The breakthrough to the mainstream with 1991's "Metallica" 
album didn't hurt credibility with the old fans, and it won the group an army 
of new ones. Up from 45% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nirvana -- There were so many expectations and tensions surrounding the band 
after "Nevermind," the group's landmark 1991 album, it's a minor miracle that 
the group delivered an album of even rawer power in last year's "In Utero." Who 
knows how long the band will be able to maintain the pace, but it already has 
changed the face of modern rock. Up from 10% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pearl Jam -- Though it's still behind Nirvana musically, the group also 
silenced a lot of skeptics with its second album -- and won a place on the 
cover of Time magazine as the symbol of rock's angry young '90s brigade. 
Reluctant or not, Eddie Vedder is a star. Up from 4% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Acts that are being judged for the first time in the Hall of Fame handicap: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alice in Chains -- Bad sign that they got upstaged at "Lollapalooza" by Rage 
Against the Machine. Hall of Fame chances: 1% 
</P>
<P>
 * Blind Melon -- Thanks to Nirvana and pals, there may be a new vitality in 
rock these days, but it doesn't mean every band is good -- or that every fan 
knows the difference. Big seller. Questionable talent. 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cranberries -- Nice sound. Nice start. But still lots to prove. 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Digable Planets -- Its mix of hip-hop and jazz is seductive and cerebral. 5% 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Dre -- The raps themselves may be offensive or dumb, but Dre's 
production work is a marvel to behold. Still, it's hard to give any newcomer 
more than a 10% chance of ever making it into the hall. 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Polly Jean Harvey -- In 1992's "Dry" and 1993's "Rid of Me," Harvey has 
given us some of the most blistering chronicles of sexual politics since 
Leonard Cohen's "Death of a Ladies' Man." 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hole -- Get your bets down early. The major-label debut isn't due for weeks, 
but the recent show at the Palace confirmed that leader Courtney Love isn't all 
talk. 3% 
</P>
<P>
 * Meat Loaf -- Interesting comeback. Less interesting music. 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Natalie Merchant -- For all that she achieved with 10,000 Maniacs, the guess 
here is that she, like Gabriel and Sting, is going on to even better things on 
her own. 15% 
</P>
<P>
 * Shaquille O'Neal -- His size won't help him here. 0.5% 
</P>
<P>
 * Liz Phair -- Witty, combative, melodic. No wonder the music hits on a 
variety of levels, all of which are difficult to shake. 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rage Against the Machine -- Great at "Lollapalooza." Great at the benefit in 
November at the Palladium. Great album. 6% 
</P>
<P>
 * Smashing Pumpkins -- Except for "In Utero," the Pumpkins delivered the most 
commanding album of the year, which is a lot to say in a year that gave us U2's 
"Zooropa," Harvey's "Rid of Me" and Phair's "Exile in Guyville." A brilliant 
blend of Hendrix-level guitar intensity and melodic beauty reminiscent of Brian 
Wilson. 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Snoop Doggy Dogg -- It's hard to tell where his talent picks up and Dr. 
Dre's leaves off. Another album should tell. 3% 
</P>
<P>
 * Stone Temple Pilots -- See Blind Melon. 1% 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the other contemporary artists whose chances have been rated at 75% 
or better in past handicaps -- and whose induction is also considered virtually 
certain, like 'em or not: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ninety percent or more: David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Michael Jackson, 
Madonna, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Talking 
Heads and U2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seventy-five percent or more: Aerosmith, Guns 'N Roses, Billy Joel, 
Pretenders, Public Enemy, Bonnie Raitt, R.E.M., Linda Ronstadt, Bob Seger, Van 
Halen.

SLOW-STARTING BRUINS LEAVE HUSKIES IN HAZE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: UCLA EXPECTED 
TO CLIMB IN RANKINGS AFTER 82-62 ROUT, BUT AWAITS TOUGHER ARIZONA THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To end a foggy weekend in the Pacific Northwest, UCLA put the muzzle on the 
Washington Huskies and returned home Saturday night to wait for the new wire 
service rankings to come out today. 
</P>
<P>
 And after dropping an 82-62 defeat on the Huskies at Edmundson Pavilion, the 
No. 5-ranked Bruins are looking at some fairly impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is 11-0, 4-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference, and probably on its way to at 
least a No. 3 ranking in the polls, because North Carolina and Duke lost last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Harrick tempered his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're No. 3, that's fine," Harrick said. "We play it off at the end of the 
year, so it really doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing's wrong with being No. 3, Charles O'Bannon said, if that's what the 
Bruins actually become. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor, but we still haven't accomplished anything in the conference," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but the Bruins get a chance for the real thing Thursday night 
against Arizona at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon did not hesitate when asked if UCLA was playing well enough 
to face Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a team in the country playing better than us right 
now," he said. "I mean, we haven't lost a game." 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't bound to happen against the Huskies. UCLA started soft, but 
scored 50 points in the second half to win in a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 George Zidek had his biggest game as a Bruin, with 21 points in 23 minutes. 
Zidek also had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon had 22 points for UCLA and Tyus Edney had 14 points and four 
assists against a 2-11 Washington team. 
</P>
<P>
 So how glad were the Bruins to see the Huskies? UCLA wanted to get here so 
badly, the team took an eight-hour, cross-state bus ride from Pullman and 
arrived Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been a much smoother trip if the Bruins' flight hadn't been 
canceled because of fog. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the ride itself, well, it had its moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was interesting," said Ed O'Bannon Sr., who made the trip with his wife, 
Madeline, to watch their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the younger O'Bannons probably were downright overjoyed with 
matching up against the Huskies, a team in transition that apparently isn't 
aware of it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 New Coach Bob Bender has been unsuccessfully trying to coax his team into 
playing a running game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't seem to matter much in the first half, which ended with UCLA ahead 
by 12 points, probably because the Bruins weren't doing much running either. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there's something else they weren't doing -- scoring. At one point in 
the first half, UCLA had 10 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lethargic," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Charles O'Bannon's driving layup 12 minutes into the game, the Bruins 
had only 10 points. The only good thing was that Washington had only nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon and Zidek had 10 points at the half, and the Bruins survived 13 
turnovers to lead, mainly because the Huskies -- the worst-shooting, 
lowest-scoring team in the Pac-10 -- missed 20 of their 25 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA scored on its first eight possessions of the second half, got a nice 
job from Cameron Dollar in short relief at point guard and pulled away in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real drama in the second half came when the O'Bannons collided and 
hit the floor beneath the Washington basket. Ed drew a charge and fell backward 
into an airborne Charles, who landed awkwardly on his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon said his arm and fingers were numb, but he was all right by 
the time he walked off the court. Until then, he didn't feel so great. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary," he said. "Lying there, I just thought about not playing for 
the rest of the season. . . .. . Some people break bones and they're out for 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harrick: "Here you've got two O'Bannons sprawled out, Holy Toledo!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon stayed in the game and played the entire second half except the 
last 30 seconds. Charles returned for the last five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all over by then, anyway. The only thing left was to wait for the new 
poll to come in, followed by Arizona.

BILLS PUT RAIDERS ON ICE AGAIN; AFC: BUFFALO COMES BACK FROM 17-6 DEFICIT TO 
REACH FOURTH CONSECUTIVE CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, 29-23. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders went from a 7-9 record last season to the second round of the 
playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They went from ridicule to respectability. They went from turmoil to triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will go no further. 
</P>
<P>
 A season of progress, achieved despite painful inconsistency that featured as 
many agonizing lows as exhilarating highs, took one final plunge Saturday 
afternoon at Rich Stadium, where the Buffalo Bills beat the Raiders, 29-23, 
before a frozen crowd of 61,923 to advance to next Sunday's AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in four years that a Raider season ended in Buffalo. 
But this was nothing like the 51-3 whipping the Raiders took in the 1991 AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a game the Raiders were leading at halftime, 17-13, after three 
quarters, 23-22, and might have pulled out with a few fortunate bounces in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have kicked their butts," Raider defensive lineman Greg Townsend 
said. " We should be representing the AFC." 
</P>
<P>
 All week, the pregame speculation centered on the weather. And it was bad. It 
was zero degrees at kickoff with 16-m.p.h. winds dropping the wind-chill to 32 
below, making it the coldest game ever played at Rich Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as it turned out, only the kicking game was affected. The passers were 
able to throw, the runners were able to go. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bills were able to do what they do best, which is dominate the AFC in 
the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of America outside the city limits might not want to hear this, but 
that sound that reverberated across the football world Saturday was the Bills 
taking their first step toward yet another Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers of three consecutive Super Bowls, Buffalo has won eight AFC playoff 
games in a row and the seven they have played at Rich Stadium. The last time 
the Bills lost a home playoff game was on New Year's Day, 1967, when they were 
defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs in an American Football League playoff 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders seemed to have a chance to break the streak coming into the game. 
They had beaten the Bills here six weeks ago, starting a run in which they had 
gone 5-1, climaxed by last week's 42-24 wild-card victory over the Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question was whether the Raiders could run on the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer in the first half was a resounding yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Montgomery and Napoleon McCallum were able to move down the sometimes 
slippery field with precision and power in the first 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, during which Jeff Jaeger missed a 47-yard 
field-goal attempt, the Raiders finally cashed in a drive early in the second 
quarter with a 30-yarder by Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as they would do all afternoon, the Bills responded with a score of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 This one was set up by a short kickoff by Jaeger on an afternoon when both 
kickers struggled with the field and the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger's kickoff wound up in the hands of one of the up men, Steve Tasker. 
Tasker has made his reputation as a special-teams star and he enhanced it 
Saturday by returning the kickoff 67 yards. Tasker raced down the left side and 
eluded three would-be tacklers before finally getting shoved out of bounds at 
the Raider one-yard line by Willie Gault. It was the longest postseason kickoff 
return in Bill history. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the most important. Kenneth Davis' one-yard run gave Buffalo the 
lead at 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra point would have made it 7-3, but on this day, an extra point was as 
perilous as a 40-yard field goal. Sure enough, the Bills' Steve Christie missed 
to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum put the Raiders back in front with a one-yard run, capping a 57-yard 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 When tight end Pete Metzelaars fumbled on Buffalo's next play from scrimmage, 
the Raiders again had the ball in Bills' territory in the closing minutes of 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 They got to the Buffalo one, where McCallum, on three carries, gained only 
half the distance to the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth down, Coach Art Shell sent in the field-goal unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold on, yelled Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them not to kick until after the two-minute warning," the Raider 
quarterback said. "I wanted to have my say." 
</P>
<P>
 With both Hostetler and offensive lineman Todd Peat arguing the case, Shell 
relented and put the ball back in McCallum's hands. He scored on his fourth try 
from the one and the Raiders led, 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelly quickly marched the Bills 76 yards, aided by a 37-yard 
pass-interference call on Torin Dorn, who was attempting to defend against 
Andre Reed. Thurman Thomas scored from the eight-yard line, cutting the margin 
to 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Bills went from a seven- to an eight-man line to shut 
down the Raider running game and opened up their own offense. The Bills rushed 
for only 14 yards in the first half, 61 in the second. The Raiders rushed for 
98 yards in the first half, only 12 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help the Raiders, who were already without defensive lineman Chester 
McGlockton, that safety Eddie Anderson had to leave early in the second half 
when his sprained ankle flared up. It also didn't help that the Raiders were 
called for being offsides five times, four of those called against veteran 
Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly connected with Bill Brooks on a 25-yard touchdown pass. Christie's 
extra point was blocked, but, after a McCallum fumble, Christie kicked a 
29-yard field goal to give Buffalo a 22-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders came back in spectacular fashion, Hostetler hitting Tim Brown 
across the middle and Brown turning it into an 86-yard touchdown, the longest 
in Raider postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was to be their last gasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly came back to Brooks in the fourth quarter for the winning points on a 
22-yard touchdown pass with 12:05 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 And then Buffalo hung on despite a series of plays that summed up a Raider 
afternoon of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 On one drive: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kelly, hit by Anthony Smith, fumbled, only to have the ball land in the 
hands of Bill lineman John Fina, who ran for 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kent Hull made a bad center snap, only to have Kelly fall on it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kelly threw a pass to Davis that bounced out of his hands and hung 
tantalizingly in the air, only to fall untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of a day for the Raiders. And that kind of a year.

THE AIKMAN SWEEPSTAKES: ANATOMY OF A DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ATTNER, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the early morning hours two days before Christmas, attorney Leigh 
Steinberg lay in the television room of his Southern California house, his 
2-year-old son sleeping on his chest. On Steinberg's feet were a pair of black 
cowboy boots, a recent gift from a client, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy 
Aikman. Wear them for good luck, Aikman told Steinberg; maybe they will be the 
difference in our negotiations with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Those talks, concerning a contract extension for Aikman, had been going on for 
nearly a month and had reached a critical point. The two sides already had 
agreed to the astonishing sum of $50 million, to be paid over an equally 
astonishing eight seasons. Those figures would make Aikman the highest-paid 
player in football history. But Steinberg and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones 
couldn't agree on how the money should be parceled out and how much should be 
guaranteed. The Aikman side wanted $11.5 million as a signing bonus and the 
rest guaranteed; Dallas was willing to pay an $8 million bonus but wanted the 
other $3 million allocated as part of future salaries, which would not be 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 A stalemate over those issues had led to a break-off in talks hours earlier. 
"The feeling was that there would be no deal," Steinberg says. One of the key 
negotiators, Cowboys Vice President Mike McCoy, left for Tulsa, Okla., for the 
Christmas holidays. Jones and Steinberg went home. But both knew it was 
imperative to continue talking. The National Football League had set a deadline 
of Dec. 23 for teams negotiating new contracts for veteran players. Any 
increased salary for the 1993 season contained within those deals would not 
count against the start of the salary cap in 1994, but only if the contracts 
were signed by Dec. 23. Aikman's 1993 income would grow in a new deal, so it 
made sense to agree now instead of later, leaving the Cowboys with more 1994 
cap money to sign other players. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones waited until mid-evening on Dec. 22 to call Steinberg at home. "The 
problem is guarantees," he said. "We are not going to guarantee the contract." 
It was a theme that Jones had maintained throughout the negotiations. It was 
important to Aikman that as much money as possible be guaranteed. He had back 
surgery in the off-season and the operation reinforced how vulnerable he felt 
to injury. If he got hurt later, he wanted to know the money still would be 
there. But Jones was convinced the salary cap made large guarantees obsolete. 
Under the cap, the Cowboys would have a maximum amount of money for salaries 
every season. If Aikman got hurt and his paycheck were guaranteed, they would 
have to replace him and still carry his salary, without the benefit of extra 
money for a new player. In Jones' mind, that was a no-win situation for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men hung up and Steinberg called Aikman in Dallas. "They just aren't 
going to guarantee the contract, it's obvious," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, then get as much money in the signing bonus as you can," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg told Jones they were dropping their demand for a guaranteed 
contract. He also told him it was not Aikman's intention to put a financial 
stranglehold on the Cowboys, that he would accept less salary in 1994 to give 
Dallas the flexibility to sign others, particularly offensive linemen. But in 
exchange, Aikman wanted the $11.5 million signing bonus. What Jones didn't know 
was how strong Aikman's feelings were regarding the salary-cap problems. "I'm 
willing to sign and then give some of my (1994) salary back to the team, so 
they can use it to sign other guys," Aikman told Steinberg before the 
negotiations started. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Steinberg realized a solution was near. Jones wanted to think about 
the bonus size. "I'll get back to you," he said. At 4 a.m. Dallas time, 
Steinberg's phone rang. "Let's do it," Jones said. Aikman would get his $50 
million, including $11 million as a signing bonus; the Cowboys would pay him 
$1.75 million in 1994 salary, about a million less than Aikman had been 
demanding earlier Dec. 22. Aikman, 27, would be a Cowboy the rest of his 
career. And for the NFL, the era of the $50 million man had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 When negotiations between Aikman and the Cowboys began in late November, 
neither side conceived of a $50 million contract. Aikman was focused on the 
guarantees; Steinberg wanted him to become the game's highest-paid player, and 
Jones wanted to pay his quarterback a market-value wage while not destroying 
the team's ability to sign other players under the cap. But interviews with the 
involved parties show how a combination of Jones' showmanship and business 
acumen, the unexpectedly hefty new NFL television contract and Steinberg's 
dogged determination to obtain a huge signing bonus combined to break new 
salary ground. What follows is the tale of how Aikman became that $50 million 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will ever know, but Jones might have cost himself millions of dollars 
by waiting until December to come to terms with Aikman, who still had 1994 left 
on his original six-year contract signed in 1989. A year ago, Jones had 
indicated to Steinberg that he wanted to extend Aikman's contract in the 
off-season. But in mid-July, he put off talks until December, in part so he 
could get a better feel for the new television contract he would help negotiate 
for the NFL. And he also had to first sign running back Emmitt Smith, a 
restricted free agent who wanted a significantly higher salary. Quarterback 
Steve Young, another Steinberg client, had just signed with the San Francisco 
49ers for $26.75 million for five years; Steinberg maintains that his goal in 
the summer would have been to obtain at least $1 more for Aikman than he got 
for Young, so Aikman could assume the "highest-paid" label. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to negotiate during the season; it's too distracting," 
Steinberg says. "And you are always fearful of injury. My hope was to finish 
with Steve, begin immediately on Troy's contract and have it wrapped up in a 
week. As it turned out, Troy played very well from the start of the season and 
then the television contract was stronger than expected. We were helped by 
waiting, but it was something we didn't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NFL's new $4.43 billion TV deal should increase each club's 1994 
cap maximum by $6 million, Jones maintains once he realized the league would 
not take a revenue cut -- and long before actual figures were negotiated -- he 
had decided on salary parameters for Aikman. "I just didn't feel it prudent to 
do Troy's contract in the summer," he says. "But we knew for a long time the 
extent we would go with his salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' refusal to begin early negotiations frustrated the Aikman camp. Then, 
when Dallas couldn't come to terms with Smith, who sat out two games before 
signing a new deal, Steinberg worried that Jones no longer was the "guy who 
could think outside the conventional NFL square. He had the kind of vision that 
was attractive. He could see football as an entertainment business, too. But I 
wondered if his close involvement with the league hadn't changed him, that 
maybe wanting to be able to say Troy was the highest-paid quarterback wasn't 
attractive to him as it might have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 There also was concern that Jones would wait until late December to push for a 
resolution. Both sides wanted a deal before the end of the regular season, so 
Aikman's 1993 salary of $1.17 million could be increased. But Steinberg knew 
that if the Cowboys offered a substantial raise below what he thought was 
Aikman's market value, he might be forced to accept it anyway if time was 
running out. "You can't in all honesty say no to a $2 million raise because you 
think he is worth $4 million more," Steinberg says. "No rational person would 
do that. But we wanted to avoid being in that position, so we pushed hard to 
start negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman was coming off a season in which he was MVP of the Super Bowl and made 
the Pro Bowl. He easily was the best young quarterback in the league and, along 
with Dan Marino, John Elway and Steve Young, among the best at any age at the 
position. But the onset of free agency had disrupted the salary structure, and 
by November, he was one of the lowest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL. His public 
frustration was growing, and the war of words between Jones and Steinberg was 
accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, soon after Steinberg had said Jones' failure to negotiate with Aikman 
was akin to dropping napalm on his own troops, the Cowboys called and said they 
were ready to talk. But the rift between Jones and Steinberg had intensified so 
much that initial talks were between McCoy and Jeff Moorad, Steinberg's 
partner. And even those had to be delayed 10 days. Why? The Aikman side had 
spent so much time lobbying to start negotiations that it had failed to prepare 
a specific offer. When the parties sat down at the end of November, it was 
apparent their views of Aikman's worth were quite different: Aikman wanted $36 
million guaranteed over six years, the Cowboys were offering $25 million over 
six, none guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas ultimately counteroffered with a four-year, $26.5 million proposal. 
That's where the talks stalemated. Jones had proposed a deal longer than six 
years, but Steinberg didn't want to tie up his client for an extended period. 
But, during a brainstorming session in mid-December, Steinberg and his 
associates played with the idea of an eight-year agreement. That would allow 
Jones to spread out a signing bonus, which for salary-cap purposes is averaged 
over the length of the contract, over more years. If the Cowboys wouldn't 
guarantee money, then an alternative might be a huge signing bonus, which 
represented immediate funds in Aikman's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones immediately liked the eight-year idea and the ballpark figure of $50 
million made sense if you added two seasons onto the original six-year 
proposal. "We already had decided that the contract was going to make Aikman 
the highest-paid player," Jones says. "We were using contracts like Young's as 
parameters for our offer. By going eight years, it would give us flexibility 
under the cap. And teams would recognize it as justification for increasing the 
signing bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 To protect Aikman, the sides agreed to a salary escalator clause for the final 
two seasons. If in those final years, when he would be paid $6.75 million and 
$7.5 million, he makes the Pro Bowl, leads the Cowboys to the conference 
championship game or finishes among the NFL's top five passers, his salary will 
be adjusted to reflect the incomes of the five most highly paid quarterbacks in 
the league. He was granted a no-trade clause, and money was to be deferred for 
four years beyond the contract's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the parties remained stuck on the issues of guarantees, bonus and 
early-year salaries, a situation that didn't change until the evening of Dec. 
22, when Aikman dropped his demand for a guaranteed contract. Steinberg, boots 
still on, finally called his client just after 4 a.m. Dallas time on Dec. 23. 
"We've got a deal," he told the sleepy Aikman, who was talking to 
girlfriend/country singer Lorrie Morgan on the other line. Aikman was so tired 
that when he woke up a few hours later, he wasn't sure if Steinberg's call was 
a dream. So he waited a while and contacted his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was I dreaming?" he said. He wasn't. During an early-evening news conference 
Dec. 23, Jones presented Aikman with a $10.75 million check. The rest of his 
bonus and 1993 salary -- in all, $2.75 million -- was deferred. Aikman can only 
shake his head. "When I came into the league, I never ever expected to earn 
this kind of money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in Jones' office, the Dallas owner brought out champagne glasses and 
had the official contract signing filmed. Everyone autographed footballs and 
uniform jerseys. It was a momentous occasion; after all, Jones had paid just 
slightly more ($65 million) for the team in 1989. In 30 years, he had never 
missed being in his parents' home in Missouri on the 23rd to help decorate the 
family Christmas tree. He wondered if he would make it this time. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't quite make it, but he was there by the wee hours of the morning. "It 
was a great Christmas," Jones says. "The Cowboys have the best quarterback in 
the league for the next seven years, and we have flexibility under the cap. And 
Troy has security. It couldn't have worked out better for any of us."

BULLETS GO LONG, BEAT CLIPPERS; PRO BASKETBALL: WASHINGTON MAKES SEVEN OF 10 
THREE-POINT SHOTS AND SCORES A 118-109 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NBA's third-worst three-point shooting team, the Clippers have defended 
three-point shots about as poorly as they have shot them, and Saturday night it 
cost them a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Bullets made seven of 10 three-point shots, including four in 
the fourth quarter, and defeated the Clippers, 118-109, before 15,330 at the US 
Air Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 15th time this season that the Clippers have given up more than 
five three-point shots in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody shoots (three-point shots) well against us," Clipper Coach Bob 
Weiss said. "It's not that we don't try to defend it. . . . They had to shoot 
them quick. It wasn't that we were standing there aiming at them. You can't 
shoot seven out of 10 in practice most of the time with nobody on you." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 107-107, Bullet guard Rex Chapman made a three-point shot with 
3:13 remaining to trigger an 11-2 run. Chapman, who had a team-high 25 points, 
made all three three-pointers he attempted, including two in the last quarter, 
as the Bullets scored their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper guard Ron Harper did a good job defensively on Chapman in a 109-92 
victory over the Bullets last month, limiting him to 12 points. But Chapman, 
who missed eight of 12 shots against the Clippers last month, made nine of 19 
shots and scored 14 points as the Bullets outscored the Clippers, 31-23, in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played a good ballgame, but that three-pointer by Chapman broke 
our backs," Weiss said. "Ron Harper tried to pay special attention to him all 
night long. He did a good job on him when we played them at home, so we tried 
to do the same things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have switched too many times, but if he's that hot, he's going to 
score because he can get a shot off from anywhere. He's that quick off the 
screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without forward Danny Manning, who sat out the game because of a 
sprained left ankle, the Clippers didn't make a field goal in the final 4:03, 
missing their last four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our go-to offense is Danny Manning," Weiss said. "He also gives us a 
lot (of points) on the break, so it was a major adjustment. I thought they did 
a terrific job (without) Manning." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper scored a game-high 26, making 11 of 22 shots, and Mark Aguirre, who 
didn't play in Friday night's 102-95 victory at Boston, had 23 points in 38 
minutes as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers (12-22) have lost 12 of their last 15 games, they didn't 
quit as they had during their recent seven-game losing streak, taking a 
three-point halftime lead after falling behind by 13 points in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not having critical lapses, and when we do they're two minutes instead 
of being a quarter," Aguirre said. "And that's progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson, who averaged only 5.6 points in the previous five games, 
scored 17 points. Jackson, who had shot only 41.2% in his previous six games, 
made six of 13 shots, including two of four three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in a funk," Jackson said. "I haven't been shooting the ball, but if 
you look at my numbers, I think the assists and rebounds have been consistent, 
but I haven't been looking for my shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a guy who's going to be like (Phoenix Sun guard Kevin Johnson) or 
(injured Golden State guard Tim) Hardaway or those guys that put up shots every 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel I'm the same player, but it's just not as much fun because we're 
losing. People say 'Hey, you're not doing the shake (to celebrate good plays) 
and you're not excited,' but I'm not excited over one play, I'm excited over a 
team doing good -- and when you're eight or nine games under .500, there's 
nothing to be jumping around and doing the shake about."

PERFECT START POWERS THE KINGS, 5-3; HOCKEY: L.A. SCORES ON ITS FIRST FOUR 
SHOTS AND THEN HOLDS OFF THE DEVILS. GRETZKY NEEDS 16 GOALS TO BREAK HOWE'S 
RECORD. 
</P>

 Textbook hockey, it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 The King-New Jersey Devil game here on Saturday night featured one period of 
playing dangerously, followed by two periods of solid goaltending and stellar 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kings prevailed in those crazy first 20 minutes, which was all they 
needed in their 5-3 victory before a sellout crowd of 19,040 at Meadowlands 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 How strange was that first period? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Kings scored four goals on four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Gretzky scored on a breakaway. He can bank the puck off the side of 
the net and score or slap a 30-foot line drive out of the air past a goalie, 
but usually doesn't score on breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New Jersey Coach Jacques Lemaire pulled starting goaltender Chris Terreri 
at 8:39 of the first period. Terreri gave up three goals, but the timing of the 
switch was odd because Bruce Driver's goal at 8:39 had cut the Kings' lead to 
3-2. The Kings scored on their next shot, on the power play, when Rob Blake's 
shot from above the right circle went past goaltender Peter Sidorkiewicz after 
deflecting off Devil right wing John MacLean's stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very strange game," said Gretzky, who added an empty-netter with 
four seconds remaining and had one assist for a three-point performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got two short-handed goals and they had one. You don't know what will 
happen. (King Coach Barry Melrose) said keep shooting at the net and strange 
things will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The two goals by Gretzky bring him closer to Gordie Howe's all-time record of 
801 goals. Gretzky needs 16 goals to surpass Howe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting excited," Gretzky said. "It's only 15 to tie now. I'm starting to 
get there. Obviously, there's a good chance I'll do it this year now. I'd like 
to break it this year." 
</P>
<P>
 How does it compare to becoming the all-time leading scorer? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, 1,852 (points) was pretty exciting," he said. "I think this one will be 
more exciting because people thought this would never be broken." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, the second half the season began positively on almost all counts. The 
Kings (18-21-4) are unbeaten in their last six road games and moved back into 
eighth place, the final Western Conference playoff position, with 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Robb Stauber made 33 saves and the Kings' specialty teams performed 
well. With their two power-play goals on Saturday night, the Kings have scored 
seven in their last three games. The Devils scored twice on the power play 
after Dixon Ward received a five-minute major and an automatic game misconduct 
for high-sticking forward Bill Guerin at 4:30 of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kings killed off the Devils' final five power-play opportunities, 
including four in the third period. Typically, that's when the Kings call upon 
Pat Conacher. But earlier, Conacher, playing against his former team, showed he 
is more than a checking center. He scored his eighth goal of the season, at 
6:46 of the first period, while killing a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Conacher has more goals than teammates Warren Rychel, John Druce, Tony Granato 
and Shawn McEachern, among others. He was helped by linesman Gord Broseker, who 
accidentally set a pick on Devil defenseman Scott Niedermayer. Then Conacher 
went down the left wing and his shot hit the left post and trickled past 
Terreri. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gord should have got an assist," Conacher said. "My eyes got wider when he 
bumped him. But they all count. Ten years from now, it will have gone in over 
his shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Melrose: "Patty was great. If we played this team every night, he'd be 
unbelievable."

MORNING BRIEFING: FOR $5,000, BERGER FOUND PLACE TO ROOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In 1947, seven years after Wally Berger had retired from baseball, he and his 
wife, Martha, decided to settle in Manhattan Beach. He gave Martha $5,000 and 
told her to use it as a down payment on a house.  
</P>
<P>
 Martha went looking and found a place close to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I called Wally and said, 'Guess what. I got a house for $4,950 and have 
$50 left over for furniture,' " Martha said. "And Wally said, 'What is it, a 
chicken coop?' I said 'Close, but when you see it you will like it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Berger, who hit 38 home runs and had 119 runs batted in with the Boston Braves 
in his rookie season, died in 1988. But Martha still lives in the house. Now, 
it's worth about $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: There are only three active players in the National League who 
have at least 10 years' major league experience and have spent their entire 
careers with one team. Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
 The big jerko? When Mike Ditka recently showed interest in the coaching job 
with the Atlanta Falcons -- and was spurned -- it did not escape Jay Mariotti 
of the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why in the name of a heart palpitation would Ditka want to leave what he has 
now?" Mariotti asked. "If Atlanta hired him, he would have to deal with the 
two-sport headache known as Deion Sanders, the moods of Andre Rison. He'd have 
to deal with Bobby Hebert, who has a gun arm but makes Jim Harbaugh look like a 
Mensa achiever. He'd have to deal twice a year with Steve Young and the 49ers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Is that what the big jerko really wants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it takes: The American Hockey League is pulling out all stops to draw 
fans. The Portland Pirates' fans now stay in their seats during intermissions 
to watch frozen-turkey bowling or to catch T-shirts propelled by slingshot from 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 But the award for creativity goes to the Binghamton Rangers, who recently 
sponsored a "Baby Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 For five days in a row, babies were entered in crawling derbies at 12 
different stores in a food chain to qualify for the final, which was held 
during a game intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 A large mat was placed on the ice between periods, complete with lanes, and 
the babies were off. The winning baby received a $500 bond, and the parents got 
a four-day trip to the Poconos. 
</P>
<P>
 Add baby: During a recent basketball game between the Miami Heat and the Utah 
Jazz, the Utah dancers lured four men from the crowd with the promise that they 
would be in a dance routine.  
</P>
<P>
 The men were serenaded with a few choruses of "Baby Face," as the women 
strapped red bows to the men's hair and made them hold oversized baby bottles 
and wear baby bibs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Fowler of the Miami Herald says the crowd loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could almost hear every man in the Delta Center tell himself, 'Remember, 
don't ever volunteer for anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Orel Hershiser, Dodgers; Dwight Gooden, New York Mets, and Tony 
Gwynn, San Diego Padres.

COMMENTARY; A WISH: GET BACK AGAIN JOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY KORNHEISER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We're all wishing for the same Super Bowl, aren't we? We all want to see Joe 
Montana get a shot at the 49ers, because that would be poetic justice. Montana 
vs. Steve Young. Montana vs. Eddie DeBartolo. Montana vs. the team that cut him 
loose. Old Joe, like Gary Cooper in "High Noon," keeping his appointment with 
destiny one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine the thrill of seeing Montana in another Super Bowl, the 
anticipation of him getting the ball, say, down by six points with two minutes 
to play, and having to cover 80 yards against his dear friends and former 
teammates? Wouldn't that bring you to your feet? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that better than watching -- a "directional punter"? 
</P>
<P>
 (What is Madden's preoccupation with directional punting? He spent more time 
on directional punting in this one Giants game than Les Aspin spent on 
Mogadishu. Meanwhile, Mike Horan, Mr. Directional Punter himself, got a punt 
blocked by his teammate's keister! Does that make him a "re-directional 
punter"? Enough already with directional punting. If you want to punt the ball 
to the sideline, for heaven's sake, just turn and face the sideline.) 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Kansas City has to go through Houston and Buddy Ryan on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the defensive genius in Detroit who allowed Sterling Sharpe, the 
only offensive weapon the Packers have, to beat him in the last minute! Can you 
believe that? Here is Sharpe, who already has two TD catches, and he's wide 
open in the end zone! Forget "nickel" and "dime" packages, if you're Detroit 
you've got to put a "dollar" package out there -- 10 guys on Sharpe, and one 
guy rushing Brett Favre. Detroit should have been on Sharpe like cream gravy. 
No, that is not what Joe Montana is going to see Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "Earth To . . . " Buddy Ryan we're talking about. Do you actually 
think Buddy is going to let Joe Montana beat him? If Buddy punched out his own 
coach, what do you think he'd do to Montana? Buddy's going to put a bounty on 
Montana. Did you see what the Giants did to the punk doofus McMahon on Sunday 
-- when they left him twitching on the turf, and the trainer came out and 
appeared to be delivering the last rites? Buddy was taking notes on that. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy is way out of control. Buddy is so far over the line he needs a cab to 
get back. Not only did he throw a punch at Kevin Gilbride, but over the weekend 
he called him a "wimp," and said Gilbride "should be selling insurance." How 
does that work at team meetings? 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy has been beaten by Montana before: In 1984, when Buddy was the defensive 
coordinator for Da Bears, Montana came into Soldier Field in the playoffs, and 
blanked them 23-0. And in 1989, when Buddy was coaching the Eagles, Montana 
came into Veterans Stadium and threw five touchdown passes -- four in the last 
quarter! -- and beat Buddy, 38-28. Buddy is going to run guys at Montana the 
way they run bulls through Pamplona. He'll run Willie Horton at him if he has 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, have I mentioned how great the games were this weekend? All four. 
Fabulous. And you know who else was fabulous? Joe Gibbs. I'm sitting there 
watching a guy who looks like the Coach "Joe" I knew, but certainly doesn't 
sound like the Coach "Joe" I knew. Nope, that "Joe" was a sphinx. You couldn't 
get a decent quote out of him; that "Joe" had the personality of Cup-A-Soup. 
This "Joe" -- wow, what did he do, take a seminar with Morey Amsterdam? Story 
after story. Funny, engaging, congenial. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, remember a few weeks ago when every game ended 3-2, and people were saying 
the game had been turned over to field goal kickers, and defenses were 
smothering offenses, and the NFL was ruined, finished, kaput? Well, how do 
those morons feel now seeing feverish playoff games like these: 42-24, 28-24, 
27-24.

A KICKER IS NOTHING WITHOUT A POSITIVE ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a rehearsal: 
</P>
<P>
 The center is snapping the ball; I'm following it through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The holder has it; he's putting it down. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm striding into it; I can feel my foot strike the ball. It feels good. The 
ball is going through the uprights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's at that point David Treadwell permits his mind to see the truth: Is it 
just practice or is it the real thing? Look at the scoreboard: Is this San 
Francisco I see or only Asbury Park? 
</P>
<P>
 "I put it through my mind so often that when I line up I'm thinking, I've been 
here before," Treadwell said. "You do it often enough and you can fool your 
mind. Your mind doesn't know what's reality and what's not.' 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell is a place-kicker, one of the trio of legs that Dan Reeves brought 
in as Jersey Broncos and who have become significant parts of the New York 
Giants' rise from their own ashes. They've already gone far beyond expectations 
and now they're going to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 And the last time they played a game of any magnitude in San Francisco has its 
place in the storied history of the Giants. Small children and incoming 
place-kickers know it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt Bahr had five field goals, the Giants won and went to the Super Bowl," 
Treadwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a minute. Bahr's five field goals were all the points the Giants had, and 
they won, 15-13. Not only that, but the last moment ticked off while Bahr's 
game-winning kick was in the air. Jan. 20, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, but Bahr's field goal with 7:20 remaining won the Super Bowl 
and Scott Norwood didn't win the Super Bowl for the Buffalo Bills as the clock 
ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be his stigma," Treadwell said. "Scott Norwood didn't lose the 
Super Bowl, the Bills lost the Super Bowl. Actually, it should be, 'The Giants 
won the Super Bowl.' 
</P>
<P>
 "People put too much emphasis on the negative. You watch the news shows and 
it's all murders and disasters. Aren't there any shows about how good things 
happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 He sees Joe Carter's success and no failure for Mitch Williams. He sees Bahr's 
success and not Norwood's failure. There are heroes and no goats in his 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 It's his kind of mind control -- call it the power of positive thinking or 
psychocybernetics, or whatever. "It's my way of coping," he said. He tries to 
convince himself that there's pressure on every kick and that the kick to win 
the game is no different than the ones he's made in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the putt on the 18th at Augusta just like any other? "Not for me, but it is 
for them," Brad Daluiso said. "Then, I wouldn't expect Arnold Palmer to make a 
field goal at the end of the game, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Daluiso is the one with the really strong leg. He puts kickoffs out of the end 
zone. He tries outrageous field goals, like the 54-yarder that beat the Phoenix 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Horan is the punter who replaced Sean Landeta and has cornered coffin 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell has converted 25 of 31 field-goal attempts this season. He missed a 
38-yarder against the Jets; he made a 31-yarder with 10 seconds remaining to 
force Dallas to overtime on the last game of the regular-season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interval before the overtime, he and Daluiso went onto the field to 
test their range. "I was thinking, 'Am I going to get a shot to do my job?' " 
Treadwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes covet fantasy all their lives. "I don't do that," Treadwell said. "I 
constantly put pressure on myself: I know if I don't make those other field 
goals, I don't keep my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell is the kicker Reeves had in mind when he cut Bahr, to the dismay of 
a number of Giants who remembered. "Matt understood," Treadwell said. "It can 
be a cruel business. I was disappointed when I had to leave Denver, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell is 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, a reed among the sequoias in the locker 
room. He sees himself as a football player, not as "a kicker" who goes off to 
private practice and mystic routines in a tradition founded on left-footed 
Cypriot soccer-style kickers who handpainted neckties and -- legend says -- 
crowed: "I keek a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm a football player; I'm part of the team," Treadwell said. "I 
think it's a different approach to the game. For the majority, it's a physical 
approach. As a kicker, it's mental. That doesn't mean I'm not as involved in 
the game; it doesn't mean I don't want to win as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to maintain a level of composure. I don't crack heads. I'd love to. 
I'd love to play another position -- quarterback or defensive back. My size 
doesn't allow it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they're all soccer-style kickers these days, and Treadwell, like most 
of them, played soccer in an earlier life.

TV SCHEDULE DEADLINES MAY FINALLY PROMPT ACTION BY BASEBALL OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER PASCARELLI, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tough baseball decisions, long discussed and long delayed by owners whose eye 
for public image too often is blackened, are finally close to being settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Circle Tuesday. That's when the owners begin meetings in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., and they will emerge (yes, we've heard all this before) with realignment 
and an extra round of playoffs, a revenue-sharing plan and possibly a new 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 This may sound like more propaganda, but if there's no realignment deal with 
the players' association within a couple of weeks the fall TV schedules have to 
go to bed without making room for the extra playoffs. And if there's no 
revenue-sharing plan pretty soon, then talks with the players' association will 
not have started by the time the players report to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the owners don't hurry and name a commissioner soon, they could end up 
with Marge Schott -- heaven forbid. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two leading candidates for commissioner. One is Harvey Schiller, 
head of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the focus of various controversies. He 
is a friend of New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and widely believed 
to be a form of bargaining chip used in exchange for revenue-sharing support 
from teams such as the Yankees and Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is Arnold Weber, retiring president of Northwestern University and 
former adviser to former President Nixon. He is believed to be a finalist 
because powerful Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is a member of the 
Northwestern Board of Trustees and because Weber himself is a board member of 
Tribune Co., which owns the Chicago Cubs and the broadcast rights to eight 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for trying to find the best and the brightest, a powerful, new 
commissioner without excess baggage and not beholden to any constituencies. If 
the owners really cared about heading into the second half of this uncertain 
decade with dynamic and healing leadership, are these really the best choices 
they can find? 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller is an abrasive sort who was nearly touched by the USOC scandal. He is 
supposedly detested by most of those with whom he dealt at the Southeastern 
Conference (of which he was once commissioner) and the TV networks that were 
bidding on the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 And the semi-sedentary Weber is at an age and interest level where he would be 
a caretaker who would warm the empty chair through the next few years until the 
owners could start looking for someone to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there were actually good people interested in this job, who 
viewed being commissioner as a matter of public service for helping a game so 
intertwined in the fabric of our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kirk, the respected attorney and politician, was one. So was NBC sports 
chief Dick Ebersol. There are also a number of in-house possibilities who would 
have also been interested if the owners had ever been willing to look to 
someone within baseball who actually knows what he would be getting into. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is glaringly obvious that the search committee treaded water in hopes 
that Bud Selig, Milwaukee Brewers president and interim commissioner, would 
agree to sell his team and remove the "interim" from his title. And when Selig 
finally convinced them he was not interested, the search committee rushed to 
judgment on a couple of candidates with powerful in-house sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 So barring a public outcry that could force them to reassess this process, the 
owners are hell bent to make an uninspired choice as their next "leader," 
someone who will be in trouble with the owners by the time paint dries on the 
nameplate to his office door. 
</P>
<P>
 A COMPROMISE revenue-sharing plan formulated by Richard Ravitch, the owners 
chief labor executive, fell one vote short last week of the 21 votes needed for 
approval. The eight nays came from the so-called big-market group: both New 
York teams, the Los Angeles Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, 
Baltimore Orioles, St. Louis Cardinals and Colorado Rockies, who if not 
demographically big-market certainly is financially with its 4 million in 
attendance and ongoing free-agent shopping (shortstop Walt Weiss being the 
latest acquisition). 
</P>
<P>
 However, there will be enough votes for approval by the time the owners meet 
in Florida. St. Louis is close to changing its vote if a few more financial 
tweaks are made in the plan. Red Sox club President John Harrington has been an 
active and effective part of revenue sharing since the start and would be an 
unlikely party to killing the whole process so near to its completion. And some 
of the other opposition clubs have held out approval only because of various 
particulars, not to the concept as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that revenue sharing would help small-market clubs with whatever 
added income it could provide. And it's obvious that giving up a few million 
would not hurt some of those rich, big-market operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oakland Athletics President Sandy Alderson correctly points out that 
revenue sharing would indirectly benefit a large majority of clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What revenue sharing would do is narrow the range of competition, even if a 
middle-market club like us doesn't pay or receive appreciably," Alderson says. 
"It would narrow the range of payrolls and, in the process, it would allow all 
clubs to be more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that right now for most clubs, money considerations are 
more important than talent considerations when you make personnel decisions. 
Economics are always going to be part of your personnel decisions, but right 
now they are considerably more in that direction than they should be." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the process, pennant races could be changed. For example, with revenue 
sharing, maybe a team such as San Diego last season would not have been selling 
off players. And a team such as Atlanta would not have been in position to 
scoop up Fred McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe at least franchises such as Pittsburgh and San Diego won't have to 
be totally decimated like they have been the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER BIGGER NAMES such as Will Clark and Rafael Palmeiro signed, it has been 
a fairly low-key free-agent season, and there remain some interesting unsigned 
players. Chris Sabo appears to be headed to either the Dodgers or New York 
Mets. . . . Tim Belcher, a proven pitcher who has gotten surprisingly little 
mention, is being semi-pursued by the Seattle Mariners and Toronto. . . . The 
Mariners are also talking to veteran starting pitchers Frank Tanana and Charlie 
Leibrandt. . . . A handful of clubs continue to weigh the medical risk of 
giving a multiyear guarantee to reliever Gregg Olson, whom the Baltimore 
Orioles still say they can retain.

DECLARING EARLY: IT'S A COMING OUT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the ones who ought to be boycotting aren't basketball coaches, whining 
over one lost scholarship. Maybe, instead, the ones who ought to be walking are 
football players, who give up their last year of eligibility for the promise of 
pro riches, only to end up on the outer edges of the NCAA limb, swaying ever so 
unsteadily. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks Trent Dilfer of Fresno State and Heath Shuler of Tennessee were 
among 29 underclassmen who declared for the NFL draft last week. No problem. 
They bring substantial credentials with them and are certain to be picked early 
-- probably the first two passers to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, however, declaring early is more of a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you announce you're coming out for the draft and then don't get 
picked. Then what? In college football, you're out of luck. There is no turning 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the protectors of motherhood and apple pie at the NCAA corrected 
the problem for basketball players, voting to permit those who declare and then 
are not gleefully embraced by the pros to make a U-turn and regain their 
remaining collegiate eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 For football players, though, second chances still don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem to be reasonable to expect that will be changed next year," 
said Chuck Neinas, executive director of the College Football Assn. "It seems 
like a good idea, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, about half the undergraduates who declare for the NFL draft get 
picked. Last year, it was 24 of 46 and the year before, 25 of 48. The others 
vanish into a kind of football purgatory, drifting from training camp to 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them catch on, like Washington State wide receiver Philip Bobo, signed 
as a free agent with the Los Angeles Rams. Others don't, like Vanderbilt tight 
end Pat Akos. 
</P>
<P>
 They were among the underclassmen who declared for the NFL draft a year ago. 
Also in the Class of '93 were a couple of Atlantic Coast Conference linebackers 
-- Marvin Jones of Florida State and Keith Battle of North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones came out with all of the pomp and circumstance appropriate to his status 
as an All-American from Florida State. Battle's decision to go pro was greeted 
with considerably less hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 For both, there were no guarantees. For Jones, though, there was plenty of 
probability. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always some uncertainty," Jones said. "I hoped I would get picked 
high, but you really never know. They keep you in the dark. You think anything 
can happen. It's hard to believe something you've hoped for is really going to 
happen. You look at the dark side. A lot of people said I should have stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jones had an armful of awards to reinforce his decision. "I was 
confident," he said. "My name kept appearing among the top five. I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Jones was pounced upon by the New York Jets, who made him the 
fourth choice in the 1993 draft. He made it through half the season before 
suffering a fractured hip. While he was rehabilitating, his old college team 
finally won the national championship it had flirted with during his time in 
Tallahassee. There are no regrets, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it, even though I'm not there, I still feel a part of it," he 
said. "I helped put them in that position. I don't feel bad. I'm happy for 
them. It would be nice to be there. But I made a decision and I have no 
regrets. This would have been my senior year. I could have been hurt playing 
there. Then what?" 
</P>
<P>
 No pro contract. That's what. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jones was picked, Battle waited, and waited, and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six other linebackers went in the 1993 draft. Battle was not one of 
them. He was out there for eight rounds, available, hoping for somebody, 
anybody to call his name. And when the draft was over, he was still out there, 
a linebacker with nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been here, working out," said William Hicks, strength and conditioning 
coach for NC State. "He's staying in shape, hoping for a shot."

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; JORDAN TO THE WHITE SOX? SURELY A SCREWBALL IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nice retirement, Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of you who had four months in the Michael-Jordan-is-back pool, you win. 
I thought his comeback would be in basketball, but with Jordan, you never know. 
</P>
<P>
 What a guy! He's the best who ever played basketball. He takes up golf and 
says he wants to play on the pro tour. Now he takes batting practice for a 
month and announces he would like to go to spring training with the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 This will do wonders for the White Sox's exhibition attendance, if not team 
morale. Remember when White Sox players got upset that Bo Jackson was getting 
all the press? When they vetoed Minnie Minoso's return? When Jordan's 
retirement overshadowed their playoff series with Toronto? Wait till they see 
this circus. 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler says politely that Jordan would be "at 
best a longshot," adding they will decide next month whether to invite him. 
However, it won't be up to Schueler but owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who also owns 
the Bulls and would never deny his Mike anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, of course, likes his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no fantasy," he told his biographer, Chicago Tribune columnist Bob 
Greene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know yet whether I'll actually be good enough to make the team, but I 
believe my chances are better than 50-50. This is something my father wanted me 
to do. He started me in baseball when I was 6. Two years ago, he told me I 
should go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan hasn't played baseball since his junior year in high school. He might 
have been a prospect, but had he stayed at it, he would have seen the pitchers 
begin to spin the ball as they release it, resulting in an altered flight path 
called a curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are sliders, sinkers, split-finger fastballs, cut fastballs, 
screwballs, changeups. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't hit .300 in a college league," Red Sox scout Frank Malzone said. 
"What's going on? Are the White Sox exploiting him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, having worked it all out, is undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball teams stay in a city for four or five days at a time," he said. 
"It's not like the NBA, where you fly out after the game. I'd like to take my 
wife and children with me on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 That heads off the I'm-quitting-basketball-to-spend-time-with-the-family 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball, that's over," Jordan said. "That's the past. I don't miss it at 
all. When there's a game on TV, sometimes I watch, sometimes I don't. It's easy 
for me to turn off the TV and walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 It'll be fun while it lasts, although Jordan might not have really thought 
this out. He hates to be embarrassed. When he laid an egg in the All-Star 
three-point competition, he all but stopped shooting treys for a season. 
</P>
<P>
 One word of advice as he chases his dream: Don't bet on it. MEANWHILE, BACK IN 
CHICAGO STADIUM . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's almost as if Jordan never left. The Bulls are winning and players are on 
General Manager Jerry Krause, upset that he didn't try to beat New York to 
Derek Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Horace Grant: "I truly believe if we'd gotten Derek Harper or Jeff 
Hornacek, we'd be back in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Scottie Pippen: "New York lost their point guard and within two or three 
weeks they got a solid replacement. We lost the best player of all time and 
three months later, we've done nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people expect the Bulls to contend, we have to have something to go to war 
with. . . . I'm not going to be comfortable if we have to go to the playoffs 
with what we've got now." BIG D, AS IN DUE FOR A SHAKE-UP 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks are winless at home and have fallen behind the pace of 
last season's 11-71. Since March 1, 1992, they're an astounding 18-123. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Donald Carter is loyal to a fault, but the heat now falls on the other 
two members of his central committee, General Manager Norm Sonju and personnel 
director Rick Sund, both already on the outs with new Coach Quinn Buckner. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at our difficulties under (John) MacLeod, (Richie) Adubato and 
Quinn, I think that raises some management questions," says Doug Adkins, 
Maverick vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this happens with three coaches in a row, I think obviously that 
management has to do some self-evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Buckner, having rid himself of his nemesis, Harper, is still 
butting heads with rookie Jamal Mashburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Buckner again pulled Mashburn, who then pointedly refused to join 
the huddle. Cut off leaving the dressing room through a back door, he said, 
"You've got to ask Quinn. I don't have anything to say about it."

<P>
 Said Buckner: "He's having trouble getting the ball to go down. That could be 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night against Atlanta, Buckner didn't start Mashburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Terry Davis: "Whatever him and Quinn got going out there, they'd 
better straighten it out because this isn't the league for that. Whatever Quinn 
is doing to him or whatever, we don't need that . . . around here. It's already 
bad enough." THE DONALD IS ON THE CASE 
</P>
<P>
 With Clipper dreams in tatters and the franchise poised to follow, owner 
Donald T. Sterling is trying to get to the bottom of this in his inimitable 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling has started asking confidants what they think of his coach, Bob 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also reports he's asking what they think of his general manager, 
Elgin Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Since some of those confidants are sportswriters, it didn't take long to leak. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss is a nice man, perhaps too nice, but they can't pin this on him. This 
team was in big trouble before he arrived. He made two mistakes. The second was 
letting Sterling suck him into voting against trading Danny Manning to Miami. 
The first was taking the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor is a good basketball man who has been hamstrung at every turn. He had 
an agreement to sign Manning but Sterling's fiscal watchdog, Andy Roeser, 
fiddled it away. He had a deal that would at least get something back for 
Manning, but Sterling threw it into committee and thwarted that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling, upset at charges that he has a divided front office, OKd a plan in 
which no one was to comment on anything except publicist Joe Safety. Now 
Sterling, Baylor and Roeser are unavailable on routine matters. Behind the 
scenes, it's the same old zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, it looks safe to kiss off the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 21st is to be any different, Baylor must be given real operational 
control, with the ability to fire anyone and no obligation to consult the 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sterling isn't comfortable giving him that much power, he has to find 
someone else. The Clippers need a strong man. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sterling wants to know who has messed this whole thing up, his initials are 
D.T.S. and he can find him in the mirror. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Boys, Worse Boys (Cont.): Detroit forward Sean Elliott on the team's 
plummet: "We've got a lot of crybabies on this team. There's a lot of 
finger-pointing. Somebody makes a mistake, we fall apart and start arguing." 
Said exec-to-be Isiah Thomas: "I would have to say that's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Old Trail Blazers never die, they just need more shots: Portland General 
Manager Geoff Petrie on his aging roster: "We have some players who think 
they're the same player that they were five or six years ago (Jerome Kersey?) 
and players who still think they can get to the rim and slam and take over 
games at will (Clyde Drexler?). What we do have is a team with an awful lot of 
talent and once it gets healthy, we've got a good chance to make some noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 76er owner Harold Katz's plan to move into a new arena in Camden, 
N.J., was foiled by New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman's pledge not to raise 
taxes. Gov. Whitman says she was convinced by rocker Jon Bon Jovi, who told her 
the area would support only one arena. Katz might now have to rejoin his rival, 
Flyer owner Ed Snider, who is building Spectrum II. 
</P>
<P>
 You're nobody till somebody loves you: 76er forward Clarence Weatherspoon, 
averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds, railing at his lack of fame: "I'm a . . . 
nobody and I always do all the . . . work. I'm a nobody around the league and 
in my own city. I go out every night and get close to 10 boards and I still get 
pushed in the back. Ask around the league who's a better player, me or LaPhonso 
Elis, and everybody will holler Ellis. He was first-team all-rookie and I 
barely made second team. That's . . . up." 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway averaged 12 points, five rebounds, five assists 
and shot 45% in the first month of the season but went up to 15-5-6 and 48% in 
the second. The Magic, criticized for trading Chris Webber for Hardaway, is 
ecstatic: "In my opinion, he's the runaway rookie of the year," Coach Brian 
Hill said. "And there's no one even close." Actually, someone is: Webber is 
averaging 17 points, nine rebounds, four assists, two blocks, a steal and is 
shooting 54%. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State's Bryon Russell, starting at forward for the Utah Jazz, was 
chosen to play in the rookie game All-Star weekend. Russell credits his 
development to playing against pros last summer, including Magic Johnson. 
"Magic was hogging the court," Russell said. "I said, 'Yo, big man! Can we get 
in there?' He said, 'Next game.' " Russell says his team beat Johnson's and 
Johnson told him: "You've got a future in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Turn out the lights, the party's over: Karl Malone was averaging 26 points and 
12 rebounds when the league office told him to take the little lights out of 
the heels of his sneakers. Since, he's averaging 21 and 11. . . . Malone has 
led the league in free throws attempted the last five seasons but is now 
running No. 3 behind David Robinson and Shaquille O'Neal. Starting last week, 
Robinson had shot 396 free throws, 91 more than O'Neal. "You look at all the 
people around the league who bitched and moaned about me getting to the 
free-throw line," Malone said. "Maybe it's finally working." Or, maybe the 
Mailman, at 30, is slowing down.

 After a brush with a double bogey and an unhappy experience with a 
photographer, Davis Love III staggered in with a two-stroke lead Saturday after 
three rounds of the Hawaiian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just totally lost my composure," Love said."I'm lucky to get in at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Love, who took the lead with a spectacular 60 in the second round, could 
manage only a 71 for his next trip over the Waialae Country Club course. He 
will take a 199 total, 17 under par, into today's final round in the chase for 
a $216,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, everything went right," Love said of the 12-under-par effort. 
"Today, everything went the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just got to put both out of my mind, all the bad stuff today, all the 
good stuff yesterday, and just go play golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Brett Ogle, once six shots off the pace, was second at 201 after a 
four-under-par 68. Tom Lehman was next at 203 with a 68 and Jeff Maggert, also 
with a 68, followed at 204. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogle got a three-shot swing on the 15th, a 15-foot birdie against Love's 
double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the par-three 17th, Love said a camera snapped on his backswing and 
he jerked the shot into a bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the ball found the sand, however, Love swung around and pointed a 
finger at a Japanese photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was angry then and I'm angry now," Love said.

TROJANS RUN INTO FIRED-UP COUGARS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC IS OUTPLAYED FROM 
START TO FINISH IN 89-59 ROUT BY A WASHINGTON STATE TEAM DESPERATE FOR VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On second thought, maybe a boycott would have been a good thing for USC. 
</P>
<P>
 A fired-up Washington State team dominated the Trojans in every phase of the 
game, turning a 19-point halftime lead into an 89-59 romp Saturday at Friel 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably the make or break Pacific 10 Conference game for the Cougars, 
11-5 overall, 1-3 in the Pac-10, who were coming off a heartbreaking 81-79 loss 
to UCLA on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 There was no doubt which team came to play, even though it was a 12-12 game 
early before freshman point guard Dominic Ellison ignited a 12-0 run that put 
the Cougars in complete charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison, a teammate of Trojan freshman Stais Boseman at Inglewood High, had 
extra incentive. He seethed because USC didn't recruit him. When the rout was 
on, he ran by the Trojan bench a couple of times shouting, "See, see." 
</P>
<P>
 Although George Raveling said the Trojans (10-3, 3-1) were outplayed in all 
aspects of the game, they still made a second-half run. Brandon Martin, who had 
a career-high 23 points, scored seven in a row as the Trojans cut the deficit 
to 56-45 with 10:35 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eddie Hill, a senior from Reseda, made a three-point basket in what turned 
out to be a five-point play. Lorenzo Orr was called for an elbowing foul as the 
ball went through the net and David Vik made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "That five-point turnaround ended our chances," Raveling said. "It was even 
more than that, because it cost us a possession and a chance at two or three 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, as they did against Washington on Thursday, shot poorly. Except 
for Martin, who was nine for 19, the Trojans were only 11 for 37 and most of 
those baskets were from in close. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem may be that Burt Harris and Damaine Powell aren't playing 
well at the point guard position. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said he didn't recruit Ellison because he had two point guards and 
somebody would be unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison is benefiting by the presence of veteran guards Hill and Tony Harris. 
Last season when the Trojans had three senior guards, Harris played well. But 
now the point guards have to take charge of an inexperienced team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans lost at Pullman by 22 points last year and Raveling, who coached 
here before going to USC, said it happens every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why it is," Raveling said, "but we never play well here. Even 
when we had Harold (Miner) and went to the NCAA, we were whipped badly here." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson was still upset about the officiating 
late in the loss to UCLA and some of his anger appeared to rub off on his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 They came out ready to play and responded to USC's challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-pointer by Martin to tie the score, 12-12, Ellison made a basket 
and two free throws and the Cougars outscored the Trojans, 14-1. The Trojans 
went almost six minutes without a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, USC's Claude Green made a three-pointer that triggered a 
9-0 Washington State run led by Ellison's four points. 
</P>
<P>
 A second-half three-pointer by Martin was answered by a 12-0 Cougar run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars shot 50.8% and were led by senior center Fred Ferguson, who scored 
18 points on seven-for-seven shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans sat in the fog-shrouded Seattle airport for six hours Friday, but 
Raveling said it had no bearing on the outcome. He also said the commotion 
about whether the game would be played because of a possible boycott by the 
Black Coaches Assn. was immaterial.

UCLA WOMEN SURGE LATE, BUT LOSE TO WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA women's basketball team dug itself a first-half hole and almost 
climbed out of it in the home stretch before losing to visiting Washington, 
86-81, Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (11-2), rebounding from its 81-71 loss at USC Thursday, is 3-1 in 
the Pacific 10 Conference.UCLA slipped to 7-6, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's second-half charge was led by Natalie Williams, who had 20 points and 
17 rebounds; Amy Jalewalia, who tied her career high with 28 points, and Detra 
Lockhart, who had a career-high 13 assists.  
</P>
<P>
 But it all went for naught as UCLA never solved the Huskies' outside shooting 
(they had seven three-pointers) and their defense. Washington forced 26 UCLA 
turnovers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Their defense got to us in the first half -- they put us in a hole and we 
never quite got out," UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Washington will be in the conference race all the way because of that 
defense; they really have good motion and on-ball pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, after building a 38-31 halftime lead, never lost the advantage in 
the second half, but UCLA several times came close. Zrinka Kristich's follow 
shot at 6:31 put the Bruins within one, 69-68. Williams, with 28 seconds left, 
put UCLA within two, 82-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Laura Gonsalves seemed to ice it with two free throws with 17 
seconds left, at 84-80.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams' fourth foul with 8:08 to play hurt UCLA down the stretch. Washington 
post player Rhonda Smith, who had no points in the first half, finished with 
20.

<P>
 For once, Nolan Richardson was happy that his Arkansas players didn't listen 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversy surrounding a proposed walkout by the Black Coaches 
Assn., No. 4-ranked Arkansas went about its business and beat Auburn, 117-105, 
Saturday at Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was a coming-out party for us," the Razorback coach said. "It's been a 
long week with all of the talk about the BCA, and I am certainly part of that. 
And that's not about basketball totally."

reinstate a 14th scholarship.

86-79, with 10:02 to play, but they scored four consecutive baskets to take an

</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a tough seven days during which the Razorbacks lost their

 Stevin Smith made a 42-foot shot at the buzzer Saturday at Tempe, Ariz., 
giving Arizona State a 63-60 victory over No. 19 California. The Sun Devils 
rallied from 12 points down in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiebreaking shot, which came with Cal starters Jason Kidd, Ryan Jamison 
and Monty Buckley on the bench after fouling out, ended an eight-game winning 
streak by Cal, 10-3 overall and 3-1 in the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Riley scored 21 points for Arizona State (7-5, 2-1), Mario Bennett had 15 
points and 11 rebounds and Smith finished with 11 points -- all in the second 
half and all but two on three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond Murray had 22 points and 13 rebounds for Cal. Buckley scored 13 points 
and Kidd had 11 rebounds, 10 assists and seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray tied it, 60-60, with two free throws with 4.6 seconds to play, setting 
the stage for Smith's dash down court. He shot right after crossing midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears led, 26-22, at halftime and opened a 45-33 lead with 11:57 to play 
after an 8-0 run capped with a dunk by Buckley off an assist by Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Arizona 89, Stanford 72 -- With defensive traps limiting the Cardinal to 
seven baskets in the first half, the Wildcats built a 30-point lead before 
squandering much of it at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Stoudamire scored 21 points and backcourt mate Khalid Reeves had 20 for 
Arizona (13-2, 2-1), which regrouped after an 98-93 overtime loss to Cal on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire's bank shot put Arizona up, 78-48, with 9:47 to play, but the 
Wildcats then turned cold. The Cardinal (9-4, 2-2) went on a 22-5 run during 
which Dion Cross scored nine points and pulled to 83-70. Stoudamire returned 
and made a three-point play to rescue Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has lost 12 consecutive times to Arizona, eight in a row at McKale 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon 74, Oregon State 64 -- Junior college transfer Darryl Parker scored a 
career-high 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as the Ducks withstood a late 
rally by the Beavers at Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks (5-7, 1-2) jumped out to a 27-11 lead, going ahead by as many as 21 
points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers (4-8, 0-3) rallied late in the second half, cutting the Ducks' 
lead to 70-64 on a jump shot by junior forward Kareem Anderson with 1:02 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 After a jump ball gave Oregon State possession, Brent Barry missed a 
three-pointer and Parker scored on a breakaway dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The game ended as Parker stole the ball in the Beavers' backcourt and fed Jeff 
Potter for the final basket with only one second remaining.

IRVINE IS TURNED INSIDE OUT IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So much for the inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine Coach Rod Baker, in attempt to revive his team's sagging offense, 
said the Anteaters were going to re-emphasize their inside attack. But Saturday 
night they ended up out in the cold and lost to Nevada, 98-85, in front of 
5,393 at the Lawlor Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as if every time Irvine attempted to jam the ball underneath, the 
Wolf Pack ended up with it and seconds later were jamming it in the hoop on the 
other end of the court. That, and a five-minute, second-half drought when 
Nevada outscored the Anteaters, 20-0, were plenty enough to drop Irvine to 4-7 
and 1-2 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure we got the kind of effort inside we needed to make good things 
happen," Baker said. "And we threw the ball around as if we were running a 
dummy offense with no defenders on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the inside guys didn't play well and maybe the players on the point 
made some ill-advised passes. But hey, how about those perimeter people? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our wings didn't do a very good job of getting back on transition defense," 
Baker said. "My first impression is that we didn't guard anybody very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, bad offense plus bad defense equals bad loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine turned over the ball 13 times in the first half, but the Anteaters' 
long-range offense was on target and they trailed at the intermission by only 
two points (47-45), thanks to 10 first-half three-pointers. But the Wolf Pack 
(6-7, 2-3) had 14 points on breakaway dunks or layups after Anteater turnovers 
and the tone was set for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine took a 66-65 lead with 10:26 left on a free throw by LaDay Smith, but 
then Nevada's Walter Outlaw -- who scored 15 of his 17 points in the second 
half -- scored on a breakaway jam; Jerry Hogan hit a three-pointer, and Jimmy 
Moore made an old-fashioned three-point play (layup and free throw) to put the 
Wolf Pack ahead, 72-66, with 8:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty seconds later, the only thing left in doubt was whether Nevada would 
score 100. Preston Johnson, who was six of 11 from three-point range and 
finished with a game-high 20 points, was fouled by Chris Brown on a three-point 
attempt. He made the first two free throws. Outlaw grabbed the rebound when he 
missed the third and fired it back to Johnson, who nailed another three-pointer 
that also nailed down the victory in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that only a five-point play?" Baker asked. "It seemed like 12." 
</P>
<P>
 For everything Nevada did right, Irvine did something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 No Points: Baker called timeout to try to stop the onslaught, but the 
resulting play was an out-of-control drive by Lloyd Mumford and a pass that 
Smith and Mark Odsather fought over before dropping out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Points: Johnson drilled a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 No Points: The Anteaters couldn't get a shot off in the allotted 35 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Points: Eathan O'Bryant, who tied a school record with 16 assists, went all 
the way to the basket for a layup, was fouled and made the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 No Points: Odsather put up an air ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Points: Joe Hannon fouled Outlaw, who made one of two free throws to give 
Nevada an 86-66 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a heck of a fast run," Nevada Coach Pat Foster said. "In that stretch, 
we did some great things offensively. At times, we were lethargic on defense, 
but not during that stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a depressing loss for Irvine, a team that has known its share of 
disappointment in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just a little out of sync," Irvine's DeForrest Boyer said. "We had a 
lot of mental breakdowns. Guys hesitated getting back on defense. Some nights 
it just isn't going to be there for you, but it was real frustrating. When they 
started scoring on all those fast breaks, it starts messing with your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Brown (five three-pointers) and Todd Whitehead (four) led the Irvine 
attack with 17 points each. Starting power forward Jermaine Avie and Boyer 
combined for 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards Outlaw and Moore combined for 21 rebounds as Nevada dominated the 
boards, 50-40. 
</P>
<P>

TITANS HOLD MEETING AFTER LOSING TO AGGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five minutes after Cal State Fullerton lost again, this time at Utah State, 
59-50, Coach Brad Holland could be heard screaming behind the closed locker 
room door. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes passed. Twenty. The game officials emerged from their locker room 
across the hall, showered and packed. Still no Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 25 minutes after the game ended that the first Titan gingerly 
poked his head out of the locker room. And then one by one, the Titans (2-10, 
0-4) walked out of the locker room and toward what's left of the rest of their 
season, lips tight and faces grim. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game they could have won, the Titans managed season lows in points, 
points in a half (17, first half), field-goal percentage (31.8%), rebounds (22) 
and offensive rebounds (five). It was the lowest point total for the Titans 
since a 76-47 whipping at Nevada Las Vegas in 1992. It was their lowest-scoring 
half since a 16-point first half in a 41-37 loss at New Mexico State in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Their morale was at a season-low, too. After the Titans boarded the bus, 
Holland stayed in the locker room, with assistant Bob Hawking and walk-on Fred 
Amos for another 15 minutes. Guard Danny Robinson wandered back into the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting kind of hungry, man," Robinson said to assistant coach Chris 
Brazier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you go in and tell Coach," Brazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nooo," came the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would blame Robinson? Holland and forward Winston Peterson (11 points, 
four rebounds) had words on the bench during a timeout at the three-minute 
mark, with Utah State leading, 47-39, and the game slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 And Holland, Hawking and Amos didn't emerge from the locker room until 45 
minutes after the final buzzer. When they did, Holland headed straight for the 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a team meeting, no comment," Holland said, never breaking stride. "We 
had a team meeting, no comment. Sorry, that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, Darren Little and James French, who failed to score a field goal for 
the first time this season, also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, Peterson and Little opened up a little -- barely. Peterson 
confirmed he and Holland exchanged words on the bench. "Yeah, a little bit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little confirmed that nobody would have wanted to be in that post-game locker 
room unless they had to be there. "All I've got to say is there was some heat 
in there," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Utah State 7-footer Nathan Wickizer putting in only six first-half points 
and then leaving with a sprained ankle with 18 minutes to play in the second, 
the Titans seemed in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 They pulled to within two, 39-37, when David Frigout hit an inside shot with 
6:33 to play, but the Aggies (6-7, 3-2) held them to two points in the next 
four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 And this Utah State team shot only 44% -- 32% in the first half, with only 20 
points at the half and 18 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a team we could definitely have beaten," said Greg Vernon (10 
points), who called this Fullerton's lowest point of the season. "We were only 
down by three at halftime and we were pumped up. We should have been up by 10 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this victory as much as any victory. It (would have been) a road 
victory, and it's hard to win on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "This probably was our worst loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon said that after Holland spoke in the locker room, he gave the players a 
say to vent their frustrations. And there were plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a team meeting to express our feelings," Vernon said, "to get the 
steam out." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton led by one point on four occasions, the final time a 27-26 advantage 
with 12:23 to play after Peterson muscled up an inside shot. But with Wickizer 
out, Eric Franson and Jon Wickizer, Nathan's brother, took over. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of 6,847, Franson finished with a game-high 18 points -- 12 in the 
second half -- and Jon Wickizer had 12 -- eight in the second half. And the 
Aggie fans spent the final minute chanting "Warm up the bus" at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing left for the Titans -- who lost their 12th consecutive game 
here -- was hunger pangs while they waited for their frustrated coach. Titan 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Brad Holland said Brian Carlson, who joined the team as a walk-on at the 
semester break, will be a redshirt this season.

 So much for the inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine Coach Rod Baker, in attempt to revive his team's sagging offense, 
said the Anteaters were going to re-emphasize their inside attack, but once 
again they ended up out in the cold, losing to Nevada, 98-85, before 5,393 at 
the Lawlor Events Center on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada outscored the Anteaters, 20-0, in a five-minute span of the second-half 
as Irvine fell to 4-7 overall and 1-2 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure we got the kind of effort inside we needed to make good things 
happen," Baker said. "And we threw the ball around as if we were running a 
dummy offense with no defenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine committed 13 turnovers in the first half, but its outside offense was 
on target and it trailed by only 47-45 thanks to 10 first-half three-pointers. 
But the Wolf Pack (6-7, 2-3) had 14 points on breakaway dunks or layups after 
Anteater turnovers and the tone was set for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada's Preston Johnson had 20 points. Chris Brown and Todd Whitehead led 
Irvine with 17. JOHN WEYLER

LOYOLA FADES IN LATE GOING AGAIN, 74-58 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After watching his team fade in the stretch for the second night in a row, 
Loyola Marymount Coach John Olive acknowledged that the Lions' nerves are 
wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are very frustrated, and so am I," Olive said."But none of us are 
going to give in to it. We've got to keep refining what we do to play better at 
the end of games." 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident again Saturday after Santa Clara used a 14-2 run to pull away 
for a 74-58 West Coast Conference victory at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, Loyola (1-12, 0-2) blew a 16-point lead in the second half in 
an 82-77 loss to St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive said fatigue played a part in both losses. The Lions are down to nine 
scholarship players because of injuries and ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think we're tired," he said. "That's no excuse. Both teams 
played (Friday) night, but we're a little undermanned." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara (9-5, 2-0), which was coming off a 54-51 victory over Pepperdine, 
took a 39-28 halftime lead. Freshman forward Drew Zurek gave the Broncos a lift 
off the bench, scoring 13 of his career-best 17 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Wyking Jones led Loyola with 17 points and 15 rebounds. ROB FERNAS

PEPPERDINE STYMIES ST. MARY'S EARLY, 81-61

<P>
 Going into Saturday night's game, Pepperdine had defeated St. Mary's 10 
consecutive times in West Coast Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves led by as many as 30 points and coasted to an 81-61 victory before 
3,104 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed a little more resiliency tonight," Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not going to be sure if we've worked out the kinks until we have a 
close game." 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling most of the way in its conference-opening loss to Santa Clara 
on Friday, Pepperdine, 9-5 overall and 1-1 in the conference, took control 
early against St. Mary's (8-5, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves went on an 18-0 run early in the first half and led by 35-19 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine was led in the half by point guard Bryan Parker, who scored nine 
points on three three-point baskets although he went scoreless in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaels (8-5, 1-1) hurt themselves in the first half by making 14 turnovers 
and sinking only 36.4% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't fault our defense," Asbury said. "It's been a good defensive team. 
This team has played as well from a set defense as any team I've coached in my 
15 years here." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine had four players score in double figures, led by forward Dana Jones 
with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Johnson had 18 points to lead the Gaels, who committed 21 turnovers and 
shot 38%.

 San Jose State quarterback Jeff Garcia threw three fourth-quarter touchdown 
passes and ran for the decisive two-point conversion, rallying the West to a 
29-28 victory Saturday in the East-West Shrine Game at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who ran for the conversion with 47 seconds to play, was chosen 
co-offensive player -- along with East quarterback Jay Fielder of Dartmouth -- 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The East led, 28-7, at the end of three quarters, but the West narrowed the 
gap with the first two fourth-quarter touchdown passes by Garcia, who finished 
with 22 completions in 32 attempts for 266 yards. Winter Sports

DIGEST: MOORPARK QUARTERBACK PRESTON OPTS FOR CINCINNATI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark College quarterback Todd Preston said Saturday he has orally 
committed to play football at the University of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston, a 1991 graduate of Westlake High, said he chose the Bearcats over 
Memphis State and Eastern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking for a quarterback and I felt that was going to be the best 
place for me," Preston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston accepted a scholarship to California after high school. He redshirted 
there for a season before returning to play at Moorpark. As the starter for the 
Raiders last season, he completed 102 of 219 passes for 1,651 yards and 19 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Former El Camino Real High running back Jamal Anderson scored two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns Saturday, helping the West rally from a 21-point 
deficit to a 29-28 victory in the East-West Shrine game in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who played at Moorpark College on his way to the University of Utah, 
caught an eight-yard touchdown pass with 47 seconds left, pulling the West to 
within 28-27. Quarterback Jeff Garcia then ran up the middle for a two-point 
conversion that gave the West its winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also caught a one-yard scoring pass from Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the only passes Anderson caught and he also carried the ball eight 
times for 48 yards. Basketball  
</P>
<P>
 Hart High's boys' basketball team, ranked No. 1 in the area by The Times with 
an 18-1 record and 15-game winning streak, might be limping down the stretch 
with injuries to two key players. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Valenzuela, a 6-foot-4 senior starting forward, has strained ligaments 
in the thumb of his shooting hand and is questionable for Tuesday's game 
against Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 More devastating, however, is the off-court hand injury suffered by sixth man 
Adam Dover. Dover, a 6-5, 205-pound senior who sat out last season, recently 
severed three tendons and a nerve in his left hand with a vegetable knife. The 
injury required three hours of surgery. Dover is lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who's come a long way in three months," said Hart Coach Mike May 
of Dover, the team's most physical player, "and it's really going to hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dover was averaging five rebounds a game. JEFF FLETCHER and DANA HADDAD

PREP WRESTLING / FIVE COUNTIES INVITATIONAL; CALVARY CHAPEL DOMINATES FINAL 
MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's getting to the point where people will stop scoring Calvary Chapel 
wrestlers and start timing them instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory isn't so much the question as is how fast the Eagles will clinch it, 
as evidenced by their overwhelming performance Saturday night in the 
championship of the Five Counties Invitational at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel placed six wrestlers in the finals -- four more than any other 
team -- and five won individual championships en route to the Eagles' team 
title, where they outscored their closest competition by legions. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending State champion Calvary Chapel, which finished third here in 1993, 
scored 214 1/2 points to runner-up Canyon Springs' 125 1/2, the largest margin 
of victory since Shawnee, Okla., defeated Capistrano Valley by 101 points in 
1988, and the second most points -- Clovis West scored 223 1/2 in 1983 -- in 
the tournament's 28-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles saw this competition as a testing ground, not their playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lets us know what kind of competition there will be at the State meet," 
Calvary Chapel Coach John Azevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Holiday, who pulled out a last-second victory for the 145-pound title, 
agreed: "This shows us how we're doing in California." 
</P>
<P>
 With victories over the state's top-two ranked wrestlers, Holiday's doing 
fine. He made it five for five for Calvary Chapel when he scored on an escape 
with three seconds remaining to take an 8-7 decision in his match against 
Clovis' Kyle Swan, No. 1 in the State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to go for (the escape) earlier," he said. "I looked over at my 
coaches and I knew I had to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Eagle who didn't win a title was Ed Mosley at 152, who lost, 7-5, in 
overtime to Jim Kutz of Roseburg, Ore. Mosley's only other loss of the season 
came at the hands of the same wrestler -- Oregon's defending state champion -- 
at the Sierra Nevada tournament, where Kutz won, 6-4, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have liked to see Mosley win, but overall, it was awesome, and we 
came out of it with no injuries," Azevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners for Calvary Chapel were Joe Calavitta (103), who fell behind 
early before he won, 6-5; easy winners Shane Valdez (119) and Dane Valdez (125) 
and Mauricio Mora (135), a 9-5 winner over Vince Virgen of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 At 140, David Wells of El Modena lost, 4-3, to Madera's Moises Perez on a late 
takedown by Perez, and heavyweight Wally Sibrie of Buena Park and Greg Ford of 
Whittier went scoreless into the third period before Ford scored for the 2-0 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nogales Super Champion wrestling tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills wrestlers finish in top three -- Laguna Hills' Jeff Greco, Kevin 
Ely and David Yarbrough placed among the top three in their respective 
divisions. The fourth-ranked Hawks placed third in team competition and Sunny 
Hills fourth in the 37-team tournament.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL; BREA-OLINDA HAS EDGE ON CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Jody Anton's jumper with about 12 seconds left gave Brea-Olinda 
a two-point victory over Capistrano Valley in the championship game of the 
Irvine tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no need for Jody Anton on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, ranked fifth in the nation and seeking respite against an Orange 
League schedule that offers little challenge, used the Cougars as a whetstone 
to sharpen their game in a 72-31 nonleague victory at Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the fun games to play," said Brea's Nicole Erickson, The Times 
Orange County player of the year in 1993. "The better the competition, the 
better we play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats had runs of 10, 13 and 13 points, forced 29 turnovers, allowed 
the Cougars to get off only 35 shots and make only eight. 
</P>
<P>
 They held Susan Scott (averaging 24.5 points) without a field goal until she 
made a three-pointer with 1.2 seconds left in the third quarter. Scott had a 
team-high 14 -- including nine free throws. They held Jennifer Garrett 
(averaging 12.5 rebounds) to two points and two rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 They did pretty much what they wanted. Colleen Hudson scored 20 points, Nicole 
Erickson 19 and Lee Moulin 16. Kiyoko Miller added nine. 
</P>
<P>
 But most importantly, Brea got an opportunity to stretch itself against a team 
outside the Orange League. The three-time defending State champions have taken 
this tack -- playing decent county teams in midseason -- to keep from getting 
stale. 
</P>
<P>
 "These games are very important for us," said Erickson, who had six steals and 
three three-point baskets. "Even in a game like this, we were sloppy in the 
first half and had a lot of turnovers. This gives us some reality. We lose our 
edge a little bit (even though) this year we've done our best job of keeping up 
our level of play during league." 
</P>
<P>
 Most teams would love to have Brea's edge, even its dull one. The Ladycats may 
have committed four turnovers in the first quarter and five in the second, but 
they forced nine Capistrano Valley turnovers in each of the first two quarters. 
Brea turned the ball over only three times in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 It's safe to say the Ladycats judge themselves on a different level than most 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We focus on how we play, not who we play," Brea Coach John Hattrup said of 
being stuck in the Orange League, which Brea's junior varsity might win. "When 
we play these (midseason nonleague) games, we play them like (the playoffs). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what keeps us in shape for CIF. We consider these playoff games. 
That's why we schedule them, so we stay in shape for the playoffs. These are 
CIF final or semifinal types of teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley played for the Division I-AA title last year. El Dorado -- 
last week's 84-37 victim -- reached the III-AA semifinals. Next Saturday, Brea 
plays host to Mater Dei, which is ranked fourth in Orange County and fifth in 
the Southern Section's Division I poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hattrup said the Orange League serves its purpose, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition level is different," Hattrup said, ". . . but everyone gets 
to play, everyone gets a chance to score. Not every league can have four or 
five good teams in its league. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to realize this is a once-in-a-lifetime type of team. After this 
season, we're not going to be fifth in the nation. This is a special group. It 
doesn't matter who's coaching this group."

 They were teammates and roommates at the University of Maine, and their bond 
grew stronger when goaltenders Mike Dunham and Garth Snow joined Team USA in 
preparation for the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 That friendship will endure, they say, no matter which is chosen to start in 
the Olympic opener Feb. 12 in Lillehammer. And while Dunham was once the sure 
choice, his monthlong slump, coupled with Snow's strong play since returning 
from a call-up with the NHL's Quebec Nordiques, makes that choice anything but 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how he feels, because I struggled in August," Snow said after making 
40 saves in Team USA's 5-2 victory over Team Canada, played before a sellout 
crowd of 16,215 at McNichols Arena. "We'll get through this. At the same time, 
who's to say we're going to go with one goalie all the way through, that we're 
not going to alternate? It's a coaching decision and we'll live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow gave up two goals in the first 5:20 but frustrated Team Canada (25-20-3) 
the rest of the way to earn his 11th victory and reduce his goals-against 
average to 3.15. He has won both of his starts since rejoining Team USA. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Dunham has given up 23 goals in his last three games and lost all 
three. In the last six weeks, his goals-against average has gone up almost a 
goal, to 3.75, and his save percentage has plummeted to .871. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Tim Taylor hasn't decided whether to stick with one goalie or to 
alternate the two. "The idea is to play the hot goaltender and if that works 
with the team chemistry, go with that," Taylor said. "If I start a goalie and 
he has a great game and I feel I should come back with him, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow outplayed his Canadian counterpart, Corey Hirsch, as Team USA improved 
its record to 34-15-5. Canada's top line of Chris Kontos, Petr Nedved and Paul 
Kariya was blanked, though the trio produced many good chances. Kariya, drafted 
fourth overall by the Mighty Ducks last June, left the game with 17 seconds to 
play after being cut above the left eye by Brett Hauer's stick, but he was not 
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Campbell, John Lilley, Ian Moran, Darby Hendrickson and Todd Martin scored 
for Team USA.

 Robert Reichel scored three goals, and rookie Andrei Trefilov posted his 
second consecutive shutout as the Calgary Flames beat the hapless Ottawa 
Senators, 10-0, Saturday night at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichel scored twice in the first nine minutes, and the Flames led, 3-0, after 
the first period. After scoring four goals in the second period, the only drama 
that remained was to see whether Trefilov could hold on for the shutout. The 
goaltender made 21 saves, running his shutout streak to 122 minutes 21 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, Quebec 0 -- Steve Konowalchuk scored his first two goals of the 
season and Don Beaupre made 24 saves for his first shutout at Quebec, sending 
the Nordiques to their sixth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques have been shut out in three of their last five games and have 
scored only eight goals in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Montreal 2 -- Newcomer Bob Kudelski scored his first goal for the 
Panthers and assisted on another to lift Florida at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers have two victories and a tie against the Stanley Cup champions 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 2, Buffalo 1 -- Curtis Joseph made 32 saves and Brendan Shanahan and 
Craig Janney scored to lead the Blues at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabres outshot the Blues, 33-20, but scored only once in seven power-play 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, Chicago 5 -- Travis Green's fluke goal with 6:45 to play 
in regulation capped the second comeback in the game for the Islanders, earning 
them a tie at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Green had the puck behind the net and purposely banked it off the back of the 
leg of Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour for his 11th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, Boston 2 -- Ray Sheppard scored the first goal and assisted on the 
decisive one as the surging Red Wings beat the slumping Bruins at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Red Wings an 8-2-1 record over the last 11 games. The 
Bruins, playing without injured Cam Neely and Adam Oates, lost their fourth 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, Edmonton 3 -- Larry Murphy scored 17 seconds after Edmonton's 
tying goal, giving the Penguins the victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rice had tied the score with a third-period power-play goal before 
Murphy's shot from the right point deflected in off Edmonton defenseman Dave 
Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 5, Winnipeg 1 -- Nik Borschevsky scored twice to lead the Maple Leafs 
to their sixth consecutive victory at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto (27-14-7) improved to 61 points, best in the NHL. The New York Rangers 
(28-12-3), with 59 points, have one more victory but have played five fewer 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 8, Hartford 2 -- The Sharks scored three goals in both the second and 
third periods to lift them past the Whalers at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Igor Larionov scored a hat trick, giving him 11 goals this season.

THE BENEFITS AND SIDE EFFECTS OF HEALTH INDUSTRY MERGERS; TREND: MORE THAN $1.4 
BILLION IN DEALS HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED INVOLVING O.C. COMPANIES, REFLECTING A 
BIGGER-IS-BETTER PHILOSOPHY. 
</P>

 Wescott (Bill) Price III says he knows a good deal when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he began searching for an acquisition target to help his health 
maintenance organization expand into new, potentially lucrative regions, the 
chief executive officer of FHP International Inc. in Fountain Valley rejected 
candidate after candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he found what he believed to be a gem of a deal: TakeCare Inc. in 
Concord. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern California HMO had what it took for Price to jump into the health 
care industry's merger and acquisition frenzy. It had an efficient management 
team; it had a solid presence in Northern California and in Colorado and the 
Midwest, where FHP has no members. Best of all, Price was well-acquainted with 
TakeCare Chairman Jack R. Anderson and President R. Judd Jessup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a perfect match," Price said last week after announcing a $62-a-share 
bid to buy TakeCare, a deal valued at $829 million. "We had been talking about 
it for some time, and we felt there was a smart fit here. It really puts us in 
a strong competitive position." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, today's health care industry is more than a buyer's market -- it's a 
survivor's market. 
</P>
<P>
 As politicians prepare to negotiate the final version of the National Health 
Plan, industry executives are trying to position their companies for success in 
what will become an increasingly competitive marketplace. A flurry of 
consolidations last year is expected to snowball in 1994, with more than $1.4 
billion in deals already announced involving Orange County companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have praised FHP's decision to buy TakeCare, calling it an ingenious 
strategic move that would thrust the company into the nation's top five HMOs 
and move it far ahead of its closest competitor, PacifiCare Health Systems 
Inc., to take the No. 2 spot in California behind HMO giant Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and health experts suggest rivals such as PacifiCare, Maxicare Health 
Plans of Los Angeles and United Healthcare Corp. of Minnesota cannot afford to 
take the proposed FHP acquisition -- the most expensive in the industry's 
history -- for granted. They said that although FHP's proposed merger came as a 
surprise, no one was shocked at the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we are getting to the point where not much is a surprise anymore," 
said Mary O'Connell, a health analyst with brokerage Louis Nicoud & Associates 
in San Francisco. "The ante has really been raised." 
</P>
<P>
 FHP is the latest example of an evolving health industry in which providers, 
drug manufacturers and medical device distributors are following a 
bigger-is-better philosophy: seeking greater economies of scale to cope with 
anticipated cost constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County companies have been at the heart of this push to consolidate. 
Among those on a buying binge: 
</P>
<P>
 * Newport Beach nursing home operator Regency Health Services Inc. announced 
in December that it was merging with Tustin competitor Care Enterprises in a 
$120-million stock swap that would create the state's largest chain of nursing 
homes and rehabilitation hospitals. That came after Regency bought 13 nursing 
homes earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * McGaw Inc. in Irvine, a supplier of intravenous solutions and pumps, last 
month agreed to sell itself to Miami-based generic drug maker IVAX Corp. for 
about $600 million. Company officials said the merged company would broaden 
both firms' product lines and become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abbey Healthcare Group Inc., the Costa Mesa-based home health care company 
that lost a bidding war for a Boston competitor in March, ultimately purchased 
31 home health agencies across the nation last year -- including the 
$195-million purchase of Total Pharmaceutical Care Inc. of Torrance. The 
company, which spent more than $250 million on acquisitions in 1993, hopes to 
become America's largest home health care provider by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * PacifiCare, the Cypress-based HMO, purchased California Dental Health Plan 
of Tustin in September, giving it an edge over several competitors by offering 
a broader range of health and dental services to employers. PacifiCare, which 
in 1992 began socking away cash for acquisitions, also recently announced its 
intention to purchase Advantage Health Plans Inc. of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wellpoint Inc., a Woodland Hills HMO, announced plans to purchase 
Irvine-based UniCare Financial Corp. to create what the companies called a 
"seamless package" of health care and workers' compensation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidations among health maintenance organizations should continue because 
these prepaid, lower-cost providers are expected to virtually take over all 
care for Americans under health reform. Fewer than 10 million Americans would 
be outside the anticipated system of managed competition and HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe very strongly that the health reform process that is going on is 
forcing providers to form new relationships," said Don White, a spokesman for 
Group Health Assn. of America, a Washington-based HMO industry organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has passed for new players to enter the HMO industry, said White, 
adding that many of those in business today may not be around in the near 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference will be that the companies (that survive consolidation) will 
be much stronger," White said. "But even they will have to go through some more 
restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger F. Greaves, chairman of Health Net Inc. of Woodland Hills, said he 
believes companies joining forces would be "definitely good for the public" 
because greater size should lead to increased efficiencies and, ultimately, 
lower costs to members and their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Greaves' company announced a merger with Qual-Med Inc. in Pueblo, 
Colo., that would create a company with $1.8 billion in annual revenue. By 
comparison, the FHP-TakeCare deal would result in nearly 1.6 million members 
and $3.5 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net and Qual-Med's merger negotiations have hit a snag. A jury recently 
awarded $89.1 million to a Health Net member suffering from breast cancer who 
claimed that she was denied medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greaves also blames the delay on the sheer complexity of putting two 
multimillion-dollar health care companies together. He said such a 
consolidation process is traumatic, even when the partners seem to be a perfect 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield of California and UniHealth America in Burbank were two companies 
consumed by the complexity of consolidation. In June, the firms proposed a 
mega-merger, which would have created a $6.5-billion firm with 4.5 million 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger, which was welcomed enthusiastically by health care analysts and 
observers, fueled a major debate about the need for such consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between Blue Shield and UniHealth inevitably collapsed in November 
because of differences between managers on both sides about how to form the new 
corporation, said Blue Shield spokesman Mike Odom. Blue Shield officials also 
wanted to retain the Blue Shield name. UniHealth, a nonprofit corporation, was 
faced with ironing out legal issues involving its for-profit enterprises, 
including its PacifiCare subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consolidations of that magnitude are very complex," Odom said. "There are 
lots of details and issues that need to be negotiated. It doesn't always work 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Odom partly blamed extensive news coverage of the proposal for creating 
expectations that the two firms could not live up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways the media jumped on it right away as if it were a done deal," 
Odom said. "It was a difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for FHP and TakeCare, said Doug Sherlock, publisher of Pulse, an 
HMO newsletter in Philadelphia, is that the issues facing them are quite 
different from those that scuttled the UniHealth-Blue Shield deal. Both are 
for-profit companies. There are few geographic overlaps in membership and the 
companies' top managers are friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's two different cultures," Sherlock said. "They are not comparable. They 
won't have any problem at all completing the acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherlock said that, in the future, so-called "mixed model HMOs" will be the 
strongest in the industry. Mixed-model HMOs are those that provide a 
combination of company-owned hospitals and clinics operated by staff physicians 
along with networks of doctors who work under contract. FHP owns hospitals and 
clinics, while TakeCare contracts with medical centers and physician groups to 
provide care for its members. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal allows FHP to speed up its transition from a so-called staff-model 
HMO to a mixed-model operation, a move it began in earnest two years ago. By 
July, if approved, only half of FHP's doctors would be company employees, down 
from more than 65% of them today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues that are driving health care reform are also driving companies to 
change now," Sherlock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some corporate executives downplayed federal reform as the primary motive for 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think . . . people are running to do things in anticipation of what 
the government is going to do," said Richard Rapp, Abbey Healthcare's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey's strategy, Rapp said, it to make Abbey a "one-stop shopping" home 
health care company, providing clients with both medical equipment and nursing 
care. That strategy assumes that the home health care provider with the most 
services at the lowest cost will gain a lion's share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our acquisition strategy is simply a reaction to what is already going on in 
the business," Rapp said. "It's market driven." 
</P>
<P>
 FHP's Price agreed that shopping for corporations simply to hedge your bets is 
foolhardy and could be disastrous. FHP's acquisition was strategically designed 
to add significantly to its successful Senior Plan program for Medicare 
recipients, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had hoped for some time to expand its 300,000-member senior plan 
into Northern California and Colorado. But under federal law, an HMO needs to 
have a traditional member signed up for every Medicare recipient it hopes to 
bring into such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making an acquisition when you don't know what health care reform is all 
about is ridiculous, if that is all you are doing it for," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FHP-TakeCare proposal could lead to a bidding war for TakeCare's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's wealthy Hillman Family, which owns about 16% of TakeCare stock, 
maintains that a third HMO is set to outbid FHP. Neither the family nor 
officials of either company would identify the rival HMO or give details of the 
alleged counteroffer. Consequently, some analysts warn that FHP may have a 
rockier time than expected in concluding the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked, Price said that he is so sure of the synergy in his proposed 
acquisition that he will staunchly defend the deal by fighting whatever 
overtures are made by a competitor. It is, after all, a matter of corporate 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that whoever wants to step into this deal will have to do so under 
great peril," he said. Mergers: Health Care Trend

JAMES FLANIGAN: IT'S ALREADY TIME TO TAKE STOCK IN EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the focus of President Clinton's trip to Europe last week was on 
unfinished business from the Cold War -- the NATO alliance, nuclear armaments 
in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 But more revealing for the future, and perhaps surprising, is the fact that 
two heads of state who met with Clinton -- Presidents Lech Walesa of Poland and 
Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic -- preside over the fastest-growing 
economies in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish and Czech economies are small but their moderate success in 
adapting to a new world after half a century of war and Cold War offers 
insights on how totalitarian states can become market economies and how their 
future development will broaden or undermine the European Union in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Implications for U.S. policy and U.S. business are considerable. Economic 
success in Eastern Europe would deter the region from descending into 
Yugoslavia-style chaos and it would help Russia and the lands of the former 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Stability and security now "depend as much on economic conditions as on 
assurances against military threats" write former Defense Secretary Harold 
Brown and Charles Wolf Jr., director of RAND Corp., in a paper on the post-Cold 
War period. 
</P>
<P>
 The world is turned upside down in Europe today. Germany is in a deep 
recession that economists say will last through 1995. Volkswagen has gone to a 
four-day week to share out work; some of Germany's major companies are in 
financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's high wages, social benefits and taxes are blamed for sapping 
economic vitality. "Our social market system is bankrupt," declares Norbert 
Walter, chief economist of the Deutsche Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, East Europeans who work for less are getting the jobs. The Czech 
Republic's famed Skoda Works, now partly owned by Volkswagen, is working 
overtime to turn out a car that sells briskly for less than $5,000 in Germany 
and other countries. Its workers make roughly one-tenth the pay and benefits of 
Volkswagen's German employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech Republic is doing quite well, even though most of its products are 
formally shut out of the huge EU market. Following the split with Slovakia last 
year, it is now a country of 10.3 million people with a gross national product 
of $38.4 billion that is poised to grow 4% in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investors have poured $2.3 billion so far into ventures in Poland, 
according to J.P. Morgan & Co. Pepsico acquired a chocolate and cookie company 
and turned it into a local base for Frito-Lay. And Time Warner, Bertelsmann of 
Germany and a Luxembourg company are bidding for a commercial television 
channel. The Polish economy -- largest in Eastern Europe with 38 million people 
and a GNP of $70.6 billion -- may grow 5% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary, the other leading East European state, may have slower growth because 
EU restrictions hurt its agricultural exports. 
</P>
<P>
 How did these countries adapt to a competitive world in just a few years? They 
encouraged foreign investment but did so in an unusual way. They used stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech government handed its citizens vouchers of ownership in the state 
enterprises that were being privatized. Initially that seemed less than a 
brilliant idea, explains Charles Harman of Credit Suisse First Boston, who 
heads investment banking for Eastern Europe from offices in Prague and London. 
"Trading was nonexistent because while everyone had shares no one had money to 
buy other shares. But foreign investors came in, and it has developed into an 
active market with roughly $50 million a week in transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 And more to come. The Czech stock exchange has just qualified for investments 
by the emerging markets mutual funds that are sending so much U.S. investment 
around the world. "We anticipate an inflow," says Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 In Poland there is a very active stock market because the Poles have extra 
money thanks to remittances from Polish-Americans in the United States. That's 
also why a sizable consumer economy has developed in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake. Eastern Europe's fledgling economies are fragile and 
troubled. Inflation is a constant threat. In the Czech Republic it is now 12% a 
year, but in Poland it runs at 30% and more, says Susanne Gahler, the Morgan 
bank's chief economist for Eastern Europe. "Stock markets have helped with 
privatization," she says, "but much of the real work of restructuring 
industries for productivity remains to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern economies need markets, need access to the 12-nation European 
Union market specifically. But the EU has been unyielding in negotiations so 
far, maintaining restrictions against heavy machinery, textiles, agricultural 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later those restrictions will be relaxed. The East European states 
are like Mexico in one sense, developing economies on the border of a highly 
developed market. But East European education and skill levels allow them to 
turn out higher quality goods than most developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, history is on their side. For centuries before World War II, the lands 
that are now the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were principal suppliers of 
agriculture and industrial goods to Germany and central Europe. Now they're 
trying to re-establish historic patterns. And as their costs are compared to 
the swollen costs of EU Europe, the Easterners will get business. As German 
industry restructures, it will certainly use Eastern suppliers more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So the EU will either admit the East European states or dissolve itself in 
fractious internal disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is for a vibrant, enlarged market emerging in central Europe in 
this decade, with big opportunities for U.S. companies. And that future 
business could do for the next half century what NATO did for the postwar era 
now ended.

DISNEY? NIMBY!; SOME VIRGINANS DON'T WANT U.S. HISTORY PARK IN THEIR BACK YARDS 
</P>

<P>
 Amid the sanctuary of the sparsely settled northern Virginia countryside 40 
miles west of Washington, Walt Disney Co. has come to build an entertainment 
field of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 In what could become an important test of Disney's legendary business acumen 
-- not to mention its recently established Washington lobbying office -- the 
entertainment giant is waging a high-stakes battle to transform part of rural 
Haymarket into a multimillion-dollar, 1,200-acre historical theme park called 
Disney's America. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture comes as the Burbank-based company faces mounting financial woes 
at its Euro Disney theme park near Paris and doubts about its commitment to the 
planned $3-billion Disneyland Resort expansion in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 As development fights go, the battle in Haymarket could be epic. While 
Hollywood is no stranger to the Washington area, Disney may find that Virginia 
is a world apart. 
</P>
<P>
 In this state -- birthplace of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, home to 
historic Jamestown and Williamsburg and such landmarks as the Manassas Civil 
War battlefield national park near here -- Disney not only must face 
environmentalists and traffic foes, but also protectors of Virginia's storied 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, unlike Euro Disney or Florida's Walt Disney World, Disney's 
America would be built in the back yard of the national news media, with the 
prospect that every twist and turn of the project would receive national and 
even international attention. 
</P>
<P>
 As in France -- and Anaheim and Long Beach, where Disney has also talked 
recently about developing a huge project -- residents of this affluent northern 
Virginia outpost have given Disney a mixed reception. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Disney support group has sprung up, and several Virginia 
politicians -- including newly elected Republican Gov. George F. Allen -- have 
publicly embraced the park as a welcome economic boost. 
</P>
<P>
 But horse breeders, environmentalists and owners of big country estates off 
the remote gravel and dirt roads that bisect western Prince William County are 
bracing for a fight to preserve their rural lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us feel completely outraged," said Jim Price, head of the Prince 
William County anti-Disney group Protect. "We moved out here because we wanted 
a rural environment. The biggest insult is that the politicians are going to 
force us and the whole state of Virginia to pay for this. We are getting 
steamrolled by a development that will change this area forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The park represents a change for Disney as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the company's collection of fantasy- and animation-dominated 
theme parks, Disney's America would pay homage to American history and culture. 
The park would have amusement rides, high-tech interactive and "virtual 
reality" re-enactments of U.S. historical events -- such as Civil War combat -- 
as well as 1,300 hotel rooms and a 27-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Disney has asked for permission to eventually build 2,500 homes 
and 2 million square feet of office and retail space on the remaining 1,400 
acres it has purchased or optioned in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growth . . . is going to happen regardless of Disney," Tom Lewis, senior vice 
president of Disney Development Co., said at a recent news conference, where he 
downplayed the traffic the park would generate. "We believe we can be an 
important part of the solution to the transportation problem. We are not the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is gaining more experience than it might like in beating back 
opposition to its projects. The company has run afoul of local factions 
virtually everywhere it has gone. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Disney killed its proposed theme park at the Queen 
Mary in Long Beach when opposition cropped up from traffic-wary residents and 
environmentalists. A small but vocal group of Anaheim homeowners has been 
decrying the noise, dust and traffic impacts of the proposed $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort project. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has even caught flak in Florida. Environmentalists picketed the 
company's annual meeting last year, wearing turtle costumes to protest further 
development in the habitat of the endangered gopher tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Disney responded by creating a wilderness refuge and funding a 
study of tortoise respiratory tract disease. Elsewhere, the company has 
countered opponents with pledges that it would neither damage the environment 
nor create traffic snarls. 
</P>
<P>
 And Disney is quick to cite the taxes and jobs that would flow from its 
projects. About 2,000 workers would be employed during construction of Disney's 
America, and another 2,700 permanent positions would be created when it opened, 
now scheduled for sometime in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do what it takes to be a good neighbor in the county," said 
Mark Pacala, general manager for Disney's America. "It's in our interest to 
manage growth intelligently." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the park's 2,700 workers would not add to congestion because most of 
them would come from the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney pays its theme park workers an average of $5.65 an hour -- 33% above 
minimum wage, Pacala said. But the appetite for that kind of salary may be slim 
in a county that boasts an unemployment rate of 3.5% -- about half that of the 
rest of the nation -- and a median household income last year of $49,370, the 
19th-highest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Prince William County residents have a history of resisting 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, for example, residents enlisted support from as far away as 
Europe to defeat a developer's plans to build a regional shopping mall that 
would have created service jobs with pay comparable to what Disney would offer. 
Last fall, some residents cheered when Europe's Lego Group chose Carlsbad, 
Calif., over Prince William for its first American theme park. And some 
environmental and community groups in the area have begun organizing against a 
horse racing track and a large amphitheater proposed for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each major development now is touching a nerve in the public, and rightly 
so," said James Waggener, chairman of the Prince William Natural Resources 
Council, a nonprofit environmental group of about 60 residents that has not 
taken a position on Disney's proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to stand in the way of reasonable economic progress," Waggener 
said. "But people are beginning to look up and see that they are losing the 
green areas and open spaces that are important to their quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the talk, countywide support for Disney is difficult to gauge. 
Although several small and medium-sized groups have loudly protested Disney's 
plans, several others -- including the 3,000-member Coalition of Gainesville 
District Residents, one of the area's biggest citizen organizations -- remain 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in favor of Disney's park -- such as the Welcome Disney Committee, a 
30-member group dominated by local business executives -- say the development 
is preferable to encroaching suburban sprawl. That, they say, would do little 
to diversify the area's tax base and would eventually bring enough homes and 
automobiles to rival the pollution and traffic congestion any theme park would 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney will help provide the business needed to broaden our tax base," said 
Robert H. Singletary, head of the Welcome Disney Committee. "Disney will offer 
a better way of life for the working person and businesses of all kinds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the generic objections to growth, Disney also faces a uniquely 
Virginian concern that the company may trifle with the state's historical 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials have said the park will feature exhibits making phenomena 
such as slavery, the Civil War and the Depression "fun and exciting for the 
whole family." But its location will abut, among other landmarks, a 
historically black Prince William community called Thoroughfare. The area 
includes a pre-Civil War flour mill, a black church founded in 1865, an early 
segregated elementary school as well as cemeteries for slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do we have to have this hokey American history Disneyland, when we are 
living right here in the middle of real history?" asked Angus MacLean Thuermer, 
a retired federal employee who lives in Middleburg, Va., 10 miles from the 
proposed Disney park. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Vice President John Dreyer dismisses concerns that Disney will sully 
history or overlook existing landmarks in northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be a complement to the real history in the area," Dreyer said. 
"History is told in various formats. People write books about it, make movies 
about it. We are simply going to present it in a park. The sum total of all of 
this creates a greater knowledge of American history." 
</P>
<P>
 Since announcing its proposed park in November, Disney has moved to combat 
misgivings about the venture by waging an aggressive, behind-the-scenes 
lobbying campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert G. Marshall, a Republican state legislator who represents part of the 
Haymarket area, said he recently received a phone call from Disney Chairman 
Michael D. Eisner inviting him to a screening of "Sister Act 2," the Disney 
film comedy starring Whoopi Goldberg. Marshall, who said he is concerned about 
the environmental impact of Disney's proposed park and its potential cost to 
taxpayers, said he declined Eisner's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney also has courted area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arlington, Va., consulting firm Sheridan Group, for example, was one of 
scores of northern Virginia companies invited last month to meet with general 
manager Pacala and Peter S. Rummell, president of Disney Design and 
Development, to discuss the proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very surprised to receive the letter; we're not located anywhere near 
Prince William County," said Gretchen Chell, director of operations at Sheridan 
Group, which is located about 30 miles from Haymarket. "It just goes to show 
you how orchestrated their campaign is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pacala said his staff is holding a dozen meetings a week with business and 
community groups in northern Virginia. He also said Disney's Washington office 
-- headed by Richard M. Bates, former executive director of the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee -- has been enlisted in the lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have used him to make introductions to legislators on Capitol Hill," said 
Pacala -- among them Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) and Sens. Charles S. Robb 
(D-Va.) and John W. Warner (R-Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's efforts already are paying some dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince William County supervisors recently changed a zoning law to save Disney 
$400,000 of the customary $600,000 fee the county charges for a major rezoning 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people just rolled over for Disney," said Bobby McManus, the sole 
supervisor to vote against the fee reduction. The fee cut wasn't underhanded, 
she said; rather, the supervisor said she believes her colleagues simply were 
bowled over by Disney's charm and the promise of economic prosperity for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care anything about the real cost of all of this to taxpayers," 
McManus groused. 
</P>
<P>
 A few lawmakers, such as Charles J. Colgan, a Republican state legislator who 
represents the Haymarket area, say they believe the county should "spend some 
money to bring Disney here," granting the entertainment company tax and fee 
breaks. Gov. Allen shares that view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the press generally gives more attention to those that oppose 
things," Colgan added. "But this development will provide hundreds of young 
people with summer jobs and establish a broad new tax base for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some Haymarket landowners whose taxes stand to skyrocket if the Disney 
development boosts property values say they welcome the park -- although 
detractors say such owners also can be expected to cash in, selling their land 
to Disney or other deep-pocket developers that the park might attract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been straining to come up with something negative about this development 
and have been unable to come up with anything," said Steve Merkli, a longtime 
Haymarket resident whose home overlooks the proposed park. "I'm kind of in 
favor of advancement. I'm not a person who thinks we should remain in the 
1800s." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the park has intensified in recent days as Disney has released 
more details of its development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people are becoming concerned," said Ellen Penar, spokeswoman 
for the 3,000-member Gainesville coalition. "My phone has been ringing off the 
hook" since Disney submitted its rezoning application Jan. 5, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All agree that the next few weeks will be crucial ones for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's development proposal now must run the gauntlet of about 18 different 
local, state and federal departments and agencies, including an environmental 
impact review, a traffic study and even an analysis by the Federal Aviation 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to spend the next few weeks convincing the county citizens and 
all of the elected officials that this is a win-win-win partnership for us, the 
county and the state," Pacala said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to invest, today, over $650 million," the Disney executive 
explained. "That's how much we believe in our project. And when we get our 
story out in the next few months, I think folks will be convinced that the 
county and the people will see the tremendous benefit for their community." 
</P>
<P>

Remaking History 
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co.'s plans to build an American History theme park in the 
midst of heritage-rich northern Virginia have drawn a mixed response from 
prospective neighbors. Park site is located in Haymarket, Va.

SEX PLAY IN CYBERSPACE; O.C. FIRM'S CD-ROMS ARE EROTIC, INTERACTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The image of Stephanie, a busty blonde woman, invites you to touch the 
computer screen. You play the age-old game of scissors-stone-paper with her, 
tapping a menu on the screen to make your selection. You make your move, she 
makes hers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you win, she seductively unwraps a layer of clothing, writhing to 
striptease music. If you lose, she smirks and coos, "Try again." The playful 
experience is enhanced by the computer's video footage of the woman, her 
digital voice that plays in stereo and a computer-animated background 
resembling a science-fiction movie set. 
</P>
<P>
 This R-rated "Scissors N Stones"game is a glimpse of the interactive 
enticements that computers can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Pixis Interactive, a Tustin-based software company with 10 employees, says it 
has discovered that such adult entertainment -- stored on compact disks known 
as CD-ROMs with vast storage capacity for video, text, graphics and audio -- 
can add a whole new dimension to voyeurism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not passive viewing like TV or videos," said Mark Alamares, vice 
president of marketing for the 18-month-old company. "Here, you can interact 
with live characters on the screen. They will react to your actions 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Pixis titles range from R-rated games to science-fiction dramas for both the 
Macintosh and IBM-compatible machines. They sell for $69.95 to $89.95, the 
typical prices for CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, sex has become quite comfortable with the computer medium. 
Penthouse and Playboy magazines have already produced interactive computer 
programs that allow viewers to act as "virtual photographers" of nude women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex chat" computer bulletin boards, where people type provocative messages to 
each other via computer modems, have existed for years. At the recent Comdex 
computer show in Las Vegas, scores of conventioneers lined up at booths 
sponsored by Pixis and nearly a dozen other adult CD-ROM purveyors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't surprise me because it's what people want, " said Amin 
Hirschorn, who took time to browse at the Pixis trade show booth. "Here you can 
touch the screen, but not the woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality is really surprising," said Kelly Ramon, another onlooker. 
"There's a trend in society. You're seeing more sex in movies, and this is 
something creative that will compete with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Erotica, pornography and adult entertainment usually find their way onto any 
new medium, Alamares said. "Dial-a-porn" telephone services mushroomed in the 
1980s with the advent of 900 numbers. VCR manufacturers got a boost as 
customers found it more convenient to watch adult videos in privacy at home 
instead of facing embarrassment at being recognized at the local porn cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement about an information superhighway, where interactive computers 
promise to deliver addictive realism to simulations and games, is being driven 
in part by the expectation of digital sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "CD-ROMs are in the novelty stage now, very small in sales," said Lisa Palac, 
editor of Future Sex, a quarterly magazine in San Francisco that chronicles the 
link between sex, culture and technology. "But the interest among people is 
phenomenal. Among computer people, it's one more thing they can do with their 
computer." 
</P>
<P>
 If society can be enthralled by the engaging interactive aspect of video 
games, then interactive sex will probably prove equally engaging, said Rob 
Kling, professor of computer science at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the back pages of a lot of computer magazines and you'll see ads for 
adult material," Kling said. "And if you look at the adult video, it doesn't 
take great porno quality to fuel a large number of purchases." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the concerns of computer experts and the hopes of Pixis executives, 
market analysts do not expect adult games to spread like wildfire, at least not 
until most consumers have high-powered multimedia personal computers with 
CD-ROM drives. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2.6 million drives were sold in 1993, more than the total sold 
from 1986 to 1991, according to InfoTech, a market research firm in Woodstock, 
Vt. And nearly half of all personal computers sold this year are expected to 
feature CD-ROM drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adult segment is not any more successful on CD-ROMs than in any other 
medium," said Julie Schwerin, InfoTech president. "It's a very small part of 
the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Of an estimated 7,000 CD-ROM titles available, there are only about 100 
different adult titles, Palac estimates. A multimedia offering called "The 
Interactive Adventures of Seymore Butts," produced by a Santa Monica company, 
has sold well over 10,000 copies, a number which is considered a bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 Far beyond presenting titillating images on a screen is simulated sex through 
virtual reality. This is the stuff of science-fiction movies, such as in 
Sylvester Stallone's "Demolition Man": A couple wears goggles that transport 
them into a three-dimensional, computer-generated world where they can have 
sexual intercourse without actually touching. Palac said such technology is 
still in the early development stages. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing culture of "cyberporn" has feminists outraged and fearful of the 
psychological damage it could do to both women and men at a time of increasing 
concern about sexual abuse and child molestation. A frightening dimension of 
interactive porn is that it can encourage men to treat women as objects to be 
manipulated, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's marketed as a more sophisticated kind of high-tech entertainment," said 
Lisa McLanahan, one of the coordinators of the Bay View chapter of the National 
Organization for Women. "Any man who has the idea of himself as the preppy, 
sophisticated porn user is fooling himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like all pornography, it works to oppress women," she said. "What is 
different is the ability to create a woman of your dreams and control her on 
screen so that the man viewing it becomes the pornographer himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Wu, the 27-year-old president of Pixis, argues that CD sex is no worse 
than erotica in other media, and that it can even have its health benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 "With the prevalence of diseases, we're directing sexual energies," he said. 
"It's the ultimate safe sex. We think 'Scissors N Stones' is tamer than 
Playboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not sexually themed CD-ROMs become a mass market on the scale of 
adult videos, which are a staple in many neighborhood video stores, the 
founders of Pixis believe they've found a place to profit in the emerging 
format of CD-ROM, which stands for compact disk/read-only memory. These CDs for 
computers can store more than 600 times the amount of data in a typical floppy 
disk, making it possible for games to feature complex three-dimensional 
animation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend at the Consumer Electronics Show, about a dozen companies were 
showing adult movies on CD-ROMs. Among the exhibitors was Pixis' primary 
competitor, New Machine Publishing in Santa Monica, which has developed more 
than 20 adult CD-ROMs over the past year. Some of New Machines' titles, such as 
the newly released "Dream Machine," will be sold in Tower Video, Fry's 
Electronics and Virgin Megastores. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Miller, co-founder and an owner of New Machine, said that Pixis and 
his company have set themselves apart from other firms by pioneering the use of 
computer animation in adult CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone else dumps video onto CD-ROM because it's a new way to make money 
from their own material," he said. "That's not interactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller acknowledges that the visual quality of CD-ROMs is worse than videos, 
but he said most people don't mind because of the added value of interactive 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our interest is in interactivity, not just the adult segment," said Alamares 
of Pixis. "We don't come from the adult video industry, so our offerings will 
emphasize better technology and themes that go beyond adult titles, like 
science fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of a $5.8-billion industry for CD-ROM disks and drives has made 
some computer experts uneasy about the spread of computer-based pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 George Trubow, law professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, 
warned of the potential harm to children from interactive adult entertainment 
in a recent conference on computer abuse at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing for kids to peek at nude pictures on computers, but Trubow said 
he fears that the improved graphic quality of today's personal computers will 
attract all sorts of purveyors of pornography, from child pornographers to 
proponents of bestiality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have no idea what their kids are getting into with computers," said 
Valerie Rezmierski, a computer administrator at the University of Michigan, who 
also attended the UCI conference. "I'm very concerned about the damage that 
young children could suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller at New Machine said his company's "Dream Machine" title is nearly 
childproof: It requires password access to prevent children from watching their 
parents' program when they are alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail chains such as CompUSA and Egghead software have refused to carry 
titles from Pixis and New Machine. But even if mainstream companies avoid the 
titles, Pixis and New Machine expect to make plenty of money with adult 
programming. This year, Pixis expects to sell more than 100,000 of its 
"Scissors N Stones" title and it expects to quadruple sales overall. The 
company would not release specific sales information. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamares says Pixis has no intentions of marketing to youngsters, and its 
boxes are marked for "mature audiences." Distribution is limited to adult 
stores, some computer dealers and mail order. Of course, there is no reason 
that kids can't order these games via mail, but Alamares says the industry can 
thrive by appealing to those who want "tasteful" adult entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of retailers in this political climate won't carry it," Alamares said. 
"We are making products that are done tastefully." 
</P>
<P>
 With backgrounds in the computer industry, the company founders sought to set 
themselves apart from Hollywood's adult industry, Wu said. The company got 
started with private funding and the talents of programmers just out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for a way to break into the mass market and realized that sex 
and entertainment has always been the driving force for the high-technology 
market," Wu said.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of churning out numerous features like adult video producers, Pixis 
plans to make two to four titles a year with budgets of $250,000 to $1.5 
million each. It uses a full-time writer to create stories, computer animators 
to add a multimedia experience, and the company emphasizes game playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just selling the sex aspect," Alamares said. "We use a lot of 3D 
animation, live-action video and interactive game play. Sex is an important 
factor in the games, but not the sole aspect of it. We mix in action and 
adventure like in arcade games. It's a virtual movie, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 One technique to draw the viewer into the experience is the use of 
first-person point of view in the "camera angles" for the games, Wu said. When 
filming one sexual scene, Pixis' production team created an animation as if 
there were a video camera tied onto one actor's chest so that "you can feel 
like you're performing." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors and actresses, many drawn from adult videos, act out a variety of 
scenarios for each CD-ROM, because the point of interactive technology is to 
present the viewer with various choices. Thus, one CD-ROM can require seven 
hours of filming compared to a couple of hours with a regular adult film, Wu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pixis takes that footage and turns it into a complete story or humorous game 
with three-dimensional animation. "Scissors N Stones" includes a blooper reel, 
which reveals actors' mistakes, and also features a "panic button," which Wu 
says can be used to instantly turn off the game at work if the boss passes by. 
</P>
<P>
 Palac, who reviews CD-ROMs for Future Sex, said many customers are 
disappointed in CD-ROMs because their computers can't run the video fast enough 
to be lifelike or play the sound correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interactivity can be a real sham, sort of like multiple choice of which 
movie you want to see," Palac said. "Computer video can look chunky, and it's 
not as convenient to watch these things on a computer. People with VCRs can 
watch videos in bed and fast-forward to the good parts. The CD-ROMs right now 
don't offer anything better. When it comes to erotic material, the bottom line 
is people want to get aroused."

 Anyone following the GATT negotiations late last year had to relish the 
last-minute suspense -- particularly in the Franco-American battle for the 
hearts and minds of European movie fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the hubbub would have been unnecessary, had we acted decisively nearly 
50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime 
Minister Winston Churchill met aboard a U.S. destroyer in the North Atlantic to 
discuss the conduct of the world war. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders' final communique -- the Atlantic Charter -- conveyed their belief 
that, whatever the war's outcome, any future world order must prevent 
recurrences of the currency devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies 
that had so deepened the world Depression and led in no small part to the 
cataclysm they were then seeking to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "(We) will endeavor," it said, "to further the enjoyment by all states, great 
or small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms to the trade and to 
the raw materials of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the war's end, institutions were created to give the world a new 
economic order: the United Nations with its International Monetary Fund and 
World Bank, and the Marshall Plan, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 American diplomats next set out to complete the missing link by negotiating an 
international agreement that would liberalize world trade. In 1948, some 54 
nations signed the Havana Charter, which was to govern a new International 
Trade Organization (ITO). 
</P>
<P>
 The charter established three key principles that are still with us today: 
non-discriminatory treatment of all parties, a commitment to reducing tariffs 
and other trade barriers and elimination of all import quotas, except under 
emergency conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the charter's significance was deeper: It addressed many of the thorniest 
issues that would haunt trade talks for the next 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, it forbade discriminatory taxation and regulated state 
monopolies. It limited the use of domestic-content requirements and other 
non-tariff barriers and administrative procedures employed by states to 
circumvent their commitments to open borders. It also prohibited restrictive 
business practices and cartels that could serve as private controls over 
competition. It regulated the use of public subsidies and countermeasures, such 
as anti-dumping procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the charter called for rules against double taxation, protected the 
owners of patents and other "intangible" assets, promoted the elimination of 
unfair labor practices and provided foreign investors guarantees of fair and 
reasonable treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter's provisions applied equally to goods and services. Article 19, 
for example, allowed member countries to maintain "screen quotas" for domestic 
movies, but specified that the quotas were "subject to negotiation" -- 
obligating the countries to reduce them over time. As Clair Wilcox, head of the 
U.S. delegation, put it: "Other nations are using 17 kinds of discrimination 
against American films. We got them down to one, and it is negotiable!" 
</P>
<P>
 Under that provision, quotas limiting European viewers' access to U.S.-made 
films and television programming might have been reduced to insignificance long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, late in December, 1950, the Truman Administration -- preoccupied with the 
Korean conflict -- let it be known that the Havana Charter would not be 
submitted to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why did it fail? 
</P>
<P>
 Many business organizations were opposed to greater government intervention in 
markets. Liberals thought the treaty was too weak; conservatives saw it as a 
threat to national sovereignty. Republican gains in the 1950 congressional 
elections strengthened those who favored greater reliance on tariffs and 
protection of U.S. industry. And Southern Democrats, traditionally supporters 
of free trade, were changing their views as manufacturing expanded in the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 43 years, each of the seven successive negotiating rounds of the 
GATT -- initially established as a stopgap forum for discussing tariff 
reductions only -- has had to tackle the issues left on the table at Havana.  
</P>
<P>
 What can we conclude from this experience? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the specter of lost national sovereignty, which played such a critical 
role in defeating the ITO, is less relevant today. NAFTA, bilateral discussions 
with Japan and the growth of regional markets have made it legitimate for 
governments to seek concessions regarding each others' tax and fiscal policies, 
labor and wage practices and environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, as regional blocs have gained scope and importance, they have served 
as testing grounds for new rules about complex issues -- for example, the rules 
on reciprocity in financial services within NAFTA. These can then be extended 
on a multilateral basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, appropriate dispute-resolution procedures are critical. In a rule-based 
system, interpretation and enforcement must go hand in hand with rule-making. 
The GATT's caseload increased enormously in the 1980s, to 120 cases, versus 90 
in its first 32 years. Yet its adjudication powers remain so primitive that 
many cases were not resolved -- or, worse, its findings were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while there is much to complain about regarding what did not get done in 
Geneva in December, there is much for which to be thankful. We are slowly 
reconstructing the edifice we tore down in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? Maybe the old wording of Article 19 can be revived. Bring on the 
script doctors!

THE NEW GUARDIAN OF CALIFORNIA'S ZERO EMISSIONS RULE SPEAKS; AUTOMOBILES: 
JACQUELINE SCHAFER DEFENDS GOV. WILSON'S COMMITMENT TO TOUGH ANTI-POLLUTION 
STANDARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's rule forcing production of the first modern, mass-market, 
zero-emission vehicles -- most likely electric cars -- has become increasingly 
controversial as the 1998 deadline approaches.  
</P>
<P>
 The state's electric utilities, alternative-fuel vehicle and parts 
manufacturers and environmentalists -- along with many political and business 
leaders -- support the state mandate.  
</P>
<P>
 But big U.S. and foreign auto makers want to shelve the rule, one segment of a 
plan to drastically reduce health-endangering air pollution from transportation 
sources.  
</P>
<P>
 Car makers say the limitations of current battery technology make practical, 
reasonably priced electric cars impossible by 1998. Last Tuesday, Ford Motor 
Co. turned up the industry's lobbying effort, announcing that it may cancel a 
program to develop a new electric vehicle; one official termed the effort a 
waste of money without better batteries.  
</P>
<P>
 As the dispute heightened last fall, Gov. Pete Wilson alarmed electric-car 
proponents by removing Jananne Sharpless, an eight-year proponent of tough air 
pollution measures, as chairwoman of the state Air Resources Board.  
</P>
<P>
 Her replacement: Jacqueline E. Schafer, who spent most of her 20 years in the 
environmental field in Reagan and Bush administration posts.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, there has been much speculation about Schafer's views on the 
zero-emissions rule. At the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show earlier this month, 
she met with reporters to talk about electric cars and other issues. Here are 
excerpts from her remarks:  
</P>
<P>
 SCHAFER: For the last 25 years, the California Air Resources Board has been 
setting challenges for the automobile industry. Our emission standards have 
long been the world's model, since even before the federal EPA began in this 
business. And the ability of the automobile manufacturers to respond to those 
challenges is evident in millions upon millions of cars on the road today 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of technologies that have been developed to meet those emission 
standards is long and impressive. It includes catalytic converters and other 
add-on equipment, of course. But those standards have also produced more 
precise fuel systems, electronic and computerized engine-management systems, 
and lightweight materials. So it's no coincidence that stricter emission 
standards have produced cars that also have better performance and higher fuel 
economy. Simply put, in responding to the challenges that we have posed so far, 
car manufacturers have produced cars that are good for the consumer and good 
for air quality at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Emissions from a new car today have been cut by more than 90% compared to the 
models that were being built when we started the Air Pollution Control Program 
for Mobile Sources. The air quality results have been impressive. Population 
exposure to ozone in Los Angeles has been cut in half over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite that progress, the challenge for us as a public-health agency 
continues. California continues to be one of the nation's most popular places 
to live. The automobile population is increasing. And the mileage that these 
cars collectively are being driven is increasing at an even greater rate, 
because people choose to live in suburbs that stretch ever farther from our 
central cities and places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, motor vehicles continue to be the single greatest source of air 
pollution. And there is no other place where the effects of that are more acute 
than here in California, which experiences 75% of the nation's health threat 
from excessive air pollutants. And there is no place in California that feels 
the effect of that pollution more than where we are sitting here today in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 So our challenges are the auto industry's challenges: To improve public health 
by making more environmentally acceptable vehicles. An ever-cleaner 
transportation system has been the greatest reason for the air-quality 
improvements we've achieved over the past 25 years. And advances in technology 
developed in response to emission standards have been the key to cleaner cars 
and fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a policy we must continue if we are to meet our public health goals . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUESTION: What is your position on the zero-emissions rule? 
</P>
<P>
 SCHAFER: I have a bias toward retaining the ZEV rule for a simple reason: It 
has generated the production of a whole new set of incentives . . . and 
high-technology applications for transportation systems that will serve us well 
into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 My boss -- my big boss, the governor of the state of California -- . . . in 
his state (of the state) message pointed out that technologies that once built 
jet fighters are now being used to build electric cars, and that here in 
California environmental cleanup is a particularly exciting opportunity, in 
order to create many new jobs for Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 I think our regulation is part of that. I also point out that as part of the 
board's adopting that regulation, we resolved to review progress toward meeting 
that 1998 goal periodically. One of those periodic reviews will be conducted in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't regard the automobile industry as a monolith, nor the fuels industry 
as a monolith, and there are lots of entrepreneurs out there working hard to 
make this happen. So I look forward to hearing the kind of testimony that will 
be brought to the board, and I hope that we can work with the industry to make 
this standard produce the car of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUESTION: Have you seen information from the auto makers that would encourage 
you personally to repeal the standards? 
</P>
<P>
 SCHAFER: I've been reading the newspapers. I am waiting to hear from them in 
their own words, (to hear them) speak for themselves. I understand that some 
manufacturers have had some difficulty in pursuit of a particular technology 
that they've been investing in, but I think that our hearing process will bring 
these out. And I think you will see some people making advances faster than 
others. That just remains to be seen.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUESTION: Should the board maintain the ZEV rule so that those who have made 
advances can keep going, or stop the whole process, or delay it, so others can 
catch up? 
</P>
<P>
 SCHAFER: I'd like to think that it's good public policy to continue the 
incentives in place to get people to behave in the way that we would like them 
to behave . . . I do not like to turn around and disincentivize the people who 
are succeeding in doing what we would like to see done . . . Obviously, we also 
have to sell automobiles, in this state and we'll see how the consumers react. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUESTION: Is anyone at the board looking at alternative schemes that would 
meet clean-air goals without ZEVs? 
</P>
<P>
 SCHAFER: Our low-emission vehicle program, of which the zero emission vehicle 
is a part, is over and above that which is required by federal EPA, because the 
problem we have here is so much larger than any other state. In California, the 
number of days out of compliance with the ozone standard is 10 times the next 
worse case, which happens to be the New York City metropolitan area. So we have 
a larger problem. We have standards to meet that larger problem, and as a 
consequence we have to push the technology that much harder. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that automobile emissions account for the single largest source of 
the air pollution problem that we face. What we want to do is get at the large 
sources in the most cost effective way possible, and that has argued for a 
strong program of cleaner cars and cleaner fuels as the most cost effective way 
of meeting the particular clean-air problem we have here in California. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no Plan B right now. But, of course, we will review anything that's 
presented to us as we undertake the review of the ZEV standard this year. BIO

PERSONAL FINANCE: IT'S BACK, IT'S IMPROVED: BANKING BY COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home banking, a once-touted service that nearly died of neglect, is being 
revived with better products and greater consumer receptivity to new 
technologies. The result: Millions of Americans probably will be banking via 
personal computer within the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest entries in the home banking market are two of the nation's biggest 
sellers of personal finance software -- Microsoft and Intuit. Both companies 
have formed alliances with banks and credit card companies to offer a wide 
array of check-paying and bank information services via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Several regional phone companies also are working with banks to offer bank 
services by "video phone," and other companies promise to usher in home banking 
with interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
 These companies are trying to learn from the mistakes of others. Banks began 
to roll out products for personal computer banking more than a decade ago, but 
few of the products ever caught on. And when Chemical Bank -- which had offered 
Pronto, one of the most comprehensive early home banking products -- dropped 
out of the market in the mid 1980s, the industry was thought to be far from 
success. Home banking products had captured between 1% and 2% of the banking 
market over the previous 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some computer users already bank from home. Intuit's Quicken software, for 
example, works with a service called CheckFree, which charges $9.95 monthly for 
the first 20 electronic checks written each month. Prodigy, an on-line service, 
also has a home banking product that it offers in conjunction with certain 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank-based products, however, were frequently ponderous and ignored many 
of the bells and whistles available with financial software. The software 
companies, meanwhile, couldn't offer interactive access to your own bank -- to 
transfer money between accounts, for example, or to log on to see if a check 
had cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems primed for change, thanks to a flurry of joint ventures formed 
between banks and computer companies in the last year: 
</P>
<P>
 * A subsidiary of regional phone company US West announced last summer that it 
will team up with Electronic Data Systems and a French company to develop home 
banking by interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
 * A host of banks -- from Citibank in New York to Banc One Corp. in Columbus, 
Ohio -- have announced plans to test market telephone-based home banking 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intuit, of Menlo Park, announced it would team up with Visa to offer home 
banking via personal computer to any Visa-member bank that wants to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
 * And, late last year, Microsoft announced it would join with a handful of 
banks to offer home banking products in conjunction with its popular Money 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other companies are optimistic because vast improvements in 
technology are making home banking products cheaper, friendlier and more 
comprehensive. Also, today's consumer is more technologically literate and 
willing to buy and use the sophisticated systems that are necessary for 
full-scale home banking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market just wasn't ready for home banking when it was first offered," 
says Richard Bray, product manager at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash. "There 
weren't that many people with personal computers, and the technology was 
evolving too fast for the banks to keep up. It wasn't long before the bank 
products began to look obsolete, in terms of what a personal computer could 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 20 million to 30 million Americans have home computers, he says. More and 
more home computers have modems, which let computers talk to one another by 
phone, and many of these computers are newer models with the power necessary to 
run easy-to-use, graphically oriented personal-finance software. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 52% of Americans now are willing to bank and pay bills by phone, and 
roughly 15% would use a personal computer for banking if their bank offered the 
service, said Neal Chambliss, vice president of PSI, a Tampa-based research 
firm that conducts home banking surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, consumers are banking via "remote" more than half the time, adds Nik 
Banerjee, director of retail banking for the Bank Administration Institute, a 
Chicago-based trade group. About 31% of bank transactions are done at automated 
teller machines, while 24% are done over the phone, Banerjee says. Another 2% 
use "other" means -- primarily personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 43% of all transactions are done in bank branches, according to BAI 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may prove to be the pivotal measures of whether home banking will fly 
now are the products themselves. There's no doubt that what's being offered 
today is a far cry from what was on the market a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Microsoft's soon-to-be-introduced program: Money software to go on 
the market next month will be able to hook your computer into three new 
services -- Bank On-Line, Pay On-Line and Quotes On-Line (for updating stock 
and mutual fund portfolios). 
</P>
<P>
 Many banks are expected to offer Bank On-Line and Pay On-Line together as a 
package deal for about $15 a month. With them, you would be able to transfer 
money between linked accounts, find out current balances and pay bills. 
</P>
<P>
 You also will be able to copy the bank's records of your accounts into your 
personal computer. Meanwhile, some of the television and telephone-based home 
banking products promise to link you to shopping networks and investment 
services as well. You could see something you like on the shopping channel, 
flip to the banking channel to check your balance, then press a few buttons to 
buy the item. Or you could transfer cash from your checking account to your 
mutual fund without bothering to budge from the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these products were solely for banking, they really didn't make sense 
for the price," said Chuck Bruney, senior vice president at Speer & Associates 
in Atlanta. "But now that third-party vendors (computer and phone companies) 
are packaging them with other products, I really believe they're going to catch 
on." Home Bank Tips What should you look for in a home banking product? Here 
are some key factors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost. Even though the cost of most home banking products has come down, they 
still are relatively expensive. Typically, you'll pay between $10 and $15 a 
month for a product that allows you unlimited access to balance information, 
some checking account statements and the ability to pay 20 bills per month via 
remote. The bill-paying feature, if used to capacity and no further, saves you 
roughly $6 a month in stamps and envelopes. So the net cost is between $4 and 
$9, in addition to your ordinary checking account fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compatability. Most products work either in conjunction with a sophisticated 
telephone or a high-powered computer. If you have to buy equipment that's 
compatible with the home banking product, your overall cost soars. Screen 
phones, for example, cost between $100 and $500 each. Software for the 
computer-based programs can run $50 to $150, depending on what software you've 
already got. And if you need to upgrade your computer, add several hundred more 
dollars to the cost. Some companies will lend or rent necessary equipment. If 
your bank won't, consider products that work with what you've got. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transferability. Do you like your bank enough to know that you won't be 
switching in the near future? If not, make sure your home banking service is 
offered by other banks before you spend money on software or equipment that 
can't be used anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feel. Only you can determine whether you like the way a particular product 
feels. Is is ponderous? Does it require too much typing or technological skill? 
The only way to find out is to try it out. Ask your bank if you can have a free 
trial period to see if you like it.

MONEY TALK: DON'T WASTE HOME-SALE TAX BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: My husband died last year at age 57. I am 51. At the time of his death, our 
home was up for sale, but it did not sell until three months after his passing. 
Now I am wondering if I may claim the $125,000, one-time exclusion on my 1993 
tax return. The return will be a joint one, since my husband was alive for a 
portion of the year, and he did meet the criteria for using it. I have gotten 
conflicting advice from accountants. -- H.E.F . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The situation is far more hopeful than you might think. In community 
property states such as California, assets held as community property are 
entitled to a full step up in value, to the date of one spouse's death. (Assets 
held as the sole and separate property of the deceased would also be entitled 
to a full step up in value.) 
</P>
<P>
 If your home was held as community property, it is now valued as of the date 
of your husband's death. This means you probably had little or no taxable gain 
when you sold the house, since the sale occurred just three months after his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should you even be considering using the $125,000 exemption when you 
should have almost no gain to exempt? This is what your accountants should have 
told you! This means that when you turn 55 -- and assuming that you do not 
marry someone who has already used his exemption -- you are free to use the 
full $125,000 deduction upon the sale of another home. 
</P>
<P>
 If the property had not been entitled to a full step up in value, exposing you 
to a sizable taxable gain, our experts say you would not have been eligible to 
use the $125,000 exemption, because you do not meet the age requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although your husband did meet all the criteria at the time of his death, the 
home was not sold until after his passing. His dying before the sale means you 
must qualify on your own for the exemption in order to use it. IRS Views a 
'Co-Op' as Any Other Residence 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I purchased a unit in a cooperative housing project, or "co-op" several 
years ago, and recently sold it at a considerable loss. The liability for 
property taxes, insurance and other matters all reside with the co-op. Since 
the co-op is a corporation, am I entitled to deduct my loss on the sale as a 
capital loss? -- S.R.Z . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Internal Revenue Service considers a co-op the same as any other type 
of personal residence in determining tax obligations upon its sale. And, as you 
apparently know already, the IRS does not permit taxpayers to deduct any loss 
from the sale of a personal residence. Nice try at splitting hairs, but the 
government won't accept it. Home Can Be Used in Tax-Deferred Exchange 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I want to convert my single-family house to a rental and then trade the 
house for other real estate in a tax-deferred exchange. The home is worth 
$300,000 and has a $100,000 basis. My loan balance is $135,000. May I trade it 
for apartments or commercial real estate? -- J.M . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You may convert your home to a rental and then treat it as you would any 
other investment property, including trading it for another piece of investment 
real estate, such as apartments, offices or even raw land. Our experts warn, 
however, that you should hold the house while renting it for a "considerable" 
period of time, to satisfy any potential questions from the IRS. Our experts 
say you should rent it for at least a full year, preferably longer, before 
exchanging it. 
</P>
<P>
 Any new piece of property you get in exchange for the house must be worth at 
least the $300,000 market value you place on the house. Further, to qualify for 
the full tax advantages of the exchange, the mortgage on the new property must 
at least equal the $135,000 owed on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers generally have no more than 180 days to complete such a property 
exchange from the time the process begins, and you must identify the 
replacement property, or properties, within 45 days of relinquishing your 
property. The exact time the process begins is determined by when you actually 
relinquish your property. This date can be negotiated with all the players in 
the trade, so include an attorney representing you who is thoroughly familiar 
with all the rules regulating these complex transactions. A competent 
professional on your team can assure that you get the property you want and 
still meet all the IRS deadlines. IRA Rules Cover Use of Bequeathed Account 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My daughter is my IRA beneficiary. When I die, may she take the balance of 
my IRA account over her life expectancy, or must she take it all in a lump sum 
at the time of my death? F.G.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you had already begun taking distributions from your IRA, a non-spouse 
beneficiary must continue withdrawing from the account at least as fast as you 
were. If the deceased had not begun withdrawing from the account, a non-spouse 
beneficiary may either take distributions annually over his or her life 
expectancy or withdraw the entire sum by the end of the fifth year after the 
deceased's death. The deceased's plan may specify the method to be used. If the 
plan does not, the beneficiary should specify the preferred method by Dec. 31 
of the year after the deceased's death. At no time may a non-spouse transfer 
any part of a deceased's IRA to his or her own account. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are considerably different for a spouse who inherits an IRA. A 
surviving spouse may transfer the funds into his or her own IRA account and 
continue deferring taxes on that money until he or she reaches age 70 1/2.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After repurchasing 500,000 of its shares, Comarco Inc., the communications 
products maker, said Friday that it would buy up to 500,000 additional shares, 
or about 10% of its stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda company is buying up the securities now because its stock is 
close to a 52-week low, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a vote of confidence by management in the company," said spokesman 
Scott Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Comarco will redeem $1.9 million of subordinated debt on April 
15, reducing its outstanding debentures to $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Comarco makes wireless communications products, including freeway call boxes, 
and also provides engineering and facility management services.

OVER-THE-KITCHEN-COUNTER REMEDIES; MANY DOCTORS FIND FOLK MEDICINE HARD TO 
SWALLOW. BUT WHEN YOU HAD THE FLU AND GRANDMA GAVE YOU THAT HOT CUP OF GARLIC, 
PEPPER AND LEMON JUICE, DIDN'T YOU FEEL BETTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crush some garlic and add a dash of cayenne pepper. Brew with the juice of six 
grapefruit. Bombard with positive thoughts -- this, like, being Southern 
California. And, oh yes, let someone tuck you into bed with tender, loving 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 This concoction was among the nearly 200 responses sent in by readers who 
shared their best cures for wintertime colds and flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken is big, booze is bigger. And lots of readers have faith in salt, 
onions, garlic, and sizzling teas and soups. 
</P>
<P>
 There were readers who passed on home remedies that had been in their families 
for generations -- like Magda Simon's chicken soup, which originated in Hungary 
at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chicken has nothing to do with it," says Simon of Los Angeles. "It's the 
onion, garlic, parsley roots, parsnips and carrots." 
</P>
<P>
 And, the call for home remedies clearly brought back memories of a time before 
TheraFlu. 
</P>
<P>
 Devra Hill, a Beverly Hills writer, was raised on her Italian grandmother's 
boiled grapefruit juice and her English grandmother's hot toddy consisting of 
lemon juice, brandy and hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Fellstad of Mission Viejo recalls that while growing up during the Great 
Depression in the backwoods of Norway, "Home remedies were all we had. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a common remedy (to put) two drops of turpentine or naphtha on a sugar 
cube, chew fast and swallow. After a few minutes in the stomach, this vile 
concoction started a revolution that could only be relieved by a tremendous 
burp that was more like an explosion. And you felt like your face disappeared 
through your ears." 
</P>
<P>
 Other readers recalled home remedies that saved them as a child but dare not 
be repeated in the days of antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 It was apparently common to blow sulfur through a straw into a child's sore 
throat; swab the neck with kerosene, also to relieve raw throats; blow smoke in 
an aching ear, and hang little bags of smelly "asafetida" or fried onion around 
the neck to ward off germs. (Actually, the bag probably warded off other 
children, which warded off germs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lael Littke of Pasadena says her "flesh cringes" when she thinks of her 
mother's remedy for chest colds: flannel plaster bags smeared with a concoction 
of dry mustard, water and cayenne pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 "She smeared this mess inside the two bags at bedtime, then fitted them onto 
the unfortunate child," Littke recalls. "After a couple tablespoons of cod 
liver oil . . . the child was deposited to bed, covered with heavy quilts, and 
left to fry gently all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the morning, our small chests were fiery red and close to blisters from 
the heat generated by the concoction, but we were free from congestion. Or, at 
least we claimed we were, to avoid a second night's cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home cures clearly have a place in the modern world. Some ingredients do have 
the power to relieve cold and flu symptoms, according to science. Others may 
simply work because people believe they work, although there is no evidence 
that any home remedy can cure a cold. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps feeling good is just as important as getting over a cold quickly. 
Maybe that is why so many readers say they turn to their liquor cabinets 
instead of their medicine cabinets when the sneezes strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquor, like other home remedies, is contrary to what science dictates is best 
to treat colds and flu. Alcohol can raise your body temperature -- not a good 
idea if you're already stoking the thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other home remedies make some sense for reasons strongly rooted in folklore 
and homeopathy, if not in medical science. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic, for instance, is considered a potent cure in some areas of the world. 
It's said to reduce throat soreness and chest congestion. Garlic contains 
selenium, known to have a calming effect, says pharmacology professor Fred 
Weissman of USC. (He was solicited for this story as the scientific voice of 
reason.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some mystique in terms of how garlic works," he says. "But selenium 
does seem to suppress excitability, so there may be some effect in making you 
feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally bad for your breath but good for your health are onions, among the 
oldest natural remedies -- dating to the Greeks and Romans. Onions, long 
thought to prevent infection, are now considered to be effective as an 
expectorant, especially when consumed in a syrupy form. Onions are also rich in 
Vitamin C (which studies show may have a mild effect in reducing the duration 
of a cold). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many home remedies are based on liquids, which counter dehydration caused by 
vomiting or high fever, loosen congestion and relieve sore throat and coughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot liquids do the same things while also raising the temperature of the 
throat, which, legend has it, stops the reproduction of viruses. Viruses often 
take hold in the throat before spreading throughout the body. So some people 
believe that gargling with hot salt water at the first sign of soreness may 
kill the virus before it has a chance to spread.  
</P>
<P>
 According to folklore, salt breaks up mucus and draws it out of tissues. But 
salt probably works as an anesthetic, Weissman says, adding that he doubts that 
gargling at the first sign of a cold can stop it in its tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be true that some viruses colonize in the throat. But it depends on 
the virus. If you have a headache or stomachache as well, it's gone beyond the 
throat."  
</P>
<P>
 Honey is often used in remedies because of its gooey consistency -- thought to 
coat the throat membranes, soothing and protecting them. But two cautions: 
Honey should not be given to a child less than 1 year old because it can be 
contaminated with bacteria poisonous to young children; also, honey may help 
quiet a cough, but coughing may be beneficial to clear phlegm from the 
respiratory tract. 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus fruits, popular natural remedies among readers, are thought to work by 
providing an acidic environment in the throat where viruses can't flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 As for concoctions that contain a variety of fruits and vegetables, many are 
high in vitamin C and vitamin A, thought to strengthen the body's immune 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicy foods containing chili pepper, Tabasco, hot mustard or curry are also 
frequent remedies. Many spicy foods are rich in capsaicin, the substance that 
adds zing to hot peppers. Capsaicin causes tissues to release fluids and 
loosens the sticky congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbs are also trendy among Southern Californians. Echinacea is said to boost 
the immune system to fight germs. Although the herb has been studied 
extensively in Germany and is used for many problems, including colds, it 
hasn't received much scientific attention in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All our readers swear that their cures work. But Weissman is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying these things are nonsense. We do see some people improve. But 
that leads to the question: Were these people going to improve anyway?" he 
asks. "And then there is the mental component. If you take something, you often 
start to get better. I guess the bottom line is, if it makes you feel better, 
you take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Weissman is not above trying a few home remedies. He says he once iced his 
toes on the theory that lowering body temperature via the feet would provide an 
inhospitable climate for the virus. "I don't know that it worked," he says. "I 
know I got cold toes." 
</P>
<P>
 And, when he's sick, Weissman says his wife prepares a glass of water with one 
teaspoon of vinegar and one tablespoon of honey. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he drink it? 
</P>
<P>
 You'd better believe it.

OPERATING ON HOPE; MEDICAL TEAMS FLY HELP TO MEXICAN VILLAGERS THROUGH SANTA 
ANA GROUP THAT OPERATES CLINICS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sweat rose on Dr. Michael Farrell's forehead as he focused on the thin, 
twisted limb in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, steadily, Farrell rotated the boy's fractured arm into place. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old had turned the limb backward when he broke it playing the day 
before. Now, with the boy under anesthetic, Farrell tried to right it. A 
miscalculation could cause the arm's arteries and nerves to be severed. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting himself into such situations is how Farrell, a 49-year-old Laguna 
Hills orthopedic surgeon, chooses to spend the first weekend of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 He climbs behind the controls of his eight-seat Cessna Chancellor airplane at 
the Riverside airport on Friday, turns its nose south and flies across the 
border to small central Mexican villages like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying with him is a medical team of three or four and a load of medical 
supplies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a break from our daily lives," he said, explaining why he's made more 
than 80 such trips in the last decade. "It's just an opportunity to enjoy a 
change of scenery, help out some people who otherwise wouldn't get some help, 
and punch some holes in the sky with airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, the flying doctor has made most of his trips in 
conjunction with Liga International Inc., a nonprofit group based in Santa Ana 
that operates seven clinics in the states of Sonora and Sinaloa. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the injured, sick or handicapped are brought to the United 
States when specialized treatment is needed. But most care is provided at the 
austere but well-equipped clinics, like the 3,900-square-foot facility here, 
where doctors see hundreds of people per visit with every kind of health 
problem. The doctors treat infections, correct disfigurements with plastic 
surgery, fix dental problems and fit people with artificial limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday evening, Farrell landed his plane in Los Mochis on the Sea 
of Cortez. He and his team left their hotel early Saturday morning for the 
40-mile flight that followed the El Fuerte River to this northern Sinaloa 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief of police was waiting at the dirt airstrip and chauffeured them the 
quarter-mile into the village. 
</P>
<P>
 As the chief's van pulled up to the concrete block clinic about 7 a.m., people 
who had begun gathering several hours earlier were crowding the front porch. 
Many had heard radio announcements heralding the doctors' arrival and had set 
out by bus or on foot from up to 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those waiting on the porch was Martin Banulelos Dominguez, the 
4-year-old with the broken arm, who had ridden to the village on an 
early-morning bus with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Carried in his mother's arms into the clinic, Martin cried out in pain as 
Farrell touched the twisted limb. Speaking softly to calm the boy, Farrell 
poked and prodded and determined that the fracture was in the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell put Martin under a general anesthetic and began the delicate process 
of turning the bones back into place. 
</P>
<P>
 After about half an hour, Farrell had the arm set in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was serendipitous" that the boy broke his arm on a Friday, Farrell said. 
"If it had happened on Sunday he wouldn't have had the opportunity to have it 
treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Farrell were Kam Rezvan, an Irvine operating room technician; 
Annu Sharma, an Irvine pediatrician, and Dick Willner, a retired Claremont 
cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 They stopped work only during a lunch break when villagers brought them 
grilled chicken and tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 By about 4 p.m. the doctors had seen 180 patients.  
</P>
<P>
 And although Farrell seemed uplifted by the people he helped, he said he often 
must deal with an unfortunate side of his efforts: 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts each time I have to tell people there is nothing I can do to help 
them. . . So many of the problems that people have could have been prevented 
with prenatal care."

A FAMILY THAT'S SICK TOGETHER STAYS TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE CLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mass, simultaneous felling of a household by one minuscule virus is an 
adventure in family togetherness not to be missed. There is coughing, sneezing 
and wheezing all over one another. There is choral whining and bickering. 
</P>
<P>
 There are chills (so bad that my daughter thought we were having an 
earthquake) and spills (which occur when you have a child drink "plenty of 
fluids"). 
</P>
<P>
 The experience -- started by a little bug brought home from preschool by my 2 
1/2-year-old son -- gives rise to Murphy's little-known 10 Universal Laws of 
Flu and Cold Season, Family Division: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Just when the kids are getting sick, you'll realize that you have used up 
the last of 48 boxes of tissues you bought two years ago at the Price Club. 
</P>
<P>
 2. You'll flee your petri dish of a house to see the doctor, only to wait an 
hour in a windowless room. The only magazines will be copies of Glamour, 
Countryside and Highlights from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 3. You'll wonder when 2,000 square feet came to seem so small and marvel at 
how coughs resonate through the house. 
</P>
<P>
 4. No cough syrup flavor yet devised by people in lab coats will appeal to a 
picky 5-year-old. (We bribed our daughter to drink her "berry-flavored" remedy. 
Sorry, Dr. Spock.) 
</P>
<P>
 5. One child, having drunk "plenty of fluids," will throw up on the other's 
special blankie. 
</P>
<P>
 6. One child will wipe his/her nose on your necktie. 
</P>
<P>
 7. The pages about colds and flu in the family medical manual will be ripped 
out or have crayon rainbows colored all over them. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Reversing conventional medical wisdom, the preschooler who already sleeps 
less than you do will start keeping even later hours. You will nod off during 
meetings and at red lights. 
</P>
<P>
 9. A childless colleague will tell you he hasn't missed a day of work because 
of illness since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 10. At least one child will complain about having to miss a favorite activity 
at school. ("But today we get to cook! ") You will promise to bake cookies 
later. You will come to regret this.

SPOONFULS OF WOE; HOME ALONE WITH THE FLU -- IT'S A TRULY PITIFUL SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The dull ache begins right between the shoulder blades, or the base of the 
skull, and denial is usually the first response. "It's just a pulled muscle," 
you say. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's bargaining: "I'll go to bed early tonight. I'll take vitamins. I 
promise." 
</P>
<P>
 There's never a right time to be sick. And when you live alone, nobody else is 
going to pick up the slack. The laundry isn't done, you haven't shopped in 
weeks, the house is filthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Acceptance takes the form of claw marks across the living room rug as you are 
dragged under for the last time. What happens next is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 1. It doesn't seem so bad at first. Turn the phone off, the answering machine 
on, and be grateful nobody can see your matted hair and dull eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The bed accumulates objects: books, pens, tissues, two remote controls. The 
lost bookmarks are lurking somewhere near your knees. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Wait a minute. Who's going to bring you soup? Anyone with an ounce of pity 
lives 20 miles away. You don't want to whine. 
</P>
<P>
 4. You have to rest twice while operating the manual can opener. Making dinner 
takes an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Overloaded on megadoses of vitamin C and a nighttime cold liquid, you wake 
at 2 a.m., convinced that your room is crowded with shadowy figures snapping 
their fingers in unison. You can't move, but after a struggle, you manage to 
scream. Out loud. At no one. 
</P>
<P>
 6. A man you had hoped would call does just that. But as his cheerful voice 
booms from the answering machine, you realize that he will always be associated 
with the slight nausea you now feel. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Kleenex, bathroom tissue, paper towels: Who knew you could run out of every 
paper product in your house? A cafeteria-style napkin, found in an old coat 
pocket, will force an admission. You have to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Slumping your way through frozen foods, the mile-long aisle of tall glass 
doors, you stand there too long trying to remember if marble fudge ice cream is 
good for a cold. 
</P>
<P>
 9. The perky, perfectly coiffed check-out girl handles your bills with the 
tips of her fingernails. Stupidly, you apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 10. You wear the same pajamas for three days. Midway through the second day, 
they assume a life of their own. They whisper, "Burn me."

'LIFE REVIEW' MAKES MOST OF AGING; FAMILIES: DON'T WASTE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK 
ABOUT THE PAST WITH ELDERS, AN EXPERT SAYS. TALKING CAN CONNECT THE GENERATIONS 
AND BUILD STRENGTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 We hate to think about death. We loathe talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But to family therapist Terry Hargrave, the worst thing about death is not the 
dreadfulness or inevitability of it all but the way we squander it. 
</P>
<P>
 We absurdly pretend, even with aging or ill parents, that death is nowhere 
near, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 When visiting Grandma in the nursing home, we are likely to ask how she's 
doing. Far better, Hargrave says, would be to ask her how she used to be doing, 
as in 40 or 50 years ago -- having her tell stories from her past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life review" is a technique that Hargrave, chairman of behavioral sciences at 
Amarillo College in Texas, has found useful in intergenerational family 
therapy. It's the kind of thing healthy families do as a matter of course but 
which many others miss out on. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for death, Hargrave says, is "the last stage of growing up." And 
when it's done well, there's peace of mind for older family members and 
benefits for the younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 For elders, "It's a time for them to make sense of their lives, figure out 
what their lives have meant." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also an opportunity for them to give their grown children a vote of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way you can connect the generations and build strength," Hargrave 
says. "It also helps younger people to realize that Grandma and Grandpa weren't 
that crazy after all -- that they have something to say that is of value, and 
that their feelings and thoughts were not that different." 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't happen if everyone stays clammed up, pretending. 
</P>
<P>
 "You empower by simply saying those things," Hargrave says. "Saying what you 
mean to one another, telling each other what the really important things in 
life are, what they've learned from life, what they'd like to be remembered 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 Life review "gives a sense that 'my life counts,' and 'my family knows (what 
is felt),' instead of having to guess. . . . Healthy families find a way to do 
that. I run into families who use video cameras to tape Grandma and Grandpa 
talking about the old days." 
</P>
<P>
 It can be done casually, or as a ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no limit to what you can do," Hargrave says. "Some people make up 
scrapbooks. I know of one family where the mother was a great cook -- she 
created a cookbook with the family's favorite recipes and told a story for each 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 In families that do not communicate openly, life review may not seem possible, 
but there are indirect paths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the middle generation needs to realize that, developmentally, the 
aging family members are ready to talk about life in retrospect," Hargrave 
says. "They know that death is coming up. They're apt to want to talk about 
what life meant. It's helpful to them." 
</P>
<P>
 One approach is to just ask about what things used to be like. "What were you 
doing during the war? What was it like? How did your family make it during the 
Depression? Did anyone live with you? 
</P>
<P>
 "General knowledge of the historical period gives access to the personal side. 
. . . And they'll do that if you give them the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Or ask about the furniture. "When I'm working with an aging family, I try to 
go to the older person's house. I have them show me around and tell me about 
their things. People will tell me about an old desk, or an old dining-room 
table -- they say where everybody sat, talk about the good times they had. 
Usually people can tell me very specific information about how their family 
lived together emotionally, and how they went about life." 
</P>
<P>
 Older people who refuse usually feel guilty for having hurt someone in the 
past, or are in despair that they've wasted their lives, Hargrave says, "which 
would indicate a real depression. That's a sign you need some other kind of 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death, even though it's unknown, shouldn't really be feared," he says. "We 
all share it; we're all going to do it. So use the opportunity to strengthen 
the family instead of trying to ignore it or put if off."

FROM YOUNGSTER TO GANGSTER: HOW FLORIDA BOY SHOT A TOURIST; VIOLENCE: ANTWAN 
BROWN SAYS IT WAS HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO PREY ON VISITORS. HIS ATTORNEY CALLS THE 
CRIME A SEARCH FOR STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MULVANEY, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antwan Brown was a pint-sized Miami purse snatcher, 14 years old and barely 
100 pounds. What he lacked in size he made up in bravado, and when his victim 
-- a middle-aged German tourist -- resisted, he fired a single shot with a 
.38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I did it," Brown said in a recent interview. "It just kind 
of happened. I was trying to snatch that pocketbook. I took out the gun and 
shot her." 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet ripped through the arm of the woman, Renate Morlack, and lodged in 
her spine, leaving her paralyzed. The shooting, which occurred Oct. 26, 1992, 
was one of the first of a series of attacks on European tourists that turned 
the international spotlight on South Florida and sparked a nationwide debate, 
still raging, over juvenile crime and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with Brown, his friends, relatives, law enforcement officials, 
community leaders and others, a detailed portrait emerges of this incident, 
which became the crime of the year in Miami and a chilling symbol of the terror 
of life in the United States. Morlack, her family watching, was shot in the 
parking lot of a fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was arrested four days later, after a $1,000 reward was offered and 
television broadcast a re-enactment of the crime. The person who called police 
may have learned of Brown's involvement from Brown himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told everybody in school," said his girlfriend, Malikata Hayes. "He wanted 
everybody to know he was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Larry Sparks, agreed. "I don't think money was really the thing. 
In his corner of the world, he is a pretty little guy. I think he did it more 
for status, recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown pleaded guilty last May to attempted murder, attempted robbery and 
attempted burglary and was sentenced to 3 to 20 years. He is serving his 
sentence in the Hamilton Correctional Institute, a medium-security prison near 
the Georgia border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I got a lot of time," he said in a three-hour interview with Newsday in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone would have shot my momma, then I'd say it ain't enough time," he 
said. "But since I received the sentence, I say it is too much time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometime I say I deserve this time. . . . Then sometimes I think, 'Why'd they 
give me all this time?' If I'd have shot somebody else, then they wouldn't have 
gave me all this time. They did it because it was a tourist. . . . If a regular 
lady would have been out there and I'd have shot her, I bet I wouldn't have 
caught that sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 At another point, Brown, who is expected to serve nine years, said he sent 
Morlack a letter of apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Morlack refused requests for an interview. Prosecutors said she approved the 
plea bargains in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile crime is sweeping the nation, perhaps nowhere as visibly as in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids today are out of hand, very much," said Antwan's mother, Sandra Brown, 
43. "I don't know what happened to them. It's like something came over the 
world and changed them to little devils." 
</P>
<P>
 "Twan," as she calls him, is her third son. The eldest, Charles, 24, is in the 
middle of a 7-year prison term for robbery. Dedric, 19, has been arrested once, 
but the charges were dropped. He is a high school graduate who recently tried 
to join the Army but was rejected because of a leg injury. He is unemployed 
today. Her youngest son, Javron, 12, comes home from school and hunkers down in 
front of the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Brown has worked as a housekeeper at a nursing home for 16 years and 
takes home between $340 and $370 every two weeks. She pays $400 a month rent 
for a two-bedroom house that resembles a converted garage. She receives $245 a 
month in food stamps. Charles' father was a high school friend. The father of 
the other three boys is Charles Stafford, a cab driver, who married her when 
Antwan was 10. He died in 1990 of complications from diabetes, and that's when 
Antwan's troubles started. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daddy wouldn't let me do no crime," Antwan Brown said. "He give me a 
beating. He was always telling me that he wanted me to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Dade County Board of Education officials confirmed that Brown's grades went 
from B's to D's and F's after his father died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just was hanging around with the wrong people," he said. "I wanted to be 
down with the boys. I wanted to be trend (popular). They got all the females, 
they got all the girls." 
</P>
<P>
 "The big change (was) when he started at Northwestern High School," said his 
mother. "He started changing. The older boys he started hanging with would say 
if you are going to be in the in-crowd, you got to show the bullyness." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Harper, chief of the Dade County Public Defender's Juvenile Division, 
says Brown is far from unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "The culture of violence is that without violence, they have no other power," 
he said. "We face the fact that criminal behavior is the norm. . . . There is 
no long-term goal; there is just the next high point." 
</P>
<P>
 Antwan's first gun was a .22-caliber. "I bought it for $5 from a baser," he 
said, using the slang for a crack addict. "Me and my friend shared it. Everyone 
else has got a gun, so we wanted a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 A gun, neighborhood youths claim, is a necessary accessory at Friday night 
parties, big affairs with 50 to 60 teens congregating around a group of girls 
in a back yard, their disputes, fistfights and gunplay spilling out on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, you go to a party and people be shooting at you, you got to have a gun," 
Antwan said. "Maybe you get shot. Maybe you shoot first." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime over the summer, Brown lent his pistol to a friend and never saw it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's girlfriend, Malikata, was his contact with law-abiding society. At 15, 
she is a B-student, hoping to get into college and later become a teacher or a 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to tell him not to do it, not to commit crimes," she said, sitting on 
the slab in front of her mother's weatherworn wood-frame home. 
</P>
<P>
 She said he didn't carry a gun when he was with her, carrying her book bag and 
holding her hand. They used to go to the movies and the Sizzler steakhouse on 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought he'd do anything more than stealing cars and purse 
snatching," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Antwan's life was different away from Malikata. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be a gangster," Brown said, breaking into a grin that flashed the 
gold caps on his two incisors. "I just wanted to be like that. They got big 
car, big money, all the females. That's what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 19, Brown or one of his friends -- their accounts differ -- stole a 
car at a football field. In the glove compartment of the Oldsmobile was a 
.38-caliber revolver, fully loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Brown and three of his friends went out "Z-ing" -- the street 
term for cruising the streets in a stolen vehicle, looking for a rental car 
filled with tourists. Brown said he was looking to graduate from random purse 
snatchings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claimed that this was his first night Z-ing. He said it took nearly an 
hour before they spotted what they were looking for, a rental car on 31st 
Street in the McDonald's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this car and it looked new," Brown said. "I walked up to it and saw a 
map on the front seat and we knew it was tourists." 
</P>
<P>
 They peeked through the window and saw Morlack, her husband and two teen-age 
children getting ready to order. They figured they had some time. They bought 
gas and returned to the McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We waited for them . . . and talked about it," Brown said. "I said I would do 
it, I knew how to do it because I did it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Morlacks returned to their car and were getting in when Brown and one of 
the other boys ran across the street. "We were pulling," he said, recalling how 
he grabbed the purse strap. "The (car) door was open and we were pulling. They 
pulled off and the door, I knew the door probably was going to knock me down, 
so I shot her." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Gunther Morlack had slammed the gear shift downward, into reverse, 
trying desperately to escape. He apparently didn't see a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know if I hit her," Brown said. "I ran. I kept it (the gun) in my 
hand. I said, 'Go, go, take me home.' They just said, 'What happened?' I just 
said, 'Take me home, take me home, take me home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he walked past his mother and went right to his room. He put the 
gun in the back of his closet and got into his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just laid there thinking, 'Why I shot her, man, why I shot her.' And I 
hoped maybe I hadn't shot nobody, maybe I missed, I was just thinking 
everything," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 He told his brother, Dedric, about the incident that night. "He said, 'Hey, 
man, you messed up.' And then he say, 'Tell Momma right away.' I say, 'I ain't 
going to tell,' because I know she was going to tell the police." 
</P>
<P>
 He went to school the next morning and started talking. He told a couple of 
friends and he told his girlfriend, Malikata. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't believe him," she said.

DUCHESS OF KENT FLOUTS 300-YEAR TRADITION, BECOMES CATHOLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Duchess of Kent became the first member of Britain's royal family to 
convert to Catholicism in more than 300 years Friday, going against an 
18th-Century law forbidding members of the monarchy from becoming Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 The duchess was the first British royal to convert since King Charles II, who 
turned to Catholicism on his deathbed in 1685. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute ceremony was carried out by Cardinal Basil Hume, head of the 
Roman Catholic Church in Britain, in a private ceremony at Archbishop's House 
near Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's monarch, Queen Elizabeth, is the head of the Church of England, 
created in the 16th Century after Henry VIII broke with Rome so that he could 
divorce and remarry, and the duchess needed special permission to leave the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 The duchess, 60, was accompanied by her husband, the Duke of Kent, Edward, who 
is 18th in line to Queen Elizabeth's throne, and their three children. 
</P>
<P>
 The duchess's switch to Catholicism sparked fresh reports that Princess Diana 
was considering becoming Catholic, even though she has been reported as saying 
there is about as much chance of her becoming a Buddhist or a Muslim.

DEATH PENALTY REMAINS ALIVE AROUND WORLD, AROUSING STRONG PASSIONS; PUNISHMENT: 
IN 1992, 1,708 PRISONERS WERE EXECUTED IN 35 COUNTRIES, FOUR-FIFTHS OF THEM IN 
CHINA AND IRAN, ACCORDING TO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 China executed 1,079 prisoners in January last year, 62 of them in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 4 1/2 months of 1993, 40 prisoners, half of them convicted drug 
dealers, were publicly beheaded in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of death sentences are carried out in the United States every year. 
It is the only NATO nation besides Turkey that routinely executes criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty remains very much alive around the world, arousing strong 
passions among both proponents and opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 1,708 prisoners were executed in 35 countries, four-fifths of them in 
China and Iran, according to Amnesty International, a London-based prisoners' 
rights organization. The toll rose even higher in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these are just the cases we know about," said Curt Goering, acting 
executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. "The true extent is surely 
much greater." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, six countries in the last three years have joined 
the growing list of those that have abolished or limited capital punishment -- 
either in law or in practice -- bringing the total to 87. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves 103 countries that use the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent executions are but the latest chapter in the age-old story of 
crimes and punishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks killed messengers who brought bad news, and the Babylonians put to 
death persons who sold adulterated beer. Accidentally sitting on the king's 
throne was cause for execution in ancient Persia. 
</P>
<P>
 Witchcraft, perjury, idolatry, adultery and man-stealing were among the 
offenses punished by death in the Massachusetts Bay Colony of the 1600s. 
Britain listed 350 capital crimes in 1780. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq reportedly executed dozens of merchants in 1992 for price-gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, executions were routinely carried out in public. Transfixed 
onlookers watched prisoners impaled, stoned, burned at the stake, garroted and 
beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the condemned generally are put to death with less fanfare. The most 
common methods of execution are firing squad, used in 86 countries, and 
hanging, in 76. Seven countries still behead criminals, and seven stone them to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Three supposedly more humane forms of killing prisoners -- electrocution, the 
gas chamber and lethal injection -- have been introduced in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notorious execution tool was the guillotine, which appeared during 
the French Revolution as a replacement for the ax and sword. It was both less 
brutal and more democratic. Before its arrival, beheading was only for nobles; 
commoners were hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The guillotine itself got the ax in 1981, as France joined its Western 
European neighbors in ending or restricting the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The first move in that direction had occurred in 1863, when Venezuela 
abolished capital punishment. Venezuela was joined by about 15 other countries 
in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 The abolitionist movement has gained momentum in the last three decades. 
Robert Badinter, a former French minister of justice and a leader in the 
campaign against capital punishment in his country, has observed: 
</P>
<P>
 "Paint in red the countries where the death penalty is used and in white the 
countries that are liberated from it, and almost country by country you will 
see that the map of freedom and the map of abolition fit exactly together -- 
with a few exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable exception is the United States, where 36 states have the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Watt Espy, an Alabamian who has compiled a history of the death penalty in the 
United States, said that he has documented 18,555 legal executions since the 
first one in Plymouth Colony in 1608. He said the actual number may be as high 
as 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, the peak 
period was the 1930s, when an average of 167 American executions were carried 
out each year, with a record 199 in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the number of executions in the United States and public support for them 
started to decline after World War II. Court challenges led to a moratorium on 
executions, beginning in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges and juries had imposed death 
penalties arbitrarily, in violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on 
"cruel and unusual punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later the high court clarified its guidelines, opening the way for 
executions to resume, and it subsequently overturned a number of legal 
obstacles once used to delay or block executions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, 215 executions have taken place in the United States, 186 of them 
in the South, according to the information center. 
</P>
<P>
 If one of the more than 2,700 inmates on U.S. Death Rows were executed every 
day between now and the end of the century, there would still be a backlog. 
</P>
<P>
 Public opinion in the United States has shifted during the last 
quarter-century. Recent surveys indicate that about 80% of Americans favor the 
death sentence for murderers. The number drops substantially when alternatives, 
such as life in prison without parole, are offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition appears to be stronger outside the United States. The European 
Parliament, the legislative assembly of the European Community, has called for 
action against capital punishment. The newly organized, Italy-based 
international League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty is working to end 
executions worldwide by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the chief argument in favor of capital punishment was deterrence. But 
studies of the deterrent effect have proved inconclusive, so the battleground 
has shifted to retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some crimes are so utterly detestable that the death penalty is the only 
means of providing victims and the public with the sense that justice has been 
fulfilled," said Carlos Zelaya of the Washington Legal Foundation, which 
supports capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International counters: "Just as criminal codes do not sanction the 
raping of rapists or the burning of arsonists' homes, still less is the 
deliberate taking of a life by the state an appropriate punishment for murder." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of capital punishment, the jury is still out.

MOHAWKS SEEK TO SAVE LANGUAGE, REVIVE CULTURE; NATIVE AMERICANS: DISMAYED AT 
THE COMMERCIALISM AND CASINOS, THEY BOUGHT 300 ACRES IN UPSTATE NEW YORK TO 
ESTABLISH A TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tom Porter is shedding the white man's "language of commerce." As 
Sakokwenionkwas, he will make a new life in the valley of his ancestors, 
speaking a tongue with roots in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year from now, I will speak only Mohawk," he said. "I will be a living 
example to the young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter, 49, is spokesman and spiritual leader of a group of Mohawks who have 
started a new community here in the Mohawk Valley, about 50 miles west of 
Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they plan to live simply, in harmony with nature, in keeping with the 
traditions of their Iroquois forebears who were driven from this valley 200 
years ago. It will be an "immersion community," where Mohawks will steep 
themselves in the language, spirituality, myths, rituals, values and culture of 
their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a language dies, anthropologists say 50% of your values and traditions 
and culture dies," Porter said. "Ours is a living language. If we are to keep 
it alive, we must speak it." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter is a solid man with hair worn in a ponytail. He has a careworn 
expression and fleeting smile. He speaks softly, slowly, savoring stories of 
history and prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole valley is the original homeland of my people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mohawk is one of the six nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, founded by 
the legendary chief Hiawatha. The Iroquois lived in palisaded villages across 
New York state when Europeans arrived in the 1600s. They controlled a territory 
stretching from Maine to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mohawk Valley, a major east-west trade and travel route in Colonial times, 
was a key battleground during the Revolutionary and French and Indian wars. The 
Mohawks had lived peacefully among the European settlers for more than a 
century. But Mohawk mercenaries, recruited by the British-educated Mohawk 
Joseph Brant, joined Tory massacres during the Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloody pay-backs by the Continental Congress forced the Mohawks to flee to 
their northern hunting grounds. Today, their descendants live on reservations 
at the Canadian border and in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a prophecy that one day, our great-grandchildren would come home to 
this valley," Porter said. "So now here we have returned." 
</P>
<P>
 "We call this place Kanatsiohareke (pronounced Ga-na-jo-hla'-ga). It means 
'place of the clean pot,' " Porter said. The word refers to the 12-foot-wide 
limestone potholes in a local creek bed. Nearby Canajoharie, home of Beech-Nut 
baby food, got its name from the same Mohawk word. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement has been Porter's dream for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a destiny for me, because of what my grandmother taught me -- to 
keep alive the traditional ways of the Mohawk people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to do that at Akwesasne, the St. Regis Indian Reservation 200 miles 
north along the Canadian border, home to about 9,000 Mohawks. He grew up here. 
He built a home for his six children, raised horses, netted fish, grew fruit 
and vegetables. His wife, Alice, was renowned for her beadwork. They lived 
simply, without electricity or other "trappings" of the commercial world. They 
spoke Mohawk and Choctaw, Alice's native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter served as an acting Bear Clan chief in the traditional longhouse 
government, which opposes the reservation's state-sanctioned elected Tribal 
Council. He helped start the 13-year-old Akwesasne Freedom School, with an 
elementary curriculum taught in Mohawk. 
</P>
<P>
 But Akwesasne, "Land where the partridge drums," has become poisoned, Porter 
said. The St. Lawrence River, which once fed the Mohawks a bounty of fish, is 
tainted with toxic compounds from industries upstream. The land, where Mohawks 
once had hundreds of farms and now have none, has been polluted by fallout from 
aluminum smelters and chemical plants upwind. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another kind of poisoning at Akwesasne, Porter said: a poisoning of 
the spirit, an erosion of cultural integrity. It comes, he said, in the form of 
bingo halls, cigarette smuggling, tax-free gasoline and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambling has stirred bitter disputes at Akwesasne between traditionalists, who 
consider it a vice that will destroy their people, and other Mohawks who say 
casinos are the key to their nation's sovereignty and economic survival. Two 
Mohawks were killed in a shootout over the issue in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The first house Porter built was burned during an uprising in 1979. Two of his 
beloved Belgian horses were poisoned. Porter has been shot at and arrested. Two 
years ago, he suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he and a band of like-minded Mohawks are making a fresh start at 
Kanatsiohareke, on a hillside overlooking the Mohawk River. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mohawks bought the 300-acre property for $210,000 at auction in July. 
There are three wood-frame residential buildings, a huge barn and auxiliary 
structures. The main house, built in the 1800s, needs many repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 A sparkling stream flows through a 200-acre forest and past the buildings. 
About 90 acres of tillable fields stretch to the river, which is framed by 
landmark crags called Big Nose and Little Nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Five families moved to the settlement last fall from Akwesasne and 
reservations in Ontario. More will come this spring. For now, they live in the 
rambling main house and share meals. One day they will build separate homes. 
The main house will function as the longhouse, the meeting place and social and 
religious center of the traditional Iroquois community. 
</P>
<P>
 They will seek to be self-sufficient, although some may hold outside jobs. 
Porter, who has worked as a cultural consultant for the North American Indian 
Traveling College in Ontario, plans a "pick-your-own" raspberry and strawberry 
farm. He wants to grow organic vegetables and raise beef cattle and perhaps 
buffalo. The community may raise trout in a "fish farm" along the creek or 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a shop selling books and native crafts, such as ash-splint 
baskets, moccasins, ribbon shirts and beadwork. Eventually, a learning center 
may be established for those who wish to study Mohawk culture and spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will attempt to get away from the idea of private ownership and 
competition among individuals," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Akwesasne, everybody's out for themselves," said Jayne George, 35, who 
lives at Kanatsiohareke with her three children. "Here, we're a community, 
living together, working together. Everybody has a say. Everybody shares." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mohawks had raised about $25,000 toward the land purchase by holding taco 
dinners and other fund-raisers at Akwesasne, and through donations, Porter 
said. They were able to keep that for living expenses when a group of private 
donors, who requested anonymity, put up the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real surprise, a blessing," Porter said. "They said the only 
repayment they want is for us to succeed, because the world needs examples like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Other blessings have been bestowed on the Mohawk homesteaders. Neighbors bring 
food. Dozens of volunteers, including Albany college students, join weekend 
work bees. A church donated furniture. The sheriff came by one day to mow the 
lawn. A professor volunteered advice on fish farming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like what they're trying to do here," said Jim Meyers, a retired carpenter 
from nearby Tribes Hill who puts in six to eight hours a day at the compound, 
doing repairs free and partaking in hearty meals of Indian corn soup. "It's 
nice to learn their ways. It's a slower life, a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how things have happened," Porter said. "We just had a dream, 
a desire, a hope that the Creator would help us. And every time there was an 
obstacle, someone came through to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter said the community fulfills the prophecy in an old Mohawk tale. In the 
story, Mohawk hunters bring home two snakes, one gold and one silver. The 
snakes grow huge and turn on their caretakers. One goes north and one south, 
leaving a path of destruction. The Mohawks are told to go to a hill to ward off 
the serpents.

CANCER CENTER TAKES ITS SKILLS TO RURAL VIRGINIA; ONCOLOGY: IT IS ESTIMATED 
THAT THE PROGRAM HAS SAVED ABOUT A MILLION MILES OF TRAVEL FOR SUFFERERS, WHO 
MUST GO TO RICHMOND ONLY FOR SUCH HIGH-TECH PROCEDURES AS RADIATION AND 
BONE-MARROW TRANSPLANTS.

<P>
 Some days, nurse Connie Deagle's job means chatting with Tamara Tuttle's 
daughter Susie about her favorite movies while her mother visits the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times it means helping to administer a complex form of chemotherapy 
through a patient's spine. 
</P>
<P>
 At night Deagle's job as coordinator of Rappahannock General Hospital's 
oncology clinic means taking calls at home from patients with questions about 
their cancer treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic at the 76-bed hospital is one of four cancer outreach partnerships 
that the Medical College of Virginia's Massey Cancer Center in Richmond has 
established at small hospitals in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Deagle, 39, who has lived in nearby Middlesex all her life, and her 
counterparts at the other clinics provide the human link that doctors at Massey 
say makes the project function effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know more about the individual patients than I do," said Dr. Christopher 
Desch, director of the program and one of two team oncologists. "When I say I 
don't know if this guy can get back and forth to Richmond, they say, 'Well, 
Uncle Barney can call Fred, and his next-door-neighbor's kid will take him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that a major obstacle to cancer treatment in rural areas is lack 
of access to specialized care, doctors at Massey created the program in 1989. 
Oncologists from the center visit the rural hospitals every two weeks to treat 
patients and train local doctors and nurses to administer chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients in these areas must travel to Richmond only for such high-tech 
procedures as radiation and bone-marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialists estimate that the program has saved about a million miles of 
patient travel. They say it has tapped into a new group of cancer patients who 
would refuse treatment if it meant driving to a big city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of people say, 'I'd rather die than come to Richmond,' " said 
Dr. Thomas Smith, the medical college's director of cancer education and the 
other team oncologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's cancer-mortality rate is the eighth-highest in the country, 
attributed in part to high levels of poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and 
elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer rates in other rural regions are rising, according to the National 
Cancer Institute. In his Sept. 22 speech on health-care reform, President 
Clinton called for more "strategic alliances between rural hospitals and urban 
health centers." 
</P>
<P>
 One in four Americans lives in the country, often far from hospitals with the 
latest technology. "They represent a substantial part of the nation, but 
they're a quieter, more stoic portion," Desch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Massey center's rural health-care venture began in South Hill, Va., a 
tobacco-growing community near the North Carolina border. That program's 
success led doctors to set up shop in Kilmarnock, a retirement and fishing 
community on the Chesapeake Bay, and in Farmville, a town in central Virginia. 
A similar program for nurses only was started recently in Grundy, near the 
Kentucky border. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's success hasn't meant profits either for the Virginia college or 
for the financially precarious hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Financing comes from an annual $250,000 state grant and $100,000 in hospital 
money and private donations. Most of the patients are on Medicare or Medicaid 
or are underinsured. 
</P>
<P>
 Rappahannock General hopes to open a new building soon for its overcrowded 
oncology clinic. Much of the $700,000 needed for the project will have to come 
from community donations, said hospital administrator Fred Baensch. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye toward creating a national model for rural outreach, the college, 
the country's fourth-largest academic medical center, is evaluating the overall 
financial impact of its program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can show that you can provide superb care at the rural hospitals and the 
rural hospitals can at least break even," Smith said. "What we can't show yet 
is that all rural hospitals can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some researchers say that one standard program for rural outreach 
won't work because of regional diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Massey program is only one approach to improving cancer care in rural 
areas," said Dr. Susan G. Nayfield, program director of cancer prevention and 
control at the National Cancer Institute. "There are other approaches that can 
be more suitable to the needs of other rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the University of Alabama, for example, are studying attitudes 
toward cancer in the state's rural "Black Belt," where beliefs about the 
disease differ from community to community, Nayfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The home-grown nature of the Virginia program accounts for its comparative 
success, Smith said. Some hospitals' idea of cancer outreach, he said, "is to 
get in a car with the chemotherapy, drive to a center, give it, bill it, then 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
 At Massey, clinical nurse specialist Cynthia Simonson is reachable 24 hours a 
day to answer phone calls from the rural hospital nurses she has helped train 
in oncology. In turn, the rural nurses handle patient phone calls that 
Simonson, Smith and Desch don't have time to take. 
</P>
<P>
 On "clinic day" at Rappahannock General, the one-floor hospital is bustling. 
Smith and Simonson arrive early for a day of back-to-back appointments with a 
dozen patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Deagle is at the hub, arranging for examining rooms and briefing the 
Massey staff on the patients she has treated in the previous two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Today she must perform one of her saddest duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Tuttle, a 62-year-old widow from nearby Irvington, has suffered from 
breast cancer for the last year. Only one of her three adult daughters, Susie, 
who is mentally disabled, lives at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie is with her mother when Smith informs Tuttle that her breast cancer has 
spread so much that she probably will die within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Deagle enters the room at the end of the physician's consultation, Tuttle 
begins to sob. As Deagle embraces her, she is more than a nurse. She is a 
neighbor and a friend.

'MT. DIOXIN'S' NEIGHBORS FEEL THREATENED; FLORIDA: THE 40-FOOT-HIGH WALL OF 
CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS EXCAVATED MORE THAN A YEAR AGO AND LEFT TO SIT. NEARBY 
RESIDENTS COMPLAIN OF BREATHING PROBLEMS, RASHES AND CANCER.

<P>
 Behind a chain-link fence, where someone hung a hand-lettered banner reading, 
"MT. DIOXIN," sits a 40-foot-high wall of contaminated soil covered with gray 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by homes and businesses in the middle of Pensacola, the mound marks 
the site of a defunct plant where wooden utility and foundation poles were 
treated with creosote for 58 years, until the plant closed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Dioxin and other toxic chemicals, suspected of causing cancer, were dumped or 
leaked there. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, some living only a couple of hundred feet away, contend the 
excavation of contaminated soil in 1992 compounded health problems they suspect 
were caused by the pollution. And they wonder why the Environmental Protection 
Agency hasn't finished the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we are stuck with it," said David Stallworth, who lives two 
blocks away. "That's why we are trying to get relocated." 
</P>
<P>
 But federal officials insist there is no immediate public health threat, so 
evacuations aren't warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth blamed the excavation for aggravating his bronchial condition, but 
no health assessment has been conducted to verify whether the pollution is 
responsible for breathing problems, rashes, cancer and other complaints of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA excavated to a depth of 45 feet and fenced the site. For more than a year, 
enough dirt to fill 12,500 dump trucks has waited for disposal. Formerly owned 
by bankrupt Escambia Wood Treating Co., the site has not been added to the 
priority list of EPA's Superfund program, the first step toward a permanent 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, no decision can be made on how to dispose of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The excavation cost about $4 million. The estimated cost of completing the job 
is at least $25 million and possibly much more. It could take two years or more 
once work begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in EPA's Atlanta regional office said they are pushing hard to get 
the project on the list. They made it one of the top three in priority among 
nearly 6,000 sites in the eight-state Southeast area, said Narindar Kumar, site 
assessment chief in EPA's regional Superfund office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware of all the concern on the part of the citizens and we've got 
congressional people also interested," Kumar said. It's a temporary solution." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, the site should be added to the list in mid-1994, he said.

addiction to garbage and grease. To others, he was a furry folk hero, beloved 
by tourists who brought him bread and honey. 
</P>
<P>
 He was nicknamed Split Ear, for an old battle scar. Now he's dead. His mammoth 
carcass was found in the woods on Aug. 28, five days after he was peppered with 
birdshot by a man sick of seeing the 680-pound bear around his dogs and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 But even months after his body was bulldozed into the forest floor, Split Ear 
remains larger than life, his name invoked by those on both sides of a 
long-simmering feud in the hamlets within the 6-million-acre Adirondack Park, 
home to about 4,000 black bears. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side are wildlife biologists and others who say feeding bears is bad 
for the animals and dangerous to humans. On the other side are people who say 
bears are gentle, fun to feed and a great tourist attraction. The state caused 
the problems in town, they say, when it shut down open-pit landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old Split Ear was King of the Hill at the town dump," said Eugene Conger, 64, 
a semi-retired mechanic who fed seven bears in his yard until the state made 
him stop. "He'd been eating there for 26 years, then the government closed down 
his 'restaurant.' Where was he supposed to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bear-feeding in Old Forge, about 100 miles northwest of Albany, has gotten so 
rampant that state officials plan to make it illegal by next spring, said Louis 
Berchielli, bear expert for the state Department of Environmental Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who feed bears "incidentally," by leaving crackers for deer or 
being sloppy with their garbage, may be subject to prosecution, he said. 
Legislation allowing the department to ban bear-feeding was signed by Gov. 
Mario Cuomo in August, along with updated hunting guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Conger said he started feeding bears in addition to deer four years ago, when 
a sow he calls Mabel came around. "She had been hit by a car and was hurt," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabel would come for breakfast and dinner. "Sometimes she'd be lying on the 
picnic table, waiting," he said. "I called it Mabel's Table." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, Mabel would gobble down a 5-gallon pail of grease-drenched pancakes 
and waffles donated by a local restaurant. A bakery sent 30 loaves of bread a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Conger would sit at the table with Mabel, hand-feeding her grapes, 
honey-soaked bread and maple syrup squirted from a plastic bottle. Other bears, 
including Split Ear, started coming after the dump closed two years ago. People 
came too, as many as 300 a day, to watch and feed the bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite the tourist attraction," Conger said. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors complained of traffic jams and cars parked on their lawns. 
Police were told of a man who let Mabel lick honey from the arm of his 
8-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a circus-like atmosphere," Berchielli said. There was no law 
against feeding. "But because there was such a high potential for someone being 
hurt, we went in (in the fall of 1992) and told him that if he didn't stop we'd 
treat it as a criminal nuisance case." 
</P>
<P>
 Closing down Conger's snack bar didn't get rid of Split Ear, though. Plenty of 
other people also feed bears, although not so publicly, Conger said. And there 
are always trash bags and trash bins to raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Mr. Conger stopped feeding the bears, Split Ear would still come and 
sit on his neighbor's porch," Berchielli said. "It kind of terrorized the 
elderly lady who lived there." 
</P>
<P>
 So in September of 1992, Split Ear was lured into a culvert trap (essentially 
a big section of pipe), drugged, and trucked about 12 miles to the Moose River 
Plains, a wilderness area rife with black cherries and other bear food. He 
returned to Old Forge in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they have to feed the bears because we closed the landfills," 
Berchielli said. "But Split Ear weighed 680 pounds (more than twice the normal 
weight of an adult male). His belly just about dragged on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry over Split Ear's death inspired local artist Richard Nadeau to 
design a T-shirt honoring him. It is selling briskly at his Moose River Trading 
Post in nearby Thendara, he said. Nadeau envisions a whole line of Split Ear 
artifacts, including caps and key chains, with some of the profits going to a 
fund for bear research and educational brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Celeste Nagle, who moved to Old Forge from Long Island with her husband, Gary, 
and opened the Black Bear Inn last July, said she doesn't mind the bears pawing 
through her trash. She fumes when she talks of Split Ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "That poor old bear just wanted something to eat," Celeste Nagle said, 
standing behind her bar beside several large, framed photographs of local 
bears. "He was never a threat to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Impassioned letters about Split Ear have become a regular feature in Old 
Forge's weekly newspaper, the Adirondack Express. 
</P>
<P>
 One writer penned a poem titled "An Ode to a Bear." Another, in "A Eulogy to 
Split Ear," wrote, "I will miss your silent lumbering and your dark, haunting 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald A. (Pete) Beckingham, who was fined $500 for illegally "taking" a bear 
out of season, told the newspaper that he had birdshot in his shotgun and only 
meant to drive Split Ear away, not kill him. He said the bear had been 
bothering dogs and children in his yard for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can thank a concerned citizen for doing what the paid conservation 
officers should have done last year," wrote Jim Capron, one of many who contend 
that the state should move nuisance bears farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 That just moves the problem, said Berchielli, because bears accustomed to 
handouts will seek people wherever they go. The solution is to change the 
bear's behavior by denying it access to garbage and goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Berchielli said Split Ear's fate is not unique. "Unfortunately, it's quite 
common" for homeowners to shoot scrounging bears, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Conger, he still has the company of about 15 white-tailed deer who eat 
100 pounds of corn a week in his yard. Mabel and her cubs still stop by for an 
occasional visit. But he misses feeding the bears, who gaze from poster-size 
photographs on his dining room walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were like part of my family," he said.

DEAD SOLDIER DRAGGED THROUGH SOMALI STREETS A MODERN-DAY UNKNOWN; MOGADISHU: 
PENTAGON SAYS NAMING THE MOB'S VICTIM SERVES NO PURPOSE AND WOULD ONLY PAIN 
THOSE WHO LOVED AND LOST HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Popeye Field watched the news that day both fearful and transfixed as a U.S. 
soldier was dragged like a dead dog through the dust of Mogadishu by jubilant 
Somalis. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that Tom? His Tom? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell my son's face, and his arms," said Field, his voice still thick 
with heartbreak since the death of the 25-year-old Army sergeant from Lisbon, 
Me. "My two sons and myself was all looking. Right now, I couldn't tell you for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 3, Tom Field was among the U.S. Army Rangers hunting the underlings of 
Mohammed Farah Aidid who were plunged into a bloody urban battle that left 18 
U.S. servicemen dead, 78 wounded and 300 or more Somalis killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The awful events of that day changed everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll was terrible enough, but one single, sickening sight -- a still 
photograph of a mutilated dead soldier, tied with rope before a jeering crowd 
-- chilled many who had continued to think charitably about the United States' 
purpose in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four days later, President Clinton announced troops would withdraw from 
their mercy mission within six months, by March 31, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal was not the fruit of victory; Somalia remained in deadly 
disarray. Instead, it was inspired in great part by the revulsion of the 
American people when they saw the humiliating spectacle made of that one slain 
soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 And, still, who he was remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Which mother had kissed that face, or which wife that mouth with its crooked 
teeth? Who once felt warm in those arms? 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 18 men killed by Aidid's supporters, five were reported missing until 
the Somalis returned their remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the only ones that could have been in that photograph," said Navy 
Cmdr. Joe Gradisher, a Pentagon spokesman assigned to field questions about 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he Sgt. Thomas Field, a skilled mechanic from a family of stock car racers 
whose father felt uneasy about his choice of an Army career? 
</P>
<P>
 Was he Staff Sgt. William Cleveland, 34, whose military heritage dated back to 
a soldier who died fighting on the Union side in the Civil War, and whose 
ambition since childhood was a life in uniform, like his father? 
</P>
<P>
 Was he Chief Warrant Officer Raymond Frank, 45, a pilot for 27 years who 
dearly loved flying? 
</P>
<P>
 Was he Sgt. 1st Class Randall Shughart, a 35-year-old from Newville, Pa., who 
so loved the military that he made his wife, Stephanie, promise never to ask 
him to quit? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was he Master Sgt. Gary Gordon, 33, whose funeral in Lincoln, Me., the 
papermaking town he left 15 years ago, drew hundreds of mourners? 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon's position is this: Naming the man in the picture serves no 
purpose, and would only pain those who loved and lost him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were American soldiers," Gradisher said. "That in itself is jarring 
enough. You don't need an individual's name to express horror at the treatment 
of the bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradisher said he did not know if the Pentagon had even identified the soldier 
in that indelible photograph -- taken by Toronto Star reporter Paul Watson and 
distributed worldwide by the Associated Press -- or other bodies shown in 
television footage. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP's effort to determine their identities required calls to relatives and 
others who knew the 18 men before the list could be narrowed to the five, whose 
names the Pentagon then confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those reached were these five soldiers' parents; widows had moved, had 
newly unlisted numbers or took refuge behind the shields military families 
learn to erect. 
</P>
<P>
 And some, who did not want to be quoted, said it was better to leave the 
grieving alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Nada Morford, the mother of William David Cleveland Jr., felt that way at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 She knew her son's stepmother had told a Virginia newspaper she recognized 
David as the man in the AP photograph, but Morford immediately protested, 
saying it was not her son. "I want him to rest in peace and let him go," she 
said then. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morford had only glanced at the picture in the newspaper weeks before, and 
the question gnawed at her. She went to the town library to make photocopies of 
pictures in a Time magazine article. And then she asked a reporter for the AP 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 She swallowed tears as she described how she pored over the pictures, how she 
found contours that seemed so familiar, but not enough for her to say with 
certainty the soldier in the photograph was her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son had black eyebrows and eyelashes," Morford said. "He" -- the soldier 
-- "had light hair, black eyebrows." But then, she said, she noticed that the 
legs and feet resembled David's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate to say this is positively my son, and have it be somebody 
else's," she said from her trailer home in Peoria, Ariz. Then, she began to 
cry. 
</P>
<P>
 In Clarksville, Tenn., Willi Frank thought she spotted her husband immediately 
in television footage. But even then, of the bodies she saw, she wasn't really 
sure which might be Ray Frank's. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before, she had learned Ray was missing. She studied CNN's continuous 
reports, mesmerized, sure each time she could pinpoint that achingly familiar 
indent of Ray's back surgery scar, the particular way he wore his short, 
graying hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time you're looking for identifying marks, you're praying there 
aren't any," Frank said, reflecting on that endless day. "I picked out the one 
that I hoped was him, because it looked like it had been the least mistreated." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, who was taken prisoner when his 
helicopter was shot down and later released, offers the five families at least 
some comfort: He believes all five men were dead before the Somalis got to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Durant will not publicly even attempt to put a name on the face in the 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to prove beyond any doubt," he said, "so why put the family 
through what they've already been through?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many among the families of the 18 dead told of trying to learn whether the 
unknown soldier was theirs, of quizzing the battle survivors at the funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some could barely speak for weeping; others said they found little relief in 
knowing the soldier in the picture was someone else's husband or son. 
</P>
<P>
 "That picture represents every parent's nightmare," said Caroline Smith of 
Long Valley, N.J., who lost her 21-year-old son, Spc. James E. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 When she buried her son in Ft. Benning, Ga., Caroline Smith learned from some 
of the men with him in battle that he had been shot and pulled inside a 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we happen to know that person wasn't our son," she said, "it 
could have been. It could have been."

U.N. SENDS DEPUTY TO ARISTIDE MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.N.'s chief trouble-shooter on Haiti will not be attending the weekend 
conference called by exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on the future of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations will send Colin Granderson, executive director of the U.N. 
operation in Haiti, and not chief mediator, Dante Caputo, to the Miami 
conference, a U.N. spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move apparently reflects doubts by the United Nations that the conference 
would have much impact in solving the Haitian crisis as well as disappointment 
with Aristide for killing a broad-based conference planned for December in 
Haiti, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, U.N. spokesmen say that Caputo could not go to Miami because he is 
at his home in Argentina and would not arrive in time. They point out that in 
addition to Granderson two officials from U.N. headquarters in New York will 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four nations serving as an advisory body on Haiti at the United 
Nations, the United States is sending Lawrence Pezzullo, Washington's special 
envoy for Haiti. France, Venezuela and Canada are sending medium-level 
delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide had originally excluded the military from the conference but then 
invited them, although it was doubtful they would attend. Diplomats also said 
it was not certain if representatives from the private sector would arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Many prominent Haitians had expressed a hope to attend, but were fearful of 
reprisals from the military if they said so publicly, Aristide's backers say. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials had pressed for inclusion of military representatives saying it 
would be harder to resolve the crisis if they failed to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed 
a conference he first backed in December called by Prime Minister Robert Malval 
in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, diplomats said there was a realization that the Haiti 
problem could not be resolved without Aristide, the country's first 
democratically elected president who warned U.N. officials months ago that the 
military would not restore democracy without an international force on the 
scene.

 A coal company and two employees have been charged in a methane gas explosion 
that killed eight miners in Virginia's worst mining disaster in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Southmountain Coal Co., Freddie Deatherage, superintendent, and foreman 
Kenneth Brooks were charged Thursday with 31 counts of failing to conduct 
safety tests that could have detected the buildup of gas, failing to dilute the 
gas and falsifying records to cover up violations. 
</P>

 A cigarette lighter ignited the gas in the 1992 blast.

CLINTON TO BRING HOME JEWISH BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton is bringing home seven books from his trip to Russia, 
marking a quiet breakthrough in a long feud over works claimed by the 
Lubavitcher sect of Hasidic Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orthodox Jewish sect claims a collection of 12,000 books and manuscripts 
that have been held by Russian authorities since early this century. 
</P>
<P>
 With Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's approval, Clinton's aides were able 
to obtain from the Russian Library seven books from the collection for turning 
over to the U.S. Library of Congress on a loan basis, White House officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's aides hope the release will begin an evolutionary process that will 
lead to a turning over of the collection to the Lubavitchers, a Brooklyn, 
N.Y.-based sect begun in Europe in the 1730s. 
</P>
<P>
 The books include writings on Jewish thought and teaching. They had been in 
possession of the sect until World War I, when the Germans advanced on Russia 
and the books were taken for safekeeping.

ORPHANED BABY ELEPHANT DIES IN CALCUTTA ZOO

<TEXT>
<P>
 A baby elephant, separated from a herd that had strayed off its fire-ravaged 
reserve and wreaked havoc in several towns, died in a zoo from infections and 
apparent loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried, but the little elephant is dead," A. K. Das, director of the 
Calcutta Zoo, said Friday. "She could not fight infections and probably the 
pain of being away from her mother was too much." 
</P>
<P>
 At least six people were trampled to death by the herd during its 10-day 
odyssey in early January that brought the herd as close as 60 miles to 
Calcutta, a city of 10 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The herd has since returned to its forest home, but it left behind two baby 
elephants and a young female.

'SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME' GAINS DOCTORS' ATTENTION; PEDIATRICS: WITH A TINY BABY,

 Micah Radcliffe, healthy at birth, was fighting for his life at 3 1/2 months 
after a brain injury his mother said happened when a baby-sitter shook the 
infant for fussing and refusing to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he was going to die," said Kristina Radcliffe, sitting with the 
doctors who saved him. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Micah is beating the odds. Although he hasn't fully recovered and now 
suffers from cerebral palsy, his progress is surprising his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some people don't realize the dangers of shaking small children, the 
threats to infants of "shaken baby syndrome" are gaining recognition in the 
medical community. 
</P>
<P>
 The sitter, meanwhile, faces a charge of aggravated child abuse, a felony that 
carries a prison term of up to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm blessed. How far Micah has come," said Radcliffe. "I didn't know whether 
I could keep him, whether I could be the mother he needed. But I knew in my 
heart it was what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 He was lethargic, ashen and convulsing when she rushed him to the emergency 
room at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital last March. His eyes were protruding, 
then rolling back. She gently patted his face to keep him awake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Santamaria, head of pediatric emergency services, and Dr. Daniel 
Plasencia, director of pediatric intensive care, took care of Micah for the 
next six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many babies with head injuries who end up in ICU die in the first 24 hours," 
said Plasencia.

 "We see children who do not do as well as Micah, or die in front of you," 
added Santamaria. 
</P>
<P>
 They operated for a brain clot, kept Micah on a respirator and in intensive 
care nearly three weeks. At 5 months, he went home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was blind and deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a single mom with no family. It was devastating. Micah had three 
surgeries, a shunt from head to belly. He was just an infant and going through 
all these horrible things," said Radcliffe, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 11 months, Micah's hearing has returned and he can see. At times he 
wears a patch over his right eye to strengthen it. It crosses in and eventually 
may require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The cerebral palsy has robbed him of his strength on one side. Doctors say it 
probably will be a year before they know the severity of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Plasencia had not seen Micah in some time. He hugged the smiling baby and 
tears welled in the doctor's eyes. "We usually don't get a chance to see the 
results of what we do," he told the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child can fall three floors and not get as seriously injured as a shaken 
baby," said Debra LaFlam, the hospital's child advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 With a tiny baby, the brain is loosely attached. It hemorrhages when it slams 
against the skull. Neck muscles aren't developed, so when a baby is shaken the 
head flops back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, Plasencia compared it to the force of a ball rolling around in 
a box -- banging from one side to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have signs of injury with just one shake," said Santamaria. "I don't 
think people realize what kind of damage can be done. And there is a lifetime 
of tragic consequences to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to be put out of business," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization of 45,000 
pediatricians, published a statement about shaken baby syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an extraordinarily high incidence of morbidity and mortality among 
infant victims of shaking," it said. "In one series . . . 60% died or had 
profound mental retardation, spastic quadriplegia or severe motor dysfunction." 
When these severely injured children survive, they may be blind or develop 
brain damage, the academy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radcliffe lost her job during the ordeal. Her life began to revolve around 
doctors and therapy. "For a long time I felt like I was going crazy and not 
able to share my frustrations with anyone else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She blames herself for her son's injury, saying she didn't have the money to 
hire a sitter and relied on a friend she knew through church. 
</P>
<P>
 The sitter, John Mark Mitchell, 27, has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors accuse 
him of aggravated battery by forcibly shaking Micah.

U.N. HEALTH GROUP REPORTS AIDS INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An estimated 3 million people worldwide have developed full-scale AIDS since 
the disease was first identified in the late 1970s, the United Nations' World 
Health Organization said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a twice-yearly report, it estimated that about 14 million adults and 1 
million children have developed the HIV infection -- which WHO and many leading 
medical authorities say causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimates -- far higher than formally reported figures -- represent an 
increase of half a million AIDS cases since the last report in July and of 1 
million in the incidence of adult HIV infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Reported AIDS cases totaled 851,628 across the globe at the end of December, 
against 718,894 last July, WHO said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while one half of these were reported by developing countries, the U.N. 
body said it believed Third World states accounted for over three-quarters of 
actual cases. 
</P>
<P>
 African accounted for 35.5% of reported cases, but 67% of the estimated 
incidence of the disease since the 1970s, the report said. The United States 
accounted for 40% of reported cases but 13% of the estimated total.

STRANGE SILENCE SHROUDS SUICIDE FOR HIRE; ILLINOIS: A WOMAN IN PAIN AFTER A 
MASTECTOMY ASKED AT LEAST FOUR NEIGHBORS TO KILL HER BEFORE SOMEONE AGREED. 
POLICE WONDER WHY NONE OF THE OTHERS SPOKE UP. 
</P>

<P>
 Susan Potempa's husband and son found her battered body in the garage after 
returning from a Thanksgiving football game. At first, police called her death 
a random act of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Then an even more disturbing story unfolded. The 50-year-old woman, racked by 
pain after a mastectomy for breast cancer, had asked at least four neighborhood 
men about arranging a murder before finding a jobless 18-year-old who police 
said took her life for $2,100 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't the neighbors who knew Potempa well know how desperate she was? Why 
would she go to such lengths to end her life? Why didn't the men she solicited 
for murder tell authorities? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen murders for 36 years," Police Chief Anthony Corbo said. "I've seen 
bloodier and more gruesome murders, but never a murder like this with the 'for 
hire' aspects and so many people (who) had inklings of it and (had) not come 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it hard to believe that people would keep to themselves and not pick 
up the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicious spending pointed to Reginald Williams, an 18-year-old who lived 
less than three blocks from the Potempa family, and he told a friend that he 
had killed Potempa, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend contacted police and agreed to tape a conversation with Williams, 
leading to his arrest in early December. He is in jail in lieu of $350,000 bond 
on a charge of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim's willingness to be murdered is irrelevant," Cook County State's 
Atty. Jack O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Susan Potempa lived in a split-level house on Selma Street in this 
blue-collar Chicago suburb for more than 20 years, neighbors said. They always 
greeted people with a smile and a wave. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Susan Potempa's breast cancer was diagnosed. She had a mastectomy, 
but the surgery left her in excruciating pain, said neighbors who often drove 
her to the hospital when she was too sick to drive herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Ingram, who lives a few houses away, said Susan Potempa asked him several 
months ago if he knew anyone who would "bump someone off." 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't mention who it was . . . . She said, 'I'll pay money,' " Ingram, 
20, told the Daily Southtown newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kind of blew her off," he said. "Anytime I'd see her I'd say, 'Yeah, 
I'll find someone,' but I didn't want nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Susan Potempa drove Williams to her house on Thanksgiving night, 
when Williams allegedly tried to strangle her and left with the $2,100 after 
she lost consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 But she survived and tracked him down so he could finish the job, authorities 
said. Police said Williams succeeded the second time, strangling her with an 
electrical cord and hitting her over the head with a power drill. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Potempa was found two days later when her son and husband returned from 
an out-of-town football game. They have refused to talk with reporters. Police 
said there is no evidence that her family knew of her plans. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley also said there is no evidence that she arranged the murder to 
preserve insurance benefits.

NEW MOMS EMBRACE LIFE AND DREAM OF A BETTER WORLD FOR THEIR BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE DREYFOUS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's dreary out; rain is falling sporadically along the commercial route to 
St. Peter's Medical Center. Hospitals, too, are often dismal -- uncomfortable 
places full of sickness and death. 
</P>
<P>
 But up on the fourth floor, none of this is on the agenda. Men, grinning 
nervously, trail their laboring wives with cups full of ice. And everywhere, 
small pink bundles of new life squirm, gurgle and, occasionally, squall. 
</P>
<P>
 More babies are delivered at St. Peter's each year than almost anyplace in the 
United States. The hospital is renowned among medical professionals for its 
expert newborn care. But the nearly 6,000 women who check out each year 
remember it mostly as the place where it all starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Awesome. Fearsome. Full of intrigue and boundless dreams. A new child 
represents hope, and the all the potential of an enormous canvas that has not 
yet been splotched with a single color. 
</P>
<P>
 During these first days, several mothers took the opportunity to sit back and 
contemplate the world that awaits their new babies. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't "remarkable" moms. They don't plan on making headlines; they 
aren't single, or teen-aged, drug-addicted, poor or particularly troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 With their husbands, they are simply trying to make their way among life's 
roadblocks. Their concerns are common: child care, racism, violence, sexism. 
They imagine a safe and open world -- one in which their children will feel 
welcome. Ilene Davidson and Brianna 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Brianna will be an aspiring woman in the world. I know how difficult 
it can be," says Ilene Davidson, balancing her 7-pound-10-ounce daughter on her 
belly. 
</P>
<P>
 She is stretched out in Room 36, a freckle-faced blonde. Her hair looks 
amazingly good and she wears an open, engaging smile. She doesn't hold back, 
although she is bashful when the tears start to flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," she says, "but my hormones are a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 So much emotion, so many physical changes in these first days. Davidson has 
done this before. She's the mother of Justin, a rambunctious 4-year-old. But 
having a daughter is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow it seems like boys and men make do in this world. Women have to 
struggle a little harder," says Davidson, 32. "But my mother wanted me to have 
a daughter so I would feel what she has felt: very, very close." 
</P>
<P>
 Widowed young, Davidson's mother reared her children alone. She was always 
there for Ilene and her sisters, always made time for dinner together, for 
sharing secrets and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is so demonstrative, full of caring love. If anybody ever said anything 
about one of her daughters, she got her back right up," Davidson says. "I 
absolutely believe in equal rights, and I want my daughter to feel the same 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Being there, Davidson firmly believes, is half the battle. So her husband, a 
fire marshal, is working three jobs. And she has given up work at a day care 
center near their home in Dayton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many women who are not fortunate enough to be able to stay at 
home. I saw it in my child-care business every day. It's so hard on parents. It 
rips them apart," Davidson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful that I'm lucky. I had a choice. Somehow, somewhere, somebody 
needs to provide for a choice. We've got to find a way to provide financial 
assistance to parents -- moms or dads -- who want to stay home." Eva 
Gondor-Feher and Paul 
</P>
<P>
 At 46, Eva Gondor-Feher's face is more deeply lined than those of the younger 
mothers on the ward. But beyond her age, she is remarkable for her tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried very hard to get pregnant," she says. Her first husband didn't want 
children; she lied to him and tried to get pregnant anyway. But nothing seemed 
to work. Doctors eventually told her she could not bear children. 
</P>
<P>
 She divorced, then married a man who welcomed the idea of fatherhood. Somehow, 
the impossible happened: They had a son, Peter, followed in April by a new 
playmate, baby Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 She likes boys, believes sons are easier to rear. But one thing nags at her: 
the state of the world and the wars they might be called on to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard from my parents about the destruction and pain, the loss. My father 
was exiled in Siberia. I don't want my kids to see this kind of sadness in 
their lifetime," says Gondor-Feher, an immigrant from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Her elder son looks up, a little forlornly, with his huge eyes rimmed by long 
lashes. He knows her feelings on the subject. "I don't think Peter likes it 
that Mom doesn't let him play with (toy) guns," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I won't let him play with those kinds of toys. I'd rather spend double on 
a Lego set. That's something he can use to build. Guns destroy. I want my sons 
to build -- contribute something -- in this world." Margaret Allgood and Troy 
</P>
<P>
 Two-day-old Troy Allgood has some big shoes to fill. His dad is a hulking 
former football player well known around their hometown for his work with 
United Cerebral Palsy and anti-drug campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 His dad is black, his mom white. The couple thought carefully before marrying. 
They knew that society is not always friendly to interracial unions, or to the 
children born of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of concerns about the world they'll inherit," says Margaret 
Allgood, who also has a 2-year-old daughter. "We talked a lot about interracial 
kids before we got married. We wanted to make sure we were strong enough and 
together enough to deal with whatever might come." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Allgood says, it takes a lot of guts to have kids today. She 
worries that her son will face pressure to be cool, act tough, act out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we're going to do everything we can to protect him, bring him up 
with the right values," says Allgood, 35. "You have to make all sorts of 
decisions for these little people. You want them to grow up right. You need to 
prepare them, and give them so much support." 
</P>
<P>
 She'll soon be going back to work as district sales manager for a leather 
goods company. It's not exactly ideal, but for now it makes financial sense. It 
will also mean "juggling." Three-fourths of women with children under 18 have 
to do it these days, guilt and conflict and all. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son! My son! We're so excited about his future. Mommy and Daddy are doing 
everything they can to prepare for their children's futures, so they'll have 
everything they need: a good education and options in life." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, the questions and doubts are always there: "Can you do it? Will 
they turn out all right? Can you do it? " Maureen Sullivan and Meagan 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Sullivan has no doubts. She's tough. She's got answers and opinions 
and a surfeit of strength. But the huge, mushy spot at her center still seeps 
through in a flash. All she has to do is think of Meagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do whatever I have to to make her safe and happy and comfortable in the 
world," says Sullivan, 32, who has another daughter, 2-year-old Erin. "My girls 
need to be educated and strong and they need to know what they're up against 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 That's no feminist philosophy, she's quick to say. That's simply reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula for strength, she believes, is family. And community. And, in her 
case, a moderate dose of Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the only way to correct the crime rate, the drug situations, a lot of 
the situations that come up, is to start at home. You know, these children 
today aren't being taught values, right and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a huge commitment, which is why Sullivan and her husband were married 10 
years before embarking on parenthood. She wanted no distraction, no competing 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years I wondered whether to have kids at all," she says. "First, my 
career -- I'm an office manager -- was very important. Then I just wasn't 
ready. Then there was always the excuse that we couldn't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, the Sullivans got their house in order. If it meant her 
husband, a lumberyard operations supervisor, had to do a little construction on 
the side, fine. If it meant fewer meals out, less time alone, two hours instead 
of 15 minutes to do an errand, fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just pulled our marriage together and made the place for children," 
Sullivan says. "And I wouldn't trade it for the world. There's nothing more 
important than having a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have great hope for my child's future. I hope she's as happy as I am. And 
it's easy, really. You don't have to have a lot of material things or money in 
the bank. My kids can talk to me, have faith in me, believe in me and be my 
friend. These are the things that count. These are the things that make 
happiness."

SON BUILDS HIS DAD'S COFFIN IN LABOR OF LOVE; MORTALITY: NEW HAMPSHIRE MAN 
CRAFTS A PINE BOX TO COMPLY WITH FATHER'S WISHES. "IT CAN BE VERY SAD AND YET 
VERY UPLIFTING," HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADOLPHE V. BERNOTAS, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his back yard workshop, Ignatius MacLellan has almost finished building the 
pine coffin that awaits his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strong box, 6 feet 9 inches long, 2 feet 4 inches wide, 21 inches 
high. As coffins go, it is a bit on the long side to accommodate his 6-foot-3 
father, who is dying of prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The elegant box is finished like fine furniture. Made of the clearest pine, it 
has a cherrywood cross inlay at the head. Plugs cover countersunk screws. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have told him building the casket for his 67-year-old father is 
morbid. But others have told him they find his devotion moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly makes you aware of your own mortality and it can be very sad and 
yet very uplifting," the son said. 
</P>
<P>
 Too sick to travel from his home in Barrington, R.I., his father, S. Joseph 
MacLellan, probably will not see the casket over which his son literally shed 
tears "when the box was transformed into my dad's coffin." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLellan, 34, a lawyer for the state, likes to work with wood and write. In a 
first-person newspaper account of his project, he recounted that he blurted 
out: "I will build it!" when his father wondered where he would get a plain 
pine coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 But MacLellan found there was much more to the job than simply building a box. 
In his narrative, he recalled his and his family's plodding progress by phone 
through cemeteries and funeral homes and Rhode Island state agencies to nail 
down laws governing burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since people die every day, you would think answers could easily be obtained. 
Not so," he wrote. He found it frustrating dealing with reluctant funeral 
directors, but humorous to hear them refer to the dead as "patients." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLellan said some morticians became evasive when he made his unusual request 
for details on burial in a homemade coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 The most helpful, MacLellan said, was Raymond Romano of the Wilbur-Romano 
Funeral Home in Warren, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never had a request about a homemade coffin," Romano said in a telephone 
interview. But he gave MacLellan the information he sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say they want to be buried in a pine box," Romano said, "but 
when it comes time they end up with the standard commercial casket," usually of 
steel and wood. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLellan's work is almost complete. "I haven't decided about handles for the 
coffin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that decision, he will visit Horace Bailey, who also happens to live in 
Bow, about three miles to the south in a log house he built himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey has been building pine caskets since 1981, but until recently MacLellan 
did not know that. Bailey, proprietor of Pine Tree Products, thinks he is the 
only full-time finished pine coffin maker in northern New England. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who read MacLellan's narrative in the Sunday Monitor, said he will 
advise MacLellan to install rope handles, the kind he puts on the 200 coffins 
he makes each year and sells almost exclusively to funeral homes in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey went into the business when he was laid off as an architectural 
engineer. He called upon the skill with which he had built a pine coffin for a 
stage play two decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand why people want to be buried in a pine box. When I croak, I plan 
to be buried in one of my boxes," the 67-year-old native of Newbury, Vt., said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine coffins, Bailey said, appeal to people "who want something simple and 
dignified, hand-crafted -- and not something glitzy with satin, something that 
lights up and plays music." 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry Cabot Lodge and his wife are in my boxes," Bailey said.

NAACP CHIEF DISCOVERS IT'S HARD TO PLEASE ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME; CIVIL 
RIGHTS: IN TAKING THE HELM LAST YEAR, BENJAMIN CHAVIS SET OUT TO INJECT NEW 
LIFE INTO THE GROUP. HE WOUND UP SPLITTING HIMSELF DOWN THE MIDDLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The demands flew at Benjamin Chavis under a hot summer sun at an outdoor rally 
here. With sweat soaking his suit collar, he tried to placate reporters, senior 
citizens, NAACP officials on cellular phones and his 2-year-old daughter, who 
was demanding her daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be able to please everyone at rallies, but it is nearly impossible in 
the world of civil rights. This was Lesson No. 1 for the new head of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
 In taking the NAACP helm eight months ago, Chavis set out to inject new life 
into the civil rights group. He split himself down the middle, working with 
offenders and the offended, on each issue he came across. 
</P>
<P>
 That drew critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives branded him liberal. Liberals labeled him conservative. Old 
people said he's too young to have historical perspective. Young people 
complained that, at 45, he's too old to sense the future they face. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people, Chavis said in an interview, simply don't know what to make of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a responsibility to make sure we're not just kicking up dust. That's 
been one of the problems," Chavis said. "A lot of people go out here and stage 
publicity stunts and then nothing derives from it after the public attention 
has gone away. Brothers and sisters want a change." 
</P>
<P>
 His first order of business was to make the NAACP more visible in poor 
communities, where the group was considered out of touch. Then he moved to the 
corporate arena, in search of money to build an endowment that would keep the 
NAACP out of a financial hole. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pulled together a motley array of politicians, businesses, street gangs 
and civil rights outsiders like Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan, who was 
considered untouchable for his criticisms of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to his selection, I don't think the people of urban America had as much 
entree to the NAACP's power as we have now," said Carl Upchurch, head of the 
Council for Urban Peace and Justice, which spearheads a national truce effort 
among street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The inner-city effort disturbed some on the NAACP's board of directors, which 
was leery of using NAACP resources to aid the gang truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's being met with severe challenges from his board. That will limit 
his ultimate involvement with what we're trying to do," Upchurch said. "But he 
personally has maintained all along that he supports us. That's a starting 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to please his board, Chavis created an unhappy public, some of whom 
felt he had tied his hands by agreeing to work in tandem with board chairman 
William Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NAACP simply can't operate effectively with Siamese twins at its helm," 
wrote USA Today columnist DeWayne Wickham. "The prevailing mood is that Chavis, 
in agreeing to power-wielding . . . , William Gibson's terms of power-sharing, 
offered up his manhood as well," wrote editors of One, a publication for black 
professionals in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis denied that Gibson restrains his leadership. He said there was "a lot 
of rancor" between Gibson and the previous executive director, Benjamin Hooks, 
to which people apparently had grown accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, people are lamenting that there's no power struggle," Chavis said. "Dr. 
Gibson and I have engaged in serious discussion on a number of issues. The fact 
that, at the end of the discussion, we are on the same page is significant, 
healthy. I don't see that as weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis also is battling rumors that his relationship with Jesse Jackson, with 
whom he had competed for the NAACP post, is unfriendly and uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Jackson are congenial, Chavis said. They have displayed no outward 
signs of the contentiousness that rose between them over the NAACP job before 
Jackson quit the campaign out of discomfort with a proposal to broaden Gibson's 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fellow freedom fighters," Chavis said. "I believe we have established 
a good working relationship. There is no sense of competition or antagonism 
between us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people salivate at the thought of fights. I don't. The African-American 
community is better served when African-American leaders stop fighting each 
other and work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson questioned Chavis' maneuver in striking a $1-billion, 5-year agreement 
for jobs and minority-owned franchises with the parent company of the Denny's 
restaurant chain, after allegations of racism by the restaurant surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations that Denny's served black patrons so slowly that it effectively 
denied service are winding through federal courts. Chavis' early dealings with 
Denny's ran counter to Jackson's traditional strategy: Side with the victim in 
court, and make up with the offender later. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis insisted the NAACP has not bargained away its ability to criticize 
Denny's. "To have an agreement with the NAACP does not give any corporation 
immunity from our scrutiny and, if necessary, confrontation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he and Chavis have "operational unity," and are not disagreeable. 
"We work together and share concerns," Jackson said. "The right thing to do is 
to have functional, operational unity. The last thing to do is attack each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in unity. I really believe in it," Chavis said. "But I also know 
unity does not happen by osmosis. There are both external as well as internal 
contradictions that have to be overridden." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the time, Chavis is alone on that unity stump, most recently at 
November's gang peace summit in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis tried to arrange a private meeting between himself, Jackson, Farrakhan 
and Congressional Black Caucus chairman Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) to follow up on 
their pledge to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 There were private meetings, between Chavis and Jackson, then Chavis and 
Farrakhan. Jackson left without joining the meeting with Farrakhan; Mfume was 
not there. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan told the crowd at Mosque Maryam that he respects Chavis' 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I can unite with Dr. Chavis," Farrakhan said. "We're not attaching 
ourselves to labels. We're attaching ourselves to principles. Our unity is not 
a sham. It's real."

<P>
 The man who pleaded guilty to killing five outdoorsmen in Ohio was ordered to 
pay $5 million to a victim's widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lee Dillon avoided the death penalty by pleading guilty in July to 
shooting the men from 1989 to 1992 while they hunted, fished or jogged. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims included Gary Bradley of Williamstown, W.Va., whose widow sued, 
seeking $5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble County Common Pleas Judge John Nau ruled in her favor Thursday. Dillon 
was not in court and there was no lawyer there representing him.

COMPROMISE PRODUCES SCENIC RULES FOR NEW JERSEY'S MAURICE RIVER -- IN PEACE; 
ENVIRONMENT: THE BODY OF WATER IS HOME TO MANY THREATENED SPECIES AND SUPPORTS 
SEVERAL INDUSTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Meandering past country homes, historic farmhouses and ancient Indian 
settlements, the Maurice River is home to many threatened species and a 
stopover for migratory birds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the river is also the lifeblood of economically depressed Cumberland 
County, supporting what's left of the area's fishing, food-processing and 
shipping industries. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal government effort to preserve the ecology and beauty of the Maurice 
could have turned into a battle between environmental and economic interests. 
Instead, it became a model for future conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Maurice and its tributaries were added to the federal Wild and Scenic 
River System last year, it was one of the few times the National Park Service 
followed the lead of riverside communities and industry rather than forcing 
unwanted preservation on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've broken the mold," said Patricia Charnas Weber, chief of the Park 
Service's National Rivers and Trails branch in Philadelphia, which oversees 
Wild and Scenic River System activities for the mid-Atlantic region. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past when the agency considered including a river in the program, 
officials would conduct "perfunctory review of public comment and sentiment, 
and then they would go ahead and do their own thing," said Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 But a compromise plan for protection of 35 miles of the Maurice and its 
tributaries -- which took six years and hundreds of hours at contentious 
community meetings in five municipalities -- has been agreed to by all sides: 
government, environmentalists and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Its success could result in the conservation of more Eastern rivers, such as 
the Maurice, which run primarily through private property. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be applied to several rivers currently under Park Service study, 
including the Farmington in Connecticut, the Concord in Massachusetts, the 
Merrimack in New Hampshire and a 70-mile segment of the Lower Delaware that 
borders 55 municipalities and six counties in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hopes for it and, frankly, it's probably the only way we're going to 
get rivers that flow primarily across private lands into the national system," 
said John Haubert, who oversees studies of rivers for inclusion in the Wild and 
Scenic program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which just celebrated its 25th anniversary, aims to preserve the 
nation's free-flowing rivers with outstanding attributes. More than 10,500 
miles of waterways have been designated, with about 90% on public land 
primarily in Alaska, Oregon, California and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maurice and its three tributaries, the Manumuskin, Menantico and Muskee, 
carry pristine water from southern New Jersey's million-acre Pinelands National 
Reserve to the Delaware Bay. Its banks are lined with wild rice and hardwood 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The waterways are home to more than half of New Jersey's threatened species of 
plants and animals, including the federally endangered bald eagle, peregrine 
falcon, short-nosed sturgeon and a globally endangered member of the pea 
family, the sensitive joint vetch. The river is a critical stopover for 
migratory birds on the Atlantic Flyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is also home to people who rely on the river for their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us are born and raised around here. All we wanted was to be left 
alone and have an opportunity to make a living," said Jack King, 65, often a 
spokesman for the area's commercial fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who has made his living off the river since 1958, said he signed on to 
the management plan after receiving assurances his side would benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 He and George Garrison, mayor of Commercial Township, said the promises 
included a waste-water treatment plant, the dredging of the mouth of the river 
-- approved in 1944 by the Army Corps of Engineers but never financed -- and 
exclusion from the Wild and Scenic designation of the Maurice's last seven 
miles before it empties into Delaware Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N.J.), who worked closely with all sides, said the 
dredging and the treatment plant are going forward, but are not linked to the 
river management plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fauerbach, 47, also has strong ties to the river. His family has lived 
along its banks for eight generations; some of them were schooner-sailing sea 
captains. In 1979, Fauerbach co-founded an environmental group, with a vague 
notion of saving the waterways from pollution and development. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent overcast day he showed visitors tree stands along the river's 
banks and on its islands that are favorite roosts for the area's few bald 
eagles. A great blue heron circled Fauerbach's small motorboat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Jake," Fauerbach said. "Not a lot bothers him. He knows my voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Fauerbach was a leader in the fight to win designation for the river, which 
began in earnest Feb. 14, 1986, when the New Jersey Hazardous Waste Facilities 
Siting Commission listed Maurice Township as a potential plant location. 
</P>
<P>
 That outraged environmentalists. It also led members of New Jersey's 
congressional delegation to request a study on the river for possible inclusion 
in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hughes decided that no plan would go to Congress until the five affected 
municipalities had signed on and written their own river management plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had such difficulties over the years in our region with some 
environmental initiatives, we agreed one of the ground rules was that we would 
build a consensus," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently did the last holdout, Commercial Township, come aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the longest while I was the one black sheep," Mayor Garrison said. "But 
it was a matter of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commercial Township is 34,000 square miles with 5,000 people. We have the 
highest unemployment and highest public assistance rates in the entire state. 
We don't have any major industry. The two main means of economic subsistence 
are sand mining and commercial fishing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the river protection plan is a watered-down version of the 
National Park Service's usual standards. 
</P>
<P>
 It limits but does not stop development, designates the distances houses and 
septic tanks must stand from the river and regulates some types of land use. It 
also leaves open the door for designation of the river's last seven miles.

FEDERAL FARM-LENDING POLICIES QUESTIONED; AGRICULTURE: GENERAL ACCOUNTING 
OFFICE SAYS THAT FORGIVEN OR REDUCED LOANS TO FARMERS COST TAXPAYERS $7.6 
BILLION FROM OCTOBER, 1988, THROUGH JUNE, 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Few things are more politically popular than stopping the auctioneer's gavel 
so family farmers can stay on the land, even though the gesture can cost 
taxpayers billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people respond to images of struggling families losing not only their 
livelihoods, but the roofs over their heads. So it wasn't hard for Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy, new on the job, to announce last March he would block 
foreclosures that had not yet gone to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically strapped farmers complained they were not being treated "by the 
book," as Espy had put it. A good number weren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 1,090 potential foreclosure cases that farmers had asked to be reconsidered 
during the moratorium, 398 were handled incorrectly, the Farmers Home 
Administration says. Farmers did not appeal 1,800 more potential cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 35% overturn is very high and it means that there's real problems with the 
agency decision-making," said Tim Sullivan, staff attorney with the Farmers 
Legal Action Group, an advocacy group in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael V. Dunn, the new head of the FmHA, said the bulk of errors came from a 
misunderstanding of the 1987 law that liberalized how the agency handles 
delinquent loans. Dunn cited a lack of training for the county officers and 
supervisors who deal with farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cases were returned to the states. Still, a procedural flaw doesn't mean 
that the outcome will be any different. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we will have given them the benefit of the law," said Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be the only benefit for a while if the cost-cutting mood in 
Washington prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 As lender to beginning farmers and other high-risk borrowers, the agency's 
generosity, encouraged by Congress, has proven costly. The General Accounting 
Office says that forgiven or reduced loans cost taxpayers $7.6 billion from 
October, 1988, through June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO says the law lets farmers take on more debt even if they are behind on 
what they already owe. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting on Vice President Al Gore's proposals to reinvent government, the 
GAO said the lending policies were one of the "fundamental issues" the 
Administration failed to address. 
</P>
<P>
 FmHA has more than 225,000 outstanding direct loans worth nearly $14 billion. 
Of that amount, $4.2 billion is delinquent, representing one-fourth of the 
loans as of Sept. 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn says information acquired during the moratorium will make it easier to 
administer the lending program. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that screamed at me is we have to do a better job of providing 
supervised credit," he said. That means sitting down with borrowers, working 
with them to design an operation that they can reasonably manage, looking at 
sources of profit and loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I making money on the hog operations? Am I losing it on the cattle 
operation? How much does it really cost me to produce a bushel of corn? What's 
my best market strategy for that?" Dunn explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, of the Farmers Legal Action Group, said that supervision would go a 
long way. Previously, agency officials urged farmers to take on larger loans 
and build bigger, more diversified operations than they asked for. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural disasters also helped push farmers over the financial edge, Dunn said. 
In 404 of the cases reviewed, hail, drought, flooding or another local 
catastrophe caused the hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means a great deal to us with the drought in the Southeast and the 
floods in the Midwest," he said. "We're giving directions to our people out 
there that we have to get out in front of these natural disasters and work with 
these borrowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even with reforms, the FmHA portfolio will always look worse than what 
commercial banks can offer, said Dunn.

JAIL LOOK-ALIKE IN A HAIRLESS ESCAPE

<P>
 A convicted murderer broke out of St. Petersburg's oldest prison by posing as 
his cellmate, the chief warden said Friday. It was the first escape in the 
prison's 115-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Datsishin had recently begun serving a 15-year term for murder and 
robbery in Kresty, a prison built in 1879. Datsishin shared a cell with eight 
other prisoners, including Viktor Smirnov, who was finishing a six-month 
sentence for failing to pay alimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnov and Datsishin resembled each other physically and just before 
Smirnov's term ended, both men shaved their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresty had a reputation for being impossible to break out of, and few 
prisoners have ever tried, Warden Stepan Demchuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess which one was asleep and which one strode out when the other's name was 
called.

HOLOCAUST NIGHTMARES LED TO BOOK ABOUT LIFE IN DEATH CAMP; LITERATURE: NEITHER 
SHERRI SZEMAN NOR ANY MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY WERE IMPRISONED. SZEMAN IS NOT EVEN 
JEWISH. BUT, SHE SAYS, THERE WERE VOICES IN HER HEAD DEMANDING TO GET OUT. "THE 
KOMMANDANT'S MISTRESS" WAS THE RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES HANNAH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherri Szeman's nightmares about being in a Nazi concentration camp would not 
go away. So she wrote about them, and they did. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a powerful, detail-rich novel titled "The Kommandant's Mistress" 
that suggests a firsthand account of life and death in World War II Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that neither the 37-year-old poet-professor nor any members of 
her family were ever in a concentration camp and are not even Jewish. In 
addition, Szeman knew little about the Holocaust until she began researching 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was young I've had nightmares that I was in the concentration 
camps, and I don't know why," Szeman said. "As I got older, they got more and 
more intense. Pretty soon they were waking me up. Finally I just decided it was 
a message." 
</P>
<P>
 Szeman said she is surprised at the success of her book. 
</P>
<P>
 The 273-page novel is in its fifth printing, with 10,000 copies published, 
according to Rose Carrano of HarperCollins Publishers. The book is being sold 
in the United States and eight foreign countries, including Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel portrays the relationship between the commander of a Nazi 
concentration camp and the Jewish inmate he makes his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is divided into three parts, first giving the commander's narrative, 
then the inmate's story, and finally straightforward, antiseptic biographies of 
the two as they might have been presented in a history book. 
</P>
<P>
 Szeman (SEH-mon) said she used that format "to make you think about what we 
call truth and what we call history, and that there is no absolute truth, and 
even history is biased. It is always through a human perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 The details of the novel are what fascinate readers -- from the black human 
soot that pours from chimneys of the camp's ovens, covering everything with 
grime, to the mayhem and terror that greet Jews as they arrive at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Szeman said many people who read the book, including survivors of 
concentration camps, believed that she must have been there to be able to write 
such a story. But she insists the details were from her dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "If their voices woke me up, they would not let me go to sleep until I got up 
and wrote it down," she said. "It would be like they were hammering on my head 
from the inside, saying, 'You have to write this down."' 
</P>
<P>
 Author Patrick McGrath, who reviewed the book for The New York Times, called 
it powerful -- "a startling fresh take on the psychology of the victims of the 
Holocaust and the perpetrators." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a novelist does not have to experience a phenomenon firsthand to write 
about it effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a certain way, the Holocaust isn't history," McGrath said. "It's somehow 
still with us. . . . In a sense, we're all still working with it. Whether one 
was present or whether one's family was involved is sort of irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Szeman, who is single, was born in Dayton and reared in the area. She is an 
associate professor at Central State University in nearby Wilberforce, where 
she teaches English literature and creative writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I was 7 years old, I wanted to write," she said. "And by the time I was 
12, I was writing stories. By the time I went to college I made the decision to 
be a writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Szeman pursued a career in education to support herself while she was writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first years of her writing career were devoted to poetry. She said an 
earlier novel took her three years to write, but that she could find no 
interest among publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did everything wrong," she said. "But I think it taught me how to write 
fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Szeman began writing poems about her dreams about 10 years ago. But she said 
that the poems kept getting longer and that when she stopped writing them, the 
nightmares about the concentration camps would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I heard the kommandant's voice saying, 'Tell my story,' " she 
said. So in 1991 she decided to try another novel. 
</P>
<P>
 She began reading books on World War II Germany, viewed documentary films and 
even interviewed survivors of concentration camps. Then she went to work on her 
home computer, finishing the project in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In her novel, Szeman uses what McGrath calls a "switchword style," in which 
scenes change abruptly, turning on a single word or theme. She said it was 
designed in part to force the reader to pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was just trying to imitate how your mind operates," she said. "It's 
like stream of consciousness in a way, but it's much more focused because I 
don't see the point in rambling."

 When E.J. Crane, 28, a postdoctoral fellow at Bowman Gray Medical School in 
North Carolina, wants to know how fast a particular enzyme reaction occurs, he 
can calculate it on his Macintosh computer. But that would take 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Crane uses the Mac to sign onto the international collection of 
computer networks known as the Internet and hook up with a more powerful 
computer at a hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C. On it, he can perform the same 
calculation in a minute -- using a program made available on Internet by 
Washington University in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, Crane signs onto Internet to send messages to his brother in 
Minnesota, discuss ideas with other biochemists across the country and copy 
three-dimensional images of protein molecules from a national database in 
Upton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet -- clusters of large computers linked to high-speed long-distance 
phone lines -- is radically changing the way professors and students carry out 
their missions. By making all kinds of information available to anyone with an 
Internet account, the network has begun to blur the differences between big 
universities -- with their big computers and big libraries -- and smaller 
institutions. The computer links also encourage long-distance collaboration, 
allowing isolated scholars and academic newcomers to tap into the collective 
wisdom in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Internet users say titles, sex, race and other distinctions fade, because on 
Internet, everyone is just an address. "It's a great leveler," said University 
of Richmond professor Elizabeth Gruner. "Anyone can ask anything . . . and 
anyone can respond." 
</P>
<P>
 But universal, round-the-clock access makes Internet a mixed blessing. Highly 
addictive, it encourages users to spend hours communicating via computer with 
distant friends and colleagues rather than with the person down the hall. Many 
users, under the guise of participating in academic discussions, spend hours 
reading and responding to obvious, repetitive inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Internet often encourages scholars to ask for help rather than carry out their 
own research, and some professors are worried that it will devalue individual 
accomplishment and encourage intellectual laziness. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial optimism in this technology has faded considerably," said Robert 
Jay, art department chairman at the University of Hawaii. "Green graduate 
students . . . now seem to believe they can ask the rest of the (people on the 
network) to do the most basic bibliographic research for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some are concerned that Internet's capacity for transferring large files at no 
cost may encourage the proliferation of low-quality electronic journals that 
publish papers rejected by more established publications. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, however, Internet has embedded itself in academic life. 
Consider these developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Trotter Hardy, a law professor at the College of William and Mary, has 
organized two academic conferences entirely on Internet. For each, he chose a 
topic -- one was the impact of electronic mail on teaching law -- and invited 
as many as 25 people to participate. They exchanged electronic messages for 
three weeks, then Hardy compiled and sent out a transcript, entirely on 
Internet. For professors without time or travel money, such conferences help 
compensate for a lack of mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harvard University's government department has created a special Internet 
file to help its job-hunting graduate students. With a quick Internet query, 
recruiters at other universities can get copies of the students' resumes, their 
published articles and sections of their dissertations. "I know of three cases 
where recruiters learned of our students from our (Internet) service and 
invited them to apply before the positions were officially announced," said 
government professor Gary King, who set up the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Solveig C. Robinson, a University of Chicago graduate student, stalled 
in her research into "Shafts," an obscure 19th-Century publication, she posted 
a query on "Victoria," a list of about 600 scholars interested in the period. 
"Within 48 hours, I had a couple of responses that put me in touch with a woman 
from Texas who had done some work on 'Shafts' . . . and we pooled our notes," 
Robinson said. "Since she hadn't yet published anything, there was really no 
other way for me to know about her." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rochester Institute of Technology mathematician Stanislaw P. Radziszowski 
has spent 3 1/2 years working on complex logic problems with an Australian 
colleague, one of only a few mathematicians who had the necessary expertise in 
algorithms and computer programs. The pair, who are in the forefront of 
programming computers to do formal reasoning, have met in person only three 
times and talked on the phone perhaps four times, but they communicate via 
electronic mail three or four times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Internet, "our joint work would have been rather impossible," 
Radziszowski said. "Our computers very often work simultaneously on the same 
problem. . . . They use the same data, and we check each other's results by 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
 * Many universities offer courses to long-distance learners on Internet. 
Students carry on class discussions, work on group projects and submit their 
papers entirely on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two or three years, Internet has become ubiquitous in the academic 
community: Although non-academics usually pay for access, most universities 
offer free accounts to students, faculty and staff members. Many academics now 
turn first to e-mail and Internet instead of the telephone when they need to 
reach someone. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars simply type up a message of any length, address it, push the send 
button and whoosh, the electronic letter goes out on the information highway. 
The next time the recipient signs on, the message will be there, waiting to be 
read.

 A JEWISH THANKS: In Chapter 3 of the novel "Schindler's List" -- now the 
season's most talked-about movie -- author Thomas Keneally writes about Leopold 
Pfefferberg, one of the Jews saved by factory owner Oskar Schindler. It was 
Pfefferberg, now Leopold Page, who first told the story to Keneally, a UC 
Irvine writing teacher. . . . Today at 4 p.m., Keneally will be honored with a 
special humanitarian award by the Jewish Community Center in Costa Mesa. Page

 DUAL FUEL: County officials have taken a couple of major steps toward 
eliminating its fleet of pollution-spewing diesel buses. For one, they've 
ordered 15 electric buses. These buses will mainly run to and from rail depots. 
. . . Also, county tests on alternative-fuel buses have finally been completed. 
Propane beat out natural gas and methanol as the cleanest -- and cheapest. The 
next step is to line up a supplier. Transportation chief Stan Oftelie calls the 
test results "a technological breakthrough."

 ROAD SHOW: The Chapman University Chamber Orchestra began 23 years ago, and in 
all that time it's had only one director: John Koshak. On Monday, he takes its 
34 members on a 22-concert, 12-day California / Las Vegas tour. . . . Koshak 
says the annual road tour "helps our students build confidence, and they 
develop tremendous comradeship." But there's another reason to tour: 
Recruitment. Koshak adds: "It introduces Chapman to a lot of people who may not 
have heard of us."

 POG HEAVEN: Collecting pogs -- or trovs -- has become such a hit here that pog 
tournaments are the latest craze. The next one: At the Parkview Center in 
Irvine on Jan. 29. . . . Pogs are colorfully designed milk bottle caps, usually 
$1.25 for five. Collectors play a game to win or lose them with friends. "It's 
a cross between trading cards and marbles," says Bill Hodson of TROV U.S.A., 
who'll run the Parkview event. Entry is free. Hodson says his profit will come 
"after the newcomers are hooked on the game."

FASHION FUROR; TOUGHER SCHOOL DRESS CODES RAISE QUESTIONS OF SAFETY AND RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trend toward tougher dress codes at Ventura County schools -- from high 
schools down to kindergarten -- is touching off a growing debate among school 
officials, students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is whether clothing restrictions enhance student safety and academic 
performance or whether they are an overly hostile reaction to current fashion 
that infringes on constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by a new state law that allows schools to ban clothing associated 
with gangs, school officials across the county are proposing and enacting dress 
regulations that range from forbidding baggy, oversized clothing to banning 
shorts and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators say such regulations protect students from being mistakenly 
targeted in gang violence and encourage children to work harder in school. 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents, students and school officials say such rigid rules interfere 
with children's First Amendment rights to free expression. And they question 
whether all children in short pants should be lumped with hard-core gang 
members in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes away their rights, their freedom and their responsibility," said 
Cheryl Baron, whose daughter attends an Oak Park middle school that decided 
this month to forbid oversized clothing. "We all have rights and we all have 
free will and anytime it gets interfered with or stepped upon, I think it's out 
of line." 
</P>
<P>
 While some school officials link clothing to classroom performance, other 
education experts question whether there is any real evidence that student 
dress has any impact on school performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen any study that showed a connection between style of dress and 
academic achievement," said Pedro Noguera, a UC Berkeley education professor 
and trustee for the Berkeley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning clothing that school officials associate with gangs is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, one Ventura County school district after another has 
prohibited students from wearing apparel marked with gang symbols -- in some 
cases banning all baseball caps because some have been associated with gangs. 
The new law on dress codes that took effect Jan. 1 simply gives schools the 
state's backing for such policies, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 But some schools are going further. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, school officials are moving to establish a back-to-basics 
elementary school that would have the strictest dress code of any public school 
in the county: Boys would have to wear collared shirts and slacks, while girls' 
attire would be limited to dresses or long pants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura parents are excited about the prospect of sending their children 
to a school where they will not be distracted by what their classmates are 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a discipline thing," parent Terrie Torres said. "It keeps 
them more focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Unified School District Supt. Joseph Spirito agreed that requiring 
students to dress more formally for school may encourage better discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way you dress is the way you behave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At schools that already have dress codes tougher than the norm, officials say 
the restrictions work. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista Fundamental School in Simi Valley has had a restrictive policy on 
student apparel since the school opened 12 years ago. Students may wear jeans, 
but may not wear shorts except on certain designated days. Girls who dress in 
leggings must wear blouses long enough to cover their hips. And no one can come 
to school with orange or purple hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Sheila Robbins said she has noticed that when the school's 
kindergarten through sixth-grade students do wear shorts, they don't behave as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that there's a correlation between how students dress and how they 
behave," Robbins said. "When they dress appropriately and they dress like 
they're going to go to work, then they get their work done and their studies 
improve. When they dress like they're going to go to the beach or something 
like that, then we find we have more behavior problems and they seem to get 
less work done in class." 
</P>
<P>
 Noguera at UC Berkeley agreed that students who wear outlandish attire may 
distract their classmates. "There are extremes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said many urban schools nationwide are introducing school uniforms or 
establishing other strict dress codes to protect their students against rampant 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Noguera said it is unclear why school districts in relatively low-crime 
suburban areas such as Ventura County are instituting blanket bans against 
oversized clothing and similar types of apparel in addition to blatant gang 
attire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems kind of like a conservative backlash against anything that seems 
related to rap culture," Noguera said. "It probably just is a reaction to the 
popular fashions for young people, which many people find objectionable -- the 
baggy clothes, the sagging pants." 
</P>
<P>
 School districts that attempt to ban all clothing deemed to be gang attire 
might be going too far, Noguera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new state law allows schools to set policies banning gang attire only if 
the clothing is linked to a particular gang, he said. "These policies, unless 
they are very clearly identified with gangs -- such as insignia -- verge on 
violating civil liberties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local clothing retailers said the grunge look of baggy trousers and 
extra-large flannel shirts might have originated with some gang members, but is 
now a firmly established fashion trend among law-abiding, middle-class youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all hip-hop," said an assistant manager at the Contempo Casual clothing 
store in The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks. "As far as it being gang wear, I don't 
really associate it to that." 
</P>
<P>
 And some students contend that it is ridiculous for schools with no 
gang-related problems to institute bans on so-called gang attire -- especially 
among younger children in lower grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park student Ryan McCusker said he is upset about a new ban on oversized 
clothing at Medea Creek Middle School, which he attended two years ago and 
where his sister is now a student. Medea Creek officials have said the ban, 
which takes effect Feb. 1, will protect students from being mistakenly targeted 
in gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just, like, stupid," 15-year-old Ryan said. "There's no gangs out here 
that are going to shoot Medea Creek kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Oak Park school board president conceded that the affluent 
community has no gang problems, he said the state education code allows schools 
to ban clothing that is considered dangerous or disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If boys are wearing their pants so low that their underwear shows -- which 
seems to be the latest style -- that can be considered distracting or 
disruptive," board President Robert Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the city with the biggest gang problem in the county -- Oxnard -- 
takes a more tolerant view of some of the current youth clothing styles. Oxnard 
school officials have resisted broad clothing bans, and some police officers 
question the usefulness of dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police respond daily to incidents of young people getting assaulted 
simply because they happen to be dressed in clothing that is clearly gang 
attire, said Gino Rodriguez, youth services officer for the Oxnard Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got kids that are being stabbed, shot, beat up, strictly by the 
clothes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, however, Rodriguez conceded that the current outfits favored by 
Oxnard gangs are very recognizable: baggy white or black T-shirts worn with 
oversized gray or green work pants that are frazzled on the bottoms and slit 
partly up the outside seam. 
</P>
<P>
 The gangs differentiate themselves by the initial on their pants belt buckle, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Sgt. Chuck Hookstra said gang members also dress in baggy shorts 
or cutoffs that come down to the knee, but they always wear long white socks 
that prevent any skin from showing. The current style for Oxnard gang members 
also favors a particular type of athletic shoe with stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hookstra said baggy short pants alone don't mark a child as a gang member 
in Oxnard. And Rodriguez said youths whose clothes deviate from the standard 
gang outfits, such as by wearing a red T-shirt, are not likely to be mistaken 
as gang members by youths from rival groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Because gang members will always be able to find a new clothing style to 
identify themselves, dress codes have little benefit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not, per se, for banning clothes," Rodriquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in Oxnard said they have no plans to adopt a dress code as 
stringent as that at Medea Creek in Oak Park. Nor do they have plans for a 
back-to-basics school such as the one now under consideration in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District, which includes five large high schools 
in Oxnard and Camarillo, already forbids students from wearing certain types of 
head gear and clothing, such as black Los Angeles Raiders jackets, which are 
identified with certain gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supt. Bill Studt said he draws the line at banning entire clothing styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a kid wears baggy pants doesn't mean he's a gang member," Studt 
said. "Thirty years ago it was white Levi's that kids wore. Now it's baggy 
clothes. Personally I think it's a style thing." 
</P>
<P>
 A principal at one of the Oxnard district's high schools said she would prefer 
to see students dress more formally for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids still do come in the grungies," Hueneme High School Principal Joanne 
Black said. "I would like to see the kids better dressed." 
</P>
<P>
 She worries, however, that forbidding young people from expressing themselves 
through dress might encourage them to rebel in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids like to show their originality," Black said. "They have done that from 
time immemorial in their dressing. The problem is if you take this outlet away, 
will they do something that is even worse? They might do face decorations or 
something. Our kids are very creative. When you step on one thing, they'll come 
up with something else." 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents said they believe adults place too much emphasis on giving 
students freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda Garrett's son attends Pierpont School in Ventura, which she hopes will 
become the district's first back-to-basics school next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is less enthusiastic about the rigid dress code proposed for the 
school than a plan requiring parental involvement and enforcing strict 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 And Garrett acknowledged that the proposed dress regulations would force a 
drastic change in the dress habits of her 9-year-old son Tommy, who does not 
own a pair of long pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wears shorts rain or shine," Garrett said. "He's a beach kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Garrett said she believes a stiffer dress code can benefit 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we get a little too worried about that kind of stuff with kids . . 
. about their creative expression," she said.

 Oliver Mefford didn't end his love for the sky when he sold his airplane and 
gave up his pilot's license last year at the age of 92. He just switched to 
sky-diving. 
</P>
<P>
 Mefford took his first leap from an airplane recently in tandem with an 
experienced sky-diver from an airport near Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going from zero to 180 miles an hour right off the bat -- that was quite a 
thrill," Mefford said. "We did several things coming down -- spins and 
wingovers where you turn to one side and then the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Four seconds into the dive, his sky-diving partner, Pat Wilson, opened a small 
chute to slow them down. Mefford said he had to keep his arms folded across his 
chest at the start of the 10,500-foot jump "so we wouldn't flop around." But he 
stretched his arms wide in classic sky-diving fashion after the small chute 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 They opened a larger chute about 5,000 feet to cushion their landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't seem to be scared," Mefford said. "I guess I've done enough stunts 
in a plane that it didn't seem to bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mefford and his brother, Dwight, now 81, became pilots in 1937 when Oliver 
Mefford was 36. They played such major roles in developing a municipal airport 
in their hometown of Tulare that it bears the name Mefford Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Mefford often has done things at an older age than most folks. He was 
an Army flight instructor during World War II while in his 40s and served a 
couple of terms on the Tulare City Council in his 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 He belonged to a group called United Flying Octogenarians for 80-something 
pilots but had to quit when he turned 90. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely that Mefford's sky-dive will make the Guinness Book of World 
Records. J. R. Taylor, co-owner of Skydiving West, said Mefford is older than 
the listed record holder, but a 95-year-old sky-dived over Arizona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mefford said he agreed to sky-dive only to raise some money for his hometown 
Rotary Club's charities, not to set a record. And he feels once was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a thrill when you first step out, but there's no use for me doing 
it anymore," Mefford said.

INTIMATE ELITE COLLEGE COMBINES THE ETHEREAL WITH THE DOWN-TO-EARTH; EDUCATION: 
DEEP SPRINGS GIVES STUDENTS THE CHANCE TO STUDY NIETZSCHE IN THE MORNING AND 
PUNCH COWS IN THE AFTERNOON. THE 26-STUDENT, ALL-MALE INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA 
DESERT IS DEBATING WHETHER TO ADMIT WOMEN.

<P>
 Smack in the middle of nowhere, just off a shimmering ribbon of desert highway 
north of Death Valley, sits one of academia's best-kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Isolation defines Deep Springs College. Isolation, and the unique opportunity 
to study Nietzsche in the morning and punch cows in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people have heard of this college and cattle ranch founded in 1917 by L. 
L. Nunn, an obscure electric power magnate. Dedicated to training a select few 
for lives of leadership and service, the institution has been quietly producing 
future ambassadors, politicians and college deans for the better part of eight 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition, room and board are free. But to be admitted to this elite enclave 
between the Eastern Sierra and the Nevada border, students must be very smart. 
And they must be male. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Monday night, the 26 students at Deep Springs gather in the college's 
ramshackle main building for public speaking, one of two required subjects (the 
other is composition) at the liberal arts institution. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent night, the speech topics were race, class or gender. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-white, all-male, mostly middle- and upper-middle-class student body 
was representative of none of the subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put the bleach down," began Damon Rich, a student from St. Louis. "Who is a 
person without their skin?" he asked his audience, which included a lightly 
snoring dog. "Who is a person without their gender?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rich is criticizing political correctness. His college, founded three years 
before women in this country were allowed to vote, faces growing criticism for 
barring females. 
</P>
<P>
 The real topic of discussion at Deep Springs, one that affects its future and 
its funding, is whether this select clubhouse should accept women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should go coed," said Deep Springs President Sherwin Howard, who 
came here 16 months ago. "I arrived here thinking that, and I still do. But my 
thinking is more ambiguous now. It's not so clear-cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard is also concerned about this term's all-white enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year about a third of our students were minorities," he said. "We need 
to work harder on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Springs was set up to be a utopian experiment in self-sufficiency, run by 
students who earn the nation's top SAT scores. In exchange for their year-round 
education, students must work at least 20 hours a week on the 3,000-acre ranch, 
helping to care for cattle, chickens, pigs, horses and an organic vegetable 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus consists of 12 ranch-style buildings. The nearest outpost of 
civilization is Big Pine, a spit of a town 30 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two fundamental rules here: No drugs or alcohol and no leaving this 
desolate, breathtaking valley except during term breaks or with special 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment is limited to 26, and students stay for no longer than three years. 
They are expected to transfer to prestigious institutions such as Cornell, 
Harvard, Yale or the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep a permanent state of flux, faculty members may stay a maximum of six 
years, and the college president stays no more than three. Like the professors, 
presidents usually arrive on sabbatical from other universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Student committees do all work, including admissions, curriculum and 
reinvitation (students must be invited back for a second year). 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, on loan from Utah's Weber State University, has begun a nationwide 
tour of Deep Springs alumni groups. Armed with a recently completed 64-page 
survey on the advantages and disadvantages of going coed, his mission is to 
find out how both scenarios would affect donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Started by an endowment from its founder that now totals about $4.5 million, 
Deep Springs operated last year on a budget of about $500,000. More than half 
that amount came from private contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some graduates and previous contributors now refuse to donate to an all-male 
college, Howard said. Others won't give if women are admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said he hopes to resolve the issue, once and for all, during his three 
years here. The college's Board of Trustees, which has voted down coeducation 
in the past, may vote again this year, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's survey of 350 former students, parents and others found that 
respondents were evenly divided on the issue of coeducation. So are the current 
student body and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Office manager Iris Pope, who has worked at Deep Springs for 11 years, is 
vehemently opposed to coeducation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a woman, and if it was discriminatory, don't you think I'd say so?" said 
Pope, affectionately described by fellow staffers as never having felt an 
opinion she didn't express. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't do the posturing they'd do if women were here," she said. "They 
end up being better male communicators. This forces them to talk to each other. 
They learn to really deal with each other, without sexual pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't have to come here. If you want the coeducational experience, go 
to the other 99% of colleges that are coed." 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Springs is more a state of mind than an institution of higher learning. 
Nunn, who made his fortune by building the country's first alternating-current 
power plant, intended it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The desert has a deep personality; it has a voice. Listen to the voice of the 
desert and you will receive from it enthusiasm and inspiration," Nunn wrote in 
1923. 
</P>
<P>
 He also envisioned his college as an oasis from an "evil system" corrupted by 
all manner of "material device and sensual pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people live here, including students, male and female professors and 
ranch hands. All proclaim the college's introspective isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I've become a substantially different person," said 19-year-old 
Travis Beck, a second-year student from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I came here I was on this naive and epic quest to understand all of 
life. I was a renaissance dork," said the serious-minded young man who began 
his previous night's speech by quoting Nietzsche's preface to "The Birth of 
Tragedy." "I think I've become much more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 For fun, students like to shimmy naked down a nearby sand dune, or sleep 
outside under a blanket of stars, staring at the highly visible Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its isolation, life is full here. Work and schooling are undertaken 
with equal seriousness. If the dairy boy doesn't milk the cows, there is no 
milk for breakfast. Public speaking and committee work produce endless hours of 
discussion and soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 There are rarely more than six students in a class; sometimes there are only 
two. The curriculum changes with each term. The current course list includes 
anthropology, American pragmatism, ecological physiology and an independent 
study class in German translations of Nietzsche. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Logue, 18, arrived here in June from Waterford, N.J., knowing little 
about horses and less about cows. Logue read about Deep Springs in "one of 
those college books" and applied. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the opportunity to be a cowboy of sorts, and to work a ranch, that 
lured him. "The uniqueness of an experience like this, 26 people, all men, in 
the middle of nowhere," he said. "I probably will never experience life on a 
ranch anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the college's most distinguished graduates are former Democratic U.S. 
Rep. Jim Olin of Virginia, former University of Rochester President Robert L. 
Sproull, writer William Vollman and former U.S. Ambassador to Singapore Edwin 
Cronk. 
</P>
<P>
 Olin, who retired in January after 10 years in public office, calls his three 
years at Deep Springs "tremendous" and a major factor in his choice to become a 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 73, he entered Deep Springs in 1938 and became student body president. "I 
got the biggest kick out of the fact that the students had a lot of authority," 
he said. "That leadership experience was a very strong factor in later life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also was very much influenced by the debates that we used to have with each 
other, the intimate, very deep conversations that we would have with other 
fellas." 
</P>
<P>
 Olin is active in fund raising for the college, and has slowly begun to think 
that barring women is no longer a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really raises the question of whether we're training these students in the 
right way to become leaders," he said. "My youngest daughter went to Dartmouth, 
and she got elected to an honor society where she lived in the same house with 
men. Used the same bathroom. She got along fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Logue, who was drawn to Deep Springs because of its all-male student 
body, now second-guesses himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, I was very strongly in favor of it remaining all male," he 
said. "But I don't really think it's fair for all the females who could come 
here and have a great experience."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TIGERS MANAGER RIGHT AT HOME WITH HIS FANS

<TEXT>
<P>
 One by one, Matthew Huml of Newbury Park handed up his baseball glove, a 
wooden bat, an autograph book and a baseball for George (Sparky) Anderson to 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the 6-year-old sheepishly asked the Detroit Tigers manager the greatest 
number of hot dogs that bulky Tiger outfielder Cecil Fielder has eaten in one 
sitting before a game. Anderson leaned forward and flashed a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six," he said, pausing to gauge the boy's wide-eyed reaction. "But maybe more 
before he came," he concluded with a gravelly laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of children lined up Friday evening at St. Paschal's Baylon Church in 
Thousand Oaks to rub shoulders with Anderson, a member of the parish, who has 
wintered in Thousand Oaks for 28 years. The free event was open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm in Thousand Oaks, I'm totally at home," Anderson said. "I know 
everyone in this town by face. They have always shown me courtesy. I have never 
been bothered." 
</P>
<P>
 Signing pictures, sharing baseball tips and answering questions from children 
and adults alike is fun, "because I always believed this is what real life is," 
Anderson said. "The other part is not the real world. It's make-believe."  
</P>
<P>
 Sean Lindsay, 11, of Newbury Park said the children like Anderson because he 
is always patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll sign anything you want," Sean said, displaying the baseball and glove 
he had autographed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryann Bensman brought her 8-year-old son, Kenny, for the event. But her 
enthusiasm rivaled the boy's. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be in the Hall of Fame someday," Bensman said of Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Always playing coach, Anderson said he likes to use the attention his fame has 
afforded him to teach children important lessons about life. He told the crowd 
an anecdote about a man in a car who followed him home one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he stopped to ask the gawker if he needed help, but the man 
replied that he had come only to steal a glance at Anderson's digs. "I thought 
you would have a much bigger house," Anderson said the man exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson concluded, "A big house and money -- if that's your ambition, you've 
failed before you've begun." BRENDA DAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CONSTRUCTION OF TWO CATCH BASINS TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting to protect more than 200 homes and several bridges, the federal Soil 
Conservation Service has awarded $2-million worth of contracts to build debris 
catch basins in two canyons outside Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 The basins, designed to trap sediment that washes down hills stripped bare by 
last fall's fires, will be built in Adams and Fagan canyons by Radich 
Construction of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Work will begin Wednesday and will probably take 40 days, said Sheri Klittich, 
a field officer with the Soil Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the basins will not be completed until late February, they will be of 
little help in preventing mudslides during this winter's rainy season. But soil 
experts believe that the hillsides denuded by the Steckel wildfire will take up 
to a dozen years to recover fully. Thus, the basins will be helpful in 
protecting homes during future rainy seasons, Klittich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger of mudslides surfaced after the fire roared through the canyons, 
charring the vegetation that normally anchors topsoil and prevents dirt from 
slipping down hills during rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it this way: We wouldn't be building these basins unless we thought there 
was a hazard," Klittich said. "The (ditches) will be large, but over time they 
should blend in and not be too unsightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's emergency watershed protection program will pay 75% 
of the cost of the basins. The Ventura County Flood Control District will pay 
the remaining cost. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OJAI; RECYCLING PLAN GIVES REDUCED TRASH FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Customers taking advantage of an improved recycling program in Ojai will pay 
less for trash pickup service, under a new franchise agreement between the city 
of Ojai and E.J. Harrison and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-year plan, which stipulates that 5% of gross revenues be given to 
the city, upgrades the company's commitment to recycling, particularly among 
commercial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our experience with (E.J. Harrison) in the past has been very positive," 
Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley said. "There's a mutual interest because this city 
is small enough for them to try out something new and make us a model from 
which to work for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers recycling more materials, resulting in fewer solid wastes, would 
fall into a lower monthly service category. But the agreement also proposes 
rate increases of between 4% and 12% for residential and commercial service. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, minimum residential service would increase from $17.59 to 
$19.09 a month; basic service would rise from $20.81 to $21.65 monthly; and 
high-volume service would increase from $31.71 to $35.75 every month. 
Commercial fees also would be raised between $5 and $17 a month, if the new 
rates are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 E.J. Harrison officials have not asked for a rate increase in Ojai since 
August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is scheduled to become effective Feb. 1. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; FBI SEEKS SUSPECT IN 5 BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI is looking for a man suspected of robbing five banks in Ventura County 
in the last six months, as well as two other banks during that same period in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI released a photo of the man taken by closed-circuit cameras during a 
robbery Jan. 11 at the Great Western Bank in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect appears to be in his 40s, about 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weighing 
195 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the seven robberies, the man has handed a teller a note asking for 
money and warning that he has a weapon, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other robberies in Ventura County were at the Great Western Bank in Port 
Hueneme on Dec. 18; Bank of America in Camarillo on Aug. 6; Bank of A. Levy in 
Thousand Oaks on Aug. 3, and at the First State Bank of the Oaks in Thousand 
Oaks on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Crime Stoppers has offered up to $1,000 for any information 
leading to the arrest of the suspect, an east county Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with any information is asked to call the FBI at 642-3995 or Crime 
Stoppers at 987-TALK. SCOTT HADLY

 Floods inundated wide areas around the city of Bandung in West Java, forcing 
tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, the official news agency 
Antara said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Antara said four villages were swamped when heavy rains caused the Citarum 
River to overflow. The flood waters rose higher than 8 feet, villagers told 
Antara. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters flooded rice fields and about 6,000 houses, offices, schools and other 
public buildings. More than 50,000 people have been left homeless in Bandung 
and outlying districts, the news agency said.

GIANTS NEEDED A DAM TO STOP 49ERS' WATTERS; NFC: SAN FRANCISCO BACK RUNS FOR 
NFL-RECORD FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN 44-3 VICTORY. TAYLOR ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The 49ers took the ball out of Rodney Hampton's hands Saturday and put Ricky 
Watters' name in the postseason record books while pummeling the Giants, 44-3, 
in an NFC divisional playoff game at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Watters, who made a spirited sprint around the stadium before the game 
slapping fans' hands, ran for five touchdowns and topped the previous NFL 
playoff best of three touchdowns in a game held by 21 others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you slow down guys like Jerry Rice and John Taylor, you think you'll 
do OK," Giant cornerback Mark Collins said. "I never thought Ricky Watters 
would score five touchdowns. I was thinking, 'Gee, when is it going to stop?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Watters ran 24 times for 118 yards and set a postseason record for most 
touchdowns and most points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pumped up," Watters said. "It was such a great challenge going against 
LT (linebacker Lawrence Taylor), that great defensive line they have and the 
way those linebackers come up so hard. I still can't believe we did so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean LT came up to me and patted me on the back. He said, 'You're running 
your butt off; keep it up.' Whew, that's a lot coming from him. To me he's 
still the greatest linebacker to play the game, a legend, and that has to make 
you feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who partied here in 1991 following the Giants' 15-13 NFC championship 
game victory over the 49ers, indicated his career is now over after 13 years in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time to call it quits," he said. "I've done everything I can do. 
I've been to Super Bowls, I've been to the playoffs, I've been a dominant 
force. I would like to say it's time for me to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 While Taylor said he has played his last game, the 49ers move on to play the 
winner of today's game between Dallas and Green Bay. If the Packers win, the 
49ers will return to Candlestick Park. If the Cowboys win, the 49ers will 
travel to Dallas for a replay of last year's title game, which they lost, 
30-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one step," Watters said, pushing aside talk of his record 
performance. "I just want to stay focused. This doesn't mean anything unless we 
win next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Watters had a pair of one-yard touchdown runs sandwiched around a Mike Cofer 
29-yard field goal to give the 49ers a 16-0 lead two seconds into the second 
quarter. He continued the first-half assault with a two-yard touchdown run to 
extend the 49ers' lead to 23-0 with 4:03 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they started scoring, they knocked us right out of our game plan," said 
Hampton, who ran a season-low seven times for 12 yards. "The game plan was to 
keep the ball away from the 49ers, but we got behind and we had to throw to try 
and score." 
</P>
<P>
 Seifert challenged his offense this past week to light up the scoreboard and 
to do so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran four offensive plays and we were down 16 points," Giant center Bart 
Oates said. "Not only did we not respond to that, but we didn't get a first 
down. If the 49ers play like this next week -- I don't care who they play -- 
then I wouldn't be surprised to see them in Atlanta (for the Super Bowl)." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers took a 23-3 lead into the third quarter and then handed the ball to 
Watters for touchdown runs of six and two yards. A sixth opportunity to score 
eluded Watters after he was pulled from the game early in the fourth quarter 
with the ball at the Giants' 11-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized we had another game coming up," San Francisco Coach George 
Seifert said. "The most important thing was having the player healthy for the 
next game." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Marc Logan scored three plays later on a two-yard run to hand the 
Giants their worst playoff loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question who was the best team out there today," said Giant 
Coach Dan Reeves, who lost to the 49ers, 55-10, in Super Bowl XXIV while 
coaching the Broncos. "I'm disappointed that we came in and played this way. It 
hurts; it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 49ers took us out of our element very quickly. They struck quickly and 
repeatedly, and took the running game away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants had advanced this far by bludgeoning their opponents with the 
league's No. 1 running attack and a stubborn defense. In their previous nine 
games, the Giants had limited opponents to 17 points or less. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 49ers' offense, which entered the game ranked No. 1, attacked the 
Giants without resistance. Quarterback Steve Young moved the 49ers 80 yards in 
eight plays to open the game, with Watters running off right guard for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Cofer missed the extra-point attempt, but the 49ers would show no further 
mercy. After forcing the Giants to punt, they moved into position for Cofer's 
29-yard field goal, and with 4:53 remaining in the first quarter it was already 
9-0 in favor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the outset they just overpowered us," said Giant quarterback Phil Simms, 
who completed 12 of 25 passes for 124 yards with two interceptions. "It was a 
disaster on both sides of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Simms opened the Giants' second possession with a pass. Simms hadn't thrown an 
interception in seven previous games, but his second attempt Saturday flicked 
off the hand of wide receiver Chris Calloway, bounced off the shoulder pads of 
linebacker Bill Romanowski and into the hands of safety Tim McDonald at the 
Giants' 41-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Watters scored eight plays later, and after little more than 15 minutes of 
play, the 49ers had 10 first downs and 157 yards in total offense, while the 
Giants had five yards and were still looking for their initial first down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ricky's both elusive and powerful, but after the first quarter I told him to 
just turn the power on and run them over," said Young, who completed 17 of 22 
passes for 226 yards. "And if you love offensive line play, that was something 
beautiful to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you, that was a very good team we played today, but if you could 
draw up a plan for a playoff game this was it: no turnovers, great defense, 
solid running game, solid passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to do the same thing next week."

MIKE DOWNEY: FRUSTRATION IS A TEAM EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When one football team meets another and the final score is 51-3, nobody goes 
home distraught that the better team lost. When one football team meets another 
and the final score is 29-23, everybody on the losing side goes home wondering 
why it couldn't have been the other way around, or, worse yet, wondering which 
game-costing play was his own damn fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling, then, was more one of exasperation than humiliation for the 
Raiders when their season ended here Saturday, because this was a defeat that 
felt far worse than the last time the Buffalo Bills made them suffer. That 
playoff game of three years ago was over before it was over. But this was a 
game that was the Raiders' to win, and one that will be theirs to replay and 
replay inside their heads, again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say we killed our selves ," frustrated quarterback Jeff Hostetler 
contended, and the man was right, what with inadequate pass-defenders, 
snap-happy linemen and an infuriating inability on third and one to gain one 
lousy yard. But there is no sense singling out which Raiders should remain 
blameless and which ones should remain nameless. They all worked hard, but they 
all took it harder. 
</P>
<P>
 With every visible breath you took, you wanted to shout that the Raiders had 
this game in the fridge. It was something you sensed when they were 11 points 
ahead and when Napoleon McCallum was doing a greater job of crossing Buffalo's 
frozen tundra than Napoleon Bonaparte ever did crossing Russia's. It was 
something you were tempted to believe after Tim Brown traversed 86 yards with a 
pass to chop away at Buffalo's home-ice advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The players themselves, though, they knew better. So did their coach, Art 
Shell, standing there with frost in his mustache. Each and every one of them 
was justifiably proud of how hard the Raiders were struggling to win this 
teeth-chatterer of an AFC playoff game, yet each and every one was also 
painfully aware that the Buffalo Bills, drat their Super Bowl-losing hides, 
simply will not go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman Thomas staggers off groggy from a concussion, but they will not go 
away. Pete Metzelaars puts flesh through bone in a hand he uses to catch 
passes, but they will not go away. Steve Christie kicks footballs everywhere 
but where he is aiming, but they will not go away. No matter which valuable 
Buffalo player vanishes, another one materializes -- a Bill Brooks, a Keith 
McKeller, a Kenneth Davis -- to make life miserable for visitors in ways that 
have nothing to do with the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 In no way were the Raiders afraid of them. They went to great lengths to 
demonstrate how relaxed they felt, as when Hostetler took off scrambling in the 
first minute, tiptoed his way to the Buffalo bench and plopped down onto a seat 
beside an amused Steve Tasker, who slapped the Raider quarterback on the back 
and did everything but pass him some Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been easy for the Raiders to come in cold and stiff. Not only 
did they travel more than 2,500 miles for the game, but they arose at 5 a.m., 
Pacific time, to shower, shave, tape and insulate themselves for the game. It 
was only 9:30 back in California when the opening kickoff was telecast by NBC, 
the network that was kind enough to assign to its coverage O.J. Simpson and 
Paul McGuire, both of whom played for the Bills, as well as an ebullient Cris 
Collinsworth, who broke an AFC playoff record afterward for exclaiming "Huge 
afternoon!" to three consecutive players from the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had more important things to worry about. One was the footing, 
which became a factor as soon as Jeff Jaeger attempted his first field goal. 
His left foot planted awkwardly, Jaeger was unable to do anything more than 
direct a kick that fluttered and wobbled like a shuttlecock. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler got a feel for the game, little by little, throwing his first five 
completions to his backs and tight ends before seeing how ably his wide 
receivers could run. He also had to contend with Buffalo line-monster Bruce 
Smith, with whom he had words after one particularly nasty hit, and with 
blitzes, as when safety Matt Darby of UCLA fame hurtled himself at Hostetler 
like a wrestler off the top rope. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tasker who proved that the footing was sure. Stabbing a short kickoff, 
he easily sidestepped Raider tacklers Rickey Dixon and Patrick Bates, outran a 
puffing Aaron Wallace and avoided the kicker, Jaeger, who was supposed to 
impede the runner until a more qualified tackler could arrive. By the time 
Willie Gault caught up to him, Tasker was a yard away from the game's first 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the Raiders opened up. Hostetler took off on a quarterback draw. 
This was not a day for conventional weapons, not in this weather. The Raiders 
were determined to practice ball control. McCallum twice crashed over from a 
yard out, and L.A.'s committee of obscure running backs completely dominated 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last thing the Raiders dominated. The second half was a farce of 
mistakes, with little forward progress and remarkable lapses of attention. 
There was the rookie Bates getting burned when he was supposed to pick up 
Brooks once the receiver had been released to his care by Lionel Washington. 
There was the ineligible man downfield who wiped out a 25-yard gain, the 
repeated encroachment raps against Howie Long that he could not, or would not, 
later explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly tried, the Buffalo quarterback saying: "A guy like Howie Long loves 
to make the big plays, and he usually does. I don't know, we got them 
(off-side) five or six times in the past. They get antsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement affected everyone's play. Dixon began hitting everything that 
moved, once nearly flipping Andre Reed like a flapjack. Extremely large but 
little-seen tight end John Duff made a big play, but later let Buffalo's Smith 
blow by him for a sack. And ultimately Bates, a rookie thrown into the fray by 
necessity, was out of position when Brooks caught the game-winner, able to do 
nothing more but lunge at the receiver in the end zone, tackling air. 
</P>
<P>
 One play here, another there. Any one of them could have saved the day for the 
Raiders, but once again, Hostetler was right on the money. He said: "Who cares 
who did what? We all lost this game. We all have to live with it."

BILLS PUT RAIDERS ON ICE AGAIN; AFC: BUFFALO COMES BACK FROM 17-6 DEFICIT TO 
REACH FOURTH CONSECUTIVE CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WITH 29-23 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders went from a 7-9 record last season to the second round of the 
playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They went from ridicule to respectability. They went from turmoil to triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will go no further. 
</P>
<P>
 A season of progress, achieved despite painful inconsistency that featured as 
many agonizing lows as exhilarating highs, took one final plunge Saturday 
afternoon at Rich Stadium, where the Buffalo Bills beat the Raiders, 29-23, 
before a frozen crowd of 61,923 to advance to next Sunday's AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in four years that a Raider season ended in Buffalo. 
But this was nothing like the 51-3 whipping the Raiders took in the 1991 AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a game the Raiders were leading at halftime, 17-13, after three 
quarters, 23-22, and might have pulled out with a few fortunate bounces in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have kicked their butts," Raider defensive lineman Greg Townsend 
said. " We should be representing the AFC." 
</P>
<P>
 All week, the pregame speculation centered on the weather. And it was bad. It 
was zero degrees at kickoff with 16-m.p.h. winds dropping the wind-chill to 32 
below, making it the coldest game ever played at Rich Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as it turned out, only the kicking game was affected. The passers were 
able to throw, the runners were able to go. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bills were able to do what they do best, which is dominate the AFC in 
the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of America outside the city limits might not want to hear this, but 
that sound that reverberated across the football world Saturday was the Bills 
taking their first step toward yet another Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers of three consecutive Super Bowls, Buffalo has won eight AFC playoff 
games in a row and the seven they have played at Rich Stadium. The last time 
the Bills lost a home playoff game was on New Year's Day, 1967, when they were 
defeated by the Kansas City Chiefs in an American Football League playoff 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders seemed to have a chance to break the streak coming into the game. 
They had beaten the Bills here six weeks ago, starting a run in which they had 
gone 5-1, climaxed by last week's 42-24 wild-card victory over the Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question was whether the Raiders could run on the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer in the first half was a resounding yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Montgomery and Napoleon McCallum were able to move down the sometimes 
slippery field with precision and power in the first 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, during which Jeff Jaeger missed a 47-yard 
field-goal attempt, the Raiders finally cashed in a drive early in the second 
quarter with a 30-yarder by Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as they would do all afternoon, the Bills responded with a score of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 This one was set up by a short kickoff by Jaeger on an afternoon when both 
kickers struggled with the field and the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger's kickoff wound up in the hands of one of the up men, Steve Tasker. 
Tasker has made his reputation as a special-teams star and he enhanced it 
Saturday by returning the kickoff 67 yards. Tasker raced down the left side and 
eluded three would-be tacklers before finally getting shoved out of bounds at 
the Raider one-yard line by Willie Gault. It was the longest postseason kickoff 
return in Bill history. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the most important. Kenneth Davis' one-yard run gave Buffalo the 
lead at 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra point would have made it 7-3, but on this day, an extra point was as 
difficult as a 40-yard field goal. Sure enough, the Bills' Steve Christie 
missed to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum put the Raiders back in front with a one-yard run, capping a 57-yard 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 When tight end Pete Metzelaars fumbled on Buffalo's next play from scrimmage, 
the Raiders again had the ball in Bills' territory in the closing minutes of 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 They got to the Buffalo one, where McCallum, on three carries, gained only 
half the distance to the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth down, Coach Art Shell sent in the field-goal unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold on, yelled Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them not to kick until after the two-minute warning," the Raider 
quarterback said. "I wanted to have my say." 
</P>
<P>
 With both Hostetler and offensive lineman Todd Peat arguing the case, Shell 
relented and put the ball back in McCallum's hands. He scored on his fourth try 
from the one and the Raiders led, 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelly quickly marched the Bills 76 yards, aided by a 37-yard 
pass-interference call on Torin Dorn, who was attempting to defend against 
Andre Reed. Thurman Thomas scored from the eight-yard line, cutting the margin 
to 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Bills went from a seven- to an eight-man line to shut 
down the Raider running game and opened up their own offense. The Bills rushed 
for only 14 yards in the first half, 61 in the second. The Raiders rushed for 
98 yards in the first half, only 12 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help the Raiders, who were already without defensive lineman Chester 
McGlockton, that safety Eddie Anderson had to leave early in the second half 
when his sprained ankle flared up. It also didn't help that the Raiders were 
called for being offsides five times, four of those called against veteran 
Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly connected with Bill Brooks on a 25-yard touchdown pass. Christie's 
extra point was blocked, but, after a McCallum fumble, Christie kicked a 
29-yard field goal to give Buffalo a 22-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders came back in spectacular fashion, Hostetler hitting Tim Brown 
across the middle and Brown turning it into an 86-yard touchdown, the longest 
in Raider postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was to be their last gasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly came back to Brooks in the fourth quarter for the winning points on a 
22-yard touchdown pass with 12:05 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 And then Buffalo hung on despite a series of plays that summed up a Raider 
afternoon of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 On one drive: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kelly, hit by Anthony Smith, fumbled, only to have the ball land in the 
hands of Bill lineman John Fina, who ran for 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kent Hull made a bad center snap, only to have Kelly fall on it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kelly threw a pass to Davis that bounced out of his hands and hung 
tantalizingly in the air, only to fall untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of a day for the Raiders. And that kind of a year.

JIM MURRAY: SCHOLARSHIP SHOULD BE REAL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hate to say this, but I've never heard such poppycock in my life.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm referring to the boycott threat of the basketball coaches, specifically 
the Black Coaches Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 The coaches are incensed by the ruling of the NCAA that reduces the number of 
basketball scholarships from 14 to 13. That computes out to about 330 
scholarships a year for Division I coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Their position is, since these scholarships would go mainly to minority 
students, they are "critically important" to the disadvantaged youths.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, I don't know about that, but they are critically important to basketball 
coaches, let me tell you.  
</P>
<P>
 Basketball is a game in which you need only one Michael Jordan or Larry Bird 
or Magic Johnson to "make" a team. The more guys you can recruit, the better 
your chances of getting this special-quality player. Coaches would like 100 
scholarships a year -- and if they get 14, that might be their next goal.  
</P>
<P>
 The sophistry in this reasoning is so transparent I'm amazed that college 
presidents take them so seriously.  
</P>
<P>
 If these worthies were arguing to put in place 330 additional scholarships for 
real scholars, I'd be the first to throw my hat in the air. If they were 
fighting to get scholarships for the underprivileged kids who scored highest on 
the math tests or who led their schools in the social sciences, you'd have to 
applaud.  
</P>
<P>
 But they're not looking for kids who spend their lives in classrooms or 
libraries; they're looking for kids who spent their lives on playgrounds or in 
school gyms. In high posts, not higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
 They want jump shooters, not students. You can bet me every lucky winner of 
one of those 330 extra scholarships would be 7 feet tall or so and no menace at 
all to the school library.  
</P>
<P>
 We don't need jump-shooters. We're up to our hips in jump-shooters. We need 
doctors, scientists, statesmen.  
</P>
<P>
 The coaches aren't going to try to get those types in school. A recent study 
showed that the average Scholastic Aptitude Test scores for athletes at 
Oklahoma was 759, at Mississippi 768, while the average for the non-athletic 
student body at Rice was 1,324. Society doesn't need guys whose scholastic 
aptitude peaks at signing his own name.  
</P>
<P>
 If the coaches were encouraging recruitment of 5-foot-8, slow, bookish young 
men who wear glasses, you would be on their side. But you remember their last 
crusade was against Propositions 42 and 48, which tightened academic admission 
standards. In short, they're not looking for scholars and go out of their way 
to block a school from acquiring them. 
</P>
<P>
 No, their mission is not to get kids in the State Department or the stock 
exchange or the medical research teams, it's to get them in the Final Four.  
</P>
<P>
 USA Today recently conducted a survey that showed there were about 1.4 million 
black students in American colleges and universities and only about 2,000 of 
them were basketball players. That's not even 1%.  
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to the next problem: Whose teams are these anyway? These teams 
belong to the colleges, right? They're not the property of the coaches, who 
are, after all, merely employees of those colleges. What gives them the right 
to tell those players to boycott or do anything else not done with a basketball 
in their hands? When does a coach tell an institution what to do? I thought 
that was the job of boards of trustees, not former Celtic forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 I have had trouble on this score before with Coach John Thompson of 
Georgetown. Coach Thompson seemed to think our 1988 Olympic team belonged to 
him, not to the United States of America. He kept it sequestered from the press 
and community right down to the time it lost to the Soviet Union in the final. 
All we got to do was pay for it.  
</P>
<P>
 If basketball coaches want to upgrade their teams (and by inference their own 
incomes) by increasing the number of jump-shooters and post-up guys they get to 
choose from, let them say so. Just don't cloak it behind a pious claim they're 
only trying to improve society. They're only trying to improve their fast 
break.  
</P>
<P>
 Go ahead and give minority kids those additional 330 scholarships. But specify 
they're to go to non-athletes and see how happy that makes them.

FANS SHELLING OUT MORE DOLLARS FOR GOLDEN AGE OF NBA; PRO BASKETBALL: THE 
AVERAGE COST FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR ATTENDING A GAME IS $168.68, AN INCREASE OF 
6.9%.

<P>
 Inflationary times call for inflationary measures. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as this NBA season lumbers along without Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and 
Michael Jordan, the sport's aficionados are caught in an inflationary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the NBA's biggest names have recently retired, a family of 
four is paying on average $168.68 to attend a game, a 6.9% increase over last 
season, according to an annual survey by Team Marketing Report, a Chicago 
sports-business publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the increase is attributed to a 7.7% rise in the average ticket 
prices, said Alan Friedman, who for four years has monitored fan expenditures 
as the publication's editor. 
</P>
<P>
 In devising the Fan Cost Index, Friedman tabulates expenses for a family of 
four by including tickets, two beers, four hot dogs, four soft drinks, two 
souvenir caps, two programs and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this system, NBA prices have risen almost three times faster than the 
Consumer Price Index, which monitors the overall inflation rate. Furthermore, 
the increases are much greater than in the NFL and baseball, which jumped by 
4.8% in 1993. NFL ticket prices increased 1.7%, baseball 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The most expensive NBA city is New York, where an average ticket for a Knicks' 
game is $39.66. A 14-ounce beer is $4.25, a hot dog $3, and parking $12.50 for 
a family total of $232.62. Chicago is second at $215.79; Phoenix is third at 
$205.26, and Boston fourth at $203.30. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Clippers are professional sport's anomaly. They lowered 
ticket prices by an average of 41 cents. Friedman said it was the biggest 
decrease of any NBA, NFL or baseball team. At $22.45 a ticket, the Clippers are 
well below the NBA average of $27.12. They rank 21st among 27 teams in ticket 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as guard Ron Harper might suggest, even at NBA bargain prices Clipper 
fans are investing a hefty chunk to watch mediocre performances. The Clippers 
rank 18th in the Fan Cost Index and have the league's 22nd-best record. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the Century Freeway in Inglewood, the Lakers illustrate what happens when 
the freewheeling '80s meet the austere '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 All Showtime and little substance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers increased ticket prices by only 1.7% this season, yet still rank 
fifth overall in the Fan Cost Index. A family can expect to spend $199.84 to 
watch a game at the Forum. With the team rebuilding, the Lakers have discovered 
the magic of marketing to keep some fans interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, much of the attraction comes naturally, said Brian Murphy of Sports 
Marketing Letter, a Westport, Conn., publication that analyzes professional 
sports. He said it is not surprising that the NBA continues to strengthen its 
fan base as costs escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment for a family is pretty nice, there never is a rain-out," 
Murphy said. "You don't see a lot of fights in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, you can see Jack Nicholson at absolutely no extra charge."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that's an L.A. phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 But from Murphy's perspective, the NBA has not priced itself out of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the golden age of basketball," he said. "It began toward the end of 
Kareem's (Abdul-Jabbar) career and is still going full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it worth for the fan to attend basketball when it's in its golden 
age? There are so many future Hall of Famers (playing), it's stunning. It's 
like Broadway. Why can a show command a $60 ticket? The quality is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to fine dining, theater, a trip to Disneyland or a weekend outing, an 
NBA game is not off the entertainment scale, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Boston charges more for parking, at $15 a car, than the Knicks. Chicago 
matches New York at $12.50, followed by the Clippers and Miami Heat at $7. But 
it is all part of urban landscape, particularly in the close quarters of 
Manhattan.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, most teams have parking lots operated by the arena, but the New 
York lots are individually run. And with limited space, demand far exceeds 
supply.  
</P>
<P>
 "Often, people will pay $10 to $20 to park," said John Cirillo, the Knicks' 
vice president of public relations.  
</P>
<P>
 The parking situation embodies the overall problem of operating in big cities. 
If the cost of living is higher, then it stands to reason that the costs of 
operating a team will be higher. And the fan is expected to make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this, however, has stopped Knick fans from displaying their loyalty. 
Last season, the team sold out 39 of 41 home games. This season, all their 
games are expected to be sellouts, team officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said interest is high because fans expect great performances nightly. 
"That is not necessarily an impression shared in at least one other sport," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Did anyone say baseball? Putting a Price on the NBA 
</P>
<P>
 The Fan Cost Index, as tabulated in an annual survey by a Chicago 
sports-business publication, projects expenses for a family of four to attend 
an NBA game. The survey includes tickets, two beers, four hot dogs, four soft 
drinks, two souvenir caps, two programs (prices not shown) and parking.

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES; PLAYOFFS WILL PAY OFF; CASH-STRAPPED UNIVERSITIES 
NEED A FOOTBALL FINAL FOUR 
</P>

<P>
 From here to Florida, the bowl games early this month separated the title 
contenders from the rest in college football, leaving, as usual, a web of 
unanswered questions, starting with these two: 
</P>
<P>
 Which team is the best in the land? 
</P>
<P>
 Should a national championship playoff climax the college season? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to Question 2 is easy: Sure, starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Question 1 is unanswerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Florida State met Notre Dame or Nebraska again today, the winner 
wouldn't be the better team, necessarily, let alone best of all. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's leading college football clubs are so closely matched most years 
that nearly any 60-minute happening can be disproportionately influenced by 
turnovers, bad calls, big plays and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one loser can claim: "We were robbed." More than one winner can 
brag: "Look at the scoreboard. We're No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, sports fans who want to settle the best-football-team argument on 
the playing field are asking the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 So why have a championship game? 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale for that is something else: You play it for a reason that is as 
urgent, as honorable, as American, as it is excellent. You play it for the 
money. ROCKY TIMES HAVE AMBUSHED UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
<P>
 In two respects, a January playoff, bringing together the four best teams 
emerging from the bowl games, will someday be as welcome as it is spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 It will: 
</P>
<P>
 * Create an American classic. With semifinals one weekend and a title event 
the next, three big annual games will be added to the winter sports calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd support a final-four playoff," UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young said the 
other day. "More games would be too many. One isn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * Strengthen American education. With revenues evenly divided, a playoff could 
generate as much as $1 million each year for every school that competes in 
big-time football. 
</P>
<P>
 And they all need it. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are rocky times for (state) schools, and for most private schools, 
too," Richard Little, vice president at Miami University of Ohio, said, voicing 
an opinion that can be heard on any campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The need didn't seem so acute a few years ago -- when there was no real need 
for a championship game, either. College football has been a consistent success 
story without it. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been major changes lately in the economic condition of the 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget problems have led many schools to drop some of their varsity sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Many -- UCLA among them -- have even abolished or downsized academic 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money just isn't there these days," Little said. "They're phasing out 
departments and degree programs (because) more than half the states have cut 
back on aid to higher education." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the states have been financially stricken, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (legislature) thinks about us, but they also have to think about 
Medicaid," Little said. "And so many other things: the burgeoning prison 
population, secondary education, infrastructure breakdowns, social-service 
needs. There's a confluence of pressures and problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The universities are responding to the crisis predictably with unprecedented 
increases in tuition and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas inflation in America rose 2.8% last year, the cost of a college 
education was up 6%, according to a College Board spokesman at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 The average for tuition, room and meals at all U.S. four-year colleges now is 
$6,207 a year, he said, but the cost rises to $10,000 and up at larger state 
and private schools, and to $25,000 or more at some. 
</P>
<P>
 With such intense pressures on the economy of every university, all possible 
sources of revenue need to be looked at. A football final four would plainly 
help. NFL KIND OF MONEY IS THERE FOR A FINAL FOUR 
</P>
<P>
 Postseason college football has always attracted a number of outspoken 
critics. Football in January, they continue to charge, is crass commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it have to do with education? they ask. Who needs it? We'd be 
overwhelmed by two weeks of media hoopla and hype. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, that's the whole point. 
</P>
<P>
 The more commotion, the better. The nation's troubled universities need 
windfall profits. If hype helps, hype. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff could be impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's Super Bowl in recent years has been hyped into a one-day $50-million 
event. It reaps $41 million from TV alone and then sells out at $175 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 A college football final-four playoff, capitalizing on the nation's post-bowl 
game ferment, could arguably double that -- producing $50 million for the main 
event plus $25 million for each semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The take from the championship game alone "would be closer to $100 million 
than $50 million," said Georgia Athletic Director Vince Dooley. 
</P>
<P>
 Others tend to agree. In both total revenue and excitement, some suggest, a 
final-four playoff might even outpace the NFL's longer playoffs for these 
reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Even taking into account the overlap, there are slightly different publics 
for pro and college ball, both of them very large. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CBS, which has lost the NFL, is in the market for a comparably prestigious 
major league enterprise and could bid against ABC for at least a share of 
college football. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With only three games, a brisk college playoff, going head to head against 
pro football's monthlong January playoffs, would offer a compact, competitive 
zing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday nights, possibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, conceivably, the championship game should be played in the NFL's usual bye 
week before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 As college basketball has found, there's something about a finely focused 
final four that stirs the imagination of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The instant we have championship football, it will become one of the world's 
four great annual sports events," said Dooley, comparing it to the Super Bowl, 
World Series and college basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Education would gain the most. It would gain substantially wherever big-time 
football is played. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see the revenue equally divided between academics and athletics 
at each university," Dooley said, proposing a course of action that could well 
be taken, when they come to consider it, by the presidents of the top-division 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At present in Division I-A, there are 106 football-playing institutions, but 
some of them favor a smaller grouping of about 70. 
</P>
<P>
 In either instance, assuming a playoff payoff approaching $100 million, each 
school would get an annual dividend of, more or less, $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose Dooley and the others have overestimated -- and revenues are only half 
that. What's wrong with half a million? 
</P>
<P>
 Why throw all that away? THREE PLATOONS ANSWER TO OVEREMPHASIS 
</P>
<P>
 Those arguing against a college football playoff typically mention one or more 
of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * As arranged by the new bowl coalition, there is often a championship game 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but, were Florida State and Nebraska really No. 1 and No. 2? 
</P>
<P>
 And how much money did they make for Division I? 
</P>
<P>
 When New Year's Day is crowded with eight bowl games -- or even four or five 
-- none of them realizes the kind of revenue that's there for a single 
championship event. 
</P>
<P>
 To maximize proceeds, the universities need a time when a brief title series 
could get the undivided attention of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bowl associations, fearing a loss of prestige, bitterly oppose football 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but such fears seem exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 1 bowl tradition is firmly established. And interest will be even 
greater in the New Year's games that have final-four significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl associations have already profited hugely from their friendly 
relationship with college 
</P>
<P>
 football. Their self-serving lobbying against a four-team playoff -- in an era 
of great need for the universities -- is unseemly. 
</P>
<P>
 * College football in January means that the players will have to miss too 
many classes.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but a campus classroom isn't necessary to the learning process. You can 
go to school in any hotel, in any suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Where necessary, the teams could travel during the postseason with three 
platoons: offensive, defensive and academic. They make enough money to take 
along a small platoon of tutors to help the players who need it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an NCAA rule against aid to athletes unless the same services are 
offered to other students, but NCAA rules are often modified. A reason for 
modifying this one is that the revenue created by football players will benefit 
all students. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is moot, of course, at the many schools that are between semesters 
or quarters in January. 
</P>
<P>
 After New Year's Day, moreover, only those who play for the final-four teams 
need be off campus, and some will only be gone for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cries of overemphasis can again be expected, the fact is that college 
football players are required, in any case, to miss few classes -- fewer than 
basketball players or debaters or political activists or many others. 
</P>
<P>
 * The university leaders who exploit football players throughout the fall will 
be exploiting them unbearably if they continue it into January. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but big-time college football should find a way to cut the athletes in. 
They are no longer the amateurs they were earlier in the century. 
</P>
<P>
 As we have argued before in this space, today's college football players are 
entitled to a percentage of the gross -- possibly 20% in the regular season and 
10% during the much more lucrative playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They earn it. They are recruited as athlete-entertainers whose job is to earn 
it. THEY CAN PICK A FINAL FOUR, NOT A FINAL ONE 
</P>
<P>
 To select a final four each winter, the present voters -- 
sportswriters-broadcasters and coaches -- might as well stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Their separate votes for each team could be added up, as they are now by 
coalition calculators. And the top four in the combined totals could be seeded 
1 through 4. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were a playoff this winter, the top-seeded teams, as determined in 
the compilation after the bowl games, would be Florida State, Notre Dame, 
Nebraska, and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seem the obvious four. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, over the years, the coaches and writers have usually had the top four 
right -- though not always in the right order. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if voting by groups of bystanders is good enough to certify a quartet, it 
is an unacceptable way to crown a champion. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like letting historians decide who won the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the inherent defects of any poll are magnified when one 
team must be singled out as champion. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some of the writers raising their hands for Florida State again 
this winter -- instead of Notre Dame -- were engaging, no doubt, in a 
self-fulfilling prophecy, having first named the Seminoles No. 1 last summer, 
before their first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that sort of thing isn't what's mainly wrong with polls. If there were 
a final-four playoff, you couldn't be sure the best team won that way, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial flaw in voting for No. 1 is that it creates absolutely nothing in 
the way of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed most is a fresh way to raise fresh money.

THE RAIDERS DON'T NEED BROWN-AND-OUT PATTERN; AFC: RECEIVER MAKES ANOTHER BIG 
PLAY, BUT WILL IT BE HIS LAST WITH THE TEAM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally thawed after the coldest loss in his greatest season, Tim Brown packed 
up his silver-and-black duffel bag and secured the zipper. 
</P>
<P>
 The last zip? 
</P>
<P>
 The thought crossed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," Brown said. "It was very difficult. I came off the field and we 
were in there praying with the guys, and I was thinking, 'Is this going to be 
my last time or what?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's magical Raider mystery tour -- which began with such promise in 1988, 
took a turn into the abyss, saw him sweat out the trading deadline last 
October, then turn in the best-ever season by a Raider wide receiver -- might 
have come to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did what he could Saturday, catching five passes for 127 yards -- 
remarkable considering the chill factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's 86-yard touchdown reception gave his team a third-quarter lead it 
couldn't hold. The Buffalo Bills came back to beat the Raiders, 29-23, in a 
divisional playoff game at Rich Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the lead. Can the Raiders now hold on to Brown, a first-rate free 
agent? 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious answer is: They must. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown completed the season of his life, with 80 receptions for 1,180 yards and 
seven touchdowns. He was voted the team's most valuable player by his peers. He 
willed the Raiders to victory after victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing is simple with the Raiders. When Brown signed a contract two years 
ago, he negotiated an "out clause" if a new collective bargaining agreement was 
reached that included free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened, but there were complications. Brown thought he should have been 
a free agent this season. But Raider owner Al Davis named Brown a transitional 
player, meaning the team could retain him by matching any offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The case went to the NFL, which ruled Brown had to play this season as a 
Raider. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this cloud, Brown reported to training camp. There were trade rumors and 
rumblings, but Brown put it out of his mind long enough to become a star. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the Raiders thought of him in the past, he must now be considered a 
top priority in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision won't be up to me," Brown said. "It's going to be left up to Mr. 
Davis." 
</P>
<P>
 As a transitional free agent, Brown can seek the best available offer by 
another team. The Raiders can keep him by matching the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders choose to make Brown their franchise player, he cannot sign 
with another team but will have to be paid the average salary of the league's 
top five receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel like the pressure's on me to make any kind of a decision," Brown 
said. "But it has been a great year. I've really enjoyed working with Jeff 
(Hostetler). If I have to work with him for the next four or five years, I 
think I could live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Could the Raiders live without it? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he and Davis have not discussed his future: "We haven't talked 
about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging to Raider fans was that, after the game, Brown spoke as a Raider 
in the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be OK," Brown said. "We're a young football team. Everybody 
will bounce back and we'll be ready to roll next year." 
</P>
<P>
 While he might have once jumped at a chance to leave the Raiders, his success 
with Hostetler this season could change his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared Saturday the combination of Hostetler-to-Brown might bail the 
Raiders out of another fine mess. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Bills leading, 22-17, in the third quarter, Hostetler scrambled on 
second down from the Raider 14 and tossed a short pass to Brown, who caught the 
ball while breaking free of defender Mickey Washington at the 25 and found open 
field in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown ran uncontested down the field, made an inside move at the Bills' 20 on 
the last man with a chance to stop him, safety Mark Kelso, and scored 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 It put the Raiders up, 23-22, with 29 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping that would get the defense going," Brown said of his touchdown, 
"and they (the Bills) would go three and out and we'd get the ball again and 
maybe get some more points." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the way it worked out. On their next drive, the Bills drove 71 
yards in nine plays, taking the lead on a 22-yard pass play from Jim Kelly to 
Bill Brooks with 12:05 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of deflated all the momentum of my play," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a sense, his season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown wouldn't mind coming back to try it again next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," he said.

BUFFALO GETS WARMED UP FOR ANOTHER SUPER BOWL; BILLS: TASKER AND HIS TEAMMATES 
DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE NOT WANTED, THEY PLAN ON GOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buffalo special teams specialist Steve Tasker's toes were numb. His fingers 
were frozen. His body was sore all over. 
</P>
<P>
 And he couldn't have cared less. Not with the Bills still in contention to 
ruin yet another Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills, losers in the last three Super Bowls, are one step away from 
playing in another one after Saturday's 29-23 victory over the Raiders in an 
AFC playoff game contested in frigid temperatures at Rich Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody keeps saying that they don't want Buffalo in the Super Bowl," 
Tasker said. "But we have only three words for that -- We Don't Care." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the Bills have a strange way of showing it. As usual, they fell 
behind early before the offense got going and the defense buckled down in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasker gave them one of their few first-half highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 On a field better suited for ice skating, Tasker returned his first kickoff of 
the season, breaking through the Raiders' coverage for 67 yards until Willie 
Gault ran him out of bounds at the Raider one-yard line, setting up a touchdown 
run by Kenneth Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bills couldn't stop the Raiders' offense, which was coming off its 
best game of the season last week against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders built a 17-6 second-quarter lead largely because quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler was hitting running backs Ty Montgomery and Napoleon McCallum on 
short patterns out of the backfield. McCallum scored twice on one-yard runs, 
had 45 yards by halftime and appeared well on his way to another big week. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing in the playoffs. Sound familiar? It did to the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 They fell behind the Houston Oilers, 35-3, in the third quarter of a playoff 
game last season before rallying for a 41-38 overtime victory. Did memories of 
that game jar the Bills out of their first-half slumber? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not really," linebacker Darryl Talley said. "It's different circumstances 
this year -- and two completely different teams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders didn't blow a 32-point lead, as the Oilers did. But they did blow 
an 11-point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly completed four consecutive passes to move the 
Bills to the Raider 45 late in the second quarter. They picked up 37 more yards 
when cornerback Torin Dorn was called for pass interference against Andre Reed, 
and Thurman Thomas scored on an eight-yard run on the next play to cut it to 
17-13 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had to settle down and get the offense going," said Reed, who caught 
four passes for 53 yards. "We were a little too giddy in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 That mood changed in the locker room at halftime. After giving up 17 points in 
the first half, the Bills' defense was blistered by defensive coordinator Walt 
Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walt wasn't happy with us," defensive end Bruce Smith said. "He wasn't happy 
with us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills played as many as eight men on the defensive front in the second 
half and took away the short passes. The Raiders managed only 120 yards and one 
first down in the second half -- an 86-yard touchdown pass play from Hostetler 
to Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Thursday, Walt came up with this great defensive scheme and we didn't get 
a chance to practice it Friday," linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. "We walked 
through it Saturday a little bit and executed it pretty well today." 
</P>
<P>
 And Corey's message got through to Smith. With the Bills leading, 29-23, Smith 
beat tackle Bruce Wilkerson and sacked Hostetler for a seven-yard loss on a key 
third-and-seven from the Raiders' 29 with 5:42 left in the game. After getting 
the ball back, the Bills ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the first half, the Bills' defense gave Kelly plenty of opportunities 
in the second half. Kelly, who completed 27 of 37 passes for 287 yards, had 
scoring passes of 25 and 22 yards to Bill Brooks in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy to overlook Brooks, whom the Bills acquired from Indianapolis in 
the off-season. He had caught only one touchdown pass in the last six games. 
But his second touchdown catch of the game -- on a crossing pattern in the end 
zone -- put the Bills ahead, 29-23, with 12:05 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought Billy would be able to hit the seams a couple times," Kelly said. 
"It wasn't there a couple of times, but we called it again at the right time."

MEMORIES TO BRING A CHILL; RAIDERS: THE PLAYS THAT DIDN'T GET MADE WILL HAUNT 
L.A. DURING THE OFF-SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler did not try to hide his frustration from reporters 
after the Raiders' 29-23 playoff loss to Buffalo on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because he knew that the Raiders' roller-coaster season would still be 
going if they had made more plays when they needed to after taking an 11-point 
lead in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You figure that maybe on a day like today (with wind-chill of 32 below) that 
23 points would be enough to win," said Hostetler, who completed 14 of 20 
passes for 230 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shot ourselves in the foot on offense and we killed ourselves by not 
making some plays and having too many penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders look back at their final game of the season, they will 
remember several costly plays. 
</P>
<P>
 They will remember nine penalties for 77 yards, headed by Howie Long, who was 
drawn offside four times by quarterback Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will remember Jeff Jaeger's short kickoff that was returned 67 
yards by Steve Tasker, which led to Buffalo's first touchdown and gave the 
Bills' a 6-3 second-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Torin Dorn, who played most of the game as the Raiders' extra 
defensive back against the Bills' spread offense, will remember two key pass 
plays that led to Buffalo touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came with the Raiders ahead, 17-6, with less than two minutes 
remaining in the first half. Dorn was called for a 37-yard pass interference 
penalty that led to an eight-yard touchdown run by Thurman Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torin could not have played that pass any better, and he was called for 
interference," Raider cornerback Lionel Washington said. "There shouldn't have 
been a call made on that play." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorn's afternoon got worse later in the game when he was beaten on a 
stop-and-go pattern by Bill Brooks, who scored on a 25-yard pass play from 
Kelly to give Buffalo a 19-17 lead in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Napoleon McCallum will remember his third quarter fumble that was 
recovered by Buffalo's Henry Jones at the Raiders' 30-yard line. That led to a 
Steve Christie field goal that gave the Bills a 22-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Patrick Bates will remember his only play at safety when he filled in 
for a groggy Ricky Dixon, who had replaced injured starter Eddie Anderson, 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Bills trailing, 23-22, Bates could not reach a 22-yard pass from 
Kelly to Brooks that proved to be the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Anthony Smith will remember sacking Kelly and forcing a fumble 
that landed in the arms of Buffalo lineman John Fina, who returned the ball 15 
yards to the Raiders' 49 with eight minutes remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will also remember that after gaining 14 first downs and 98 yards 
rushing in the first half, they were held to one first down and 12 yards on the 
ground in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also remember the 16 offensive plays they had in the second half, 
compared to 41 in the first two quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough loss for us because we played well," Raider Coach Art Shell 
said. "We just didn't make enough plays on either side of the ball to get it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Raider defensive end Greg Townsend: "This is tough because the game never 
really got away from us. We might have lost, but I still feel that we have a 
better team than them." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Hostetler: "I definitely didn't want to come in this locker room and 
have my season over with today. And in that sense it's really frustrating and 
disappointing. I don't think that they're a better team than us, but that's the 
game of football. It's just that we didn't come out on top when it counts."

IT'S JOE COOL AND HIS CHIEFS AGAINST THE RED-HOT OILERS; AFC: MONTANA WILL BE 
UNDER PRESSURE FROM RYAN'S DEFENSE IN SHOWDOWN OF CLASHING STYLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It will be not so much a game as a 100-m.p.h. collision of values. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City Chiefs are as plain and solid as Joe Montana's smile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers are as wild and unpredictable as Buddy Ryan's right fist. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of today's AFC semifinal here between these teams should be favored 
to advance to the Super Bowl, simply because it will have shown an uncommon 
ability to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs can win only if Montana is still walking after three hours against 
a furious rush by the league's most aggressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers can win only if this defense can avoid getting burned by the 
pinpoint passing of the coolest quarterback in postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but I think we can be the best team in NFL history," said injured Oiler 
safety Marcus Robertson. "I mean, when you consider all the controversy we have 
had to overcome. Nobody has done what we have done." 
</P>
<P>
 While that may be an overstatement even in the league's loudest locker room, 
the Oilers are certainly one of the hottest teams ever. 
</P>
<P>
 They are only the fifth team to have ended a regular season with 11 
consecutive victories, the first since the perfect 1972 Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are certainly the first to win so much despite: 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy over a birth.  
</P>
<P>
 Tackle David Williams became the center of national debate when his salary was 
docked after he missed a game against the New England Patriots to be with his 
wife for the birth of their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy over a death.  
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Jeff Alm was legally drunk when he shot himself after his 
best friend had been killed in a one-car accident while Alm was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Fights between players.  
</P>
<P>
 Too numerous to mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Fights between coaches.  
</P>
<P>
 Sick of seeing the replays of Ryan punching offensive coordinator Kevin 
Gilbride on the sidelines yet? 
</P>
<P>
 Just when the team thought that things had finally settled, owner Bud Adams 
picked Friday to announce that the Oilers might leave town in four years if 
city officials don't build him a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that their players are listening anymore. Not to their owner, not much to 
Coach Jack Pardee, not to anyone but themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 They have made the playoffs in each of the last seven years, but have yet to 
advance past this second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "An atomic bomb could drop in this room and it wouldn't divide the team," 
cornerback Cris Dishman said. "None of us is getting any younger. This is the 
year we have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs, meanwhile, are as controversial as a wheat field. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, General Manager Carl Peterson signed two of football's model 
citizens to lead them to this point, which is exactly what Montana and running 
back Marcus Allen have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcus and Joe were signed for playoff games like these -- to bring us to 
that next level," Peterson said. "We're not pleased just being at this point, 
we've been here before. The Super Bowl is our only goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, in his first postseason play in four years, proved he still knows 
what month it is by rallying the Chiefs from a 10-point deficit to a 27-24 
overtime victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But he missed the Chiefs' first touchdown after suffering bruised ribs from a 
vicious shot after a pass. And the Steelers' defense had 10 fewer sacks than 
the Oilers'. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of Montana today renders meaningless any lessons that can be 
taken from the Oilers' 30-0 victory over the Chiefs in the second game of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana didn't play in that game, partly because of an injured wrist and 
partly because Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer did not want to expose him to 
Ryan's defense so soon in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montana's place, rattled Dave Krieg was guilty of five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly lost in this circus is the Oilers' offense, still explosive 
despite struggles by aging quarterback Warren Moon, who has five touchdowns and 
five interceptions in his last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon sat out the season finale because of sore ribs but will return today to 
complement the Oilers' new force, running back Gary Brown. He replaced injured 
star Lorenzo White at midseason and quickly equaled rushing records set by Earl 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 But things should really heat up when the Chiefs have the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Montana is an accomplished player, but it's one thing to be respected," 
Oiler linebacker Lamar Lathon said. "It's another thing to be in our way."

RAIDER CHARTER MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chartered plane carrying the Raiders back to Los Angeles Saturday after 
their playoff loss in Buffalo made an emergency landing in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ned Walker, a spokesman for Continental Airlines, said indicators showed that 
the landing gear did not fully retract. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, a Continental A300 air bus, left Buffalo at 6:45 p.m. EST, an hour 
later than scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 After the problem was discovered, the plane was rerouted to Cleveland, where 
it dumped fuel over Lake Erie before landing at Cleveland's Hopkins 
International Airport, a major hub for Continental. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews were on the ground when the plane landed. Walker said that is 
routine procedure for situations such as this. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers were put on another plane, which left Cleveland at 9:30 p.m. EST 
and was to arrive in Los Angeles more than 3 1/2 hours after the scheduled 
arrival of the team charter from Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker called the emergency landing a "routine response to a non-routine 
situation." He said such landing-gear problems are "extremely rare but do 
occur." LARRY STEWART

COWBOYS HOPING TO EXPLOIT A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY; NFC: AIKMAN IS ON TARGET AND 
SMITH IS RESTED AND READY ENOUGH AS SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS GO AGAINST THE 10-7 
PACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman went on "The Late Show With David Letterman" 
last Tuesday and threw passes at moving taxis on an icy New York street. Dallas 
Coach Jimmy Johnson was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad they cut his segment short," Johnson said, "because he was going to 
talk about my fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Hellestrae, the Cowboys' deep snapper, also thought Aikman's performance 
was a little lame -- and proved it by firing off a snap into the passenger 
window of a moving truck in the parking lot of the team's practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody really knows how many takes it took for Troy to nail his throws," 
Hellestrae said. "Let the record show that I drilled mine on the first try." 
</P>
<P>
 A sprightly bunch, these Cowboys, heavy favorites to defeat the Green Bay 
Packers today at Texas Stadium in an NFC divisional playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players are loose. The coach, too," Johnson said after Thursday's 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if it meant anything that Aikman had flown to New York on his day off to 
appear on the Letterman show, Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said, "I would say it 
shows that they're a very confident team." 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys begin the playoffs with home-field advantage, the healing benefits 
of a week off and the erratic Packers as an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas, the defending Super Bowl champion, defeated Green Bay in early 
October, 36-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to be overconfident," Packer safety Leroy Butler said. "They won 
the Super Bowl. We're coming to their place. They beat us, 36-14. They should 
be (overconfident). If I was them, I would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful thinking, the Cowboys say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I've always said, every week is a different week," running back Emmitt 
Smith said. "You know they're going to come in here ready to play. And we've 
been in situations where we've lost games we know we should have won. So I 
don't think we ever underestimate anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith isn't fully recovered from the separated shoulder he suffered two weeks 
ago in his 168-yard effort against the New York Giants, but the injury 
shouldn't limit his role today -- a bad sign for the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Bay defense, worn down by injuries, has allowed three backs to rush 
for 100 yards or more in the last four weeks. That two of them are named 
Scottie Graham and Derrick Lynch doesn't speak well for the Packers' chances of 
stopping Smith, the league's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I say about (the injuries on defense) will look like an excuse, but 
the simple fact is, we have been injured and have been playing with some 
different people in there," Holmgren said. "That has an effect. But so what? 
We've got to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith carried only 13 times for 71 yards in the Dallas-Green Bay game Oct. 3, 
but the Cowboys didn't need a career day from him. Dallas won because Aikman 
had his best passing day of the season, completing 18 of 23 for 317 yards, and 
the Cowboy defense limited Packer wide receiver Sterling Sharpe to four catches 
for 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the one game this year that I thought we were handled pretty well," 
Holmgren said. "When we got on our heels, it was over. They put it to us pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping Sharpe, the only player in NFL history who has caught 100 or more 
passes in consecutive seasons, is the first priority of any team facing the 
Packers, and the Cowboys must hope they can do it twice in one season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys took Sharpe out of the earlier game by hitting him at the line of 
scrimmage and using double coverage downfield, a luxury Dallas could afford 
because of Green Bay's mediocre running game. 
</P>
<P>
 If Aikman is the picture of consistency this season -- he has thrown only six 
interceptions -- Packer quarterback Brett Favre is at the other end of the 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Favre, 24, threw for 3,303 yards and 19 touchdowns during the regular season. 
Unfortunately for the Packers, he also gave up 24 interceptions to lead the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Detroit Lions on the final Sunday of the regular season, Favre 
threw four interceptions and the Packers lost, 30-20, missing their chance to 
clinch the NFC Central title. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young quarterback wasn't rattled in the wild-card playoff game against 
Detroit last Saturday at the Pontiac Silverdome. He found Sharpe for three 
touchdown passes, including a 40-yarder to win the game with 55 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers can only hope that Favre and Sharpe can work their magic two weeks 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that Aikman left his game on the Letterman set.

NBA ROUNDUP; MAVERICKS SET HOME LOSS MARK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks set an NBA record for home-court futility Saturday night, 
dropping their 17th consecutive game at Reunion Arena -- a 104-87 loss to the 
San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Cummings and David Robinson scored 20 points each to pace the Spurs, who 
have won five in a row and 10 of their last 11. Dennis Rodman had 19 rebounds 
and Robinson 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks had been tied with the Orlando Magic, who lost 16 in a row at 
home over two seasons in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn led Dallas with 26 points, including five three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks' 2-32 record is the worst in NBA history after 34 games. Dallas 
tied the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers for consecutive losses in one season when 
it dropped 20 in a row in November and December. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 97, Detroit 88 -- Derek Harper had his best game as a Knick, scoring 
18 points and leading a fourth-quarter comeback that extended the Pistons' 
losing streak to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks were held to 12 points in the third quarter and trailed by five 
entering the fourth. They held Detroit to two points in the first 6:23 of the 
fourth and put the game away with a 16-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, acquired from the Dallas Mavericks on Jan. 6, and Anthony Mason each 
had six points during the decisive run. Patrick Ewing led the Knicks with 23 
points and John Starks added 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 82, Houston 76 -- Scottie Pippen scored 25 points and B.J. Armstrong 
had five in the final 1:57 as the Bulls held off a fourth-quarter Rocket rally 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, who missed four of six free throws in the final 1:06, got 29 
points from Hakeem Olajuwon in their lowest scoring game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 110, Philadelphia 67 -- The Cavaliers turned in the best defensive 
performance in team history at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland, which has won 10 in a row against Philadelphia, got 20 points each 
from Brad Daugherty and Gerald Wilkins in ending the 76ers' three-game winning 
streak. Chris Mills added 16 and Larry Nance 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's 67 points were the fewest scored in an NBA game this season and 
fewest by the 76er franchise since it moved from Syracuse in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 119, Sacramento 103 -- A.C. Green scored 22 of his career-high 35 
points in the second half and also had a career-high 19 rebounds as the Suns 
ended the Kings' five-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns outscored the Kings, 23-10, during the final 5:30 for their 11th 
consecutive victory over Sacramento, a streak dating to Nov. 26, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Wilson, starting only the second game of his career, had career-highs 
of 25 points and 10 rebounds to lead Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 94, Atlanta 91 -- Malik Sealy scored on a baseline drive with 35 
seconds to play, giving the Pacers the lead for good at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended the Hawks' seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 113, Milwaukee 105 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 33 points on 13-of-16 
shooting and had 14 rebounds to lead the Magic at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Scott added a season-high 23 points off the bench and Nick Anderson 
also had 23 as the Magic won for the ninth time in the last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 97, Miami 78 -- Shawn Kemp had 25 points and 14 rebounds and Detlef 
Schrempf keyed a game-breaking 14-3 run with six points at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics led, 79-67, before pulling away with the 14-3 run for a 93-70 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrempf had 15 points and a season-high 13 rebounds. The SuperSonics are 16-1 
at home this season.

PLAYER ASSAILS HANDS-ON MANNER; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: SIMI VALLEY RESERVE SAM 
RODRIGUEZ, WHO WAS THROWN TO THE FLOOR BY HIS COACH AFTER DRAWING A TECHNICAL 
FOUL, SAYS BRADSHAW SHOULD RECEIVE MORE THAN 'A SLAP ON THE HAND.'

<P>
 Basketball player Sam Rodriguez said Saturday that Simi Valley High Coach Dean 
Bradshaw should receive more than "a slap on the hand" for throwing him to the 
floor during the Pioneers' game against Westlake on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who was uninjured, said a meeting is planned for Tuesday in which 
he, his parents, Bradshaw and Principal Kathryn Scroggin will decide how to 
handle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez also said a players-only meeting will be held Monday to discuss the 
incident. "Personally, I'm curious on what (Bradshaw's) punishment is going to 
be," Rodriguez said. "I don't think it should be a slap on the hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, a senior reserve guard, said he was whistled for a foul and an 
ensuing technical for talking back to an official late in the game, which Simi 
Valley won, 51-44. Bradshaw removed him and grabbed him by the back of the 
neck, screaming at him in front of the bench, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he was talking and screaming, he grabbed (my neck) tighter," Rodriguez 
said, "and as we got toward the end of the bench, he kind of threw me down. 
There was a lot of force in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw on Saturday said it was "an unfortunate situation. Dr. Scroggin will 
make comments Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said Bradshaw met with him after the game, but he was not satisfied 
with the coach's explanation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to explain that it was his duty to show the other players what's 
right and what's wrong," Rodriguez said, "but he went about it all wrong in my 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lost it, his composure and everything. There were hundreds of people there 
and he cracked in front of all of them. It's sad that it happened because he is 
supposed to be my leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally, I didn't really realize how deep it was until afterwards, when I 
saw the fans booing him. My mom was crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's father, Sam Rodriguez Sr., said Saturday, "We're all still real 
numb about it. It was something that happened in the heat of a tight game. It 
was very disturbing for his mother and me. We are still trying to sort through 
it. We are looking at all our options." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez Sr. later said, "Our attorney has advised us to make no further 
comment until all our options are explored."

BILLS' RALLY PUTS CHILL ON VALLEY FANS; PRO FOOTBALL: LOCAL MEMBERS OF RAIDER 
BOOSTER CLUB TRAVEL TO FRIGID BUFFALO, SEE PLAYOFF DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They traveled 3,000 miles, leaving behind the sunny and warm Southland 
climate, to support their favorite football team in sub-zero temperatures. You 
probably can't find more faithful Raider fans than these.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was freezing and into the game it got colder and colder," said Debra 
Zeldin of Canoga Park. "I wore tights, thermals, three pairs of sweats, three 
pairs of socks, boots, a jacket, a big coat and a ski mask. Oh, and two pairs 
of gloves." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Zeldin and 11 members of the Greater L.A. Raider Booster Club sat 
proudly in the stands at Buffalo's Rich Stadium, clad in multilayers of thick 
clothing and waving black and silver pompons during the Raiders' second-round 
AFC playoff game against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the coldest game in Bills' history with a wind-chill factor that 
dropped the temperature to minus-32 degrees. About a dozen doctors, nurses and 
paramedics were on hand to treat fans for frostbite and exposure to the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of warm-blooded Californians, many of them from the Valley, survived 
the Eastern freeze by sticking together and sharing a large wool blanket 
featuring the Raiders' logo.  
</P>
<P>
 Zeldin, a 24-year-old Blue Cross employee, and her 61-year-old mother, Maureen 
Johnson, flew to New York on Friday for the big game. They stayed at the same 
hotel as the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most important game of the year and we all felt it was imperative 
to be there," Zeldin said. "The Raiders needed us more than ever."  
</P>
<P>
 Zeldin and her mother have been Raider season ticket-holders for three years 
and besides attending all home games this season, they traveled to Chicago, 
Seattle and San Diego to watch the team play. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a native of Canada who has lived in Canoga Park since 1964, said it 
got colder when the Raiders fell behind because the group did lots of jumping 
and cheering while the team was ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders held a 17-13 halftime lead but lost, 29-23. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started losing, we were just slouching down so it felt really cold," 
Johnson said. "Then we had to deal with the Buffalo fans pointing at us because 
we were losing. Some of them were nasty. They were using the F word and showing 
us the finger. They were just rude and it was very annoying to be in the middle 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeldin said a couple of unruly Buffalo fans tried to intimidate her group on 
its arrival at the stadium. She said, however, their antics didn't stop her 
from cheering loudly for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first got there, a couple of drunk people threw some snowballs at 
me," Zeldin said. "And when we sat down, the people next to us said, 'We don't 
want any Raider fans next to us.' Then through the game, they would throw these 
big ice things at us." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Johnson said one of her arms and a leg got too cold for comfort. 
But it's not as if booster club members didn't know what awaited them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, authorities for the Erie County Emergency Services announced that 
in addition to heavy clothing, boots and hats, spectators should be equipped 
with blankets, food, prescription medicine and a snow shovel because they may 
be stuck in traffic for a long time after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were dressed for it, but it was just very wet," Johnson said. "That really 
made it bad. It made it tougher to stay warm. Luckily, we didn't get stuck in 
snow after the game."

UPSET OF NORWAY SETS TONE FOR U.S.; SOCCER: JONES SCORES IN FINAL MINUTE AS 
UNITED STATES COMES FROM BEHIND AGAINST THE FOURTH-RANKED TEAM IN THE WORLD, 
2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Respectability has been a long time coming for the U.S. national soccer team. 
Scoffed at as a ragged band of "college boys" who qualified on a fluke for the 
1990 World Cup, the team has emerged as the confident host of this summer's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's assurance has been born of victories, including one over England 
last summer. But there were still questions about the talent and heart of the 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, to calculate the benefit of Saturday's 2-1 upset over Norway, 
ranked No. 4 in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout is likely to be widespread. The message to the rest of the soccer 
world is that Bora Milutinovic's team is capable of beating a world power, even 
when that team is at full strength. That possibility, only hinted at before, 
makes the U.S. team a pesky wild card for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 And the team, which has bickered and struggled, might have found a unity of 
purpose only five months before the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it sets a tone for the U.S. team," said Cobi Jones, who scored the 
winning goal in the final minute. "It sends a message to the rest of the world 
and ourselves. It says we can play with the best. We can come from behind and 
not give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway had loomed large for the United States, representing its first 
full-strength World Cup-qualified opponent in months. Norway came by its 
ranking after a World Cup qualifying performance that left it at the top of a 
group that included England, the Netherlands and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the team had called up several of its top players based in the 
English league. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the game played in brilliant sunshine before 15,386 at Sun Devil 
Stadium, the United States neutralized Norway's long-ball attack and itself had 
its best day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had the game's first scoring chance in the 10th minute. He received the 
ball from Dominic Kinnear and his shot hit the underside of the crossbar and 
bounced out. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway scored at the end of the half. Jostein Flo used a give-and-go to get 
around sweeper Marcelo Balboa. Erik Mykland sent a cross to Frank Strandli, 
whose left-footed shot went past goalkeeper Tony Meola. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the U.S. players had done well winning balls and creating chances, 
they were suspect as a team with the ability to come from behind. Milutinovic 
told them at the half that they were playing well and could win. 
</P>
<P>
 The players took that to heart in the second half, starting with Balboa. The 
national team veteran had not played a full game in 8 1/2 months after tearing 
the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Balboa played 29 minutes as a 
substitute against El Salvador five weeks ago and was expected to come in for 
only 20 minutes in the second half on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Desmond Armstrong bruised his back in the first half and Balboa came in to 
replace the man who had, for months, replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa reveled in his return and, in the 55th minute, scored his first goal in 
more than a year. Joe-Max Moore lofted a corner kick and Balboa rose above a 
group of defenders and headed the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was called "impossible" by Norwegian Manager Egil Olsen, but he spoke 
in frustration. Norway gave up only five goals last season, but four came off 
corner kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning goal was set up by Claudio Reyna, a junior at Virginia playing in 
his first game with the senior national team. Dario Brose, also making his 
debut with the team, threw a long ball up the sideline to Reyna, who had raced 
past the surprised Norwegian defenders. Reyna got off a sharp left-footed shot 
from the left side that Norway's goalkeeper, Frode Grodas, stopped but did not 
cover. Jones pounced on the rebound and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Elation was evident among the U.S. players, who have longed for a meaningful 
victory. But the true measure of the team's improvement might be this -- no 
longer is a loss to the U.S. national team an international humiliation. 
English manager Graham Taylor was excoriated after his team's loss to the 
United States last summer, but Olsen will merely regroup his team and learn 
from the experience.

FINDING HIS TOUCH; ARIZONA'S DYLAN RIGDON GOES TO AUSTRALIA, DISCOVERS SHOT HE 
HAD AT MATER DEI, UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the white-sand beaches and shapely waves of Australia, world-class 
skim-boarder, recreational surfer and college basketball player Dylan Rigdon 
found a long, lost friend last spring: 
</P>
<P>
 His jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 That rainbow-like arc, picture-perfect release and soft touch had deserted 
Rigdon for two seasons. Rust began to accumulate on the shot during a redshirt 
year at Arizona, and the jumper spent most of Rigdon's junior year on the 
shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon logged as much playing time in 1992-93 as Morley Safer does every 
Sunday night -- 60 minutes. Injuries and on-court inadequacies limited Rigdon 
to 12 games, and when he'd make a rare appearance, Rigdon admits he usually 
played "like a chicken with its head cut off." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon, a 6-foot-4 guard, made only four of 17 field goals (23%), one of nine 
three-pointers (11%) and scored 22 points. That's what he'd score on a good 
night for Mater Dei High School or UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 You could hear the snickering back in Orange County, where Rigdon's 1991 
transfer from Irvine, a lower-echelon Big West Conference team, to Arizona, a 
national power from the Pac-10, raised more than a few eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Thought you were too good for Irvine, huh Dylan? What do you think now, Mr. 
Bigshot?  
</P>
<P>
 He thinks he made a good decision, that's what. The big shot is back, and so 
is Rigdon. 
</P>
<P>
 A non-factor in 1992-93, Rigdon is now Arizona's first guard off the bench, 
and his long-range shooting exploits have helped the sixth-ranked Wildcats to a 
13-2 record entering Thursday night's game against UCLA in Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior is averaging 7.9 points and almost three assists. He has made 15 of 
31 three-pointers (48%), 39 of 47 free throws (83%) and has had three 14-point 
games this season. "He's been super for us," Arizona assistant Jessie Evans 
said. "He's kept a level head, sharpened his defensive skills, and has made 
some shots from beyond the NBA three-point line." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us back to Australia. Arizona spent 26 days touring the country 
last spring, playing 10 exhibition games against Australian professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Lute Olson used the trip to install his new three-guard offense 
and to get a good look at his returning players. Rigdon saw it as a chance to 
play a little basketball, see the sights and surf and skim-board some of the 
finest waves in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Both came home happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats went 9-1 on the tour, reaffirming Olson's decision that, with 
post players such as Brian Williams, Sean Rooks and Ed Stokes no longer in the 
program and the 45-second clock reduced to 35 seconds, Arizona had to employ a 
smaller, more mobile, perimeter-oriented lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon surfed a variety of beaches, from Sydney to Melbourne to the Gold 
Coast, and got enough playing time to find a groove. He averaged 8.6 points in 
the 10 games, shot 50% from the field, was 22 of 26 from the free-throw line 
and had 24 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the single biggest thing that helped Dylan was the Australia trip," 
Olson said. "We played 48-minute games and each player played a minimum of 20 
minutes. It gave Dylan a chance to get in the flow, gain some confidence, play 
for long periods of time without looking over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, whenever he played he tried to do too much too quickly. He had 
problems doing the right things, but in Australia, he got an opportunity to do 
his thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon's "thing" is to shoot from the outside, and when he's on, it's a sight 
to behold. As a freshman at UCI, Rigdon once made nine of nine field goals, 
seven of them three-pointers, in a 94-76 victory over Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon averaged 7.7 points that season (1989-90) and was named to the Big West 
All-freshman team. He averaged 11.7 points as a sophomore but was so sporadic 
he was benched by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a shooting slump and do other things well, but his whole game 
was knocking them down from outside," said Bill Mulligan, former UCI coach who 
is now at Irvine Valley College. "If they weren't going in, Dylan thought 
nothing would go right." 
</P>
<P>
 When Rigdon's shooting went south, so did the rest of his game, and when 
you're not a great defensive player to begin with, a lack of effort really 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Those slumps caused friction between Mulligan and Rigdon, and the two had 
several heated exchanges on the bench. But those arguments had nothing to do 
with his departure, Rigdon said. Irvine's 16-42 record in his two seasons was 
the real reason he left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play for a winner," Rigdon said by telephone from Tucson. "Every 
spring I watched 'March Madness' on TV and I wanted to be a part of that, 
whether I was playing two minutes or 20. I wanted an opportunity to play for 
the best, compete for the Pac-10 title and go to the NCAA tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of Rigdon's friends questioned the decision. Why leave a team you 
can star on for a school where you might spend most of the time on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon got his answer in his first game in Arizona's McKale Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 13,000 fans, screaming and yelling, and here I was, used to 
playing in front of 2,000 in the Bren Center," Rigdon said. "I was so nervous. 
I scored four points, but I was ecstatic. It's amazing the support you get from 
the community, the fans and other students here. They treat the players like 
celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a difficult adjustment going from Irvine, where defense was something 
the Anteaters did to catch their breath between fast breaks, to Arizona, a more 
regimented program where every aspect of the game was important. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember playing Nevada Las Vegas my freshman year and they had Larry 
Johnson, Stacey Augmon, Greg Anthony and Anderson Hunt," Rigdon said. "That was 
the most intense game I had ever played in, but here, every day in practice is 
like that. You have to have all your attention focused on what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon didn't last season. He was struggling in school and was hampered by an 
ankle sprain and a shoulder injury. He worried that he wasn't getting enough 
playing time, and when he got into games, "I just played terribly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Australia trip boosted his confidence, and when he returned to Orange 
County last summer, he began working with a physical therapist and personal 
trainer, rehabilitating until his injuries were fully healed and increasing his 
strength and stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon played in the L.A. Summer Pro League on a team with Cherokee Parks 
(Duke) and Scott McCorkle (Syracuse) and in pickup games with NBA players such 
as Scott Brooks, Adam Keefe, Tod Murphy and Byron Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was as prepared as I've ever been when I got back to school," Rigdon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon's timing was perfect. He entered this season in peak mental and 
physical condition, and Arizona's new offense, for which Rigdon's skills seem 
perfectly suited, has helped him emerge as a key player for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigdon usually spells former Mater Dei standout Reggie Geary on the wing, and 
with opponents focusing on guards Khalid Reeves and Damon Stoudamire, Rigdon 
has been able to spot up for many open three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 And if he misses a few shots, he doesn't get discouraged. He'll just dive for 
loose balls, bear down on defense, try to penetrate and pass or snag a few 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guards are our best players, and once they start penetrating it makes my 
job a lot easier," Rigdon said. "I just stand in the corner and get a lot of 
kick outs. I'm open for most of my shots, and I have my confidence back." 
</P>
<P>
 He had to go all the way to Australia to get it, but he's glad he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in Australia to have fun, surf and play basketball," Rigdon said. "I 
stopped worrying about the crowds, the media, what people thought of me, and my 
game just went up."

MIKE PENNER: PLOT TWISTS, CAST OF CHARACTERS MAKE FOR INTERESTING PLAYOFFS 
</P>

 U nconventional wisdom of the day . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bills 29, Raiders 23: Kind of reminded me of those old Ram playoff games in 
Minnesota, where the warm-weather team handles the conditions surprisingly 
well, is ahead at halftime, makes a crucial kicking error, forgets to make many 
crucial tackles in the second half, is flagged for a crucial pass-interference 
penalty and freezes at the finish. You do remember those old Ram playoff games, 
don't you? 
</P>
<P>
 49ers 44, Giants 3: Kind of puts those two Ram losses to San Francisco this 
season, 40-17 and 35-10, in perspective. Strange but true: T.J. Rubley's 
offense was more effective up there than Phil Simms'. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young: Let's see. The last time the 49ers played the Giants in a playoff 
game, the 1990 NFC final, the Giants advanced, 15-13. That game was played 
where? Candlestick Park? And the Niners' quarterback that day was? Joe Montana? 
Just checking. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana: If he doesn't win today, in the Astrodome, with Buddy Ryan's 
bounty hunters homing in on his every hinge, joint and socket, the Kansas City 
project will have failed. To whom do the Chiefs turn then? Johnny Unitas? Sammy 
Baugh? 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan: Could that right hook to the temple of Kevin Gilbride, delivered 
in the so-called "heat of battle," actually have been premeditated? Consider: 
The game was nationally televised. The Oilers had a bye the following week. The 
resulting commotion was guaranteed to fill the newspapers every day for 14 
days, thus thrusting Buddy back into the spotlight, enabling him to upstage 
Warren Moon, Gary Brown and an 11-game Houston winning streak. Nah, Buddy's 
mind just doesn't work like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Pardee: The head coach of the Houston Oilers. The country may have 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston-Kansas City: To the winner goes a trip to the freezer, and our 
prayers, since the winner will be the last thing standing between the Buffalo 
Bills and (gasp) the Super Bowl. Houston has the greater incentive, considering 
what happened after 35-3 in last year's playoff meeting, and a defense that 
might be able to interrupt Jim Kelly's private little game of catch with Bill 
Brooks. (More than anything else Saturday, the Raiders missed Jack Tatum and 
Lester Hayes.) But could anyone outside Texas, and maybe Philadelphia, root for 
Ryan in good conscience? The torture, the torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay-Dallas: Dallas avenges the Ice Bowl, despite the fact that Green 
Bay, after all these years, would be a nice change of pace in the NFC final. If 
only the Packers could bring the sleet and snow with them. If only the Packers 
knew which Brett Favre they were bringing with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding: Bizarre Sports Story of the Decade. If the allegations are 
true, what could the "Harding camp" have been thinking, if anything? That it 
could pull off a hit-and-run at the national skating championships and get away 
with it? That the sport would just throw up its hands and say, "Oh well, 
Nancy's hurt, she can't compete, that's it?" That the media wouldn't pounce on 
the story as if it were a raw steak in a pool of piranha, turning over every 
stone from Detroit to Portland? New motto for future Olympic hopefuls: If you 
can't beat 'em, beat 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 BCA boycott: I wish I could work up more sympathy for the coaches regarding 
the loss of a 14th scholarship, I really do, but I continue to see financially 
strapped universities cutting science programs, minority studies programs, 
library hours and baseball, swimming and gymnastics programs. I also wish every 
one of these coaches were as altruistic-minded as the argument put forward by 
UC Irvine's Rod Baker, but I suspect more than a few are driven by 
self-interest. For some, that 14th scholarship is important primarily because 
it enables State U. to stash a player that conference rival State Tech could 
really use. If the coaches truly want to make a difference, they can take that 
scholarship money and establish secondary education programs for their players 
once their eligibility expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The college football playoff: If scholarship money is the problem, here is the 
answer. It is coming, before the end of the decade, but in what form? Most 
favor a four-team playoff, but suppose such a system had been in place this 
year. Florida State and Notre Dame would get two bids, Nebraska the other, but 
who gets the fourth? Florida, which routed undefeated West Virginia? Or 
Arizona, which shut out Miami? Or Wisconsin, which beat UCLA, a team that 
placed ahead of Arizona in the Pac-10 standings? "If you break it off at two, 
No. 3 is upset," Bobby Bowden says. "If you break it off at four, No. 5's 
upset. There's going to be a debate no matter what you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi: As the Angels' minor league director, he and scouting director 
Bob Fontaine are responsible for most of the assets the current club has -- Tim 
Salmon, Chad Curtis, Damion Easley, Gary DiSarcina, Eduardo Perez. Why not give 
him a shot to step up? Angel general managers with bigger names and bigger 
reputations have only produced 34 years of exasperation. Angel fans do hope, 
however, that the sins of the father are not necessarily visited upon the son. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Olson: If another Bavasi/Fontaine production, name of Bryan Harvey, had 
been protected in the expansion draft, none of this would have been necessary. 
So far, the new front-office team has signed Craig Lefferts and Bob Patterson 
as set-up men, but the question remains: For whom? 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels and their lease: How about this -- the Angels and the Rams agreeing 
on something regarding Anaheim Stadium. Which is: Anaheim Stadium needs a 
face-lift. Or a wrecking ball. Right now, the Angels are one of the very few 
teams in the major leagues with a better spring-training facility than 
regular-season stadium. What the Angels need is their own Camden Yards. They 
already spruced up the uniforms. Build a better ballpark and who could fathom 
the next possibility? Maybe, even, a better ballclub.

SANTA ANITA; SUPAH GEM DEAL A COMBINATION OF DOLLASE AND SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Wally Dollase seems to have an eye for a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 He purchased Journalism for a reported $35,000 last year and the gelding won 
the first four times he ran for owner Richard Stephen, earned nearly $300,000 
in 1993 and was voted the California-bred turf champion by the California 
Thoroughbred Breeders Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of veterinarian Bruce Dodson, Dollase bought Supah Gem last 
summer for Stephen and Martha Perez. Second in two of her first four starts 
since, the 4-year-old Gold Meridian filly earned back a sizable portion of her 
$110,000 purchase price at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Never far off the pace while racing on the outside under Corey Nakatani, the 
8-1 shot ran down Sensational Eyes in the final sixteenth to win the $109,500 
El Encino Stakes by a length in 1:41 1/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 With the scratch of Mamselle Bebette, the pace in the El Encino was moderate 
and Supah Gem took full advantage for her first victory since a stakes at 
Calder in Miami on New Year's Day, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thrilled with the way she ran," Dollase said. "The outside post was the 
whole secret. She was able to relax out there. When I saw the (47 1/5 
half-mile), I figured she would finish well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time we ran her here she was part of a 45 1/5, and that's what did 
her in." She finished second to Miss Dominique in the Run For The Roses 
Handicap on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensational Eyes, making her first start since she finished last at 3-5 odds 
in the Linda Vista Handicap on Nov. 13, had taken the lead around the turn. 
Stalcreek, the 7-2 third choice, had some traffic trouble and finished third, 1 
1/4 lengths behind Sensational Eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Klair, the 9-5 favorite, finished sixth, beating only Alyshena and 
Tricky Princess. The beneficiary of a fast pace when she rallied to beat 
Pacific Squall at 11-1 in the Silver Belles Handicap last month at Hollywood 
Park, Golden Klair was hindered by the slow pace Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the moderate pace hurt," jockey Chris McCarron said. "She never 
tried to run today. The real Golden Klair didn't show up today, for whatever 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Dollase said Supah Gem is doubtful for the final race in the La Canada series, 
the 1 1/8-mile La Canada Stakes. The La Canada is expected to mark the 1994 
debut of Breeders' Cup Distaff winner Hollywood Wildcat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diazo, who will try to become the first since On The Line in 1988 to win the 
San Fernando Stakes after winning the Malibu Stakes, is the 5-2 second choice 
for the 1 1/8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled in the betting with Stuka, who is also owned by Allen Paulson, Diazo 
raced without his usual blinkers for the seven-furlong Malibu. He rallied along 
the inside and outfinished Concept Win by a half-length. Laffit Pincay will 
again ride for trainer Bill Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant Tango, who hasn't run since finishing fifth in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic, a nose in front of Diazo, is the 2-1 favorite in the field of 12. A 
developing son of Pleasant Colony, Pleasant Tango will be ridden by Eddie 
Delahoussaye, who is back after serving a five-day suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Favorites have won the San Fernando, the middle leg of the Strub Series, only 
four times in the last 16 years and there are plenty of longshots in the field 
today. Half of the dozen entrants are 12-1 or higher on the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those is Nancys French Fry, who has developed nicely since being 
claimed for $20,000 by trainer Vladimir Cerin for owner Rick Fritts on Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In four races since, the French Legionaire gelding has two victories and a 
third. However, he will be facing much tougher in the San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not expecting a miracle, but we can always hope," Cerin said. "He's very 
sharp, he's training very well and he looks good on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last opportunity to run against only 4-year-olds at this level. 
It's not an easy field, but I don't think (the 4-year-olds) are as good this 
year as they have been in the past. Diazo won the Malibu, but Malibu winners 
seldom win the San Fernando and there are some horses who were good as 2- and 
3-year-olds who aren't as good now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the position where we have nothing to lose and everything to gain. 
When we claimed him, he looks like he could be competitive at the level at 
which he was claimed, but he seems to have worked out a little bit better than 
that. He just seemed to develop when I got him. He's gained weight and looks 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meafara, who would have been heavily favored in the Grade I Santa Monica 
Handicap on Monday, won't race because of a pulled muscle in her side. 
</P>
<P>
 "She worked Wednesday and after she cooled out, she seemed to tie up," trainer 
Rafael Becerra said. "It's nothing serious, but she'll have to miss (the Santa 
Monica)." 
</P>
<P>
 In her absence, Arches Of Gold is the 119-pound highweight in a field of 10. 
Others entered Saturday morning include Senate Appointee, She's Tops, Another 
Natalie, Nannerl, Mamselle Bebette, Mama Simba, Southern Truce, Cargo and 
Desert Stormer. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Itsallgreektome, who hasn't run since November of 1992, will make his first 
start for trainer Bob Hess Jr. in Monday's third race. Eddie Delahoussaye will 
ride the oft-injured gelding in a $55,000 allowance at one mile on the turf.

MIGHTY DUCKS ADD ANOTHER BIG EWEN TO THE ORGANIZATION

 Todd Ewen is the Mighty Ducks' No. 1 enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the Ducks could have another who looks a lot like him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen's younger brother, Dean, has agreed to contract terms with the team and 
is expected to be assigned to San Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 Dean Ewen, 24, had been in the minors with the New York Islanders before 
undergoing reconstructive knee surgery last year. He practiced Saturday with 
the Ducks and said he has passed a physical.  
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 2, 240 pounds, he is a little shorter and a little more solid than 
Todd, 27, who leads the Ducks in penalty minutes with 144 and has a career-high 
six goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big kid," Todd Ewen said. "Skilled? Yeah, right. Skill runs in the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, while playing for the same junior team, the Ewen brothers started 
fighting while on opposite sides in a scrimmage. "The coach kicked us off the 
ice and we went out in the parking lot," Dean Ewen said. ROBYN NORWOOD

BLACKS IN O.C. GET IT TOGETHER AS UNIFIED FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a La Habra mother was beaten to death in a mall parking lot last 
September after a shouting match that was reportedly laced with racial slurs, 
police said initially that her attackers may have killed her because she was 
black. Prosecutors even added charges -- subsequently dropped -- that her death 
was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was no outcry then from Orange County's black community -- no 
meetings with top county officials, no impassioned press conferences, no 
demands for a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no response, and there should have been," said Randall Jordan, a 
minister who publishes a black monthly newspaper in Orange County. "I guess 
everybody thought it may have been a futile effort. At that time, I just don't 
think there was the organization between the various black groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Now jump ahead four months to January, 1994: A sheriff's deputy -- a black 
deputy -- is shot and killed by a fellow officer in what authorities describe 
as a tragic Christmas Day training accident. Black leaders -- often virtually 
invisible in local politics -- are angry. 
</P>
<P>
 They hold press conferences. They meet with county politicians. They criticize 
the slow and incomplete release of information. And, in a move stunning even 
some longtime county-watchers, they persuade Sheriff Brad Gates to request a 
state investigation into the shooting. All this in a case in which no evidence 
has surfaced to suggest that race played any part. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference this time, some black leaders say, can be traced to a meeting 
in Irvine three months ago at which black groups from the business, religious 
and civic communities came together to mobilize their sparse resources in a 
renewed push for empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some remain skeptical that a group comprising less than 2% of the county 
population can ever achieve much of a political voice. But the events of the 
three weeks following the death of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins have caused 
others to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been surprised that the black community has gotten as deeply involved in 
this issue as they have," said Dan Wooldridge, a political consultant who 
worked with the Sheriff's Department for years and as an aide to 
then-Supervisor Don R. Roth. "There's a heightened perception now that the 
black community will continue to play a higher-profile role in decisions that 
affect not only their community, but the whole community." 
</P>
<P>
 But if black leaders have staked out a higher ground on the Robins issue, 
their role has also attracted derision from people who accuse them of inflaming 
an already volatile issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they want to do is pursue their own agenda. They don't give a damn about 
Darryn Robins," said Robert MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County 
Deputy Sheriff's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I have heard about this case from the beginning indicates (the 
shooting) was an accident, and there was absolutely nothing racial about it," 
MacLeod said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders "infuriated the vast majority of Orange County sheriff's 
deputies with their quotes in (the newspaper), and that's black deputies, white 
deputies, men and women, young and old," he said. "They say, 'He's one of our 
own,' but they're out there disrupting the grieving of the family. . . . All 
they're doing is rubbing salt in the wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, is survived by a wife and a daughter, now 18 months old. Family 
members in the Los Angeles area have declined to discuss the Orange County 
black community's role in the case, saying they want to await the results of 
the district attorney's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the Dec. 25 
incident behind a Lake Forest movie theater to determine whether the shooter, 
Deputy Brian Scanlan, 32, of Anaheim should face criminal charges. Officials 
are looking at the possibility that Robins, playing the part of a suspect in a 
car stop during an informal training session, startled Scanlan by reaching for 
a gun hidden behind his car visor, and that Scanlan then shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Unanswered in the case is the critical question of why deputies were training 
in a public area with a loaded weapon -- in apparent violation of Sheriff's 
Department policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials challenged Gates from the outset over that issue, and black 
leaders joined in soon after the shooting to question whether the district 
attorney's office faced a conflict of interest in investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1985 county policy sets out procedures for the district attorney to 
investigate all officer-involved shootings, and no one has suggested that 
prosecutors have misstepped in their investigation. Some black leaders insist 
nonetheless that the office may be too close to the Sheriff's Department to 
offer an unbiased assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week of the shooting, about 40 members of a loosely formed coalition, 
representing some 15 groups from various facets of Orange County's black 
community, met to discuss how to respond to the shooting, said Jordan, 
publisher of the Black Orange, a monthly newspaper with a circulation of 2,500 
in the local black community. Their ranks included members of the Black Chamber 
of Commerce, the Baptist Ministers Fellowship Conference, the National Council 
of Negro Women, the Prince Hall Masons and other groups, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the group met again. Some two dozen people showed up, Jordan 
said. It was not a dramatic turnout, but it was a start. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the black community has usually held little political voice in a 
county that spent years trying to shake its image as a home to the John Birch 
Society: There are no blacks elected to any of the city councils, the county 
Board of Supervisors, or state or federal offices. More often than not, Latinos 
and Asians, rather than blacks, have been the ones to press issues of 
minority-wide interest, such as electoral redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
 And even when cases specifically affecting blacks have proven controversial -- 
such as the September death of the woman in La Habra, where some witnesses said 
she may have instigated and prolonged the fight with two white women that 
caused her death -- local black leaders have been criticized as too slow to 
take up the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robins case may change that, some black community members suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody that reads the paper and watches the television knows that 
there's a new black voice in Orange County . . . since the shooting," said 
Eugene Wheeler, a health care administrator who heads a business and civic 
group called 100 Black Men of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said black leaders knew when they began speaking out on the Robins 
case that there would be opposition. But he said dialogue between blacks and 
other county groups -- both pro and con -- is essential to political growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we're talking now," Wheeler said. "It wasn't happening before 
because there wasn't any major effort. But at some point, when we feel 
something is unjustly done that affects the African community, we need to speak 
out and be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 One pivotal development in the black community's response to the Robins case 
came two weeks after the shooting, when Wheeler and Jordan met with 
Undersheriff Raul Ramos for some two hours to press their case about the need 
for an independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, Gates pointed to community concerns in asking state Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren to intervene in the case and open an investigation. The 
attorney general turned him down, but even so the request itself marked a 
newfound credibility for a black community struggling to gain recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 After the state refused to intervene, black leaders continued to push their 
concerns and are now asking for a federal investigation into possible civil 
rights violations during the shooting. And Wheeler and Jordan met Thursday with 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez to call again for an independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said Vasquez, who could not be reached for comment on the meeting, 
remained firm in his belief that the district attorney can handle the case 
fairly. But the dialogue did achieve one aim. "He was respectful of our 
position, and now we can talk and continue to work together," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even within the black community, there have been differences of opinion 
over how aggressively to push the Robins case. 
</P>
<P>
 George Williams, executive director of the Orange County Urban League, says it 
is premature to talk about civil rights violations in the deputy shooting when 
the basic facts have yet to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know" what happened, Williams said. "That's the pain that surrounds 
this whole issue. Nobody is coming forward with any information that satisfies 
our need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he has discussed the shooting with several black community 
leaders in an attempt to devise an appropriate response. However, Williams said 
he doubts there is much the black community leaders can do until the district 
attorney's office completes its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as some urge patience, others suggest that the official silence 
surrounding the Robins case has only fueled wild and sometimes sinister 
speculation in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard some people call it an execution. Nobody's got anything to 
concretely base (their opinions) on, and that's the frustration," said Bill 
Mack, a black business consultant who is the former worshipful master of the 
Orange County lodge of the Prince Hall Masons. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any situation other than the case of a deputy -- had it been John Q. 
Citizen who was shot -- we would have known within 72 hours what happened," 
Mack said. "That is my concern -- why the cloak of secrecy?" 
</P>
<P>
 The only way that veil may be lifted, Jordan suggested, is by continuing to 
remind people in power that there is an interested and united black presence in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be very careful in what we're doing and how we're doing it," 
he said. "We don't want to be looked at just as black citizens. But people have 
to realize that we do see things from a different viewpoint, and that view has 
to be respected."

O.C. WATER CHIEF FAILED TO DISCLOSE PAID TRIPS; SANTA MARGARITA DISTRICT: BOARD 
CHAIRMAN SAYS ONE CABO SAN LUCAS VISIT WAS TO REVIEW FIRM'S WORK. 
</P>

<P>
 The chairman of the Santa Margarita Water District, who was slow to criticize 
the district's top two managers for taking $60,000 in gifts from companies they 
recommended for lucrative contracts, was treated to stays in Cabo San Lucas in 
1990 and 1991 by one of those same companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Don B. Schone, a member of the district's board of directors since 1977, 
traveled to the Baja California resort area for four days in April, 1990, and 
again for five days in May, 1991, with former General Manager Walter W. (Bill) 
Knitz and former Assistant General Manager Michael P. Lord, according to a 
source familiar with the trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone never reported the trips -- estimated to have cost the engineering firm 
of Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates in Irvine between $600 and $700 each 
-- on statements of economic interest, as he is required to do under the 
state's Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 And Schone voted those same years to give no-bid contracts to the company, 
which has been awarded nearly $14 million for engineering services over the 
past five years alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, an official who accepts gifts valued at more than $250 in any 
12-month period must abstain not only from voting on, but also influencing, any 
official decisions that could affect the donor in the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Several top officials of the engineering firm accompanied Schone, Knitz and 
Lord on the trips, and paid for all travel, lodging, food and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Schone acknowledged making a "field review trip" in 
1990 to look at Bein, Frost's work on a sewage reclamation system installed for 
Koll Co. developments, such as the Hotel Palmilla in Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Because "this on-site early feasibility review was at no cost to the (water) 
district/customers, the proposal (to make the trip) appeared at the time to 
have merit," Schone wrote. He said he made the trip on his own time and was 
accompanied by Knitz and Lord, who were suspended after the scandal broke, and 
later retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone said that during the trip he learned a great deal about how the Santa 
Margarita Water District might reclaim water during a drought, and that the 
district is "now placed in an optimum position to expand lessons-learned 
applications, when necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 But he declined to discuss the second free trip to Cabo San Lucas in 1991, nor 
would he explain his failure to list the gifts on his disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kallenbaugh, the president of Bein, Frost, said the company would have no 
comment on the trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Schone did not record the gifts, Knitz and Lord, who are under a 
joint federal-state criminal investigation for conflicts of interest stemming 
from their acceptance of gifts, appeared to have made some disclosure on their 
reporting forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, for instance, listed the 1990 Mexico trip as being worth $2,000 but did 
not list the 1991 trip. Knitz valued the trips he got from Bein, Frost in 1990 
to be worth $3,000 and the 1991 trip to be worth $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Schone has reported receiving gifts only during calendar years 
1990 and 1992 -- the only two times he has submitted economic interest 
statements in his 17 years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the chairman reported he accepted about $80 in free meals from Bein, 
Frost, and the same amount from another contractor -- MacDonald-Stephens 
Engineers in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he reported accepting gifts of between $50 and $100 from Bein, Frost, 
and the same amount from MacDonald-Stephens Engineers for "quarterly business 
events." He also listed $50 to $100 in gifts from the district's law firm of 
Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth in Newport Beach for "biannual business 
events," including entertainment at a national conference on water issues. 
</P>
<P>
 After questions were raised last year on whether Schone had actually received 
$200 to $400 per donor for 1990 because he listed his $50-to-$100 contributions 
as quarterly, Schone explained his filing. He said that he had received $200 to 
$400 from all three donors combined, but no more than $250 from any one donor 
-- a situation that would have required him to abstain from voting on their 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of last year, Schone refused to criticize the spending and 
gift-taking habits of Knitz and Lord, saying that he probably should have 
examined their expenses more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 When the district adopted a draft code of conduct in May, Schone spoke about 
ending "the perception that anyone is being influenced (by gift-givers). The 
impression is that there is influence being applied." 
</P>
<P>
 When the district's new ethics code -- one of the most stringent of any public 
agency in California -- was finally adopted, he spoke of "restoring trust in 
the district." But Schone has never openly criticized Knitz and Lord, nor has 
he expressed any regrets over his own lavish spending of district funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Knitz and Lord were in the habit of submitting expense accounts that 
would have made some Fortune 500 executives blush, and Schone's name regularly 
appeared along with theirs on dinner and bar tabs at some of the region's most 
expensive hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a moment of introspection last April, Schone said he should have been more 
diligent in inspecting Knitz's expense forms. But, he reasoned, Knitz was an 
outstanding manager and the district was too preoccupied with more weighty 
matters to dwell on expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have confidence in someone and you are signing things in a hurry 
after a board meeting, you don't really look that closely," he said. "I should 
have said, 'Let's call a meeting and look at this and that,' but we were too 
busy building water and sewage treatment plants." 
</P>
<P>
 The two managers retired in May after The Times revealed their spending habits 
and the enormity of the gifts they had accepted from contractors doing business 
with the district. Knitz, to kill some time during a trip to New York, once 
hired a stretch limousine for $245 to take him sightseeing around Central Park 
and wait while he had a $121.70 lunch at the Tavern on the Green. 
</P>
<P>
 The new revelations about Schone startled longtime board member John F. Van 
Dam, who resigned in May shortly before Knitz and Lord retired. Van Dam, who 
was elected to the board in 1981, said he never knew about the trips to Cabo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure wasn't invited and wouldn't have gone even if I was invited," Van Dam 
said. "That's just a case of bad judgment. I'm surprised at Don. I would have 
thought he would have known better." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Dam said he was so disgusted by the actions of Knitz and Lord that he was 
ready to resign last March 28, the day the first story about Knitz and Lord 
appeared in The Times. But other board members urged him to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no difference between what Don did and what (Knitz and Lord) did," Van 
Dam said, referring to the gift-taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone is the lone holdover from the board that was in office when the scandal 
erupted. Van Dam resigned first. And in November, the other incumbents were 
swept out of office by angry voters in a biennial election. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone, who is in his 18th year of service, has served on the board longer 
than any other director in the district's 30-year history. The 52-year-old 
engineer works for Southern California Edison and is up for reelection in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last April that Schone charged the district $275 to take 
part in the El Viaje de Portola, a horseback ride that traces the route of Don 
Gaspar de Portola. He said the expense was justified but never explained why. 
</P>
<P>
 He also billed the district for $1,302.62 in room service at the 1992 
conference of the Assn. of California Water Agencies. At the time, Schone 
rented two rooms to entertain consultants, an expense that Van Dam said last 
week was ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never would have approved of that," he said. "What were we selling? We have 
nothing to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, William R. Mitchell of the Orange County chapter of Common Cause 
and Mark P. Petracca, an associate professor of political science at UC Irvine, 
wrote a commentary that appeared in The Times in which they held Schone 
accountable for the activities of Knitz and Lord. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though there has been abundant evidence that the actions of Knitz and Lord 
were well known to the board, Schone continues to plead ignorance," they wrote. 
"If true, then Schone failed to perform his responsibilities as chairman. If 
Schone knew of their activities, he should acknowledge this and not allow Knitz 
and Lord to be the fall guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, they said, Schone should step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Petracca said last week that he is not surprised to learn that Schone took 
trips at a contractor's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time for Mr. Schone to fall on his sword," Petracca said.

FIRST LADY IN SPOTLIGHT FOR HER ROLE IN WHITEWATER; INQUIRY: HER REPUTATION AS 
A TOP CORPORATE LAWYER SEEMS TO CONFLICT WITH HER PURPORTED NAIVETE ABOUT HIGH 
FINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the White House struggles to contain the controversy surrounding the First 
Family's involvement in the tangled Whitewater real estate and banking affair, 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's role has begun to raise as many questions 
as her husband's. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Whitewater matter now seems to be a controversy befitting the 
Clintons' modern, two-career political marriage: Just as the First Lady has 
played a critical role in major policy decisions on health care and other 
issues, she now finds herself a central figure with her husband in this 
politically threatening affair. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Hillary Clinton's independent career as a top attorney in Little Rock, 
Ark., while her husband served as governor -- and her reputation for being the 
financial brains of the household -- that have prompted questions about her 
role in the Whitewater matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even friends in Arkansas are wondering why she has not come forward with a 
fuller account of what she did and what she knew at the time the events in 
Arkansas were unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why she hasn't been more open about explaining" her work as a 
lawyer for the defunct savings and loan at the center of the affair, said 
Beverly Bassett Schaffer, a former Arkansas state regulator and longtime 
acquaintance. "I don't understand why they (the Clintons) were in business with 
someone like McDougal," the thrift's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 James B. McDougal, a friend of Clinton's, owned Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan and was half-owner with the Clintons in an Ozark Mountain real estate 
venture called Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and Hillary Clinton have said they were innocent bystanders as 
McDougal drove his lending institution into the ground with a binge of bad 
loans and frittered away nearly $70,000 of their assets on the bankrupt 
Whitewater project. 
</P>
<P>
 Unresolved, though, is the mystery of how to reconcile this image of naivete 
in the world of high finance with Hillary Clinton's reputation as a top 
corporate lawyer and board member of some of the nation's biggest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The question being asked more openly in Washington and Arkansas is: How could 
Hillary Clinton -- whom one legal journal called one of the 100 most 
influential lawyers in the United States -- be unaware of gross mismanagement 
at a savings institution she represented as an attorney and neglect her 
family's only substantial financial asset? 
</P>
<P>
 Those questions intertwine with a web of others as federal investigators 
continue their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, they are trying to determine whether, amid the careening 
disorder in the runaway S&L and Whitewater, money from a federally guaranteed 
thrift was diverted into Clinton's 1984 campaign coffers. Also, there is the 
matter of whether the institution got favorable treatment from Arkansas 
authorities that helped keep it in business before federal regulators finally 
shut it down in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Hillary Clinton's role as a former attorney for the savings and loan 
that has raised concerns about her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal, who worked with Clinton in Sen. J. William Fulbright's office in the 
1960s, bought Madison Guaranty in 1982 and soon began using it to make loans to 
important figures and to finance an assortment of speculations including his 
4-year-old Whitewater venture with the Clintons, according to records filed 
with state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, the S&L was on dangerous ground, and in 1984 federal regulators 
warned that they considered its lending practices questionable. The Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board directed the S&L -- along with others in Arkansas -- to 
raise more capital and put its house in order. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal hit upon a quick way to raise money: selling stock. But that was not 
normal practice for savings and loans in Arkansas, and the proposal needed 
approval from the Arkansas Securities Commission. So McDougal had Little Rock's 
Rose Law Firm -- and specifically partner Hillary Clinton -- make his case for 
the stock sale to state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has acknowledged that Hillary Clinton, then on a 
$2,000-a-month retainer with Madison Guaranty, worked on the proposal in 1985. 
But senior presidential adviser Bruce Lindsey said her involvement was minimal 
and that most of the legal work was done by a junior associate, Richard N. 
Massey, then a 28-year-old, first-year lawyer at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Madden, the current commissioner of the Arkansas Securities Department, 
said there are at least three Rose Law Firm documents to the commission that 
refer questions back to either Hillary Clinton or Massey. But he said the case 
was fairly routine and that a "competent first-year attorney (as Massey was at 
the time) could have been primarily responsible for doing the research and 
doing the drafting." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffer, who had just been appointed securities commissioner by then-Gov. 
Clinton when the case arose, said Massey handled meetings with her staff and 
that Hillary Clinton was the only senior attorney at the Rose firm with whom 
she or her staff communicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Schaffer and her staff decided that the unusual capital-formation 
plan did not violate Arkansas law and approved it. Because of its growing 
financial problems, though, the plan was never carried out by the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffer, now an attorney in private practice in Fayetteville, Ark., said she 
did not feel pressured to rule favorably because the governor's wife was 
involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But she expressed frustration at her old friend's seeming hesitation to 
publicly explain her role as a senior attorney in the case and thereby allow 
suspicions to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly, Hillary Clinton has insisted that questions arising from private 
matters a decade or more ago are not a fit subject for public scrutiny. She has 
refused to respond to any detailed inquiries, including the central one: 
whether it was proper to represent a business partner before a state regulatory 
board run by a personal friend and appointee of her husband's. 
</P>
<P>
 She has expressed bewilderment that the press and investigators are interested 
in the aftermath of a money-losing private real estate investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, 
said the First Lady's response created a credibility problem. It is difficult, 
he said, to believe she would ignore a major family investment and overlook a 
potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can't just throw her hands in the air and say she doesn't understand all 
this legal stuff. She can't claim ignorance of legal details," he said. "It is 
not a credible defense. Her involvement is a fix of her own making." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and associates said the two images of Hillary Clinton -- meticulous 
lawyer and absent-minded investor -- are not mutually exclusive. While she was 
a keen professional at work, she had little interest in acquiring wealth or 
closely monitoring her family's finances, according to her defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, a longtime Arkansas friend of the First Family, said the Clintons got 
into the Whitewater deal on the assumption that McDougal would manage the 
property and the Clintons would simply make payments periodically on loans 
taken out to purchase the undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went into a real estate development with a developer with the clear 
understanding that he would manage the investment and with the clear 
understanding they would be passive investors," Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they were asked to write a check to Citizens Bank of Flippin (Ark.) or 
even to the McDougals when McDougal said there weren't sufficient funds from 
property sales to cover that month's mortgage payments, that didn't seem 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Clintons were aware that the property appeared to be losing value, 
but rather than questioning McDougal or seeking detailed financial statements 
on the deal, they just wrote it off as "bad business judgment," Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another family friend's assessment is that neither of the Clintons was 
interested in getting rich; they concentrated through the 1980s on Clinton's 
political career and his wife's policy crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know beans about business," said this Arkansas friend, who asked 
to remain nameless. 
</P>
<P>
 According to McDougal, the Clintons early in 1985 expressed interest in 
Madison Guaranty's affairs -- as well as their personal enrichment -- and 
sought the thrift's legal work for the Rose Law Firm. McDougal said he put 
Hillary Clinton and the Rose firm on the $2,000-a-month retainer at then-Gov. 
Clinton's request -- a claim the White House has denied. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, when Madison Guaranty clearly was on the verge of failure and 
McDougal was suffering personal problems, records show that Hillary Clinton 
wrote to McDougal to seek power of attorney over all Whitewater-related 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 She received that power but apparently did not use it until 1992, when she 
authorized Rose firm law partner Vincent Foster to work on Whitewater's 
delinquent tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated case, she took a distinctly active role in a family investment 
involving much less money. In 1983, she, Foster and Webster L. Hubbell, another 
law firm partner, formed an investment partnership called Mid-life Investors, 
with each contributing an initial $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy P. Drew, a stockbroker who helped them set up the venture, said neither 
Foster nor Hubbell later expressed much interest in the performance of the 
partnership but that Hillary Clinton called frequently to ask about her 
investment, at times phoning him daily with questions and instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership eventually foundered, paying annual dividends of between $2 
and $20 from 1986 to 1992, according to the Clintons' income tax returns. 
Lindsey, who follows the Clintons' personal business closely, said he knew 
virtually nothing about Mid-life Investors except that it was an insignificant 
part of the family's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the White House defensiveness about Whitewater questions over the last 
three weeks can be attributed to concern for Hillary Clinton's potential 
exposure to political damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief item on the White House agenda for 1994 is the health care reform 
initiative, which the First Lady has headed. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides -- and ultimately the Clintons -- concluded this week that 
until questions are resolved about the First Family's business matters, little 
progress can be made on affairs of state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't going to be no health care campaign if they don't get Whitewater 
out of the way," said Betsey Wright, Clinton's former gubernatorial chief of 
staff and an informal adviser. 
</P>

 Times staff writer Thomas B. Rosenstiel contributed to this story.

FRUSTRATED U.N. TROOPS HUMILIATED IN BOSNIA; BALKANS: TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS 
SAY THE MISSION IS CAUGHT BETWEEN LOFTY RESOLUTIONS AND HOSTILE FORCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Croatian army troops disarmed and abducted four Canadian soldiers on a 
routine patrol earlier this month, an enraged Gen. Jean Cot, the French 
commander of the U.N. Protection Force, denounced the affront to his 
peacekeeping mission as "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 But the kidnaping incident and Cot's protest passed almost unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost two years of provocations by Balkan combatants that have ranged 
from extortion to mock execution, the U.N. peacekeeping mission here has 
amassed a history of humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three generals have left the Balkans peacekeeping effort, the largest and most 
expensive in U.N. history, with harsh words for the operation and the Security 
Council that ultimately commands it. Two others have left quietly, but they 
clearly suffered the same frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials still assigned to the operation warn that the United Nations 
is discrediting the very principle of peacekeeping by persisting with a mission 
they consider a charade. 
</P>
<P>
 And as incidents of hostage-taking and harassment add new terrors to an 
operation that has quickly rolled up a record casualty toll, top U.N. 
commanders here are increasingly vocal about their displeasure in being the 
fall guys for the West's inability or unwillingness to halt the worst 
bloodletting in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration is epidemic in the ranks of the U.N. mission as its 29,000 
soldiers -- with no mandate to fight -- try to bridge a chasm between good 
intentions, in the form of lofty Security Council resolutions, and the reality 
of a deployment that has placed them between hostile forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The resentment was most recently made apparent by the resignation of Belgian 
Gen. Francis Briquemont, who denounced the "fantastic gap between all these 
Security Council resolutions and the means available to execute them." Saying 
that he no longer even reads the resolutions that serve as marching orders for 
the U.N. mission, Briquemont decried "a sort of paralysis" that he believed was 
plaguing the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgian general, who commanded the 12,000 troops in Bosnia for less than 
six months, echoed the condemnation of his unhappy predecessors in saying the 
Balkans mission was doomed from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United Nations decided to come to Bosnia in a peacekeeping operation when 
there was no peace and no agreement," Briquemont told reporters in Sarajevo 
before his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior official at U.N. headquarters here said Briquemont was compelled to 
leave because "he couldn't put up with the increasing irrelevance of the 
operation and its degradation of the entire United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just humiliation -- we are being censored in New York and ICFY," the 
Geneva-based International Conference on Former Yugoslavia being mediated by 
European Union envoy Lord Owen and special U.N. envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg, the 
official said. "Reports to the Security Council are 'cleaned up' to describe a 
mission we don't recognize. We have a sense we are just being played with." 
</P>
<P>
 Cot, the third person to command the operation since its first troops arrived 
in April, 1992, has warned of the potential for the conflict to spread faster 
than his forces would be able to contain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the inertia in the system," he said, it would take too long for 
contributing countries to deploy more troops vital to ensuring the success of 
any peace accord for Bosnia or Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to Security Council resolutions passed seven months ago designating 
Sarajevo, Srebrenica and four other besieged Bosnian cities as U.N.-protected 
"safe havens" that were to be guarded by 7,600 more troops; fewer than 2,000 of 
those forces have been deployed, and those only within the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Cot has publicly lamented the "humiliation" of his troops in both Bosnia and 
Croatia, where armed renegades on all sides have fired on U.N. forces and 
humanitarian aid workers, hijacked their armor and supplies and stolen huge 
sums of hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. forces have also capitulated to Serbian demands for road-use taxes, 
security deposits or supplies of gasoline for rebel escort of U.N. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the U.N. forces are deployed in Bosnia to protect aid convoys and have 
no orders to stop the fighting, they are often caught in the cross-fire of 
battles raging around them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most devastating recent incidents, according to U.N. sources here, 
was a Serbian rebel attack on Canadian troops near the central Bosnian town of 
Visoko in late December. 
</P>
<P>
 Two drunken Serbian gunmen, angered by the United Nations' failure to rescue 
another rebel fatally wounded by government sniper fire, surprised 11 
Canadians, only two of whom were armed at the time; the Serbs disarmed them, 
took them hostage, lined them up against a wall and terrorized them with sprays 
of machine-gun fire aimed just over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers of the Nordic contingent deployed near the now Muslim-held town of 
Vares have appealed for reinforcements and shows of air power that have not 
come, another U.N. source said, leaving field commanders resentful that the 
mission is incapable of providing backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly frustrated with an operation that has ambitious goals but no 
means to achieve them, Cot reportedly has asked for the authority to order air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 He used what was supposed to be a briefing for Madeleine Albright, the U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations, to appeal for American pressure on U.N. 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to give him that right, according to 
one participant at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost no one among the legions of military officers and foreign diplomats 
monitoring the Balkans crisis believes that the U.N. hierarchy in New York will 
ever confer such powers to operation commanders, not least because the mission 
in Bosnia continues to be defined as a humanitarian action. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization broadened its threat to 
intervene in Bosnia, declaring that in addition to Sarajevo, they are prepared 
to launch air strikes in two other "safe haven" areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of NATO's potential involvement, however, no air strikes can 
be launched without the approval of the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the announced resignation of Briquemont, Cot and other officers in the 
mission here have been more outspoken about their frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent news conference, Cot accused the warring factions in Bosnia of "a 
great deal of cowardice" in taking advantage of the self-imposed limits on his 
own troops' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, when this war is over . . . we will say in what way our forces -- 
who came to help . . . were treated," the force commander said of the Balkan 
gunmen, barely able to restrain his contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 In lamenting the departure of Briquemont, Cot clearly blamed the mission more 
than the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be difficult to give more than he has," the French general said of 
his Belgian colleague. "When one gives as much as he has, one wears out." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of mission responsible for civilian affairs, 
is also preparing to leave the operation after 22 months. He says Western 
leaders have much to risk by continuing to ignore the underlying causes of the 
Balkans crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a virtually uncontrollable explosion of extreme nationalism at this 
moment in Eastern Europe, and there is a danger that this explosion could blow 
us all away in terms of our commitment to democracy, continental stability and 
human rights," Thornberry said. "This is the defining issue of our time, and it 
is unfair to blame (this mission) or the United Nations" for failure in the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 He called upon Security Council members to identify and agree on the aims of 
the peacekeeping mission, warning: "There is no chance for achievement if you 
don't define the objectives." 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of direction was one reason the first operation commander, Indian Gen. 
Satish Nambiar, left after less than a year, and why his successor, Gen. 
Lars-Eric Wahlgren of Sweden, stayed for only three months before Cot took 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 The first U.N. commander in Bosnia, Gen. Lewis MacKenzie of Canada, left the 
operation with venomous words for a mission he described as hopelessly 
imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
 French Gen. Philippe Morillon, who preceded Briquemont as Bosnian commander, 
waged a one-man campaign to protect embattled Muslim civilians during his 
tenure, only to be stifled by U.N. administrators who have pragmatically 
accepted the mission's fig-leaf role. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major concern among peacekeeping officials, as stated by Briquemont, 
is a feeling among U.N. troops that they arrived too late to serve as a buffer 
between combatants who were already at each other's throats. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian leaders appealed for Western intervention to protect them throughout 
the six-month war they fought against the Serb-led Yugoslav Peoples Army, the 
third-largest force on the European continent, when it rolled over one-third of 
Croatia in 1991 while claiming to be defending the republic's Serbian minority. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Serbs and Croats were engaged in that bloodletting, the leaders of 
what was then a broadly integrated, multiethnic Bosnia begged for protective 
U.N. intervention to establish a peacekeeping force while there was still peace 
to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force here was finally created in early 1992, after then-U.N. envoy 
Cyrus R. Vance mediated a cease-fire between the Yugoslav army and the Croatian 
government. That agreement called for an interim U.N. deployment until an 
international peace conference could work out a permanent solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Serbian revolt against Bosnian independence began in March, 1992, 
attention shifted from the Croatian standoff to the Bosnian crisis and has 
stayed there, while Serbian rebels in the occupied Krajina region of Croatia 
solidified their proclaimed independent state. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, the mediator from the European Union (formerly called the European 
Community), and Stoltenberg, who replaced Vance, have lately talked of the need 
for a "global solution," one that would take into account all of the ethnic 
clashes and frictions in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 But as their roving diplomatic endeavor staggers on fruitlessly in its 18th 
month, Western countries have had to improvise to deal with the mounting 
humanitarian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. warplanes nightly parachute relief supplies to starving Muslim enclaves 
because road convoys are routinely blocked by Serbian gunmen who have the 
holdout pockets surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting between Croats and Muslims, who were allied against the Serbian 
rebellion before it deteriorated into a three-way civil war, has also prevented 
aid from getting to many regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But air drops are the most expensive and least efficient means of getting food 
to endangered civilians, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
has noted often. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials also criticize the expense of a meaningless "no-fly" zone 
enforcement, which sends a vast network of sophisticated military aircraft on 
four-times-daily patrols of Bosnian air space but has been repeatedly denied 
permission to force down violators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs more to run the air drops and the 'no-fly' zone than it does our 
entire ground operation," complained one official with the U.N. refugee agency. 
"It would be better if they just dropped dollar bills from the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 As relief work is undermined by the unchecked violence, and resentment of the 
outside world's indifference turns even the intended beneficiaries of the 
mission against it, U.N. troops have increasingly become targets of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the world body's force was deployed 21 months ago, the mission has 
suffered 850 casualties, 71 of them fatal, making it the most physically 
hazardous in U.N. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Exasperated by attacks on their troops, France, Britain, Canada and Spain have 
threatened to withdraw from Bosnia this spring, if the mission remains mired in 
the status quo of thwarted relief works. 
</P>
<P>
 But mission officials concede that they are actually hostages of the crisis 
and fear that they will be expected to soldier on, because their presence is 
the West's alibi for avoiding the unpopular moves needed to actually stop the 
fighting and set a deterrent example for nationalist aggressions to come.

NEWS ANALYSIS; INMAN SEEN AS A POSSIBLE DRAG ON CLINTON'S PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton picked Bobby Ray Inman to replace Defense Secretary Les 
Aspin last month, the choice was widely hailed as just what the President 
needed to win credibility with the military and its backers on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old retired Navy admiral had acquired broad experience in the 
national security arena and an awesome reputation as a bureaucratic infighter. 
He was all but an idol to conservatives in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as the blunt-spoken former intelligence officer prepares for a Senate 
confirmation hearing on Jan. 25, some analysts are beginning to wonder whether 
Clinton may find Inman to be too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is expected to be a team player publicly, experts say he could 
prove to be a drag on the President's push to reshape U.S. foreign policy -- 
particularly on how much to cut Pentagon spending and when to send U.S. troops 
to international trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 While Aspin -- who often seemed cowed by the President's national security 
team -- was reluctant to press his views too vigorously, some expect Inman to 
prove a formidable advocate who could challenge Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and the National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the dangers is that they (the Administration) may have gotten more 
than what they thought they got," said Don Snider, military and political 
affairs director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Some 
of them will consider it disruptive." 
</P>
<P>
 Inman rankled some White House loyalists when, as the President announced the 
nomination last month, he asserted that he had agreed to serve as defense 
secretary only on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you know," he told Clinton at a nationally televised press conference, "I 
had to reach a level of comfort that we could work together, that I would be 
very comfortable in your role as commander in chief -- President -- while I was 
secretary of defense." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have found that level of comfort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in Washington is as comfortable with Inman. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals have criticized Inman for rushing to the defense of James Guerin, a 
one-time U.S. businessman and CIA intelligence source who was convicted of 
transferring military technology to Iraq and South Africa. Inman tried -- 
unsuccessfully -- to win Guerin a shortened sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman also caused a minor flap in Washington when the White House conceded 
just after his nomination that he had failed to pay Social Security taxes for 
domestic help even though he knew such conduct was illegal. He paid $6,000 to 
the IRS only after he was nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he has boasted of his successful days in business, Inman's stints 
in the commercial world ended in disaster. Tracor Inc., a defense contracting 
firm he ran, fell into bankruptcy in 1991. Westmark Systems, an investment firm 
he headed, became mired in debt during his stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
 On another level, some critics have suggested Inman has too much of a Cold War 
mentality to preside successfully over the Pentagon's transition to a post-Cold 
War world. Most of Inman's jobs in the Navy were in the intelligence arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also contend that Inman consistently has proved himself a quitter. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned as CIA deputy director in 1982 after a spat with then-director 
William J. Casey, quit as a consultant to the House Intelligence Committee that 
same year after the panel was critical of the U.S. intelligence community, and 
left Westmark in disarray in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of these is expected to pose any major impediment to the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House blunted the flap over Social Security taxes by contending that 
Inman did not pay them because he wanted to see whether Congress was going to 
change the law governing such levies. 
</P>
<P>
 And Inman's falling-out with Casey came over some of the director's more 
questionable covert operations. "They were just cut from two different bolts of 
cloth," an Inman friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman intimates scoff at any notion that he is too imbued with a Cold War-era 
mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Gates, the former CIA director whose nomination Inman helped rescue 
after Gates was being pilloried by Democrats in 1989, points out that Inman was 
the prime mover behind a CIA decision in the mid-1980s to shift more of its 
attention to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be a look-ahead-to-the-medium-term kind of person," Gates said, 
dismissing as "nonsense" suggestions that Inman has been too closely tied to 
the intelligence community. "He has had very broad exposure to defense issues," 
Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Webster, another former CIA director, agreed. "One of Bobby's 
strengths is to look out into the future and make a case for what is going to 
be needed," Webster said. "He will be received as a very professional 
individual and will speak with credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Inman's main impact is expected to be felt internally, both in helping to 
shape the Administration's foreign policy and in the day-to-day running of the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast to Aspin, who had difficulty with the administrative aspects 
of his job, Inman has shown himself able to run a large, structured bureaucracy 
as well as highly articulate and skillful at influencing other policy-makers. 
He has also amassed a record as a master of political manipulation, adept at 
swaying both Congress and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 He has remained silent on defense issues pending his Senate confirmation 
hearings. But a survey of his recent writings and conversations with his 
intimates offers some insights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending: Although Inman fully accepts the proposition that the nation must 
continue to shrink the size of its military Establishment, he is unlikely to 
accept steep budget cuts as readily as Aspin did -- and may well have the clout 
to blunt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman reportedly has no major quarrel with the finding of Aspin's "bottom-up 
review" that America must be prepared to fight two major regional wars 
simultaneously. But he worries that the current budget may not be adequate to 
do the job, and he is expected to push for more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intervention: Inman is a firm believer in sending troops to intervene abroad 
when the national interest requires, but he is likely to insist more firmly 
than Aspin did that they have adequate equipment and support, a well-defined 
mission and a plan for getting out. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also expected to push Clinton to formulate a firm national military 
strategy for the post-Cold War world that spells out when the United States 
should intervene and under what conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social issues: Inman is no troglodyte -- he overturned policy at the 
National Security Agency to enable a homosexual to keep his post -- but he is 
expected to be cautious in putting Clinton's policies on gays and women in the 
military into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason: To avoid stirring up contentious new battles on Capitol Hill. "His 
freedom of movement on these issues is sharply limited by Congress," one 
insider said. "He'll work hard behind the scenes to effect change, but he's 
likely to take it slow." 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense conversion: Inman is already an ardent backer of the Aspin 
Pentagon's efforts to reform the military procurement process and to ease the 
burden on defense contractors, both by loosening regulations and by subsidizing 
industries needed for their critical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 He also supports moving away from buying big-ticket weapons -- such as new 
generations of aircraft and missiles -- and channeling more to research and 
development, an approach that enables the military to keep up on technology 
without having to spend as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman is certain to face a full platter of issues when he steps into Aspin's 
shoes later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the budget squeeze, he will have to put Aspin's new policies 
affecting women and homosexuals into effect. He will also have to decide how to 
revamp America's nuclear forces for the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 "His biggest challenge will be in trying to figure out what the President 
really wants the defense Establishment to do -- what the military's mission 
really is under this Administration," said Robert W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon 
strategist. "There really hasn't been any clue."

COLUMN ONE; PROTECTING HUMAN GUINEA PIGS; RADIATION TESTS RAISE THE CHILLING 
QUESTION; CAN IT HAPPEN AGAIN? PROBABLY NOT, EXPERTS SAY, CITING A WAVE OF 
REFORMS. BUT ETHICAL GRAY AREAS REMAIN WHENEVER PEOPLE EXPERIMENT ON PEOPLE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The experiment would have proceeded quietly had Ernest Prentice not put a stop 
to it. He thought it was immoral, maybe even illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept was simple: A University of Nebraska pediatrician wanted to test 
human growth hormone on girls with Turner syndrome, a genetic defect that 
causes retardation, stunted sexual development and extreme shortness. Half the 
girls would get three hormone injections a week for 18 months. The other half, 
the "controls," would get placebo shots of saline solution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the annals of scientific horrors -- a legacy that includes the grotesque 
medical experiments of the Nazis, the deliberate failure of U.S. doctors to 
treat poor black men for syphilis and, now, shocking revelations about human 
radiation testing -- this study, proposed in 1988, would hardly merit a 
footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, it troubled Prentice. As vice chairman of the review board that 
approves all research at Nebraska, the cell biologist did not think the 
pediatrician's plan complied with stringent federal regulations designed to 
protect child research volunteers. He was uncomfortable with the idea of 
children in the placebo group getting so many injections that would do them no 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged his board to turn down the request. The experiment was canned before 
it began. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time the Nebraska experiment was scuttled, an ethics panel at the 
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., confronted the same decision 
but reached a very different conclusion. The NIH approved the human growth 
hormone experiment, placebo injections and all, saying it did not pose a danger 
to the children. The study is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Prentice remains dumbfounded by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to," he said, "is can you ask kids, particularly kids who 
are retarded, to have hundreds of injections, which are obviously painful, for 
benefit to society? There's an ethical question and a regulatory question and 
my answer to both is no." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Nebraska controversy illustrates the delicate, and extremely subjective, 
ethical choices that accompany any experiment in which people are the subjects. 
Yet the fact that the debate occurred -- and that Prentice had the authority to 
halt a study he believed was improper -- is testimony to dramatic advances made 
in the past two decades to protect Americans who serve as guinea pigs in 
thousands of scientific studies each year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the nation confronts the chilling disclosures of Cold War radiation 
testing conducted on children, prisoners and others without their knowledge, 
many are shaking their heads and asking the obvious question: Could this happen 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, according to medical ethicists, is probably not -- at least not 
easily, or in as egregious a fashion. Clearly, gray areas exist in interpreting 
ethical codes. And there still is room for abuse. Although scientists might be 
able to dance around the edges of ethics, experts say that moral breaches on a 
grand scale are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer is science left up to the conscience of individual scientists. After 
a series of scandals that broke in the mid-1970s -- including the radiation 
tests, which first became public then albeit in much scantier detail than now 
-- a web of federal regulations and ethics boards was established to govern 
nearly every research endeavor in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists who flout the rules may lose their privilege to conduct future 
research, have their funding slashed and, if the violation is severe enough, 
face criminal prosecution. "We've already had our public response (to the 
radiation experiments)," said Robert J. Levine, a medical ethicist at Yale 
University, "and we have taken corrective action." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, as a congressional inquiry into the radiation experiments began last 
week, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who is chairing the hearings, indicated 
that further legislation may be necessary, particularly to protect those who 
were often victimized -- children, pregnant women, the mentally retarded and 
prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, experiments involving these groups come under especially intense 
scrutiny. Research on prisoners is an area with vast potential for abuse, as 
Oregon and Washington scientists demonstrated in the 1960s when they dipped 
inmates' testicles in irradiated water in exchange for $5 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison experimentation is now so tightly regulated that it rarely occurs. Many 
states, including California, ban the practice. And in a curious backlash, some 
AIDS-infected inmates have called for a loosening of the rules so they can 
participate in tests for experimental drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say ethics is fuzzy and that it doesn't get us anywhere," said Arthur 
L. Caplan, a University of Minnesota ethics professor and author of "When 
Medicine Went Mad: Bioethics and the Holocaust." "If you want to see a place 
where ethics has gotten somewhere, human experimentation is a good place to 
look. I'm not going to tell you that everybody comes to the right answer and 
that everything is rosy, but it is much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible 
Medicine, which frequently criticizes biomedical research, concurs -- up to a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have come a long way, there's no doubt about that," Barnard says. "We have 
rooted out every egregious abuse that we could find. But what we are left with 
are those abuses that we don't find, because they are done by the military and 
are secret for that reason. And we haven't rooted out the abuses that are 
subtle, that have not yet become the substance of ethical discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 Science, however, did not accomplish this transformation on its own. It took a 
sordid history, public outrage, a crusading anesthesiologist and, ultimately, 
an act of Congress to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is inherent tension in biomedical research; each study is like a tug of 
war, with the researcher's quest for knowledge on one side and the rights of 
the subjects on the other. Medical literature is punctuated with cases in which 
the rope got pulled too far in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human curiosity is such a powerful force," Barnard said. "It is the driving 
force behind science. The history of science is the history of curiosity often 
running amok." 
</P>
<P>
 Moral matters often shape modern science. Take the case of AZT. When 
government researchers first tested this drug on AIDS patients, they pulled the 
plug on the experiment when they discovered that the medicine seemed to be 
working -- it would have been unethical to withhold the drug from the patients 
who were getting a placebo. Doctors would no doubt have learned much more had 
the study continued, but as is often the case, the research had to be stopped 
before they answered all their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The most basic principle of medical ethics -- and the one most often violated 
when science does run amok -- is that of "informed consent." The idea is 
simple: researchers must obtain the consent of the people who participate in 
their experiments, and inform them of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 This concept -- clearly ignored by some scientists who conducted the radiation 
research -- dates back at least to the turn of the century, to a series of 
classic experiments performed by Army Maj. Walter Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1900, Reed, a physician, was asked to head a commission to investigate the 
cause of yellow fever, which killed thousands every year. He suspected 
mosquitoes played a role in transmitting the deadly tropical disease, and so he 
asked his soldiers if they would permit themselves to be bitten by insects that 
had bitten yellow fever patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soldiers were told they could die from it, and at least one did," said 
James Whorton, a medical historian at the University of Washington. "This was a 
very unusual situation. You were intentionally giving somebody a disease which 
had no treatment. That stirred doctors' consciences." 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment proved that mosquitoes do carry yellow fever, and it won Reed a 
page in the history books. Yet it would never have been permitted today. Nor, 
for that matter, would some other famous experiments, including Jonas Salk's 
pioneering research on a polio vaccine, in which thousands of schoolchildren 
volunteered to be injected with a killed form of the virus before tests had 
proved it was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, by current standards, Reed's methods of obtaining consent were crude 
at best. Says Whorton: "It's never been clear to me how much pressure there 
might have been from the Army for people to volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until four decades later, when Nazi doctors went on trial at 
Nuremberg, that the notion of informed consent was formalized. The trial 
disclosed the grisly medical legacy of the Third Reich: To study hypothermia, 
doctors dumped concentration camp prisoners in icy vats of water and watched 
them freeze to death. To see what would happen to pilots at high altitude, they 
put inmates into high-pressure tanks and let them decompress; the subjects' 
lungs exploded. They shot people to examine wounds with different bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazis advanced three defenses: They said they were justified because the 
subjects were doomed to die, because the experiments were necessary for 
national defense, and because the participants were a drain on society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those arguments all got rejected in 1947 when the Nuremberg tribunal issued 
the Nuremberg Code," Caplan said. "So when somebody says that the ethics were 
different in 1950 (when many of the U.S. radiation tests took place) than they 
were in 1994, forget it. We knew exactly what the Germans had argued at the 
trial and we knew exactly what we had put forward as a response, which was to 
say that none of those arguments were persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, serious abuses continued long after Nuremberg. Many were documented by 
Dr. Henry K. Beecher, a Harvard Medical School anesthesiologist who wrote a 
landmark 1966 article in the New England Journal of Medicine outlining 22 of 
what Caplan calls "the most miserable, rotten experiments" that took place 
after World War II. All endangered subjects without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Beecher's revelations -- including one study in which penicillin was 
intentionally withheld from military men who had rheumatic fever and another in 
which healthy babies were X-rayed so doctors could study their bladders -- 
rattled the American medical community. But it was not until the 1970s that the 
issue of ethics in medicine exploded, with a series of newspaper and television 
exposes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most notorious cases was cited in Beecher's article: In 1955, at 
the Willowbrook State Hospital in Staten Island, N.Y., mentally retarded 
children were deliberately infected, without their knowledge, with hepatitis as 
part of an experiment to develop a vaccine. At the Jewish Chronic Disease 
Hospital in New York, terminally ill elderly patients were not informed that 
they were being injected with live cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experiment that outraged Americans more than any other was the 
"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male," a breach of ethics 
that lasted 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, doctors for the U.S. Public Health Service set out to research 
syphilis in 400 poor, illiterate black men in Tuskegee, Ala. They lured their 
subjects with the false promise of free therapy; among the "treatments" were 
spinal taps with no anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Most horrifying was that these men were denied penicillin -- after it became 
clear in the 1940s that the antibiotics would have cured them -- so the 
researchers could study the natural progression of the disease. This went on 
until July, 1972, when a whistle-blower blew the lid off the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, the disclosures prompted Congress to create the National Commission 
for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. 
After countless public hearings, the panel issued a litany of regulations 
governing research paid for with taxpayer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Department of Defense, which underwrote many of the radiation 
experiments, now must comply with those rules, the agency initially resisted 
and operated under its own guidelines until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said: 'Look, a lot of our research has to do with classified stuff and, 
therefore, how can we put it under public view the way biomedical research has 
to be done?' " said Albert R. Jonsen, an ethicist at the University of 
Washington and commission member. "And we essentially said: 'Well, you've got 
to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The commission changed the culture of medical research in two ways. First, no 
longer could scientists simply claim that their work would benefit society; it 
had to benefit those subjects involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The second was that all research would be subject to the approval of a 
so-called Institutional Review Board, such as the one Prentice serves on at 
Nebraska. Today, there are thousands of these "IRBs" across the nation, from 
the tiniest community hospital to the best-known universities to huge federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But no system is fail-safe, and these boards are only as diligent as the 
people who serve on them. At a hearing held in a Boston suburb Thursday, 
Kennedy said he is considering a recommendation made by Dr. Kenneth Ryan, a 
Harvard University ethicist, to institute site visits by federal regulators to 
review boards that sign off on research. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists can -- and have -- flouted their rules, although not without 
consequences. As Caplan said: "There's not an ethics cop at every lab." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Martin J. Cline, a UCLA professor of medical oncology who 
in 1980 proposed a gene therapy experiment on people with beta-thalassemia, a 
genetic blood disorder. At the time, gene therapy was highly controversial, and 
the review board at UCLA turned down Cline's proposal, telling him to conduct 
further studies on animals first. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cline went to Italy and Israel and performed the experiment -- 
unsuccessfully -- on patients there. The UCLA board insisted that Cline needed 
its approval to conduct the research, even overseas, and the National 
Institutes of Health disciplined the researcher by requiring him to undergo a 
more cumbersome review when he applied for grant money. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode, Cline said, derailed his career. He abandoned gene therapy, a 
field of science that today is booming. Instead, he researches leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it was very difficult to retain a laboratory, to retain funding," 
Cline said. He added that he believes his experiment was ethical. The 
participants were fully informed and the research was intended to benefit them. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Nebraska case and others illustrate, once bottom-line questions 
such as informed consent are settled, the business of ethics can grow murky. 
One scientist's honorable pursuit is another's dance with the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 At the NIH, controversy continues to rage over experiments with human growth 
hormones. In addition to the Turner syndrome studies, NIH scientists are now 
testing the hormones on so-called "short-stature" children who have no medical 
problems, but are simply short. 
</P>
<P>
 This has provoked an intense ethical debate, as well as a lawsuit. In the wake 
of the suit, which claims that the hormones could expose healthy youngsters to 
the risk of disease, the NIH temporarily suspended the research and appointed 
an independent panel to investigate. The panel found nothing wrong, and the 
studies resumed in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is outrageous," said Jeremy Rifkin of the Washington-based Foundation 
for Economic Trends, which brought the lawsuit. "Everyone is talking about 
these radiation experiments. . . . Why is this any different?" Questioning 
Experiments 
</P>
<P>
 A University of Nebraska review board turned down a study involving human 
growth hormone for mentally retarded girls who have a genetic defect called 
Turner's syndrome. Although the research was approved by the National 
Institutes of Health, Nebraska rejected it after considering the following 
questions raised by federal regulations adopted in the 1970s to protect people 
who serve as human guinea pigs in medical experiments. Here are the 
university's answers: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1: Does the research involve only minimal risk? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No. 
</P>
<P>
 * 2: Does the research involve greater than minimal risk but offers direct 
benefit to the subjects? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No, because girls who got injections of placebo would not benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3: If the research offers no direct benefit, is it likely to benefit society 
by yielding general knowledge about the disorder being studied? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3A: If the above answer is yes, does the research pose only a minor increase 
over minimal risk? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No 
</P>
<P>
 * 3B: Are the procedures involved in the experiment reasonably similar to what 
the subjects would undergo in their actual medical treatment? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3C: Is the experiment of vital importance to understanding the disorder? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No.

CLINTON HAILS BELARUS FOR ARMS POLICY; EUROPE: PRESIDENT STOPS IN FORMER SOVIET 
REPUBLIC TO COMMEND IT FOR GIVING UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. BUT HE ALSO 
REPRIMANDS LAWMAKERS FOR THEIR RESISTANCE TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton dropped into this most docile of former Soviet republics 
Saturday to give it a pat on the head and a kick in the pants. In the process, 
he stepped into a wasteland of fog and ice, where remnants of the Cold War 
linger and the faces of people on the crumbling streets are stony with 
continuing hardship and undimmed memories of slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The pat on the head was for Belarus' quick, complete compliance with Russia's 
request that it give up the nuclear weapons on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The kick in the pants was for the country's Parliament -- an old-style Supreme 
Soviet left over from Communist days -- for its stubborn resistance to 
political and economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, quiet Belarus sometimes behaves as if it wished the Soviet Union 
had never disappeared. On military questions such as nuclear weapons, it often 
follows neighboring Russia's line. Its leader, Stanislav Shushkevich, is trying 
to institute gradual reforms -- but the Supreme Soviet, an unreformed assembly 
of old-time apparatchiks, wants him to stop even that. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Belarus gave up any claim to the nuclear weapons on its territory in 
1991, it instantly became one of the United States' favorite former Soviet 
republics. The United States worked for more than two years, ever since the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, to persuade Ukraine and Kazakhstan to get rid of 
their nuclear weapons too, but neither was as cooperative as Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted Clinton, wife Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea to 
spend a cold and dreary Saturday in Minsk, a city that has never ranked among 
Europe's tourist attractions, before heading to Geneva, where the President 
will meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad today for discussions on the 
stalled Mideast peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belarus led the way" in eliminating nuclear weapons, "and you deserve the 
credit and thanks of citizens all over the world," Clinton told an audience of 
government officials, university professors and students at the Belarus 
National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you will follow through with the commitments that have been made to 
hold new elections in March of this year," Clinton said. "I hope you will press 
ahead with plans to create a new constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Shushkevich wants to write a new, de-Sovietized constitution and hold early 
elections for a new Parliament, but conservatives in the Supreme Soviet have 
resisted both moves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the abstract wrangling about foreign and domestic policy is overshadowed 
by the all-too-visible practical realities of Minsk -- and Kiev and much of the 
rest of the former Soviet empire that Clinton tried to reach out to on his 
weeklong trip. 
</P>
<P>
 All but leveled during World War II and rebuilt to the shabby, graceless 
standards of the Soviet empire, Minsk reflects the grim face of more than half 
a century of determined communism. It has also suffered mass butchery on a 
scale and frequency that most Americans can scarcely imagine -- at the hands of 
both the Nazis and Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton ran unexpectedly into all of that Saturday when he planned to visit a 
memorial to tens of thousands of Belarussians who were summarily executed for 
suspected disloyalty from 1937 to 1941, during the Stalin era. 
</P>
<P>
 The President originally planned to visit the site, a patch of fields and pine 
forest that was ankle deep in melting ice and snow Saturday, as his first stop 
in Minsk. But former Communist hard-liners in the government complained that he 
was giving the memorial -- a simple, cross-like stone slab -- too much 
significance (they have been promising for several years to erect a permanent 
memorial, but it has yet to be built), and Clinton postponed the visit until 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, a small band of unreconstructed Communists unfurled red banners along 
Minsk's main boulevard and protested Clinton's visit with signs calling for a 
return to the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 Another showed a cartoon of a hook-nosed Uncle Sam stealing Belarus' wealth, a 
reminder of the historic anti-Semitism that contributed to the liquidation of 
one of Central Europe's largest Jewish ghettos during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Such remnants of historic passions are scattered all over the former Soviet 
Union, but nowhere are they more stark than in Belarus. Under a Supreme Soviet 
full of former party members, the country seems trapped in a time warp, between 
an old world that has disappeared and a new world they refuse to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Minsk's government center still sports a giant, brooding statue of V. I. 
Lenin. The main street is no longer Lenin Prospect, but a nearby avenue is 
still loyally named Karl Marx Boulevard. And while the Communist Party 
officially rules no more, its headquarters has simply been turned into offices 
for -- surprise -- the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
 Belarussians seem to have a hard time remembering they are supposed to be 
independent -- not surprising for a nation that was part of Russia for 
centuries until 1991. When people in Minsk talk about "our country," they often 
mean the whole of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Belarus hasn't even set up a real currency of its own, one of the most basic 
steps in achieving economic independence. The new Belarussian ruble is linked 
to the Russian ruble and is referred to here as the "rabbit" ( zalchik ) -- for 
the picture on the bill -- to distinguish it from its older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons came to Minsk from a three-day visit in Moscow, which concluded 
with a gala dinner Friday night hosted by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
and an overnight stay in a guest apartment in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Minsk, Mrs. Clinton met children suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, heart 
disease and other illnesses during a visit to Pediatric Hospital No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons flew Saturday evening to Geneva, where the President was to meet 
today with Syria's Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is aimed at giving a jump-start to Syrian-Israeli negotiations in 
the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior State Department official warned that no immediate concrete 
results are likely from the talks.

SYRIA TRUMPETS CLINTON-ASSAD TALKS AS EPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN and NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the height of President Clinton's European tour last week, the 14 million 
residents of this highly structured, tightly controlled nation were bombarded 
with news of an event of historic -- even epic -- proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A meeting between the two giants," declared one of the state-run daily 
newspapers that deliver Syria's official line each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strategic turning point that will decide the future of the region for years 
to come," announced another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past 20 years, no summit between two world leaders has received as 
much attention as this," proclaimed a third. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the hyperbolic Syrian spin was not Clinton's meeting with Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin, an event that merited barely a mention here in the 
capital of a nation that was once among Moscow's closest Middle East allies. 
Nor was it the nuclear disarmament treaty signed by Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The event that was the subject of Damascus' rhetorical blizzard was the summit 
scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. today in Geneva between Clinton and Hafez 
Assad, the authoritarian Syrian president who has outlasted five of his 
American counterparts and a litany of U.S. legislation aimed at isolating his 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 So intense was the hype and so high are the expectations surrounding today's 
summit that everyone from Clinton Administration officials in Washington to the 
diplomatic corps and Syria's intellectual elite in Damascus found themselves 
trying to temper it. 
</P>
<P>
 They have warned that the Clinton-Assad meeting is unlikely to produce an 
immediate, concrete breakthrough in the stalled Middle East peace process, nor 
will it alter overnight America's strained relations with a nation that it has 
long viewed as a renegade. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet among even the most cynical of those analysts, officials and diplomats 
stressed that the meeting will likely be a landmark of the Mideast's painful 
path to peace -- a watershed that most agreed will help pave the way for a 
future peace agreement between Israel and its most bitter, best-armed neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to come up with a peace treaty in a three-hour meeting," one 
Western diplomat said in Damascus. "In the next three to six months, you will 
see something. The peace process demands they do something. And this meeting is 
the first real key to unlocking the impasse." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadik Azm, a Damascus University professor and prominent Syrian intellectual, 
agreed. "There is a consensus now that this peace agreement is going to go 
through. Not immediately -- maybe in three months or six months. Maybe a year. 
But this is the first time there has been this kind of certainty here. There is 
skepticism, resignation and some healthy cynicism. But there also is optimism, 
in the sense that this meeting opens up a bold new game. It is a turning 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 The official mood in Damascus continued to be decidedly upbeat on the eve of 
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are optimistic," Information Minister Muhamed Salman told The Times in a 
rare interview Saturday night in Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlining the basic position Assad will bring to the summit table today, 
Salman said: "Syria considers Israel its enemy because Israel occupies part of 
its land, and also Israel occupies part of Lebanon's land. When Israel will 
withdraw from the occupied territories, there will be some change for Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody should expect Syria will compromise on its land." 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said Saturday that 
Israel will give back all of the Golan Heights -- the strategic plateau that 
Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War -- if Syria pledges that it is 
ready for full peace and normal relations, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Salman repeated Syria's harsh criticism of the agreement for limited 
Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho signed in September by 
Israel and Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, which broke ranks 
from Syria and the other Arab delegations in the peace process to negotiate the 
accord in secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace cannot be in pieces," he said, echoing Assad's longstanding demand for 
a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and all its neighbors 
simultaneously. "After the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the situation worsened in 
the occupied territories, and it spread more instability through the region." 
</P>
<P>
 But Salman concluded on a positive note. "We really seek and cling to peace." 
</P>
<P>
 And, when asked whether the Syrian people would support any such agreement 
with Israel, Salman said: "The trust President Hafez Assad enjoys from his 
people will make the majority of the people back all of the steps the president 
takes." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the first such meeting between an American President and the 
cunning, calculating Syrian leader whose name means "lion" but whose shrewd 
tactics more often are likened to those of a fox. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an event that Washington insiders and Syrian analysts described as a 
task fraught with far more risks for Clinton than for Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 In summits that have spanned two decades, Assad has met Richard Nixon in 
Damascus and Jimmy Carter and George Bush in Geneva -- the summit site of 
choice for a Syrian leader who has never been to America and has always 
insisted that U.S. presidents meet him halfway. 
</P>
<P>
 In each summit past, American presidents have met with Assad when they had 
compelling reasons to do so: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nixon, on a Middle East tour, unsuccessfully sought to shift public 
attention away from Watergate two months before his resignation in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carter tried, also unsuccessfully, to broker a Middle East peace process in 
1977 similar to the one that began in Madrid in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bush used it to appeal for, and win, Assad's backing for America's 
international military coalition to drive Iraq from Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton requested today's summit with Assad through Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher last month, hoping that it will serve as a dramatic gesture of 
reassurance that the Syrian strongman remains the pivotal player in the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a center-stage role that Assad, who views himself as the chief 
architect of the future Middle East and a singular leader in the region, has 
assumed for years and one that fueled his personal outrage after Arafat 
secretly negotiated the accord with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 With talks between the PLO and Israel mired in details and their historic 
agreement to begin Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho 
now delayed by weeks, Clinton is gambling that the attention he lavishes on 
Assad will jump-start the equally crucial peace talks between Israel and Syria, 
which also holds the key to similar accords with Lebanon and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 For Assad, who remains in firm control of Syria and wields ultimate influence 
over neighboring Lebanon, the summit is virtually risk-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said his position remains remarkably unchanged from the one that met 
Nixon two decades ago: The return of the entire Golan Heights in exchange for a 
peace treaty with his Jewish neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absolute red line for him is the sovereignty of Golan," Azm said. "I 
think everything else is negotiable. He's a very smart, shrewd tactician. He 
knows how to play his cards. And, after the PLO agreement, he has kept all his 
options open." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, in a police state where Assad controls the media and all levers of 
power, last week's summit hype was testimonial to how another Syrian described 
the task for Syria's president: "Here, whatever he (Assad) does is always 
presented as a success before it happens. Even if nothing happens in Geneva, it 
will be described here as, 'The president stood fast in the face of Clinton's 
demands.' " 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials and analysts in Washington agreed that the meeting 
will be a far more daunting task for Clinton, particularly after the grueling 
week of crucial, complex and far-reaching diplomacy that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad, perhaps the smartest and certainly the most meticulous leader in the 
region, has been preparing for the session at least since December. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhetoric alone is critical in meetings with a leader as formal and copious as 
Assad; William B. Quandt, a former National Security Council expert on the 
Middle East, noted that the Syrian president can take a single slip of the lip 
far more seriously than it was intended. To illustrate, he described just such 
an incident from Nixon's 1974 summit with Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon said the American strategy was to get the Israelis to pull back on the 
Golan in a step-by-step fashion, which was our policy," Quandt recalled. "Then 
he said, 'When they reach the edge, they will topple over.' Assad loved it. He 
took this as an American commitment that we would try to bring about full 
Israeli withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Quandt believes that, on balance, the Clinton-Assad meeting is likely 
to advance the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when meeting with leaders who are not exactly paragons of 
democracy and human rights is in the interest of U.S. foreign policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the American agenda today, U.S. officials said it will be limited to 
Middle East issues. 
</P>
<P>
 They held out little hope for Assad's longer-range goal of reshaping his 
entire relationship with America -- a decision dating to the Soviet Union's 
collapse to moderate his policies and reach out to the United States and the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad's ultimate aim, analysts said, is to get his nation off the American 
list of nations sponsoring terrorism and the accompanying U.S. economic 
sanctions; the State Department has already indicated that will not occur at 
least until Syria makes peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials added that Clinton intends to press Syria on an array of 
bilateral issues, among them Assad ending his support for terrorist groups 
headquartered in Damascus and improving his regime's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrians have jailed an estimated 4,000 political prisoners for years, 
despite the recent release of 3,500 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the circumstances surrounding the summit, some American critics 
cautioned that the young President may not be nearly tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton must resist Secretary of State Warren Christopher's inclination to 
appease Assad with diplomatic concessions for merely returning to the talks" 
with Israel, the conservative Heritage Foundation said of today's meeting. 
"This would only reward Assad for his delaying tactics and stiffen his future 
negotiating demands. In Geneva, Clinton should press Assad to reverse Syrian 
policies that threaten American interests, not reward him for participating in 
peace talks that serve his own interests." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official denied that Christopher has tried to 
"appease" Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 The official added that Christopher, who will attend the Geneva summit, has 
established a rapport with Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a 
step vital to American efforts to broker a Mideast agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior State Department official suggested that Clinton may break with 
his predecessors' practices and meet for a second or third time with the Syrian 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "To deal with Assad effectively over time, you have to create a relationship," 
the official said. "Clinton has at least three and maybe seven more years in 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 In Damascus, where Assad is expected to keep his office longer, similar 
optimism prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't expect any major breakthrough, in the sense that there will be a 
great document or agreement," Azm said. "But sometimes in these situations, 
people in power understand each other in ways that escape us." 
</P>
<P>
 Fineman reported from Damascus and Kempster from Washington. The Syria Summit

compelling reasons to do so:

HARDING'S SPOT ON OLYMPIC TEAM IS UNDER REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although she has not been charged in the attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan, 
figure skater Tonya Harding's hold on a berth in next month's Winter Olympics 
appeared less secure Saturday as U.S. Olympic Committee officials contemplated 
whether it would be in the best interests of other athletes to remove her from 
the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussion of the Harding issue -- a late addition to this weekend's regularly 
scheduled USOC executive committee meeting in Durham, N.C. -- focused on 
whether her presence would result in a media circus that would create security 
problems and distractions for other athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, USOC President LeRoy Walker strongly hinted that those 
concerns could cause the executive committee to dismiss Harding from the team 
for the Feb. 12-27 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, even if she is not 
implicated in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "While awaiting additional information from various (law enforcement) 
agencies, the USOC cannot prejudge any of the issues relating to any 
individual," he said. "But we are concerned about . . . the potential of 
disruptive elements within the U.S. delegation at the Games, and we have an 
obligation to protect the competitive environment . . . so that the 154 
athletes representing the United States can compete at the highest level." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview later, Walker added: "Timing doesn't permit us to say we can't 
take any position because she (Harding) has not had her day in court. We have 
to make a decision without the consideration of whether or not her rights have 
been abridged." 
</P>
<P>
 Although such action would be unprecedented, he called the situation 
"extraordinary" and said it calls for "unusual deliberation and action on our 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Ferguson, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., told the 
Associated Press that the chances of Harding competing in Norway are "looking 
pretty grim." 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be a rolling stone that rolls right over her," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said later that she does not believe the USOC should rush to 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible thing to say she should be removed without us knowing what 
happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Walker said the USOC is the final authority on members of the Olympic 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, 23, of Portland, earned one of two Olympic berths for U.S. women by 
winning the national championship on Jan. 8 in Detroit. The other berth was 
awarded by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. to Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., 
who withdrew from the competition after she sustained knee injuries in a Jan. 7 
attack by a man wielding a club. 
</P>
<P>
 One USOC official, who did not want to be identified, told The Times that the 
executive committee is aware that it would be "exploring uncharted waters" by 
removing Harding from the team if she is not implicated in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, that's being discussed," he said. "We're trying to juggle her 
right to compete against the welfare of the entire team." 
</P>
<P>
 If she is not allowed to compete in Norway, Harding's berth would go to 
Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, Calif., who finished second to Harding in the 
national championships and was named by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. as the 
first alternate to the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her coach, Frank Carroll, said Kwan has continued to train in case 
she is called upon, he said she has not been paying much attention to news 
reports about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has nothing to do with her," he said. "She doesn't understand it. Her job 
is to skate." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there were intensifying but unconfirmed reports implicating Harding 
in the attack -- allegations that were said to come from two of the three men 
arrested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 News accounts from Phoenix said accused "hit man" Shane Minoaka Stant, 22, 
told authorities that Harding was involved "way back" in the plot. Quoting an 
unnamed source, the Boston Globe reported that Stant also told authorities that 
he first stalked Kerrigan in Massachusetts prior to the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was sent to Boston to do the job and flew there but never could 
get a good shot at Kerrigan alone," the law enforcement source told the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Stant reportedly said that Harding faked a death threat against 
herself in November as part of the plan, presumably to make it appear someone 
was stalking top female ice skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant, of Chandler, Ariz., surrendered Friday in Phoenix. There were reports 
that he turned himself in because reporters were pestering his family in 
Portland. Sheriff's deputies late Friday cited a woman identified as Stant's 
74-year-old grandmother for firing two shots in the air to scare off a Portland 
TV crew that was filming her house. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant's allegations against Harding followed a confession to the "elements of 
the crime" by the skater's bodyguard, according to the bodyguard's attorney. 
The bodyguard, Shawn Eric Eckardt, 26, further told investigators that Harding 
was involved in the "planning and cover-up" of the assault, according to 
broadcast and published reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt was arraigned and released on $20,000 bail Friday in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt's attorney, W. Mark McKnight, said his client may have been a victim 
caught up in the plot. The lawyer told reporters that Eckardt was not "smart 
enough to be anything else. He's not a mastermind kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a deep and profound sense of remorse, and he still carries that sense 
of remorse," McKnight said. "I believe that sense of remorse began when he 
watched on national television a beautiful and promising Miss Kerrigan cringing 
and crying on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The third man arrested was Derrick Brian Smith, 29, the uncle of Stant and a 
friend of Eckardt's. He recently moved from Portland to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding and her former husband, Jeff Gillooly, have denied responsibility and 
said they would cooperate with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, who live together in suburban Portland, emerged from the seclusion of 
their home Saturday and drove off in a rental car. Harding told reporters that 
she was tired but "fine" and was looking forward "hopefully to getting some 
rest, maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving, Harding met with attorneys. One of them, the husband of her 
coach, reportedly referred her to criminal defense counsel Robert C. Weaver Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, authorities have been closed-mouthed in public as they apparently sift 
statements and evidence. At least twice, officials have denied that arrest 
warrants had been issued for Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say she's involved," said Michael Schrunk, Multnomah County district 
attorney. "I can't say she's not involved." 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, police completed their investigation into the incident on Saturday 
and submitted a report to prosecutors. The Detroit News reported in today's 
editions that an arrest warrant was requested on Gillooly, in addition to the 
three people who have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portland Oregonian newspaper reported that authorities believe Eckardt 
went through Smith to hire his nephew, Stant, for $100,000, but the bill went 
unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said also Smith had shared a rural house with Stant until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's wife told reporters that he had worked with disabled people but also 
had a dream of starting a training camp for bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 In a profile, the Oregonian reported that Eckardt took a correspondence course 
and attended a two-week training program from Executive Security International 
in Aspen., Colo., but washed out. The president of the company said Eckardt 
"thinks he is James Bond." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sarah Bergman, 20, who described herself as a longtime friend of 
Eckardt's, said he confided the outline of the plot to her and that she 
remained convinced that it was masterminded by Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff was doing this for Tonya, so he could look better in her eyes," she said 
in a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Balzar reported from Portland and Harvey from Los Angeles.

PRICING OPPORTUNITY OUT OF THE MARKET?; EDUCATION: SOME FEAR THAT RAISING 
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FEES WILL PUT THE SCHOOLS BEYOND THE REACH OF THOSE WHO NEED 
THEM MOST. BUT A CLOSER STUDY SUGGESTS A MORE COMPLEX PICTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the cornerstone of California's grand scheme for higher education -- a 
network of free community colleges where rich and poor were treated alike, 
where even the most impoverished student could flex his intellect and bootstrap 
his way to gainful employment or a spot at a four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really were aiming toward a classless society," said Clark Kerr, former 
University of California president and architect of the 1960 Master Plan for 
Higher Education, which set up the community college system as the port of 
entry for disadvantaged or lower-achieving students. 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade, however, community college proponents have been warning that the 
Legislature's decision to charge ever-increasing enrollment fees has harmed the 
egalitarian dream. And they predict that thousands of poor students will be 
turned away next fall if lawmakers adopt Gov. Pete Wilson's proposal to raise 
the basic charge once again -- from $13 to $20 a unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we see the community colleges as the first and last opportunity for people 
to get educated . . . and make a contribution as a taxpayer citizen? Or do we 
think it's a dung heap we don't have to pay much attention to?" Assemblywoman 
Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles) said after Wilson called for the fee 
increase two weeks ago as part of his proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the governor sees them as a dung heap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But such dire rhetoric does not always square with reality, statistics and 
interviews show. And although heated passions are sure to be part of the coming 
political debate over what to charge at community colleges, there is plenty of 
room for spin and doubt over what fee increases mean for the state's most 
plebeian -- and flexible -- of higher education institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging in the balance are people such as Michael Bowen, a 22-year-old 
unemployed warehouse clerk who seemed worried last week about the governor's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen came to Los Angeles Southwest College to register for classes he hopes 
will lead to a computer science degree -- and a better life than the $25-a-week 
room he is renting on a $91-a-week unemployment check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirteen dollars (per credit) is pushing it. I'll be eating one meal a day," 
he said. "But if he raises it to $20, I can just forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 To Archie-Hudson, who chairs the Assembly's Higher Education Committee and 
served on the Los Angeles Community College Board for eight years, Bowen's 
story reflects a larger truth. She maintains that Wilson's 54% fee increase 
would be especially onerous to poor minorities, particularly black men. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, community college officials have predicted that nearly 98,000 -- 
many African Americans or first-generation Asian Americans -- would disappear 
from their statewide rolls of 1.4 million students. Panicked Los Angeles 
district administrators predicted that their enrollment would plunge 20% to its 
lowest point in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Those predictions, however, are based on surveys that asked students last year 
how they would respond to a fee increase -- but did not mention anything about 
additional financial aid for the poorer students, something the governor has 
proposed in his budget. 
</P>
<P>
 And state college officials based their prediction, in part, on their December 
report examining a 7% enrollment drop after the state increased fees last year. 
Although the report shows that 14% of the undergraduates who left blamed the 
increase in their per-unit charge as the major problem, 66% cited other 
problems -- chiefly the lack of campus parking. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Archie-Hudson wrote her doctoral thesis at UCLA about what fee 
increases during the early 1980s did to disadvantaged minority groups. Her 
conclusion: That "contrary to expectations" there was no proof that higher fees 
drove blacks and Latinos away, although the charges did discourage women. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way the proposed fee increase could hurt poor or minority students, 
maintains Maureen DiMarco, Wilson's education secretary, is if community 
colleges are not able to deliver financial aid in time -- something college 
officials admit they are ill-equipped to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the proposed increase, DiMarco emphasizes that California community 
college fees would rank 44th in the country. Yet she acknowledges that that may 
not satisfy many Californians who now pay charges that are dead last, far below 
those in New York, Illinois and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as close to free as you can get," she said. "But when you are used to 
getting something for free . . . you now think this is a great imposition." 
</P>
<P>
 A community college in every locale -- that was the linchpin of the master 
plan, which established a three-tiered system of higher education founded on 
the idea of accessibility. Although the top 12 1/2% of the state's high school 
graduates could qualify for UC and the top 33 1/3% could go to Cal State, 
community colleges were to be the unobstructed portal to academe for those not 
blessed with competitive test scores, family wealth or a career path. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered an extension of grade schools, these junior colleges, as they were 
called, were not only supposed to educate and transfer students to four-year 
universities, they were also charged with providing vocational training and 
remedial classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are 109 schools run by 71 locally elected boards, all under the 
umbrella of a 16-member appointed state board. The typical student they serve 
is 27 years old, most likely a woman with children who goes to class part time 
while working at a job that pays less than $18,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, college officials say, the percentage of whites has dropped to 53% 
while the numbers of Latinos, Asian Americans, non-citizens and those seeking 
basic skills classes have increased. In Los Angeles, the largest district with 
nine campuses and 102,000 students, there are more than two minority students 
to every white one. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the statewide 1.4 million enrollment can churn for a variety of 
reasons. People leave and enter classes because they use community colleges 
like "churches and museums," said Clifford Adelman, a U.S. Department of 
Education researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a baptism you need? You go to church. There's a special show of an 
Impressionist artist? You go to the museum. That's what you need at that time 
for that purpose. And community colleges are very accommodating to people's 
life rhythms," said Adelman, author of a 1992 federal report about two-year 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But California community college supporters have claimed that the state began 
to tamper with that educational rhythm when it decided in 1984 to impose a 
$5-per-credit fee on all students. Enrollment immediately dropped more than 5% 
but bounced back and thrived through the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the economy hit the skids. Grappling with monumental budget shortfalls, 
Wilson and lawmakers raised the fee on underclassmen to $6 in 1991. That went 
to $10 in spring, 1993, and $13 a unit last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit were the 131,000 students who had their bachelor's degrees -- 
typically economically better-off whites who took courses for occupational 
reasons or personal interests. Their fees skyrocketed from $6 to $50 a unit 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40%, or about 54,000, of these students disappeared, figures show. 
College officials said half were people who needed job retraining but Adelman 
had another interpretation for the drop, which he said was not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were there to take aerobics," he said. "At $10 a credit, it's cheaper 
than the spa. But at $50, you go to Spa Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, community college administrators say they lost another 81,000 
undergraduates who were scared away by the $4 increase in the spring and $3 
hike in the fall. In a December report, officials indicated the decline was 
"primarily attributable" to the fee increases. They have subsequently said many 
of those lost were poorer minorities, for whom the modest rise compounded other 
school-related expenses such as books, child care and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report's own tables tell a different tale. Two out of three departing 
undergraduates interviewed blamed other problems such as parking, lack of 
classes because 4,000 course sections closed, and inconvenient class times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although community college officials predict that the governor's proposed $7 
fee increase would scare more students away, they acknowledge that his plan 
includes a "substantial amount" of financial aid to bail out poor students. 
Wilson wants to give students an additional $90 million in aid, plus another 
$4.8 million to help community colleges distribute it. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, Wilson's education secretary, said the governor's plan would force 
community colleges to take bolder steps to ease "sticker shock" for poorer 
students by explaining and delivering more financial aid -- something 
administrators do not do well even now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have financial aid offices that are really quite understaffed for the 
chore," said Charles McIntyre, state director of research for community 
colleges. "They simply can't process the applications in a way that is 
sufficiently timely for people to get fee waivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year 24% of students statewide received some aid, although 66% were 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 At Southwest College, built in the wake of the Watts riots as the educational 
gateway for some of Los Angeles' poorest students, there is a two-month backlog 
for financial aid requests, even without Wilson's fee hike. 
</P>
<P>
 If the governor gets his way, said dean of student services Brenda A. 
Scranton, the school will have to begin marketing itself and telling 
prospective students they must plan ahead, making it less possible for students 
to simply walk on campus and take a course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because community colleges have responded to everyone, the thought was you 
could come whenever you wanted to come and you will be taken care of," Scranton 
said. "But that's no longer true." Upward Spiral 
</P>
<P>
 California's community college students paid no unit fees until 1984. Since 
then, charges have nearly tripled. They would rise 54%, to $20 a unit, for most 
students under Gov. Pete Wilson's 1994-95 budget proposal. About a third of 
Wilson's proposed 3.4% increase in the system's budget would come from higher 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1984-85: $5 a unit, $50 maximum for all students 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991-92: $6 a unit, $60 maximum for all students 
</P>
<P>
 * Spring, 1993: $10 a unit for undergraduates, $50 a unit for students with 
bachelor's degrees or higher. No maximum on total fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fall, 1993: $13 a unit for undergraduates. No increase for those with 
bachelor's degrees or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994-95: $20 a unit for undergraduates. No increase for those with 
bachelor's degrees.

ON CALIFORNIA: OLDEST STORY IN TOWN

<P>
 For all the talk about the decline of the city, Los Angeles remains, after 
all, Los Angeles, and across the basin today countless young and maybe 
not-so-young people once more will torment themselves with the same, 
relentless, timeless question: When? When will their break come? When will they 
make it? 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is," said Glen Turner, a friend who with increasing urgency has 
been asking himself this very question, "until you make it they consider you a 
nothing. You might be a good father, a good neighbor, but to them you are 
nothing. You don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 It hardly seems necessary to explain what he meant by "making it." Glen's a 
screenwriter. Unfortunately, none of the several scripts he's written has 
appeared on a screen of any sort. Yes, he's made some small money writing, but 
nothing that would feed his family or excite the IRS. And so he writes by day, 
and drives airport shuttle vans by night, and sleeps when he can, but never 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to bed," he said, "and I hear this 'tick, tick, tick.' I am running out 
of time. The pressure is building. I am 36 years old, a guy with two kids, and 
I am becoming an old frustrated screenwriter, a cliche. I have got to make a 
decision soon. The corporate world isn't going to wait. Either I make it in the 
next few years or I go out and find a real job. I can't keep this up. The 
shuttle is making me crazy. When you drive a shuttle, everyone assumes you are 
an idiot. They assume you hang out all day with guys named Bruno. I'm starting 
to hate people. I'm convinced Hitler and Mussolini were both shuttle drivers 
when they went nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glen is a huge man, a former college football player, with a strong Boston 
accent and an even stronger sense of humor -- one of those rare people who can 
make you laugh out loud and mean it. He came west after graduating from 
Syracuse University, ostensibly to work as a cop. "I have a criminal justice 
degree," he said, "like all football players." But he quickly caught the 
entertainment bug. He acted in small theaters, performed stand-up comedy, 
joined an improv group, worked on sets and, finally, about six years ago, 
formed a screenwriting team with an actor named Kim Robillard. Which is about 
the time we met, playing YMCA basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 In between games, Glen would try out script ideas and talk about his 
prospects. Sometimes the conversations were fired with anticipation. He knew 
someone who knew someone else at some studio who had promised to push his 
comedy about the supermarket security team. Or his cousin the successful writer 
was going to talk up his Western pilot to some producer or another, soon, maybe 
even this week. The next time I'd see him, he'd be back to telling funny 
shuttle stories, the deals-in-waiting an abandoned topic. 
</P>
<P>
 When we met Thursday at a Pasadena coffee shop, the first thing he did was 
plop a pile of his scripts on the table. "Will you read these later," he asked. 
I said I would. "No," he said, "really read them. People always tell you they 
are going to read your stuff and then they never do." So I read them. They 
seemed terrific to me. Which means nothing. Opinions of outsiders, as Glen 
knows better than anybody, don't count much in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year," he said, "you feel like you are getting closer and closer. 
People keep telling you how good you are, how you are going to make it and all 
that. But it doesn't get you anywhere. The problem is that your success depends 
on people who have no minds, no sense of humor. They got their jobs by 
birthright or something and they don't want to let you in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what it's like? It's like screenwriters are little sperm, swimming 
like crazy, trying to be the one that gets to the egg. Only one makes it. And 
the rest just die off or something. Aaaahhhhhh!!!!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I asked, shifting metaphors, how many people Glen figured were in the same 
boat as him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands," he said. "Tens of thousands. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough," he said finally with a thin smile, "to sink the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 And they are out there today, all over town, tapping out screenplays, 
rehearsing for the next audition, dreaming of big breaks and big houses on the 
beach. Yearning. No one in Hollywood seems to talk much about these people. 
They aren't written up in the trades or interviewed on "Entertainment Tonight." 
They leave few traces when they give up and move on, and they are always 
replaced. Maybe somebody like Glen should try writing a movie about them. 
Probably somebody already is.

2 DIE, DOZENS INJURED IN PILEUPS IN FOG; CRASHES: MORE THAN 70 VEHICLES WERE 
INVOLVED IN COLLISIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. VISIBILITY ALONG SOME STRETCHES 
OF CALIFORNIA 99 WAS LESS THAN 50 FEET.

 Motorists speeding through the San Joaquin Valley's dense winter fog triggered 
a series of chain-reaction crashes Saturday that left two dead, at least 60 
injured and more than 70 vehicles piled up in Livingston and Selma, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the collisions occurred on California 99, where eight accidents were 
reported within an hour after sunrise. Along some shrouded stretches of 
freeway, visibility was less than 50 feet, and California Highway Patrol 
officers blamed drivers for traveling too fast and following too close. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's foggy, you have to slow down," said CHP Officer Ron Minor of the 
Fresno division. "I drive in this stuff every day. I do it for a living. But 
some mornings, people pass me like I'm standing still." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst crash was near Selma, a small farming community about 12 miles south 
of Fresno. Heavy fog brought traffic to a screeching halt on the southbound 
lanes of California 99, where 15 vehicles quickly piled up, including a small 
passenger car sandwiched between a 45-foot lumber truck and a 45-foot truck 
carrying spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 By afternoon, emergency crews were still working to unload the trucks and tow 
them away in an effort to get to the smashed car, which contained the two 
victims who died, police said. The bodies were not immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Also caught in the wreckage was a tour bus filled with more than 50 Korean 
students headed to Disneyland, according to authorities. Six youths were taken 
to hospitals, but officers did not believe that any were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were about 12 cars piled up and I would have run into them if I hadn't 
been flagged down," Perry Rath, a 35-year-old motorist from Fresno, told 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 About half a mile south of there, officers were trying to separate 32 vehicles 
that had piled up along the highway. Together, the two crashes injured 49 
people, including one victim who remained in critical condition Saturday at 
Valley Medical Center in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, near the Merced County town of Livingston, authorities were 
investigating six collisions involving 29 vehicles that occurred in rapid 
succession along a foggy one-mile stretch of California 99. Police said 12 
people were treated for mostly minor injuries, although one man remained in 
critical condition at Memorial North Hospital in Modesto after he apparently 
climbed out of his pickup and was struck by a larger truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one wreck, then pretty soon another, then another, and so forth," 
said CHP Sgt. Jim Balestra. Pileup on California 99 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Valley's dense winter fog was blamed for a series of 
chain-reaction collisions that left more than 70 vehicles piled up on 
California 99 Saturday, killing at least two people and injuring five dozen. 
The worst crash was a 15-car tangle on the outskirts of Selma. About half a 
mile south, 32 vehicles slammed into each other. A series of six smaller 
crashes, involving 29 vehicles, occurred about 90 miles to the north, near 
Livingston.

BALLOONS THAT BOMBED; 49 YEARS AGO, JAPANESE EXPLOSIVES DRIFTED INTO THE 
FOOTNOTES OF VENTURA COUNTY HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly a day of infamy in Ventura County -- hardly anyone knew what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But 49 years ago yesterday -- Jan. 15, 1945, toward the end of World War II -- 
the winds of war brought the first of three spectacularly unsuccessful and 
almost unnoticed Japanese assaults on the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks were not carried out by enemy submarines, or even by long-distance 
bombers. These bombs came by balloon -- paper balloons -- sent all the way from 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Fugo balloon bomb created a crater in the dry bed of the Santa Clara 
River near Saticoy. Two days later, on Jan. 17, an entire balloon was found in 
Moorpark, containing unexploded incendiary bombs but missing the 33-pound 
anti-personnel bomb carried by the balloons. Remnants of a third balloon bomb 
were found Feb. 21 in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the only time anyone could actually say that the war came to 
Ventura County," said Richard Senate, a Thousand Oaks-based historian. "These 
balloons were very ingeniously designed devices on the drawing board. Luckily 
for us, they didn't perform well in real life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese attack on the county was not revealed at the time, Senate and 
others said. Local news media agreed with government officials to squelch 
stories about the incidents to prevent the Japanese from knowing whether their 
unassuming weapons made it to American shores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until 1947 did we see any kind of news reports about the balloons," 
Senate said. "By then, people were getting on with their lives and didn't 
really seem to care too much about the incident." 
</P>
<P>
 No other landings in Southern California were recorded, although remnants of a 
balloon were found floating about 60 miles west of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloons, about 70 feet high and 30 feet in diameter, were launched from 
Japan in November, 1944. The idea, according to Tom Crouch, chairman of the 
Smithsonian Institution's Department of Aeronautics in Washington, was to start 
hundreds of forest fires in California and throughout the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to ride the swift west-to-east high-altitude jet stream, an estimated 
10,000 balloons launched by the Japanese army malfunctioned by the hundreds. 
Crouch said it is possible that only 10% of the devices made it across the 
Pacific to places as far-flung as Alaska and Mexico. An estimated 355 of the 
airborne bombs were credited with reaching U.S. territory, some getting as far 
as Michigan and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to set the Northwest on fire," Crouch said. "It was a desperation 
move. They wanted to strike back at us for our aerial bombing raids." 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Webber, an Oregon-based historian, said the bombs are known to have 
caused six fatalities among U.S. civilians. On May 5, 1945, an Oregon woman and 
five children on a church picnic became the only known victims when they 
approached a downed balloon and its 33-pound bomb exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloons were made of paper and glued with potato paste. The air envelope 
was filled with hydrogen and an elaborate system of ballast weights linked to a 
barometer managed the device in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 When the balloon would lose altitude, Webber said, a small explosive device -- 
about the size of a shotgun shell -- would fire and a ballast weight would be 
released, allowing the balloon to resume its normal operating altitude -- about 
38,000 feet. A typical crossing took two to three days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber said the balloon bomb attacks would have been stepped up by the 
Japanese if the U.S. forces had not started even more intensive aerial bombing 
over Japan with B-29 Superfortress bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's evidence indicating that they were ready to launch even larger 
balloons with larger bomb loads," Webber said. "What stopped them was our B-29 
raids over Japan. It literally crushed their ability to make the things." 
</P>
<P>
 For Senate, the balloon bombs showed the resourcefulness of the Japanese 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used Japanese schoolgirls to construct these things using non-strategic 
materials such as paper and potato paste," Senate said. "For very little money 
they were essentially making unguided missiles."

LEAKING OIL BARGE IS SUNK IN DEEP WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard towed a still-leaking oil barge from the Puerto Rican 
coast and sunk it Saturday night in a deep canyon under the high seas of the 
Atlantic Ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The damaged Morris J. Berman barge went down in 6,000 feet of water in the 
Puerto Rican Trench, one of the deepest spots in the Atlantic, a Coast Guard 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup specialists said the cooler waters of the trench will help congeal any 
remaining oil and minimize pollution from the barge, which has spilled hundreds 
of thousands of gallons of thick, black oil since it crashed into a reef off 
San Juan on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 A cleanup vessel was skimming oil from the scene of the sinking, 16 miles 
northeast of San Juan. The vessel was scheduled to remain overnight and keep 
cleaning those waters today, officials said.

CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS URGE PUBLIC TO LAY DOWN ARMS; VIOLENCE: GUN BUYBACKS, 
KLU KLUX KLAN DEMONSTRATIONS MARK THE BIRTHDAY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to counter the violence that one governor said would make Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. weep, civil rights activists called on members of their 
communities to lay down their arms Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would weep if he saw the grandsons and granddaughters of those who marched 
with him using violence to solve their problems," North Carolina Gov. James B. 
Hunt Jr. said of the slain civil rights leader, born 65 years ago Saturday. The 
national holiday is Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In memory of King's nonviolent teachings, gun buybacks were scheduled in five 
Florida cities. A feature of Jacksonville's buyback: the chance to win Super 
Bowl tickets, plus air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Georgia continued its gun 
buyback program through the weekend. Weapons were exchanged for $35, a $50 
grocery certificate or two tickets to an Atlanta Hawks basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, D.C., gun owners from as far away as Pennsylvania and West 
Virginia lined up outside the Union Temple Baptist Church for $100 in cash from 
money supplied by former heavyweight boxing champion Riddick Bowe and his 
manager, Rock Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 In Atlanta, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley warned that a crisis of 
violence and despair among young people could drown the contributions made by 
King and his followers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be giving up on America, turning away from the sure grounding of 
Dr. King's philosophy of nonviolence," Riley told educators at the Martin 
Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change. 
</P>
<P>
 King's widow, Coretta Scott King, awarded the 1994 Martin Luther King Jr. 
Distinguished Service Award to Johnnetta B. Cole, president of Spelman College 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Cole is a champion of human rights, very much in the spirit of Dr. King," 
Mrs. King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in today's editions of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Mrs. King 
said the nation must confront businesses that promote violence in order to 
reduce violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must recognize that while violence is ultimately committed by individuals, 
it is promoted and encouraged by a massive violence industry," she said, 
singling out film and television companies, video arcade operators, gun 
manufacturers and sellers, and toy makers for advertising and promoting 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Saturday, Ku Klux Klansmen rallying against the King holiday were 
mostly outnumbered by counterdemonstrators in protests in several state 
capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests or injuries were reported as the klan demonstrated in Columbus, 
Ohio; Little Rock, Ark.; Topeka, Kan.; Montgomery, Ala.; Tallahassee, Fla.; and 
Austin, Tex. Rallies were planned today in Denver and Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities estimated the anti-klan crowd in Austin at 2,000. Their placards 
read: "One Planet, One People" and "Klearly Kowardly Kriminals." 
</P>
<P>
 One counterdemonstrator burned a small Confederate flag. Others kept up a 
constant drumming on pots and pans, blew whistles and shook tambourines to try 
to drown out 33 klan supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 protesters in Columbus beat drums, blew whistles and hurled 
snowballs at 30 klansmen who spoke in sub-zero temperatures outside the 
Statehouse.

GIRL WHO APPARENTLY CUT SWASTIKA IN OWN CHEEK SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A wheelchair-bound schoolgirl who disappeared after apparently making up a 
story about skinheads carving a swastika on her cheek has surrendered to 
authorities, German police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman in Halle said the 17-year-old vanished Thursday after police 
launched a nationwide search for three skinheads she claimed had attacked her 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have told investigators they believe the Nazi-emblem cut on her face 
was self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now know where the girl is," the spokesman said. "She is with her parents 
at a relative's house at a location far away from Halle. The relatives phoned 
us this morning. The girl is expected to be back in Halle tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Saxony-Anhalt state prosecutor Juergen Hossfeld said investigators had 
concluded the girl made up the story about the attack that had shocked a nation 
struggling to come to terms with a rise in right-wing violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hossfeld said the girl may have fled because she feared the legal consequences 
of lying to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials in Halle on Saturday declined to say what, if any, charges 
may be filed against the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Hossfeld said investigators had searched intensively for the alleged culprits 
but there had been no leads. 
</P>
<P>
 He said doubts arose early in the search because no suspects and no witnesses 
turned up despite a hunt by more than 100 police. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's cuts were judged to be too uniformly deep to have been the work of 
an assailant and indicated the wound was self-inflicted, according to doctors 
working with the investigation.

ARISTIDE REASSERTS CLAIM AS HAITI'S LEADER; CARIBBEAN: UNLIKE U.S. CONGRESS 
MEMBERS, THE OUSTED PRESIDENT STOPS SHORT OF CALLING FOR MILITARY INTERVENTION 
TO RESTORE HIM TO POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide reaffirmed his determination 
Saturday to resume his place as Haiti's first democratically elected leader, 
while supporters, including U.S. politicians, called for military intervention 
to return him to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for deliverance," Aristide said at a conference called to find 
solutions to the political impasse in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the military leaders who overthrew him in a September, 1991, 
coup, Aristide said: "Professional criminals are knocking down the democratic 
government of the people. We are asking for what is ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aristide said several days ago that he no longer opposes a "surgical 
strike" against coup leaders, he has stopped short of calling for a full-scale 
invasion by U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But several members of the congressional Black Caucus, an organization of 
black members of Congress, urged the Clinton Administration to send in U.S. 
soldiers, and one of Aristide's closest aides appeared to support the notion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Haiti are not opposed to any means, including armed 
intervention," said Herve Denis, Haiti's minister for information and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day conference on Haiti was called by Aristide in hopes of rallying 
world support for tightening a U.N.-ordered oil and arms embargo designed to 
punish the Haitian military, and to discuss strategy for breaking the stalemate 
over his return. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aristide and Haitian military ruler Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras signed an 
accord last July that outlined a transfer of power, Cedras reneged on his 
promise to resign and turn over the government to Aristide, who was elected to 
office in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras and other Haitian military leaders declined an invitation to attend the 
weekend conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide showed impatience with any more negotiations with the military and 
set Feb. 7 as the date by which he hopes to resume his presidency in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who attended the conference were officials of the United Nations 
and the Organization of American States and representatives of the "Four 
Friends of Haiti" -- Canada, Venezuela, France and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration sent Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the President's special 
envoy to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Pezzullo described the situation in Haiti as a "cruel impasse" but expressed 
hope that economic sanctions eventually will lead to the military's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 But several members of the Black Caucus, including U.S. Reps. Charles B. 
Rangel (D-N.Y.), Major R. Owens (D-N.Y.) and Carrie Meek (D-Fla.), seemed to 
suggest that military force is the only option left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surely, with all the power of the U.S., if we really wanted to return 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, we would do it," Owens said. "Something is wrong 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Meek: "Diplomacy is not working. . . . We need military intervention in 
Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Caucus has been increasingly critical of the Clinton 
Administration's failure to find a solution in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presidential campaign, Bill Clinton indicated that finding a 
solution to Haiti would be a priority for his Administration.

NEWS ANALYSIS; POLITICAL PROFITS OF GLOBE-TROTTING; EUROPE: CLINTON LEARNS THAT 
A FOREIGN JAUNT CAN BE MORE FUN THAN STAYING HOME, AS WELL AS OFFERING A BOOST 
TO HIS IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of his first year as President, Bill Clinton put off the day when he 
would have to extend his laser-like focus beyond domestic policy to take in 
foreign affairs. Last week, the day came. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a series of summit meetings that took him across Europe to Russia and 
back again, he learned what many of his predecessors had found before him: 
Globe-trotting can be more fun and more politically profitable than staying 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 As Washington bubbled over Clinton's involvement in a murky Arkansas land 
deal, half a world away the President scored a foreign policy coup by winning a 
new agreement on removing nuclear missiles from Ukraine. He won the Western 
Alliance an endorsement of a new, more inclusive blueprint for European 
security in post-Cold War Europe. He steadied Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin on the course of economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he did it all without any of the meddling by Congress and others 
that continuously frustrates his designs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 With his walks and talks amid the spires and domes of Eastern Europe 
dominating the news images, he could say to a television interviewer that "this 
has been a very, very successful trip" without fear that faraway political 
rivals would invade his sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's shift in attention has come for several reasons. He needed to take 
on European policy questions that had been crying for his attention for a year. 
Even some aides acknowledge that these questions, which included the future of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and fraying relations with America's 
historic partners in Western Europe, were neglected in Clinton's first year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton has recognized a political fact of life that his predecessors knew 
well: At home, the President must share power, but in foreign affairs, the 
authority to act -- and the credit -- is largely his alone. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returns to Washington tonight, Clinton will bring home at least one 
genuine accomplishment: an agreement from Ukraine to remove the nuclear weapons 
left on its territory when the Soviet Union disintegrated, beginning with the 
modern SS-24 missiles that U.S. military strategists feared most. If the accord 
is carried out, it will be a significant success in the Administration's effort 
to stop the spread of nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics to other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk faces internal opposition to 
carrying out the agreement, so in the end the deal may not fully live up to its 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, in terms of U.S. public opinion, the week made America's "domestic 
President" four for four on international trips. On earlier journeys -- to meet 
Yeltsin in Vancouver, Canada, Pacific Rim leaders in Seattle and the chiefs of 
other big industrial nations in Tokyo -- he showed that he could handle 
economic summitry without a slip. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the week started on a wobbly note but seemed to gain momentum as 
the U.S. contingent moved toward Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brussels, Clinton wanted to focus on the new security alliance with the 
East European nations but was forced to take up the disagreeable task of 
issuing new military threats to the Bosnian Serbs. In Prague in the Czech 
Republic, he won an endorsement of the "Partnership for Peace" plan for the 
nations of Eastern Europe, but in the process he was forced again to face their 
criticism that the plan left them vulnerable to an unstable Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, signs were strewn along the way that Clinton is becoming more 
comfortable with the foreign affairs side of his job. Although the chemistry is 
not good with French President Francois Mitterrand and almost nonexistent with 
British Prime Minister John Major, he got along with Yeltsin, German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and Czech President Vaclav Havel, and he accumulated generally good 
reviews from much of Europe along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 A compulsive rewriter of his domestic speeches, Clinton usually sticks close 
to the text of his foreign policy speeches. But in his remarks at the Ostankino 
television complex in Moscow, where only three months ago troops loyal to 
Yeltsin battled his enemies and more than a dozen people died, he picked up the 
editing pencil to rewrite a good chunk of his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech was the kind of personal appeal he makes to Americans, and his 
engagement in them suggests he is most energized when he is translating his 
foreign policy into domestic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 On this trip, as at home, Clinton spoke of his sympathy for his audience's 
suffering, their need to embrace constant change and to gird themselves for the 
hard work of competing in the world economy. All this sounded eerily familiar 
to those who know Clinton's domestic speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was understandable, aides said, because Clinton's domestic policy is 
precisely the same as his foreign policy. "He's got only one stump speech," an 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip presented a feast of opportunities for political showmanship aimed as 
much at American as at foreign audiences. And it gave Clinton an opportunity to 
see if the image-making techniques -- and messages -- he has used in the United 
States could be applied to build support abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The big score, in the White House's view, came from Clinton's televised town 
hall meeting at Ostankino in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hoped it would show average Russians a politician who could meet 
them at eye level. They got an unexpected payoff with a domestic audience from 
a widely rebroadcast scene in which a 13-year-old Russian boy who had seen a 
photo of Clinton as a teen-ager shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy 
asked when his presidential ambitions had begun to take root, and Clinton 
invited him to shake his hand. "Come shake hands with me, and maybe you'll be 
president of Russia some day," Clinton told him. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Clinton avoided major blunders during the first European trip, he had 
some near-misses, including Ostankino. The affair may not have been such a 
success with Clinton's Russian audience, some of whom said he seemed 
condescending when he lectured them on free-market capitalism and too glib when 
he said he understood their pain but urged them to buck up. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, such reactions were a reminder that a politician 
inexperienced in foreign affairs -- as Clinton is -- can have perfect pitch 
with U.S. audiences but get off a clanger with groups whose special 
sensitivities he does not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians, for instance, feel deeply humiliated by their country's slide 
from superpower status into chaos; lectures from Americans are salt in the 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, addressing college students in Brussels' historic town hall, 
Clinton was apparently disappointed in his listeners' failure to respond more 
enthusiastically. But the progeny of Belgium's stolid burghers are not brought 
up to cheer the likes of a President as though he were a rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also avoided a pratfall in a joke comparing Kohl to a sumo wrestler 
only by including himself in the jest at the last moment. And some Ukrainians 
took it badly when Clinton quipped that Kravchuk's firm handling of reporters 
during an appearance at Kiev's airport might qualify him for work as a White 
House press aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, even many of those scenes made strong images back home. 
</P>
<P>
 There were pictures too of Clinton consorting with Havel, hero of democracy 
and culture, in the cabarets of Prague, and of Yeltsin in the Kremlin and 
babushkas on the slushy streets of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides were open about their hopes for the trip. "Your domestic stock goes up 
if you show yourself to be a good world leader," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials acknowledged the difficulty Clinton faced in 
properly expressing his advice to East Europeans. He needed, one said, "to 
express sympathy for what people were going through, without sounding 
patronizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps for this Administration, the tasks of foreign policy are made easier 
by a conviction that concerns of the world abroad are still not quite as 
crucial for the President as those he faces at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people don't want a President who spends all his time on foreign 
policy the way George Bush did," one official said. "They want a President who 
they can feel assured will perform well in a crisis, and not much more than 
that."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON TRIP HELPS YELTSIN'S IMAGE, HURTS ZHIRINOVSKY; RUSSIA: 
BUT UNLESS THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT ACTS OUT HIS ROLE MORE CONVINCINGLY, THE 
IMPACT OF THE SUMMIT COULD BE SHORT-LIVED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A month ago, Russia's image as a fledgling democracy and partner with the West 
was shattered. Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, having stunned the world with a strong 
finish in parliamentary elections, was venting militarist dreams of a restored 
Russian empire. President Boris N. Yeltsin was in seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Yeltsin was back in the spotlight, appearing with President Clinton 
at the Kremlin. Clinton was on Russian television, praising his summit host as 
a leader "willing to wade into the tides of history and make decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky was off camera, his face bloodied from a fistfight over a place in 
line at the Parliament cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's three-day visit, which ended Saturday, gave the Russian president 
what he needed badly: a restored picture, at home and abroad, that Yeltsin is 
the one in charge here, a reformist ally valued by the world's remaining 
superpower, and that Zhirinovsky is little more than a neo-fascist pest. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet unless Yeltsin manages to act out that role more convincingly, the impact 
of the summit could be short-lived. The help Clinton offered -- U.S. markets 
opening up to Russian uranium, a faster flow of Western credits already 
promised -- is modest. Neither side expects fast relief from the economic pain 
that helped Zhirinovsky's party sway 23% of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton's visit diminished the role of Zhirinovsky," said Irina G. Popova, a 
social anthropologist and historian at the Russian Academy of Sciences. "The 
summit was arranged to look very businesslike, so that Boris would be viewed 
differently, not as a weak man but as one respected by world leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 If presidential elections were held now instead of 1996, when they are 
scheduled, "Yeltsin would certainly get more votes than Zhirinovsky," she said. 
"But two years is an eternity here." 
</P>
<P>
 The suddenly imaginable scenario of an aggressive nationalist in control of 
Russia's nuclear codes has intensified debate over what, if anything, the West 
can do to diminish his appeal. After two years of tumultuous unraveling of 
Russia's militarized command economy, the politically correct answer here is 
that only Russians can decide what kind of country they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zhirinovsky is a typically Russian phenomenon," Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav 
V. Kostikov said in an interview. "Foreign political remedies to inoculate 
Russia from this disease will not help. Russia will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
 But without once mentioning the "Z-word" in public, Clinton moved on several 
fronts during the summit to help Yeltsin isolate his rival. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit featured an agreement among Russia, Ukraine and the United States 
to transfer all former Soviet nuclear warheads on Ukraine's territory to Russia 
within seven years. The deal, brokered by the Clinton Administration, would 
satisfy the Russian nationalist aim of making Russia the sole nuclear power 
among the former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and the United States also agreed, along with Ukraine, to redirect 
their nuclear missiles away from any country by May 30. Together the two 
accords conjured up an image -- nostalgic for Russian nationalists, healthy for 
Yeltsin -- of two great military powers meeting to decide the fate of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 To answer Zhirinovsky's complaint that Moscow is being bled by economic 
subsidies to Ukraine and other new states of its former empire, Yeltsin won 
Clinton's pledge to direct part of a Western aid package to help those "near 
abroad" countries buy Russian oil and gas at world prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton carefully indulged Yeltsin's effort to portray Russia as an equal. He 
nodded while the Russian leader used the words partnership and partner six 
times in a five-minute statement at the start of Friday's joint news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 And he listened passively while Yeltsin stressed Russia's independent foreign 
policy -- notably its sharp disagreement with Clinton's goal to admit East 
European nations into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's most dramatic and apparently effective weapon was a campaign-style 
"town hall" meeting in which he defended Yeltsin's reforms and answered 
audience questions on live Russian television. Expressing empathy for the many 
Russians hurt by inflation, crime and joblessness on the uncharted course to a 
free market, he promised "light at the end of this long tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton came with no new money to finance the "social safety net" of 
unemployment insurance, subsidized health care and job retraining programs that 
Russian reformers now say is crucial. Without such efforts, they cannot 
overcome resistance from Zhirinovsky, Communists and centrist political forces 
to the idea of shutting down big money-losing factories as a way to combat 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's refurbished post-summit image could help, however, by coaxing some 
funds from international lending agencies and Western nations. Yeltsin's 
government is divided over how hard to squeeze the ruble supply in order to 
qualify for their aid. But Yeltsin's rhetorical commitment to Clinton last week 
to maintain the pace of reform could free up a long-delayed $1.5-billion credit 
from the International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Confident of more hard times, Zhirinovsky predicted last week that Clinton's 
diplomacy was doomed. He said the American President had done him a favor by 
refusing to meet him in Moscow. But Zhirinovsky's influence may already be 
waning. Before his fistfight, he threw a temper tantrum in the Duma, the lower 
house of Parliament, that apparently cost him a chance to become Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Yeltsin will have a hard time with the Duma. It is split about 50-50 
between reform and anti-reform forces, but the anti-reformers have been more 
adept at alliances. As Yeltsin was assuring Clinton on Friday that economic 
reform would continue, the Duma elected a Communist as its Speaker.

YELTSIN SEEN AS INTENT ON ECONOMIC REFORMS; RUSSIA: NO SHARP TURN EXPECTED IN 
U.S. EFFORTS TO ASSIST TRANSITION TO CAPITALISM DESPITE INCIPIENT CHAOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two days of meetings with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, senior 
U.S. officials left Moscow on Saturday unshaken in their conviction that 
Yeltsin will press ahead with economic reform and said President Clinton will 
ask for nearly $1 billion in Russian aid when he unveils his 1995 budget next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials said there would be no sharp shifts in the U.S. 
effort to help Russia make the transition to capitalism, even as that nation 
seems to totter on the edge of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and other senior Treasury officials, flying 
from Moscow to Indonesia with a refueling stop here on the shores of the 
Arabian Sea, told reporters Saturday that the $900 million that Clinton will 
ask Congress to award Russia in 1995 would build on existing aid programs. The 
U.S. allocation for Russia and the former Soviet republics in 1993 and 1994 is 
$4.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 money would be directed at such programs as housing for soldiers 
redeployed from former Soviet republics and the nations of Eastern Europe that 
belonged to the Warsaw Pact; energy and environment projects, and business and 
student exchange programs, a senior Treasury official said. 
</P>
<P>
 With its extraordinary focus on economic matters, the presidential visit to 
the Kremlin was unlike any that preceded it, and it opened a new window for 
U.S. leaders on the course of political and economic reform -- and the 
resulting anxiety and tumult -- in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country has such great resources, such great people," Bentsen said. "I 
think it will respond to a market economy. But it will have a bumpy ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The summit also provided the occasion for at least three encounters between 
two key figures on opposite sides of the still-unresolved argument over how 
quickly the reform effort should proceed because of the political and social 
turmoil that it has brought. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen is on one side. Viktor V. Gerashchenko, the chairman of Russia's 
Central Bank, is on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Bentsen has encouraged Yeltsin not to stray from the 
course toward full capitalism. In Russia, Gerashchenko has built economic speed 
bumps in Yeltsin's path. 
</P>
<P>
 He has urged a slower course and, more importantly, has pumped out rubles and 
credit to unprofitable, inefficient Russian industries to keep them afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen has argued that Gerashchenko's actions have led to serious inflation 
in Russia. That inflation, although down from a monthly rate of 30% a year ago 
to 12% in December, erodes the purchasing power of people on fixed incomes and, 
in effect, simply transfers their limited wealth to the accounts of failing 
industries, Treasury officials argue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen and Gerashchenko had brief exchanges during a reception at U.S. 
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering's residence, during a visit to the first 
Citibank to open in Moscow since its predecessor was closed immediately after 
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and during a state dinner in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said Gerashchenko stressed the need for "gradualism" in redesigning 
the economy, and the Treasury secretary said he responded that "you have to 
move ahead with reform." 
</P>
<P>
 In a lighter moment, at Citibank, the Russian banker looked at a computer 
screen displaying a program known as "Micro Banker." 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the distance between a money manager brought up under the 
Communist system and his capitalist counterparts, Gerashchenko cracked, in 
English: 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the meaning of a bank. I like the words micro and macro , but 
not in economics. I don't understand all this stuff about micros and macros." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, aboard their airplane Bentsen and his aides developed their own 
wisecrack about Gerashchenko, echoing the punch line Bentsen used effectively 
against then-Vice President Dan Quayle in their 1988 campaign debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as Bentsen, then the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, compared 
Quayle unfavorably to President John F. Kennedy, they compared the Russian 
banker to Alan Greenspan, the inflation-fighting chairman of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board: "I know Alan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan is a friend of mine. And 
Viktor Gerashchenko, you're no Alan Greenspan." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerashchenko's role and the positions given to such reformers as the current 
finance minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, in the new government Yeltsin is forming 
in the wake of the Dec. 12 parliamentary elections remain uncertain. The result 
of Yeltsin's bargaining over key personnel decisions with the Parliament, whose 
makeup reflects the gains of ultranationalists and others standing in the 
president's way, will serve as a forecast of the pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a battle with Parliament," Bentsen said. "I think there's a 
sincere desire on the part of Yeltsin to follow through." 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that Yeltsin has a stronger hand than might otherwise appear to be 
the case, Bentsen reflected his 22 years in the U.S. Senate when he said: 
"These fellows want to get reelected. They'll be running again in two years. 
They'll be talking about projects in their districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the unchanged course the United States will follow in the wake of 
Clinton's talks with Yeltsin, a senior Treasury official said the plan is to 
"build better from the blueprints we have rather than creating new blueprints." 
</P>
<P>
 What it boils down to is this: an awkward quid pro quo in which international 
lenders will pace the delivery of assistance to the speed with which Yeltsin 
and his government institute the painful economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 If carried out too quickly, the reform measures further threaten Russia's 
tenuous political stability. If too slow, the lenders delay the delivery of the 
much-needed aid out of concern it would be squandered on inefficient 
operations.

GEPHARDT WARNS CHINA RIGHTS ABUSES PERIL TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt warned China on Saturday not to take 
lightly the possibility of its preferential trade status being canceled as 
punishment for human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Chinese and U.S. negotiators began an eleventh-hour round of 
talks to defuse a trade conflict over U.S. accusations of massive illicit 
Chinese textile shipments to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration announced last week that deep cuts in China's 
textile import quotas would take effect Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt headed the third U.S. congressional delegation to visit Beijing this 
month to discuss human rights and other issues with top Chinese officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The visits come just before Congress is to hold hearings on whether to extend 
most-favored-nation trading status. President Clinton has linked its renewal to 
improvement in Beijing's human rights record and must reach a decision by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Other delegation members quoted President Jiang Zemin as saying that Beijing 
"is going to make an effort" in the coming months to address Clinton's concerns 
about human rights, the New York Times reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jiang offered no details of such plans, the Times said. Gephardt made no 
reference to such an effort during his news conference.

GROUP ALLEGES RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN MEXICO

<P>
 Indian peasants were subjected to summary executions, disappearances and other 
human rights abuses by the army as it fought a New Year's rebellion in the 
Mexican state of Chiapas, Canadian investigators charged Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the town of Ocosingo, forensic experts sent by the Mexican government's 
human rights commission on Saturday exhumed six bodies from a mass grave. At 
least three more bodies, wrapped in sheets from a government hospital, could be 
seen at the bottom of the eight-foot pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocosingo residents said the corpses were those of Zapatista National 
Liberation Army rebels and civilians killed in the Jan. 2-3 clash, but there 
was no official identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, rebels in the southern Mexican state have threatened to vote on 
whether to execute a former governor seized shortly after the uprising began, 
the hostage's relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's human rights commission Saturday called for the release 
"without delay" of former Gov. Absalon Castellanos Dominguez and other hostages 
seized during the Indian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels, who number between 1,000 and 2,000, say they are fighting to 
improve living conditions for Indian peasants in Chiapas. They have yet to 
respond publicly to a government call for talks, issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, bomb threats put police on alert Saturday, and 3,000 
anti-government demonstrators in the city demanded that the army withdraw from 
Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from Canadian church and human rights groups returned Saturday 
from Chiapas, where they said troops were restricting the movements of 
villagers in what amounted to a state of siege in some parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 One Chiapas resident leaving his home to buy tortillas as troops pursued the 
rebels was shot and killed by soldiers, said Marthe Lapierre, head of a Roman 
Catholic literacy project in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soldiers took four indigenous men from one hospital and summarily executed 
four others," she told a Mexico City news conference.

 A cleanup settlement with one of the state's biggest sugar producers will help 
end a lengthy standoff between growers and environmentalists over the fragile 
condition of the Florida Everglades, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said."At 
last the gridlock is beginning to break," Babbitt told environmentalists at an 
annual conference in Miami sponsored by Friends of the Everglades. The federal 
government reached an agreement with Flo-Sun Sugar, accused of polluting 
freshwater areas of the Everglades. Flo-Sun agreed last week to pay up to $6 
million annually for the next 20 years to help clean up the Everglades and meet 
water quality standards.

VIETNAMESE HERO GETS U.S. WELCOME 25 YEARS AFTER BRAVERY

 Nearly 25 years after risking his life to save four American soldiers from a 
sniper-filled Laotian jungle, An Quy Nguyen accepted a hero's welcome Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever I did is my duty. I think everybody would do the same as I did," he 
said at this Northern California air base where he and his daughter, Ngoc Kim 
Quy Nguyen, were greeted by about 100 well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his wartime heroism, which in a separate mission cost him both arms, 
the former Vietnamese Army helicopter pilot was rebuffed by U.S. officials when 
he applied for a humanitarian refugee program. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen attempted to flee Vietnam four times, including once when he tried to 
build his own boat. He spent more than two years in jail for trying to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try so many times just because the U.S.A. land is . . . the land of 
freedom," Nguyen said. He said he plans to live in San Jose and wants to visit 
the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, 1969, U.S. forces had just dropped troops near the Ho Chi Minh 
trail and were taking off when Army Capt. John Liner's helicopter came under 
enemy gunfire. The bullets punctured gas and hydraulic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said he saw the helicopter on fire. He immediately guided the crippled 
craft away from a clearing filled with spikes to a safer patch of 15-foot high 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The American soldiers hacked their way through the grass toward Nguyen's 
chopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Liner, a Louisiana resident, also rescued were Col. Robert Stratiff, 
now a retiree who lives in Virginia, and Staff Sgt. Terry L. Whitehurst and 
Pfc. Ronald C. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's last mission was Sept. 17, 1970, when he was flying a special mission 
and was bombarded by enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack set his helicopter ablaze and in his attempt to land, Nguyen's arms 
and right leg were severely burned. Surgeons at a field hospital amputated both 
arms below the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was later captured by the Viet Cong and forced into a labor camp. He 
was thrown out after nine weeks because without use of his arms, Nguyen could 
not feed or clothe himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Air Force Col. Noboru Masuoka led the effort to bring Nguyen here with 
the help of several U.S. senators and military friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has granted Nguyen temporary admission, humanitarian 
parole, which only lasts a year. He could face deportation in January, 1995.

 Legislation to ensure that no less than 95% of all local, state and federal 
funds received by school districts reaches the classrooms has been introduced 
in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The education system in California is shameful," said Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), author of the bill (AB 2516). "We have failed to invest in our 
kids -- and it shows." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main problems, Katz said, is too much school aid goes to 
administrators and not enough to teachers and educational aids from which 
students directly benefit. GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed former Republican Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter of Palm Desert, a 
nurse, to the California Medical Assistance Commission. Commission members are 
paid $49,875 a year. The appointment does not require Senate confirmation.

DNA TEST CLEARS MAN CONVICTED OF RAPE; COURTS: A FORMER NURSE IS FREED THREE 
YEARS AFTER BEING SENT TO PRISON ON ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A MENTAL 
PATIENT. HE HAD MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE AND INSISTED THAT HE HAD AN AIRTIGHT 
ALIBI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Bravo placed the collect call to his wife from Tehachapi state prison the 
day after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been three years since he had been found guilty of raping a mental 
patient at the Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk. And five more years of 
his sentence stretched out before him. 
</P>
<P>
 He had sworn to all who would listen that he was innocent, that his alibi had 
been absolutely solid. The jury had believed otherwise at the end of the 
three-week trial and had sent him to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, on the other end of the line, came the unexpected words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got good news," said Roseanne, his wife. "You're coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo was stunned. After all the appeals had failed, all the way to the state 
Supreme Court, he had almost given up hope that something could change the 
course that his life had taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The only glimmer of a remaining possibility came from the world of science. 
Superior Court Judge James Bascue had ordered DNA testing two months earlier on 
the items that had been found at the rape scene -- a sheet, blanket and a pair 
of panties. DNA testing is used to create a molecular profile, in many cases 
allowing for the positive identification of a person from even the smallest 
bits of material. Bravo and his lawyers hoped that the tests would show 
conclusively that he could not have committed the rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The results came back the day before Christmas from a laboratory in Maryland. 
None of the stains on the items matched the DNA profile of either Bravo or the 
woman who had been raped. Bascue issued an order Jan. 6 that Bravo be released 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said Bravo did not get a fair trial, that the victim had recanted 
her accusation, that the scientific evidence presented at the trial was 
misleading and that Bravo did, indeed, have an unimpeachable alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 By the next day, Bravo was out of prison, riding in a car with Roseanne and 
their 13-year old son, Gabriel, toward their La Puente home. Bravo wore jeans, 
a black sweat shirt and tennis shoes. And he also carried a box of legal papers 
that represented what had become the focus of his life -- the fight to prove he 
was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got in the car and got the hell out of there," said Bravo, 35. "We got as 
far away as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 The strange case of Mark Diaz Bravo is one that stirs the emotions and incites 
finger-pointing from all sides. Those in his camp call his conviction a 
travesty, contending that the trial never should have happened and that the 
judicial system failed miserably. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo's appeals lawyer, Sylvia Paoli, contends that major mistakes were made 
all along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody screwed up," said Paoli, who practices in Tustin. "There was a 
continual, ongoing rash of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Chilstrom, who prosecuted the case in 
1990, said she remains unconvinced of Bravo's innocence. She suggested that the 
DNA evidence may not be as conclusive as Bravo's lawyers contend -- that the 
items tested may not have come from the rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Bravo and how he went to prison began Feb. 20, 1990, when he was 
working as a nurse at Metropolitan State Hospital. A short, heavyset woman -- a 
longtime patient at the institution -- approached a guard and said she had been 
raped sometime that afternoon. In the course of being interviewed by hospital 
authorities, she named several people as her attacker. One assailant she named 
was an employee at the hospital, a supervisor, a man named Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo maintains that he had an ironclad alibi. He said he left the hospital 
grounds at 11 a.m. as part of a second job and had not returned until after 
12:30 p.m. Then he had been in meetings all afternoon, from 1 p.m. until past 3 
p.m. According to Bravo, he went home that night not knowing that anyone had 
been raped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Bravo walked into the hospital building where he worked and 
two Los Angeles County deputies were waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said: 'You need to put your hands behind your back. You're under 
arrest,' " he said. "They put me in handcuffs and whisked me away." 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo was charged with the rape shortly after his arrest, beginning an ordeal 
that would last three years. He said he hired a lawyer by finding a name in the 
Yellow Pages that had a nice ring to it -- Steve Nieto. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after Nieto took the case, the main controversy began to develop. Nieto, 
whose law office is in Whittier, said that well before the trial he requested 
that the district attorney's office perform DNA tests on items found at the 
crime scene. The alleged rape occurred in an alcove that patients often used 
for sexual trysts, hospital officials said. He said the prosecution told him 
they planned to do the testing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chilstrom said that was not true, that Nieto never mentioned a desire to 
have DNA testing done early in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense lawyer never asked us to explore DNA until six months after the 
arraignment," Chilstrom said. "Never did he indicate to us that he was 
interested in further testing." 
</P>
<P>
 Chilstrom said that when Nieto asked for DNA testing just before trial, she 
took it to be a delaying tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If DNA had been brought up (earlier), I would have had to write memos 
Downtown to get permission," said Chilstrom, who works out of the West Covina 
branch of the district attorney's office. "There would be no way I could turn 
down DNA without someone else in the office knowing about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paoli said she is not sure what happened. "Someone is lying," she wrote in her 
appellate brief. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, the case seemed open and shut. It was the testimony of a 
well-regarded supervisory nurse against that of a mental patient who had 
recanted the rape on at least one occasion. There were other hospital employees 
who could account for Bravo's whereabouts during the time the rape supposedly 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest piece of evidence the prosecution seemed to have was blood on 
the blanket, a blood type found in only about 3% of the population. Bravo has 
that blood type. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chilstrom took a tack that was not expected by the defense. She started to 
zero in on Bravo and paint him as a liar. She took what in other circumstances 
might have seemed like little things and made them examples of how Bravo had a 
pattern of lying. How he had called himself a Marine corpsman to perhaps leave 
the impression that he had done medical work in the military, how a business 
card identified him as having a master's in social work when he did not even 
have a four-year degree. 
</P>
<P>
 (Paoli, Bravo's lawyer, acknowledged that her client had misrepresented 
himself on occasion, but said that had nothing do with the rape charge.) 
</P>
<P>
 Chilstrom presented item after item, witness after witness, and Bravo saw the 
tide turning against him. He was being picked apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time passed, I started to get scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the jury returned with the guilty verdict, Bravo and his wife found 
themselves forced to adapt to new lives. In prison, Bravo was soon taken aside 
by an inmate and told that rapists were looked down upon and that he needed to 
lie about why he was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I constantly worried about my safety because I didn't know what to expect," 
he said. "I did a good job of distorting and lying about what I was in there 
for. I had seen rapists and child molesters beaten." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Roseanne Bravo carried on in public as if nothing happened. 
The case had drawn little publicity, so she went about her business, confiding 
only in two co-workers at the hospital where she is a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I handled it as if he were still here," she said. "I felt that if I went and 
told everyone at my job, they were going to label him the way they wanted to. I 
did not want to be the talk of my workplace. And I wanted to protect my child 
as well." 
</P>
<P>
 After the conviction, Paoli was appointed as Bravo's appeals lawyer and she 
went about bringing the case to higher courts. But at each step of the way, 
Bravo's conviction was upheld. The state Supreme Court denied the appeals of 
the verdict and a motion to admit new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 As time went by, though, several things happened. The woman who accused Bravo 
of rape recanted and named another man as her attacker. Although the higher 
courts affirmed Bravo's conviction, Bascue ordered the DNA tests after it was 
returned to Los Angeles Superior Court in October. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 4, Paoli filed a blistering brief in which she presented the case for 
why Bravo should be released, including the results of the DNA tests. Two days 
later, the judge ordered Bravo freed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bravo, it was a case of modern science coming to his rescue when it was 
almost too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had done this a long time ago," he said, "none of this would have 
happened."PRISONER RELEASES --

BILL BOYARSKY: CRITICS TAKE NOTE: JUROR ABUSE ISN'T DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of my readers complained that my recent criticism of the jury system was 
superficial. A few said I didn't understand that the main reason jurors are 
mistreated is because the courts are overburdened and short of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 After my own time on a jury panel in the Downtown Los Angeles courthouse, I'd 
written that jurors were herded about like cattle, subjected to poor working 
conditions and forced to spend their 10 days of service under the old Army rule 
of "hurry up and wait." 
</P>
<P>
 So I came to the Capitol to ask an expert about what my critics were saying. 
He's Phil Isenberg, chairman of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. Since 1990, 
Isenberg has been leading the effort to reform a state court system designed in 
frontier days. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg is a smart attorney and former mayor of Sacramento with a quality 
increasingly rare in politics: a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was elected to the Assembly, he wanted to take a break from law and 
local government, and immersed himself in the budget, water issues and 
education. But in 1990, Speaker Willie Brown appointed him Judiciary Committee 
chairman. To his surprise, Isenberg got interested in court reform, a subject 
too dreary for most lawmakers. "My fatal flaw is that I can get interested in 
anything," Isenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 I told Isenberg that my critics complained that I failed to understand that 
the courts are broke. He laughed. "The courts are well-funded," he said. "But 
they think that if they don't get everything they want, they are being 
punished. If they had cuts like welfare or schools, they'd faint." 
</P>
<P>
 He showed me a report prepared in 1992 for the state's top judge, Chief 
Justice Malcolm Lucas of the state Supreme Court. The report, by Michigan State 
University professor John H. Hudzik, found that California court expenditures 
grew by more than 13% in the 1980s, compared to 5% for law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his job as Judiciary Committee chairman, Isenberg went to work to make the 
courts more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 He understood that their operation has a life-and-death impact on the way we 
live. Crowded, inefficient courts, with clogged calendars, mean more plea 
bargaining between prosecutors and defense attorneys, more criminals able to 
bargain for lighter sentences in exchange for guilty pleas. This means that 
more violent criminals walk the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts, he learned, were like the Balkans in that each of the state's 58 
counties has a fiercely independent court system. This is a relic of early 
California, when it took many days to travel by horseback from one county to 
another. Today, some of these court systems are deeply into reform -- 
consolidating work, speeding along trials, cutting red tape and computerizing. 
Others balked at change. Los Angeles County has been one of the most 
recalcitrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg, backed by Gov. Pete Wilson, pushed through new laws increasing state 
financial support of the courts, but also telling them to shape up and put an 
end to the antiquated system of maintaining separate Superior and Municipal 
court systems that basically do the same work. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's presiding judge of the Superior Court, Ricardo Torres, 
resisted. "Judge Torres delayed efficiencies for a year," Isenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But change began when Torres was replaced as presiding judge by someone just 
as committed to reform as Isenberg, Superior Court Judge Robert Mallano. "He 
has a good sense of humor, he doesn't take himself seriously, he is committed 
to change, but his colleagues trust him," Isenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano has become a pivotal figure in the reform movement. He has swung the 
reluctant L.A. system behind the most important proposal, imposing budget 
controls on the courts. The L.A. judges had resisted this, contending that when 
elected politicians try to control the judicial budget, it weakens the 
independence of the judiciary, a separate branch of government. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the judges' concerns about a loss of independence, Isenberg proposed 
that the priorities be recommended by the judges' own statewide governing body, 
the Judicial Council. Mallano became co-chair of the Judicial Council committee 
that recommended the priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-digit yearly increases of the 1980s have been halted, largely 
because of the reforms. Last year, court operations went up by just 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So it's not money that's to blame for the hardships imposed on jurors -- the 
inadequate phone system, the crowded facilities, the long waits. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts had been well-financed during the booming 1980s. Even today, 
funding is increasing, although at a much more restrained pace. The limited 
dollars are going further than in the past. The courts are beginning to spend 
more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd have to pin the blame somewhere else in the courthouse -- with its 
hallways full of defendants and plaintiffs, prosecutors and defense lawyers 
and, those at the bottom of the judicial pyramid, the jurors. Perhaps that 
lowly status, the fact that jurors are treated with indifference, was the 
reason all along.

GRAMMY WINNER HARRY NILSSON DIES; MUSIC: SINGER-SONGWRITER, 52, APPARENTLY 
SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK. HIS 'EVERYBODY'S TALKIN' IN 'MIDNIGHT COWBOY' WAS A 
HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson, who gained fame with his 
rendition of the hit "Everybody's Talkin' " in the 1969 movie "Midnight Cowboy" 
and whose quirky tunes such as "Me and My Arrow" endeared him to the Beatles, 
died of an apparent heart attack early Saturday. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson, who had never fully recovered from a heart attack he suffered in 
February, died in his sleep at his Agoura Hills home, said David Spero, his 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Spero said Nilsson, who recorded his last album in 1979, had just completed 
work Wednesday night on a new record tentatively titled "Harry's Got a Brown 
New Robe." 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I talked to him was Thursday," Spero said. "He sounded great. 
He was very up and excited about the new songs he had finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson, born Harry Edward Nelson III in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1941, stood at the 
center stage of pop music in the early 1970s. A millionaire before he was 30, 
Nilsson grew rich writing hits such as Three Dog Night's "One" and singing two 
Grammy-winning numbers -- "Without You" and "Everybody's Talkin'," the song 
that made him a major star when it was featured in the Oscar-winning film 
"Midnight Cowboy." His hit "I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City" followed 
soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, his animated movie "The Point," a musical fantasy about a boy and his 
dog that included the top-40 song "Me and My Arrow," was a prime-time triumph 
when it premiered on ABC and went on to earn two film festival awards. That 
same year, Nilsson released his platinum-selling album "Nilsson Schmilsson," 
which included the hit "Without You" and "Coconut." The next year he came out 
with the album "Son of Schmilsson."  
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson's eclectic style and whimsical songwriting won him the attention of 
the Beatles, with whom he became friends. In a 1988 interview with The Times, 
he recalled the time he and John Lennon dropped in unannounced before a stunned 
RCA executive who was considering rejecting the $5-million contract Nilsson 
wanted.

 "John said: 'You've only had two (expletive) artists in the history of your 
label -- Elvis and Harry. Pay him the two bucks,' " said Nilsson, who credited 
Lennon with helping him to eventually get the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1970s, Nilsson's career had been on the slide. Although he 
continued to dabble in music, Nilsson, whom rock critic Ken Tucker once 
described as "almost proudly lazy," stopped making records and never toured. 
Nilsson was a heavy drinker and smoker, and his health began to decline as he 
put on more weight.  
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson's creative interests were revived in 1991 when the Performing Arts 
Conservatory produced a stage version of "The Point" at the Chapel Court 
Theatre in Hollywood. "To fatten up the score a bit," Nilsson contributed a 
couple new songs for the play, which received generally good reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Nilsson also wrote and performed music for the movie "Popeye," 
starring Robin Williams, and the Terry Gilliam film "The Fisher King." 
</P>
<P>
 Spero said Nilsson had given up drinking and had recently gotten together with 
former Beatle Ringo Starr to make a video, "Rockers Against Drunk Driving," 
which will premiere on the American Music Awards on Feb. 7. On the video, the 
two sing the Beatles' song "Baby, You Can Drive My Car." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were best friends," Spero said. "I talked to Ringo's wife, Barbara, this 
morning. She said he took it very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working on his record, Spero said, Nilsson had been busy 
writing a book about his life and was looking forward to RCA releasing a boxed 
set of his music in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson is survived by his wife of 20 years, Oona, and their six children.

COUNCIL VOWS TO BLOCK PRIVATIZATION; JOBS: EIGHT MEMBERS TELL UNION RALLY THEY 
WOULD OPPOSE MAYOR'S ATTEMPTS TO SHIFT MUNICIPAL SERVICES TO PRIVATE SECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of Los Angeles City Council members promised a rally of union 
workers Saturday that they would block attempts by Mayor Richard Riordan to 
privatize thousands of municipal employees' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 As an overflow crowd at Bethany Baptist Church cheered and clapped, eight City 
Council members vowed solidarity with garbage collectors, custodial workers, 
parking control officers and others who say their jobs are threatened by 
Riordan's proposal to study the feasibility of turning some city services over 
to private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members Mark Ridley-Thomas, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, Rita 
Walters, Ruth Galanter, Zev Yaroslavsky, Jackie Goldberg and Richard Alarcon 
all spoke in support of the employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are eight of us here and I hope there are still eight of us there when 
the vote comes down in the City Council," said Galanter, who was wearing a 
black T-shirt bearing the logo of the Service Employees International Union 
Local 347, which represents 6,500 city workers in ongoing contract 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's latest offer to the union called for no salary increase but a 
guarantee that no city employees would lose their jobs as a result of 
privatization, according to city sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas acknowledged that Riordan faces a budget shortfall, but warned 
the mayor: "Don't balance the budget on the backs of working people in the city 
of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Specific privatization proposals have not been released, but Riordan has told 
council members that he is considering six municipal services as pilot projects 
for private industry: garbage collection, parking enforcement, golf course 
maintenance, custodial work, data processing and management of workers' 
compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
 David Novak, the mayor's director of communications, said the rally and the 
council members' support of the unions will not stop Riordan from studying the 
potential for contracting some city services to private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor is not an ideologue of privatization," Novak said. "But the mayor 
is an ideologue of increasing efficiency and competition. What the mayor is 
trying to do is allow for the flexibility to have the most efficient services 
provided at the lowest possible cost to taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The rally of more than 500 people began with speeches, spirituals and a march 
from a shopping center parking lot to the church. The event took on the aura of 
a 1960s civil rights demonstration as speaker after speaker invoked the name of 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday was the 65th birthday anniversary of the civil rights leader who was 
assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968 while supporting a strike by sanitation 
workers. The keynote speaker at the rally was the Rev. James M. Lawson Jr., a 
board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference who had been 
working with King in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The service employees union was joined by the Los Angeles County Federation of 
Labor and various community groups in setting up the rally that began at the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of city workers in the service sectors being studied by Riordan are 
members of minority groups and speakers criticized privatization as an example 
of the last-hired, first-fired syndrome. They also called the proposal a step 
back from affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Brooks, 36, who has worked on a city garbage crew for two years, was 
among the marchers. Brooks is black, grew up in Los Angeles and he and his wife 
are raising three children, ages 12, 8 and 4. Brooks said that it takes all the 
salary from his $17.50-an-hour city job and his wife's position as a bank 
secretary to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that city workers have not had a raise in about two years, Yaroslavsky 
said: "What's the thanks we're going to give to our workers for making that 
sacrifice? We're going to kick them out the door? Hell, no, we're not going to 
kick them out the door."

ACTIVISTS ARRESTED IN AUTO SHOW PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Saturday arrested two environmental activists who scaled a Los 
Angeles Convention Center tower to hang a banner accusing an auto company of 
destroying the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainforest Action Network staged the protest as the Greater Los Angeles 
Auto Show was taking place inside the convention center.Three other members of 
the environmental group were cited for trespassing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After scaling the building, protesters unfurled a large banner that said: 
"Welcome to the Show, Boycott Mitsubishi -- World's 1 Rainforest Destroyer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Two of them were up there trying to hang up a sign while the other three 
people were down below cheering them on," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jay 
Moberly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Custer, spokesperson for Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, said the 
parent firm has a trading company that is separate from the auto company. "They 
are involved in trading of materials in Burma involving lumber and have very 
limited forestry," Custer said. "This is a fund-raising ploy raised by a group 
of environmentalists who don't have their facts straight."

MAN CHARGED IN AIRLINE EXTORTION TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI agents arrested a man who allegedly tried to extort $1.5 million from 
United Airlines by threatening to shoot down an airliner bound for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Orvile Spence, 48, was arrested Friday night in the Lennox area as he 
attempted to pick up the money he demanded, said Charlie Parsons, special agent 
in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 About noon Friday, Spence telephoned United Airlines officials in Chicago and 
threatened to use a Vietnam War-era weapon known as a Law rocket to shoot down 
a Los Angeles-bound passenger jet, Parsons said. Spence also made similar calls 
to United Airlines in Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence was arraigned Saturday and charged with extortion. If convicted, he 
could face 20 years in federal prison and a fine of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials did not say where Spence lived and were unsure whether he 
possessed a Law rocket.

EXPATRIATES VENT ANGER AT AUTHOR, MOVIE PORTRAYALS; VIETNAM: EXILES OBJECT TO 
WRITER LE LY HAYSLIP'S ADVOCACY OF NORMALIZATION OF TIES WITH COMMUNIST NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 They can never forgive or forget. Nor do they want to. 
</P>
<P>
 For a small group of expatriate Vietnamese who live in Orange County, to 
forgive the Communist government that chased them from their homes -- leaving 
family, friends and neighbors dead -- is to trample the memory of what once was 
their nation, the Republic of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The expatriates, who vented their anger at author Le Ly Hayslip in a 
surprisingly hostile demonstration Jan. 9, said that even after nearly 20 years 
they must speak out against anyone who supported or worked for the Vietnamese 
Communists, the Cong San . 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the Communists change their philosophy -- no, until they leave our 
country -- we can never work with them," said Chuyen Nguyen, editor and 
publisher of Tieng Chuong ("Sound of the Bell"), a conservative newspaper in 
Little Saigon. "And people who say they support normalization are traitors." 
The protesters, many of whom were officers in the South Vietnamese army or 
former political detainees, object to the fact that Hayslip's personal saga -- 
which includes aiding the Viet Cong -- is the subject of Oliver Stone's latest 
movie, "Heaven and Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, who belong to a variety of Vietnamese American political 
groups, also say they are bitter that Hayslip and Stone advocate normalization 
with Hanoi, a position the nationalists adamantly oppose as long as the current 
regime is in power. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last few years, they have been bucking efforts to normalize relations 
between the United States and Vietnam once the POW-MIA issue is resolved. So 
far, they said, the battle has been futile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politically, we have no power in our hands. At the national level, we, the 
Vietnamese community, have no voice," said Nguyen, whose newspaper recently 
printed a scathing attack on Hayslip and the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oliver Stone and Le Ly Hayslip, they have a loud voice called filmmaking -- 
and what did they do with that voice? They exploited us. They portrayed 
honorable Republican soldiers who fought for democracy as evil people," Nguyen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a movie maker, Oliver Stone used us," said Nguyen, 44. "As a Vietnamese 
woman, Le Ly betrayed us." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie has, however, received at least one favorable review in the 
Vietnamese press and regularly plays -- with a dubbed Vietnamese soundtrack -- 
to packed houses at the Thu Do Theater on Westminster Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some ardent nationalists have protested and even threatened 
people who publicly support normalization. Last year, Dr. Co Pham, president of 
the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, who hosted a Vietnamese diplomat at his 
home, received threatening letters and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 While demonstrations outside Pham's office did not result in violence, Pham 
said he feared for his life. He hired a bodyguard and began wearing a 
bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 9 demonstration against Hayslip was hostile enough that the 
frightened author canceled her appearance in what she said was an effort to 
protect her visiting mother and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 That protest, leaders said, was called because "Heaven and Earth" shamed 
nationalist soldiers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was an officer in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam," said Hau Nguyen, 
president of the Vietnam Political Detainees Mutual Assn., a Southern 
California support group which sponsors former war prisoners who want to 
emigrate to the United States. "I spent four years of my life in jail because I 
fought for what I believed in. We fought for freedom from the communists." 
</P>
<P>
 "And in the movie, that woman tells the world that we are bad men, that we 
plundered villages and killed the peasants, that we tortured innocent women," 
Nguyen said, his voice strained with anger and pain.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the dozens of people who protested Hayslip's appearance, a handful were 
women who said they objected to what they believe is the reinforcement of the 
stereotype of Asian women as prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even as (Hayslip) says that the movie tells of her personal story and she is 
not speaking for all Vietnamese women in her movie, she and Oliver Stone have 
promoted it as a movie 'about the Vietnamese through the eyes of a Vietnamese 
woman' " said Ngoc Anh, 44, a staff writer for Tieng Chuong. "What else are 
people watching their movie going to think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Ha, a Garden Grove author whose own published memoir detailed her escape 
from Vietnam, said she holds no grudge against Hayslip. 
</P>
<P>
 "After watching the movie, I feel so sad for her because she has lost so 
much," said Ha, 43. "I praised her for her bravery and her honesty and her 
determination to overcome the obstacles in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what makes me angry," said Ha, who is currently trying to get her 
autobiography published in English, "is the fact that she was raised a 
Communist; her family supported communism. And her books and her movie left a 
bad impression about the Vietnamese woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone erred in his judgment, Ha and others said, when he used Hayslip's life 
story and proclaimed it a representation of Vietnamese women who suffered.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was pro-Communist; most of us fought against them," Ha said. "She was a 
prostitute; most of us were not." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were women who lost their sons, their husbands and those who nursed the 
wounded through the war without any recognition," Ha said. "We have all these 
honorable women. And who is perceived as a symbol of the beautiful Vietnamese 
woman but an illiterate country woman who spied for the Viet Cong and 
prostituted herself with the American soldiers?" 
</P>
<P>
 The expatriates are enraged that instead of repudiating her political past, 
Hayslip, with Stone's support, advocates normalization with the current 
government in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters said they believe that Hayslip's East Meets West Foundation is 
a front organization that attempts to aid the Vietnamese government 
economically. They claimed Hayslip is using the nonprofit organization to make 
money for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the divergent views on the normalization debate, the nationalists 
said they will never let up on their fight against Hayslip, Stone, or anyone 
who advocates a relationship with the current regime in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things in life that could change," said Chuyen Nguyen. "On this 
issue, there is no compromise. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Hau Nguyen added: "I will never trust anyone who has been in touch with the 
Communists."

VALET ACCUSED OF TAKING BOSS TO THE CLEANERS; COURTS: NEWPORT RESTAURATEUR AND 
PROSECUTOR SAY HE EMBEZZLED MORE THAN $440,000. HE SAYS HIS MILLIONAIRE 
EMPLOYER KNOWINGLY GAVE HIM CARTE BLANCHE TO SPEND ON HIMSELF AND CHAUFFEUR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clarence R. Wheeler earned $33,000 a year as a valet, but it was easy to 
mistake him for his millionaire boss. 
</P>
<P>
 His suits were Armani, his watches Cartier. He spent summer vacations in 
Cannes, liked to dine at Le Cirque in New York and allegedly boasted about 
socializing with singer George Michael. He splurged on facials, massages, his 
own personal trainer. Without blinking, Wheeler cut a $42,000 check for a new 
BMW at Sterling Motors in Newport Beach, according to court records and his own 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, Wheeler worked as a trusted assistant to Larry J. Cano, founder 
of the El Torito restaurant empire. 
</P>
<P>
 But the good life ended when Cano accused his valet of dipping into his bank 
accounts and abusing his credit cards to buy gifts for the restaurateur's 
chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the former valet goes on trial in Orange County Superior Court on 
11 felony counts of grand theft, embezzlement, money laundering, credit card 
and tax fraud. Wheeler, 39, is accused of stealing more than $440,000 from his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to pressing criminal charges, Cano has also filed a civil lawsuit 
against Wheeler and credit card companies to recover his losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler's attorney said his client is innocent, that Cano never defined any 
spending limits and gave the valet a free hand to buy clothes for himself and 
the chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone working for Larry Cano couldn't be expected to dress tacky. He had to 
look and live the part," said defense attorney Scott Well of Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Well alleges that Cano had visited the valet's apartment several times, saw 
the posh furnishings and never complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client believed all along that Larry Cano wanted him to do these things," 
the attorney said, citing a law stating that a person cannot be convicted of 
embezzlement if what he does is done in an open manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Well said the valet's case may be strengthened by an official from Pacific 
National Bank, who, according to civil court records, stated that Cano signed 
in her presence power of attorney authorizing Wheeler to transfer money from 
Cano's account and to write checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those statements and others prompted prosecutors to drop the charges against 
the valet last March. After a lengthy investigation by Newport Beach police and 
the Orange County district attorney's office, the criminal case was reinstated 
six months later. Prosecutors said they now believe they have sufficient 
evidence to convict the valet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano declined to be interviewed for this story, but he asked his longtime 
friend -- whose name is Larry R. Cano, producer of the movie "Silkwood" -- to 
speak on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, the spokesman, said the millionaire feels hurt because he believes he 
was betrayed and defrauded by a trusted aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said the restaurateur is aware that his lavish lifestyle will be 
on display during that criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if (the millionaire) is guilty of anything, he's guilty of not watching 
his own store," the spokesman said. "Larry may have lived a lifestyle that most 
of us can only dream of. . . . But what does Larry's lifestyle have to do with 
it? It's a subterfuge to the real issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the prosecutor and defense attorney in the case agreed the trial will 
offer a glimpse into the lifestyle of Orange County's super-rich, the kind of 
Newport Beach opulence described in Joseph Wambaugh's novel "The Golden 
Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 The witness list includes forensic accountants, executives of Neiman Marcus, 
and British pop star Michael, who may be called by the prosecution to deny 
statements by Wheeler that the singer had given the valet money and gifts. 
Michael has told investigators that he does not know Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe D'Agostino, the prosecutor, said the case is about "a 
lifestyle that most middle-class people, even in Orange County, are not 
familiar with. It's much more extravagant than most people can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to this case is to try to get jurors to understand what kind of money 
this man (Cano) had," Well said. "This was a man who spent money to put his 
tulips and fur coats in cold storage for the next year, who bought a $70,000 
limousine and paid cash. It's unfathomable to many that this was a man who had 
four houses, and on any given day each was decorated with expensive floral 
arrangements worth several hundred dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's spokesman said he was unaware of the extent of Cano's spending habits, 
but said the restaurateur was a wealthy man and that "the '80s were really good 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, 69, a former bartender, East Los Angeles native and Air Force captain in 
World War II, opened the first El Torito restaurant in Southern California in 
1954 and went on to earn almost $18 million when he was bought out two decades 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 With wealth came homes in Newport Beach, Palm Desert, Aspen and Vail, Colo. 
Cano enjoyed annual jaunts to a leased home on the French Riviera, and luxury 
cars including a Rolls-Royce Corniche and Mercedes-Benzes. 
</P>
<P>
 Business continued to boom, and Cano was so busy that around 1975 he and his 
second wife decided to hire Wheeler, a young man from Pioneer, Ohio, "to be my 
houseboy and do housework and other personal services for us," as Cano 
describes it in civil court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler later worked as his valet. And in 1989, when Cano's personal 
accountant left the job, the restaurateur promoted Wheeler with 
responsibilities to balance "my personal and credit card accounts, accounting 
for all my monies . . ., " the same court documents state. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's account at Pacific National Bank in Newport Beach was considerable, 
with up to $300,000 flowing into the account some months, according to 
transcripts from Wheeler's preliminary hearing in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler, who still worked as Cano's valet, wrote the spousal support checks to 
Cano's three former wives and took care of bills incurred by Cano's 
girlfriends, Well said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspicions started in the fall of 1992. That's when Cano says a $17,000 
alimony check to one of his former wives bounced, according to the prosecutor 
in the criminal case. The millionaire called in accountants and later Newport 
Beach police detectives to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 In civil court documents, Cano alleges that Wheeler embezzled $443,564 during 
a 2 1/2-year period from one of Cano's bank accounts and in charges to Cano's 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Wheeler was enamored with Cano's chauffeur and went on 
shopping sprees to shower the man with antiques, expensive artwork, Cartier 
watches and Armani suits from Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, the valet wrote a $60,000 check to the chauffeur, according 
to civil court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The chauffeur, Thomas John Gioia, 33, who is a prosecution witness at the 
criminal trial, declined to comment through his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano's lawsuit alleges that the valet gave the chauffeur, among other things, 
designer clothes from Gianni Versace in Beverly Hills and New York, meals at 
the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point and Le Cirque in New York, and matching 
bracelets and diamond stud earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 After the alleged theft was discovered, Gioia returned thousands of dollars in 
antiques, paintings and clothes, including 25 Armani suits, to Cano, Cano's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said the millionaire never authorized the purchases, which were 
mostly made on his accounts with credit cards bearing Gioia's and Wheeler's 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no reason for Mr. Gioia or Mr. Wheeler to be so nicely 
dressed," the spokesman said. "A run-of-the-mill sports coat or dark suit would 
do just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Well said his client acknowledges he made all the purchases, but says they 
were all authorized by his employer, Cano. 
</P>
<P>
 Well said Cano lived a lavish lifestyle and was "extremely generous" to his 
employees to the point where he leased cars for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney said that he would contend at the trial that the valet 
was valued by his boss. "He literally fed, clothed and even bathed Mr. Cano," 
Well said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Cano's "finances are upside down, my client cannot understand why he 
has turned on him. All he's done for the last 17 years is serve Larry Cano and 
now he accuses him of stealing money," Well said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano owns the landmark Cano's Waterfront in Newport Beach, Kiva Grill in La 
Jolla, and two Manana restaurants in Southern California. Two of his businesses 
recently filed bankruptcy actions in federal court, seeking protection from 
creditors.  
</P>
<P>
 Larry R. Cano, the spokesman, said he believes that by the end of the criminal 
trial, "Mr. Wheeler is going to have to pay . . . and Mr. Cano will be a lot 
wiser in handling his future finances."

DANA PARSONS: PERSONALLY, REINVENTING ONESELF IS A SINGULARLY GOOD IDEA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We hear a lot of talk these days about "reinventing" ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept gets a bad rap, because it's become synonymous with unprincipled 
shifting with the wind. Let's say that Politician A took Position B 10 years 
ago but now supports Position C. You can count on his critics to say he's 
reinvented himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it ever occur to them that the dude is evolving? 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, what's wrong with reinventing ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the marriages that could be saved if either person could reinvent 
himself or herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey, why don't you just go reinvent yourself?" has a much nicer ring to it 
than, "Honey, why don't you just go (bleep) yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be the first to admit it, I could use a little reinvention. I mean, it's 
not like I'm perfect or anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell the truth, wouldn't you like to wake up some morning and just be a 
different person, with a whole new package of skills, temperament and world 
view? Wouldn't it be great to be a brand-new you? 
</P>
<P>
 I would reinvent myself as someone who's handy. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to be able to repair cars, rewire stereos, reroute indoor plumbing (if 
necessary), build a back-yard swing set (although I am a little old for one) 
and maintain a fine lawn. Those of you who are already handy have no idea what 
a gift you have. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy people see a set of instructions that read like the Dead Sea Scrolls, 
and they begin licking their chops. People like me feel a queasiness that soon 
gives way to anger, usually within seconds of beginning the task at hand. 
Through years of experience, I'm now conditioned to believe I can't fix or 
figure out anything that requires mechanical aptitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being handy, I have a lot of useless trivia information in my head. 
Once upon a time, I may have thought that was a cool trait to have, but as the 
years pass, it is becoming less and less valuable. Much of the time you can't 
even expose your knowledge, because people will just think you're trying to be 
a know-it-all. On the other hand, I've never known any handyman who wasn't 
welcomed when his talents came into play. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd also do some reinventing in the personality department. Don't get me 
wrong, I'm a highly entertaining person with a delightful mix of appealing 
traits, but let's be honest, I could be a whole lot more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to reinvent myself into someone who's a little wackier, a little more 
spontaneous. I wonder what it's like to wake up every morning and be Madonna. I 
think it would be fun to be less responsible and to be someone whom nobody 
could ever count on. Sure, it would frustrate people, but at least nobody would 
call you boring. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't hurt to do some reinventing of my temperament. For starters, I'd 
like to be less judgmental of other people's stupid mannerisms and behavior, 
but that's hard when you possess the certain knowledge that your way of doing 
things is superior to everyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, nobody said reinvention was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 What's tantalizing about reinventing yourself is that, theoretically, it is 
possible to do it. About the only thing you can't reinvent these days is your 
height. Everything else is up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the reinvention business is hot by watching TV. The number of people 
who are more than willing to reinvent you are almost as numerous as talk-show 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Too fat? Too bald? Too spiritually bereft? Too financially insecure? Too 
socially awkward? Too unhealthy? Somewhere on that cable dial is a modern-day 
Edison wanting to tinker with you. Unfortunately, that someone is a person who 
has already invented himself and is as annoying as hell about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we know that most of us aren't happy with the way we are. The pioneers 
may have felt the same way, but where were they going to go to reinvent 
themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, we have options, and it's surprising that with all the 
opportunities for reinvention, we're not on the verge of perfecting ourselves. 
You'd think we'd have built the perfect beast by now. 
</P>
<P>
 If I weren't so lazy, I'd probably reinvent myself. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it'd be fun to eavesdrop at my own funeral and overhear a friend who 
hadn't seen me in years say, "Yeah, he was a nice guy, maybe a little on the 
bland and smug side" only to have a latter-day friend interject, "Oh, didn't 
you hear? He reinvented himself. He turned out to be quite the cutup and 
completely unpredictable. He was a jerk, but he had a certain style to him."

HOSTILE FIRE IN LITTLE SAIGON; SUBJECT OF 'HEAVEN AND EARTH' FINDS HERSELF ON 
UNFRIENDLY GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 From the moment she sat down to write her memoirs more than 10 years ago, Le 
Ly Hayslip knew she would place herself under attack from the Vietnamese 
American community for revealing how she lived her life in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a life that included aiding Vietnamese Communist soldiers, working as a 
prostitute and marrying an American. 
</P>
<P>
 As she penned her life story, the author, whose books are the basis for 
director Oliver Stone's latest movie, "Heaven and Earth," knew her life would 
never be the same. But she thought she was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last week, Hayslip arrived at a business complex on Bolsa Avenue in 
Westminster's Little Saigon with her mother and sisters, who were visiting from 
Vietnam. The reception that awaited her made Hayslip realize that she was not 
quite prepared to face the wrath of some expatriates, who believe she has 
betrayed their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of people were marching in the parking lot, waving the red-and-yellow 
flags of the former Republic of Vietnam, screaming epithets and protesting her 
family's appearance in a community the demonstrators called the "capital of 
Vietnamese refugees." The presence of a former call girl and the "Viet Cong 
sympathizers" was not wanted, the protesters repeatedly blared through 
bullhorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of facing the media there to interview her, Hayslip shielded her 
bewildered, tearful family and scuttled them away from the hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had expected tough questioning when I accepted the invitation" from a local 
Vietnamese television station, Hayslip said. "I didn't expect the threat of 
violence. I didn't expect that Vietnamese people would greet my mother and my 
sisters with their words of hatred and anger. I wasn't prepared for that. I 
wasn't ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a bed in a seaside motel one day last week, Hayslip candidly and 
calmly discussed her reaction to the unexpected protest and explained why she 
is working with the Hanoi government through her East Meets West Foundation, 
which sets up medical clinics in rural Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated beside Hayslip on the double bed, her mother and sisters chewed on 
fresh betel nut leaves, stared off into the distance and sometimes wept as they 
quietly listened to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayslip, 44, said she understands why the protesters were angry. She knows 
that because "Heaven and Earth" is the first mainstream movie about the Vietnam 
War from the perspective of the Vietnamese people, some Vietnamese Americans 
are offended that it is seen through the eyes of a Viet Cong collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven and Earth," Stone's third movie about the Vietnam War, chronicles 
Hayslip's life, as it was shaped by the war. As a teen-ager, Hayslip served as 
a lookout for the Viet Cong. She was eventually captured by government soldiers 
and tortured. She turned to prostitution to support herself and later married 
an American who brought her to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a young girl and I believed in a cause my ancestors, my family and my 
village believed in," Hayslip said. "The Viet Cong lived in the fields of my 
village. They told us Vietnam should be a united, not separated, country. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in a place where (American and South Vietnamese) soldiers 
search your home in the daytime and Viet Cong soldiers hide in your village 
during the night, how do you choose what is right and what is wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hayslip chose the Communists, the protesters believe, and for that she would 
always be a pariah to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Her detractors said they also object to Stone's sympathetic portrayal of her 
"immoral" background -- she sold sexual favors to American soldiers -- and 
claim the movie reinforces the stereotype some have of Asian women as bar girls 
and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining why she chose the path she did, Hayslip began with her 
childhood: "I was born in a poor village to a poor family. I was illiterate. I 
tended oxen and planted rice in the paddies. To keep me strong and working, my 
family shaved my head so the hair wouldn't weigh me down and make me weak." 
</P>
<P>
 As an adult during a time of tumult and economic instability in her homeland, 
Hayslip said, she had no other way of earning a living for herself and her 
toddler son other than to sell cigarettes, liquor and marijuana on the black 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that wasn't enough, I sold myself," she added. "Do people think I 
actually wanted to become a prostitute? There was a war and I had to survive 
during that war. I did what I could to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they could somehow disregard Hayslip's past, the protesters said, they 
cannot ignore her present, namely the fact that she advocates the United States 
lifting economic sanctions against Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 They also accuse Hayslip of working with the current Communist regime because 
Hanoi allows her East Meets West Foundation to build medical clinics in rural 
areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a Communist," Hayslip said, "but I can't deny that I want 
normalization in Vietnam because I think it is time. And I can't deny that I 
have met with officials from Hanoi to talk about what East Meets West could do 
for the sick and wounded who are poor and who live in areas where there are no 
hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayslip, who has made 16 trips to her homeland since 1986, points out that it 
is a place where the countryside is ravaged and people are starving, a 
situation that is perhaps lost on the opponents of normalization. She just 
wants to do something to help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people against normalization, they're saying let the country go hungry so 
that the government must finally beg for outside help and then, the government 
could be overthrown," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me, I say if you help people who are weak, they will eventually become 
stronger and they will stand up and fight. But until they gain strength, they 
can do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayslip said it was necessary to meet with officials from Hanoi, to secure 
their approval before her foundation could provide medicine and modern medical 
technology for peasants too poor to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I sat down with the Communists to ask for their permission for me and 
the people from my foundation to come into the country," she said. "I have to 
do what I think is right for my people." 
</P>
<P>
 On the emotional and sensitive debate over normalization of relations between 
the United States and the regime in Vietnam, Hayslip and her detractors 
acknowledged that there may never be common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "To reach a middle ground, the people involved would have to willingly forgive 
and learn about the other side and try to understand their side of the 
argument," Hayslip said. "Right now, I don't think that is possible."

NATIVE AMERICAN STORYTELLING HELPS SHATTER STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of tale that could quiet a group of 80 boisterous 
schoolchildren: the legend of a white buffalo whose gift of a peace pipe 
brought harmony between two Crow tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 And after Martyne Van Hofwegen, a storyteller employed by the Capistrano 
Unified School District's Indian Education Resource Center, finished weaving 
her tale of magic, dozens of small hands shot in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, is that story, like, true?" asked one fourth-grade boy at Barcelona Hills 
Elementary School in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hofwegen smiled and replied: "It was very real to Crow children. I think 
you should get what is good out of any story." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1976, thousands of South County children, as well as hundreds of Native 
American students in the Capistrano district, have benefited from a federally 
funded program that helps them understand the Native American heritage and 
erases racial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano district gets about $129,000 annually for its program, one of 
1,200 nationwide. In Orange County, the only other such programs are in the 
Huntington Beach and Garden Grove school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 Native American students from grades seven to 12 were also tutored 
and given career counseling last year under the program. And approximately 
4,000 schoolchildren in the Capistrano district were able to experience Native 
American culture firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hofwegen is a storyteller and former elementary school teacher who studied 
Native American culture at UC Santa Barbara and UC Santa Cruz. And for the 
first time this year, the resource center is featuring the lifestyle and 
history of the local Juaneno tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 The center hired Jacque Nunez, a member of the Rios family, which has been in 
the San Juan Capistrano area for more than 200 years and live in what is 
considered the oldest home in California, to show how her tribe lived in South 
County before the Mission San Juan was built in the late 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a full-length doeskin dress decorated with shells and rabbit fur, 
Nunez held up a bar of Zest hand soap and asked if any students knew how Native 
Americans washed themselves. Then she produced a hollowed stone bowl filled 
with ground Yucca root that Juanenos used as body soap. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't go down to the Kmart and pick up what they needed," she said. 
"They relied on Mother Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Juanenos wasted nothing, Nunez told the students, who hung onto her every 
word. Instead of buying pots, the Juanenos wove tightly-knit baskets that could 
hold water. The herb fennel was used instead of Pepto-Bismol for an upset 
stomach. The aloe plant served as an antiseptic for cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you like Skittles?" she asked, waving a bag of candy overhead. "Yes," the 
children yelled back enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Juaneno kids liked candy too," Nunez said, "And they ate sweet pinon 
nuts (from certain pine cones) like it was candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez, who also works as a preschool teacher, had two main messages for the 
kids: Native Americans were the planet's first environmentalists and are not 
the ogres portrayed by generations of mass media and the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never call this (planet) the 'Earth, ' " she said. "It is always Mother 
Earth. And we love her and take care of her like we do our mothers. Would you 
throw garbage at your mother?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like the youthful Asian, white and Latino faces in her audiences, Juanenos 
have fathers, mothers and are "human beings just like you," Nunez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take away some of the negative ideas people get from television 
and the movies that show Indians as being mean and not liking white people," 
she told the students. "When I leave here today, I will put on my blue jeans 
and look like anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the main task of the Indian Education Resource Center is to help 
Native Americans with their schooling, program director Joe Wilson said, wiping 
out racial prejudices against Native Americans is a critical goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an awareness program," said Wilson, a Cherokee and 16-year employee 
of the Capistrano district. "Ignorance causes stereotyping, like the 
overwhelming concept that Indians can't leave reservations. We have 400 to 500 
Indian students who will participate in the program in some manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is also happy to show youngsters the Juaneno way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we've had adequate materials on other tribes but there has been 
practically zero written in any format about the Juanenos," he said. "We're 
fortunate to have someone like Mrs. Nunez to explain their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Response from students has been enthusiastic, said Van Hofwegen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single day I see children drawn" to Native American culture, she said. 
"They feel like there is something there for them."

TRAGIC IRONY; ALCOHOL-WARY WOMAN KILLED BY ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If someone had too much to drink with dinner or at a party, Marsha Morse would 
always warn the person not to get behind the wheel. And to protect her own 
life, Morse had been known to take cabs home rather than ride with people who 
were intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes Morse's death ironic. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 7, Morse, 52, was hit and thrown 50 feet by an alleged drunk driver as 
she unloaded groceries from her car outside her apartment in the 13100 block of 
Riverside Drive in Sherman Oaks. She died in the street shortly afterward, 
leaving behind a 16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Randolph Gene Higgins of Van Nuys, was found to have a blood 
alcohol level of 0.24% -- three times the legal limit -- and five convictions 
throughout Southern California for driving under the influence, according to 
police and court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives remember Morse as an outgoing, popular woman with quick 
wit and a positive attitude. Her death would be a loss in any context. But her 
friends say they feel a special outrage because the man charged with her death 
was a repeat offender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a part of me had been lost," said Millie Raymond, Morse's sister. 
"I felt like I'd been cheated of my sister. This guy should have been in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 As he was being arrested at the scene, Higgins, 44, told police that he had 
taken several drunk-driving awareness courses and well understood that he was 
putting the lives of others in danger by driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I don't do it anymore," Higgins told police, according to 
Detective Don Bellante of the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in Van Nuys Municipal Court have charged Higgins with murder, not 
gross vehicular manslaughter, the usual charge for the offense, because of 
Higgins' previous record. They said they filed the more serious charge also 
because they believe Higgins understood the possible consequences of drunk 
driving -- and therefore displayed "malice aforethought," which is part of the 
legal definition of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond, 49, who lives in Glendale, had been close to her sister since they 
were growing up in West Los Angeles. Now, fond memories of her sister compete 
with feelings of anger and grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning I got up and I stood in the shower and I cried," Raymond said. 
"You hear about it all the time, and I knew it could happen to anyone, but it 
is so ironic that this would happen to her. . . . She didn't drink. She didn't 
smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond, herself the mother of a 10-year-old boy, is especially concerned 
about the welfare of her niece. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who asked not to be named, came home the night of the incident with 
a group of friends and saw a commotion in the street. Neighbors rushed her 
inside before she could see her mother, and Raymond, who had hurried to the 
scene, told her that her mother had been killed. The girl had to be taken to 
the emergency room because she was so distraught. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stability she has known all her life is gone," Raymond said. "Her home is 
gone. Her mom is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Morse was divorced from the girl's father -- who lives in La Habra Heights -- 
12 years ago, Raymond said. The girl will be living in West Los Angeles with 
her half sister on her father's side. They met with a therapist Thursday to 
discuss the new arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, where Morse worked as a talent 
assistant, co-workers said Morse will be remembered for her humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of those women who comes into your life with such great energy 
that you fall in love with her," said Kristina Oster of Glendale. "We all miss 
her a lot. Everyone from our work went to her funeral. We closed." 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 people attended Morse's funeral Tuesday in Van Nuys. She was buried 
at Mt. Sinai Memorial Park in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins is being held at the Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $1-million bail. He 
pleaded not guilty to the murder charge Tuesday in Van Nuys Municipal Court and 
is scheduled to appear Friday for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Higgins was wanted in Beverly Hills for failing to 
appear in court on two other drunk-driving cases. He had no valid driver's 
license, police said. His string of five convictions dates to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces a mandatory prison sentence of 15 years to life if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe that he hadn't gone to jail yet," Bellante said.

SCOTT HARRIS: RIPPLES IN THE AFTERMATH OF OUTRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Shaw of Castaic writes: 
</P>
<P>
 A few comments and/or opinions about your article taking umbrage to George 
Will's column. . . . First let me say I believe with all my heart the verdicts 
were highly influence d by intimidation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And Mr. Shaw goes on, for three pages, to explain how the jury in the Reginald 
Denny beating trial was unduly influenced by a group of black activists, 
resulting in a verdict widely criticized as too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only been a few days since the last brave foray into reader mail, but 
here we go again. Forgive me if you're tired of rehashing the ballad of 
Reginald and Damian. These days, Damian Williams doesn't seem as scary as Tonya 
Harding's bodyguard. Still, it would be a shame not to acknowledge the 
thoughtful reaction to a column last week that chided Newsweek pundit George 
Will for a telling factual error. 
</P>
<P>
 Will, readers may recall, had written that the jury "decided that smashing 
Reginald Denny's skull with a brick did not constitute assault with a deadly 
weapon." This is false. In fact, the jury decided that the attack wasn't 
attempted murder, but rather mayhem -- a charge that carries twice the penalty 
of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Will cited the jury's verdict as an example of the "hysteria" that 
characterized 1993. My point was that Will, by unwittingly exaggerating the 
jury's alleged leniency, showed that the people unhappy with the Williams 
verdict and his 10-year sentence are susceptible to hysteria themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's viewpoint is a common one. He doesn't buy my suggestion that the video 
of the Denny beating, while proving Williams' guilt, raised doubts about his 
intent. Jurors took note that Williams, instead of doing his ugly dance, could 
have finished off Denny if he had wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw writes: What would possibly be the intent of someone throwing a brick as 
hard as possible from point blank range to the side of someone's head? Would a 
reasonable person not think that a brick thrown into someone's face would not 
maim or kill or seriously injure another?  
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely. And in fact, the jury found that Williams' crime was maiming -- 
the more common term for mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the evidence, Shaw attributes the verdict to "intimidation" by 
black activists, including Williams' mother, who attended the trial and 
protested loudly enough to be heard during deliberations. Again, this is a 
popular view, one shared by the activists themselves. Shaw further suggests 
that the jury was "intimidated" by the forewoman. (Although Shaw doesn't 
mention it, it is well known that the forewoman, who is also African American, 
made news by joining Williams' mother during sentencing and suggesting that 
Williams' 10-year sentence was too harsh.) 
</P>
<P>
 No court case, especially a high-profile one, occurs in a vacuum. But the 
political pressure came from both sides. Playing to the crowd, Chief Daryl F. 
Gates personally arrested Williams and Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner initially charged 
him with torture. Their zeal helped increase public expectations of a life 
sentence while elevating Williams to the status of antihero in the cause of 
blind, equal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it hard to imagine how the jury forewoman could have "intimidated" 11 
fellow jurors. People seemed to quickly forget that this forewoman, along with 
other jurors, persuaded the judge to dismiss a juror, who is black, because she 
seemed unable to comprehend her duties. This extraordinary action, heatedly 
criticized by Williams' supporters, may have averted a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate question is whether Williams' sentence of 10 years fits the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent case in Orange County makes for an interesting comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Denny beating, this was a hate crime. The primary assailant, like 
Damian Williams, was 19 years old. The victim, 56, was found nearly dead with a 
rock lodged three-quarters of an inch into his head. This man, who can no 
longer walk without assistance, was beaten simply because his attackers 
believed him to be gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Michael Raines pleaded guilty to attempted murder and two lesser 
charges. In the end, Raines was sentenced to 10 years in prison -- the same as 
Damian Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay activists had worried that the Raines plea would result in a lenient 
sentence. So did they march over this sentence? Were they outraged? 
</P>
<P>
 To the contrary, gay leaders were satisfied. They had feared a much shorter 
sentence. 
</P>

 Two other readers offered differing perspectives on Reginald Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford Holst of Sherman Oaks writes:  
</P>
<P>
 After an upsetting event, whether people seek anger or understanding says a 
great deal about them . . . . The lasting memory of the Denny case I have is. . 
. Reginald Denny reaching out to their mothers and bearing no ill will against 
anyone. Reginald Den n y should be a role model for Los Angeles. We've been 
beaten down, but we're survivors, and we're going to make our return with a bit 
of class.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mark W. Nelson of Glendale writes: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . before I embrace the new year with all my old cynicism vanquished, I 
will wait to see exactly how much another jury awards Denny in his lawsuit 
again s t the city for failing to provide him with adequate police protection 
after the King verdict came in.  
</P>
<P>
 Denny may be able to forgive Williams for his felonious assault. I would like 
to know if he is able to forgive the taxpayers of Los Angeles in the same way.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to find fault with Denny for suing a city that pays out damages for 
minor injuries that may result from poorly marked sidewalk repair. But 
according to the city attorney's office, Denny doesn't have much of a case. 
</P>
<P>
 State law and legal precedents strongly affirm that the taxpayers aren't 
culpable for the failure of government entities to provide services. In other 
words, you can sue the city if your home is burglarized -- but you can't win. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Johnny Cochran has an uphill fight. He may reap good publicity by 
representing Denny, but he'll probably make more money billing a client named 
Michael Jackson. 
</P>

<P>
 All this Denny stuff has given me a headache. Allow me to sign off with a 
letter concerning another important column -- one that described a "mooning" 
incident in Studio City.

 Lillian Kleinman of Sun Valley writes:

 This column has got to be the stupidest, most boring thing you have ever

newspaper actually pays you to write?

OJAI ACTIVISTS SMART, STUBBORN AND NO STRANGERS TO LAWSUITS; COMMUNITY: 
RESIDENTS ARE EDUCATED AND QUICK TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS. THEIR LATEST 
BATTLE IS AGAINST A 98-FOOT RADAR WEATHER TOWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a well-read, well-educated hamlet of a town that does not easily take no 
for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its residents are more likely to vote than those elsewhere in Ventura County; 
they mobilize quickly, and they don't take to those they consider a threat to 
the quality of life rustling through the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Ojai activists have derailed a would-be landfill, squelched a 
petroleum plant expansion, felled a university site, muscled into a private 
golf resort's development plans and filed numerous lawsuits to protect their 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not -- and many clearly do not -- citizen activists in the Ojai 
Valley have become a political force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very, very bright people," said attorney Mitchel B. Kahn, who 
represented the waste management firm that last year lost a bid to open a 
landfill in Weldon Canyon. "Together, they make quite a formidable group." 
</P>
<P>
 A higher percentage of Ojai residents hold college degrees and library cards 
than in Ventura County as a whole, according to federal and county statistics. 
In the last two elections, Ojai voter turnout has been four percentage points 
higher than the county as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the mystique of the mountains looming above the valley contributes to 
the unity of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's geographical," said Greg Helms of the Environmental Defense Center, a 
Santa Barbara legal advocacy firm that handles lawsuits for several groups in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live in the Ojai Valley, you're together in a kind of village," he 
said. "It's a sort of an Old America feeling about the community that lends 
itself to public participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Mention the community of Ojai in the same breath as activism to officials at 
USA Petroleum and they clam up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company officials refused to comment, apparently still smarting from a 
citizens panel that 10 years ago succeeded in thwarting a planned $100-million 
expansion at the firm's Petrochem refinery off North Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 96 acres have been up for sale ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest political battle cry was sounded just last month, days after the 
National Weather Service erected a 98-foot radar tower atop Sulphur Mountain in 
the upper Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower is one of more than 100 being constructed nationwide as part of a 
decade-long renovation project that weather service officials say will greatly 
enhance their ability to monitor thunderstorms, wind currents and other 
atmospheric conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Information gleaned from the new system -- designed to replace an aging tower 
in Los Angeles -- will be shared with federal air traffic controllers and 
military brass to help track flight paths and plan strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, "it is urgent that the Sulphur Mountain radar become operational as 
soon as possible," weather service regional Director Thomas Potter said in a 
Ventura County Superior Court declaration filed last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one told those who live along the pricey ridge that the so-called 
"black orb" was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Ojai residents awoke one crisp morning in early December in the shadow 
of what looked to them like a huge black ball nesting above a thick steel 
scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days they stood in front of a Ventura County Superior Court judge 
arguing for, and receiving, a temporary restraining order prohibiting 
completion of the weather-tracking project. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since, the government has condemned a portion of a driveway that 
leads to the site, threatened to arrest protesters and unleashed federal 
lawyers to ensure that the project is delayed no further. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a federal judge sided with the government and refused to issue a 
restraining order blocking construction of the project. A hearing for further 
review of the case, however, is scheduled Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the radar tower point to research that links higher instances of 
cancer, birth defects, leukemia and other maladies to the kind of low-level 
radiation emitted from the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a highly educated community," said David Hedman, an upper Ojai 
resident who fought the Weldon Canyon dump and is one of the plaintiffs in the 
weather station lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there is a direct causal link between health and environment," Hedman 
said. "That's probably one of the reasons we take things so seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 To hear those fighting the radiation and other eco-legal battles tell it, the 
Ojai Valley is one of the last resting places of popular rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina V. Shelley, an Ojai councilwoman who served a stint in the U.S. Marine 
Corps, calls the local activist sentiment a mix of Old West tenacity and sheer 
grit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I operate with when I'm speaking for the community," she said. 
"Don't let go. Don't even consider failing. You just have to believe the side 
you're representing is the right side, and that's the way it has to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch owner Kim Bonsall knows that doggedness from personal experience. She 
ran headlong into it last year when the Bonsall family was about to allow a 
landfill on part of its 6,500-acre spread in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire how quickly they got organized," Bonsall said. "But I don't admire 
what they said once they got organized. For any project that goes on, 
(activists) are very quick to say something negative before having all the 
facts in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonsall is not alone. Many private attorneys and local officials also have 
been forced to answer to Ojai-based environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do keep me on my toes, no doubt about that," said Richard H. Baldwin, 
director of the county Air Pollution Control District. "They confront us by 
meetings, letters, what have you. Elsewhere in the county, that's not 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 But confrontation can also be an asset, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the business view I hear constantly, but we don't hear the citizens' 
view very often," the APCD director said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) calls the Ojai Valley a model for 
effective activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often there's a long line when I'm in Ojai," said O'Connell, who occasionally 
visits each of the cities he represents to listen to citizen concerns. "They 
have an environmental consciousness I think is very healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such consciousness, however, is not always healthy for builders and 
developers. Lawyers for the firm planning to build a private golf resort on a 
sprawling hillside above Meiners Oaks still hold a grudge against the citizen 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some genuinely concerned people up there, but some of the activists 
would have us all living in tepees again," said Lindsay F. Nielson, who 
represents Farmont Corp. in a lawsuit seeking stricter conditions on the golf 
course project. "They simply believe that any form of development is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielson, a board member of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., called many of 
the activist efforts misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai does have a large number of people who are very environmentally in 
tune," he said. "But they aren't interested in what impact (a project) has on 
the economy of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a proposed university campus did not escape the purview of the ecological 
watchdogs. As soon as officials targeted the Taylor Ranch near California 33 
and the Ventura Freeway for a state university, opponents concerned about air 
quality in the Ojai Valley went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were planning for 20,000 students," said Pat Baggerly, a Meiners Oaks 
resident and member of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County that 
opposed the site. "And all that (smog) blows up this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited campus is now being planned for a lemon grove outside 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still other elements in the mix of political and environmental 
awareness that marks the Ojai Valley. Many artisans and performers seeking 
refuge from Los Angeles have made the enclave home, propagating its reputation 
for eco-activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity residents "do help draw attention from the media, and that tells 
people what's going on," said actor Larry Hagman, who owns a 30-acre spread 
atop Sulphur Mountain. "But I don't know that I've had that much impact." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Hagman and others, the fight against the mountaintop weather station 
is merely the symptom of a larger, more suspect disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are tired of being led around by the nose and lied to," Hagman 
said. "When people ask to participate in government, they have to be allowed to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "So often we're not even asked."

8 INMATES INJURED IN LATEST BRAWLS AT PITCHESS FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four fights between African American and Latino inmates broke out at the Peter 
J. Pitchess Honor Rancho late Friday and early Saturday, resulting in injuries 
to eight inmates and a weekend lock-down, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious injuries were reported in the melees, which occurred in dormitories 
in the jail's maximum security facility and involved about 100 inmates battling 
with feet and hands, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Britta Tubbs said. All 
eight inmates were treated at the jail's clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The fights were the latest in a series of brawls between black and Latino 
inmates in the jail's maximum-security section. Sheriff's officials are 
considering segregating the facility to prevent violence and have met with the 
American Civil Liberties Union, which is examining the constitutionality of 
such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them apparently have been racially motivated," Sgt. Francisco Jimenez 
said of the fights. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's incidents began about 9 p.m. Friday when fights broke out in 
two dormitories, resulting in injuries to four inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 A brawl among about 30 inmates in another dorm occurred at 4:45 a.m., injuring 
another inmate. About two hours later, a fourth dorm erupted in fighting with 
51 inmates involved. Three prisoners were injured by rubber bullets fired by 
sheriff's officials, but none seriously, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 No deputies were injured in the brawls, which are still under investigation. 
Each of the four fights was quelled in under seven minutes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 All weekend visits were canceled, and the maximum-security facility was put on 
lock-down status, which means inmates were confined to their dorms, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 9, a riot involving as many as 1,000 African American and Latino 
inmates broke out at the jail, resulting in injuries to 80 prisoners. About 50 
inmates clashed at the jail Tuesday, in what was called a continuation of the 
riot.

VOLUNTEERS PAINT SHELTER FOR WOMEN, CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 With each stroke of pale peach paint, the room around Andre Foster started to 
look more like a home. 
</P>
<P>
 And quite a home it will be when it opens in early March: the privately funded 
House of Hope will be the largest complex of its kind in the nation for 
homeless and abused women and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance Saturday to help paint the 22-room house brought extra meaning for 
Foster, one of about 35 homeless men from the Orange County Rescue Mission's 
shelter in Santa Ana helping with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good just to be out doing something," said Foster, 39, who was laid 
off from his job in a molding company last year. "It's definitely hard out 
there, especially if you have children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is basically therapeutic, a lot of fun and a chance to help out," he 
said, running a long-handled paint roller up and down the wall of a 
second-story bedroom. "When I needed the help, it was there. I'm extending that 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people, including a church youth group from Mission Viejo, spent the 
day painting the 12,000-square-foot, wood-shingled center in Old Towne Orange. 
The home will be operated by the Rescue Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homeless men who turned out to help Saturday will receive extra 
nights at the mission's Santa Ana shelter in exchange for their efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers said they were glad to help. 
</P>
<P>
 'It's nice to help out," said Doug Woolston, 23. "This is a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 60 gallons of paint donated by the Old Quaker Paint Co. of Santa Ana went 
quickly as the volunteers painted the expansive house, with its 133 doors and 
600 electrical outlets. Another 120 gallons of paint were expected to arrive 
this week to help volunteers finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the paint, almost everything else at the house has been donated by local 
subcontractors and building suppliers. About two-thirds of the $3-million 
outlay for the house came from craftsmen and builders working through HomeAid, 
the nonprofit organization of the Orange County chapter of the Building 
Industry Assn. The remaining third of the funding came through 20,000 private 
donations, said Jim Palmer, executive director of the Rescue Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 When complete, the house will provide shelter, health care, child care and 
academic and vocational classes to 20 women and 25 children for up to 18 
months, giving the women time to learn job skills and to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Womack, who helps coordinate transient services for the mission, said it 
was easy finding volunteers for the painting job among those staying at the 
Santa Ana homeless shelter. "They want to work, they want to be productive," 
Womack said. "They believe in this thing. They know the need for the House of 
Hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, officials say there is a great need for the House of Hope. Single 
parents, mostly mothers, are the fastest growing segment of Orange County's 
estimated 10,000 to 12,000 homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building and the programs that are going to be involved are going to put 
a big dent in that," said Virgil Garduque , a mission employee who was once 
homeless himself. "This is going to be home."

FAMILY OF BARTENDER KILLED IN EXPLOSION FILE 2ND SUIT; COURTS: THE NEWPORT 
BEACH RESTAURANT'S INSURANCE ADJUSTERS ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE DESTROYED OR LOST 
CRUCIAL EVIDENCE LINKED THE FATAL HOT WATER TANK EXPLOSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a bartender killed in an explosion last year at a popular 
Southwestern-style restaurant in Newport Beach have filed a second lawsuit, 
alleging the restaurant's insurance adjusters lost or destroyed crucial 
evidence from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio De Santiago, 39, was preparing for brunch at the El Torito Grill at 
Fashion Island on Aug. 1 when a hot water storage tank exploded, demolishing a 
corner of the restaurant. De Santiago was killed and five others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for De Santiago's estranged wife, Maria Luisa Fernandez De Santiago, 
and his two children, Mireya and Eloisa, filed a wrongful-death suit against 
the makers of the hot water equipment in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Their latest suit, filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, 
is against El Torito Restaurants Inc.; the company's insurance adjusters Toplis 
& Harding Inc.; and Orange County-based investigator William F. Schultheis. The 
family's lawyer said insurance adjusters stored several pieces of equipment 
from the explosion, but now cannot produce the items. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have deprived us of the opportunity to prove there was a defect that 
caused the explosion," said attorney William M. Paoli, who represents the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Toplis and Harding Inc. could not be reached for comment 
Friday, and a lawyer for El Torito said she could not comment on the case 
because she had not seen the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, Newport Beach Deputy Fire Marshal Jim Upton said that after 
the blast he handed over various pieces including gauges, tubes and a "pilot 
module" to Schultheis, under the agreement that they were to be made available 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Paoli said the pilot module was one of the critical pieces, because it 
controlled how hot the water in the system could become. That piece and several 
others were lost or destroyed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, California state safety officials blamed El Torito for the 
explosion and fined the company $5,000, saying the restaurant's water storage 
tank blew up because a pressure valve was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The valve would have relieved pressure and kept it from building in the tank 
that eventually exploded, said investigators from the California Occupational 
Safety Hazard Administration. The tank was connected to a water heater in a 
storage room. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the bartender's family sued Debin Enterprises Inc., the equipment 
vendor; Rheem Manufacturing Co. and Raypak Inc., a Rheem subsidiary, the 
equipment manufacturers; and Honeywell Inc., makers of some controls on the 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 George W. Flynn, Minneapolis-based lawyer for Honeywell, said he is trying to 
sort through the evidence that remains. "Either negligently, or through a bad 
job, the stuff just got lost,' Flynn said.

RAMS' THREAT TO LEAVE WORRIES ANAHEIM MERCHANTS; SPORTS: WHILE THE DEPARTURE IS 
NOT EXPECTED TO DESTROY BUSINESSES OUTRIGHT, GAMES GENERATED STEADY INCOME. 
OTHERS ARE BUOYED BY THE RECENT OPENING OF ANAHEIM ARENA, HOME TO THE MIGHTY 
DUCKS.

<P>
 A refrain heard around town lately: "Who cares if the Rams leave?" 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, several business owners near Anaheim Stadium say that they do. 
</P>
<P>
 If the National Football League team makes an end run to Baltimore or 
elsewhere in 1995, as it is threatening to do, area restaurants, bars, hotels 
and ticket agencies stand to lose big money. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Rams game generates several hundred to several thousand dollars of added 
revenue for each of these businesses. And while merchants say the Rams' absence 
wouldn't be enough to force anyone out of business, money is money and no one 
likes to give it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When their attendance is poor, we do poorly, so if they leave altogether, 
there goes our attendance," said John Marquez, manager of the nearby Catch 
sports bar. 
</P>
<P>
 He has worked at stadium-area restaurants for the last 10 years and says the 
Rams are good for business, drawing an estimated 600 extra customers every time 
they play at home. The die-hards show up at 9 a.m. on game day for brunch and 
drinks, park their cars in the bar parking lot, then return for another round 
of festivities after the game, Marquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a few dates, but those dates make a big difference in our bottom 
line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in the Rams debate grew higher recently when the team announced 
that it plans to give the city of Anaheim formal notice in May that it may 
leave Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has asked the local Chamber of Commerce to contact area business 
people who may be able to help persuade the team to stay. But restaurant and 
business owners near the stadium said they are still uncertain what role if any 
they may be able to play in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Harris, manager of the nearby 71-room Angels Inn, said the Rams provide 
him with a guaranteed early afternoon sellout eight to 10 nights a year. That 
allows him to charge $5 to $10 more that day for all of his rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to stay up until 2 a.m., taking whatever I can get from the 
people coming out of the bars," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the recent opening of the nearby Anaheim Arena, home to the Mighty 
Ducks hockey team and other events, means he will still make more money in the 
future than he has before. "The arena is going to have an effect 200 nights a 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Miller, owner of the Ticket Outlet, a brokerage located next to the 
stadium, said Rams ticket sales have plummeted as their losses have mounted.  
</P>
<P>
 "But everybody seems to be forgetting the good years when the team was winning 
and drawing 60,000 people," Miller said. "Things were great then. And if the 
team stays, they will be great when the team starts winning again." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Hynes, spokesman for the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, said the hotel has 
just begun developing ties to visiting NFL teams, with the Detroit Lions and 
the Washington Redskins staying there this past season. In addition, several 
visiting booster clubs have stayed at the Hilton for years, and the Rams 
cheerleaders have been a fixture at the hotel bar's Monday Night Football 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just starting into the sports teams market, and our relationship with 
football was something we were hoping to develop in the future," Hynes said. 
"And the cheerleaders have been an attraction for the bar. . . . You always 
feel sad when somebody in the neighborhood leaves, but I'm sure we'll find 
somebody just as nice to take their place."

FULLERTON SUES ANAHEIM, CITING AGGRAVATION FROM REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT; COURTS: 
CLAIM ALLEGES NEIGHBOR'S PLANS WOULD CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH TRAFFIC, POLLUTION AND 
INCREASE NEED FOR SERVICES. BUT FULLERTON OFFICIAL 'OPTIMISTIC' OF REACHING 
AMICABLE SETTLEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 The city of Fullerton has sued Anaheim over an 895-acre redevelopment project 
that Fullerton officials contend adversely affects their city's traffic, 
pollution, sewer systems and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lawsuit, which was filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court, 
Fullerton City Manager James L. Armstrong said he was "optimistic" that an 
out-of-court settlement will be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reached an agreement in concept with Anaheim and are confident 
documentation will be complete within the next 30 days," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the suit was filed to protect Fullerton's legal rights should the 
tentative agreement fall through. Because the project was approved 30 days ago, 
Friday was the statutory deadline to file a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton officials say they are concerned that Anaheim might build a large 
commercial center along the border of the two cities. Fullerton officials said 
such a center would compete with Fullerton businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anaheim approved the project, Barry Eaton, Fullerton's chief planner, 
called it "a classic case of one city using redevelopment to steal the 
commercial base from another city." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim officials said Fullerton's concerns are unfounded because the city 
plans to develop the area for industrial use, not commercial. Nonetheless, city 
officials say they could rezone the property in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, neither Fullerton nor Anaheim officials would discuss the terms of 
the tentative settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim City Council approved the redevelopment project Dec. 14. and 
council members said at that time that they hoped the project would help 
revitalize two of the city's most run-down areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many structures in the redevelopment area have been targets of graffiti and 
other vandalism. As many as 34% of the buildings are "obsolete" and 90% of the 
properties are in violation of one or more city codes, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which is expected to span 30 years, consists of the North Central 
Industrial Area and the Anaheim Boulevard Commercial/Industrial area. The north 
section is bordered by Fullerton on the north and La Palma Avenue to the south. 
It reaches from Harbor Boulevard and Lemon Street on the west to East Street on 
the east.  
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Boulevard redevelopment area is bounded by Broadway on the north 
and Orangewood Avenue on the south.

SPEAKERS URGE INITIATIVES TO GIVE SCHOOLS LOCAL CONTROL; EDUCATION: FORUM 
BRINGS TOGETHER REFORMERS WHO WANT DECISIONS MADE ON CAMPUS, BUT PANELISTS SAY 
AUSTERE STATE BUDGETS WILL BE A HURDLE TO CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than a third of Los Angeles schools are involved in some kind of 
educational restructuring, and reformers at a Saturday symposium in Woodland 
Hills called for accelerating the movement toward local control to harness the 
energies of parents and staff and improve the learning process. 
</P>
<P>
 Local-control initiatives embraced by a growing number of schools in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District are helping the campuses to "take control over 
their destiny," and will transform the behemoth district from a "command and 
control kind of structure to a service organization," said Robert Wycoff, 
president of LEARN (Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now). 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to put "the decision making and the budget authority where the 
kids are," Wycoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 125 people at a forum sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Los 
Angeles heard Wycoff and other panelists describe the structure and goals of 
several school reform programs aimed at improving student achievement in the 
district's 624 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But while voicing high hopes for the reform movement, panelists acknowledged 
the barriers to success in a state that in 15 years has plummeted from the top 
to near the bottom in per-pupil spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the whole reform effort requires a dollar amount, and it's just not 
happening," said Joe Rao, the district's coordinator of reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a confusing array of titles and acronyms, the restructuring programs 
all aim to increase authority of school principals, teachers and parents over 
curriculum, staffing and budgets. The initiatives -- some launched for the 
first time this semester -- differ mainly in the degree of freedom they provide 
from state education and school district controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most important are "school-based management," in place at 92 
schools; LEARN, expected to spread rapidly from the current 34 campuses, and 
the charter schools, of which there are 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining the autonomy of the charter schools, Peggy Funkhouser, president 
of the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a reform group, told of a recent 
conversation with Yvonne Chan, principal of the Vaughn Next Century Learning 
Center in San Fernando -- a charter school that until recently was called the 
Vaughn Street Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a call one day from Yvonne, asking for an investment counselor for her 
(school's) monies. Now, that's different," Funkhouser said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rao, the recent shift away from the district's "one size fits 
all" approach has been accompanied by a "tremendous downsizing -- or 
right-sizing, we like to say -- of the downtown offices." 
</P>
<P>
 Although panelists said austere state budgets for public education are a 
barrier to reform, Wycoff said the public is "willing to give more money if the 
system improves itself." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to demonstrate that this is a new day, and we are going to reform our 
schools," Wycoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of Women Voters sponsored the forum as part of a research project 
on school restructuring alternatives. The league, which plans to become more 
involved in the school reform debate, will take stands based on the study, said 
Estelle Lit of Northridge, co-chairwoman of the league's education committee. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein, who served as moderator, later said the 
forum was "invigorating," and brought together for the first time "all the 
different reform movements in the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, said Korenstein, "we all seem to be going in the same direction -- 
which is to shore up public education and . . . make public education shine."

ELECTIONS / SIMI VALLEY CITY COUNCIL; CONTENDERS MEASURING SUPPORT FOR FALL 
CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 While candidates for June's state and county elections are busy raising 
dollars and grabbing headlines, at least half a dozen contenders for the Simi 
Valley City Council are quietly gauging support for the local race, still 10 
months away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearing up to compete in November for the seats held by Councilwomen Judy 
Mikels and Sandi Webb, the potential challengers are shaping platforms on 
issues ranging from trash to development of a long-sought regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that prides itself on tranquillity, most of the contenders praised 
the current council, saying they plan no major departures from its course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city is well-run and I'd like to continue that," said Larry B. 
Dennert, who owns a local garage door business. "It just helps to have some new 
blood every once in awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennert, 45, who lost a 1992 council bid, said his decision whether to run in 
November may depend on the impact that June's countywide elections have on city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Barbara Williamson, 48, in the middle of a four-year term, has 
said she might seek Supervisor Vicky Howard's seat. If Williamson decides to 
run and is elected to the Board of Supervisors, her council seat would be up 
for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Mayor Greg Stratton, 47, whose third term ends in November, has said he 
will announce later this month whether he plans to run for county auditor 
against incumbent Thomas Mahon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stratton's election to county office would open up the mayor's 
position, only one potential candidate, Councilman Bill Davis, has said he 
would seek the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 66, a retired electronic repair shop owner who has served on the 
council for seven years, said he will run for mayor only if Stratton does not 
seek reelection for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Larkin, chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central Committee, said 
background and political experience will be as important as the issues in the 
November council race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there are any issues that are really going to jump out," Larkin 
said. "Barring some scandal in the next 10 months, it's going to come down to 
strong candidates with solid backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Dennert, who is president of the Simi Valley Athletic Assn., 
potential council candidates include two board members of the Rancho Simi 
Recreation and Park District, Bonnie Carpenter, librarian for the city's school 
district, and Debi Schultze, 37, a mortgage loan processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Also pondering runs are Chamber of Commerce President Michael S. McCaffrey, 
34, who runs an insurance and investment business, insurance salesman Dean 
Kunicki, and attorney Tim Hodge, 37, a member of Citizens for a Safe and Scenic 
Simi Valley, which has criticized city developments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Webb, 44, said she intends to seek reelection and will focus her 
campaign on luring a regional mall and building support for a new police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, 48, said she also will seek reelection if her husband, whose company 
has moved to Tucson, finds another job in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Challengers might have a hard time persuading voters to oust Mikels and Webb 
if voter sentiment from the 1992 elections carries over to November. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, voters cast more ballots than in any other city election in Simi 
Valley history, retaining incumbents Stratton and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 And voters chose Williamson, an outspoken booster of the city and its 
policies, from a field of 12 newcomers to fill an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big issue in 1992 was how badly the city was doing, but the public said, 
'No, they're doing a good job,' " Stratton said. "Outsiders who want to get in 
have to figure out if somebody is doing something wrong, and then the burden is 
on them to prove it to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possible challengers, Hodge, who lost a council bid in 1992, is the 
most critical of the current council. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodge has questioned the way the city spends its Redevelopment Agency funds. 
Instead of offering cash incentives to lure large discount stores such as 
Costco, Hodge said the city should spread the money around, shifting a large 
chunk of it to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized the city's plan to subsidize the planned Cultural Arts 
Center by providing $100,000 a year. Hodge said the center should be funded 
with private dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a theme to my concerns, it's that I think government should be 
brought back to the basics, providing roads, a police force and schools," Hodge 
said. "After the needs are met, then we can take a look at the wants." 
</P>
<P>
 While more supportive of the current council, Schultze said she would like to 
see the city spend more of its resources on low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real need out there," Schultze said. "I think we could do better 
to bring in developers who might be interested in building affordable housing 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze also said she would like to get the city more actively involved in 
trash issues by seeking creative ways to dispose of trash.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous that we've been able to put men on the moon but we're still 
filling beautiful canyons with trash," Schultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunicki, 49, who serves on the city's Planning Commission, said he will use 
his planning experience to help lure developers to the city and the hillside 
where the city is hoping to build a mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always need to work on expanding the local business community with clean, 
non-polluting industry," Kunicki said. "It brings in dollars and cuts down on 
the commute." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter and McCaffrey said they are still deciding which issues they would 
focus on if they decide to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm still trying to figure out if I would have enough time to do a 
good job," McCaffrey said. "It's a major commitment for someone who has a 
family and a job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, who works full time as a computer software engineer and spends more 
than 40 hours a week on council business, cautioned potential candidates not to 
underestimate the amount of time that serving on the council involves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody who's never seen the three attachments and thousand pages of history 
and endless (environmental impact reports) is in for a big surprise," Stratton 
said. "There's tremendous piles of stuff, and that's before you've even set 
foot in the community."

WOMAN DROWNS TRYING TO RESCUE SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old mother drowned Saturday in Jackson Lake while trying to rescue 
her son who had fallen through the ice, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old boy, whose name was not released, was playing on the edge of 
the ice-covered lake with his mother about 1 p.m. when he fell through the ice, 
said Sgt. Gil Arce of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother went to help along with two other family members, and they also 
fell through," Arce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystanders were able to use a makeshift rope to rescue everyone but the 
mother, whose body was retrieved by a sheriff's dive team, Arce said. The boy 
was taken to San Bernardino Hospital, where he was being treated for mild 
hypothermia, Arce said.

DUPED CLIENTS WILL GET MOST OF THEIR MONEY BACK; ESCROW: HOME BUYERS AND 
SELLERS ALLEGEDLY EMBEZZLED BY FIRM'S OWNERS WILL RECEIVE 96% OF THEIR 
DEPOSITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An estimated 500 home buyers and sellers involved with Country Oaks Escrow 
Inc. when the firm was audited and closed in June are expected to eventually 
receive about 96% of the $2.75 million state investigators say was embezzled by 
the company's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the agency responsible for covering the losses is unsure exactly when 
the final payments will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators last week said they have accounted for all but $200,000 of the 
money believed to have been diverted from the Valencia company's $4.5 million 
in trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Corporations shut down Country Oaks Escrow on 
June 4 following a routine audit that uncovered shortages in several trust 
accounts holding deposits for real estate transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Oaks Escrow was California's third-largest escrow firm, with 
additional offices in Lancaster, Palmdale and Arcadia. About 500 clients had 
deposited money with the business at the time of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrow Escrow Co. of Santa Ana purchased the accounts following the Valencia 
firm's closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Escrow Agents' Fidelity Corp., the nonprofit agency that 
insures deposits for licensed escrow companies, say they will reimburse any 
funds shown to be fraudulently diverted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The EAFC comes into play when there has been an embezzlement," said Stuart 
Zanville, public relations counsel for the company. "The EAFC is committed to 
paying 100% of the acceptable claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for repayments are pending from investigators, although it is unclear 
when the reimbursements will be approved by the insuring agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way of knowing how long it will take to distribute the funds," 
Zanville said. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Oaks Escrow clients received about 75% of the missing funds -- $2.1 
million -- in September, following a preliminary review of the financial 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was felt it would be more desirable to disburse money as quickly as 
possible on all accepted claims rather than wait for the entire investigation 
to be completed, which would have held up payment," said Bernie Selz, chairman 
of Escrow Agents' Fidelity Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the first proof of loss was filed, it was understood it was an interim 
payment," Zanville said. "It was done at that time to expedite the payment as 
quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corporations has alleged in a lawsuit that owners Harold and 
Kathy Wiener embezzled the funds to pay for personal expenses and company 
costs.  
</P>
<P>
 But in a separate lawsuit, the Wieners, without acknowledging any wrongdoing, 
have alleged that Harold Wiener was affected by a combination of medications 
prescribed to him following heart surgery.

SUICIDE VICTIM'S BODY FOUND OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a 26-year-old man was found floating just offshore Saturday, about 
a dozen blocks north of the city pier, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Harish Gupta of Irvine was discovered by a group of surfers when 
it floated near the shore at 17th Street about 2:45 p.m., Lt. Jeff Cope said. 
Gupta had been reported missing Jan. 7, when a suicide note was found in a 
jacket left in his car, parked near the pier.

 "The man was dead and appeared to have been that way for several days," Cope 
said.

<P>
 Authorities said there no evidence of foul play in the man's death, which was 
being treated as a suicide.

HISTORY BRANCHES OUT WITH PLAN FOR CONEJO TREES; LANDMARKS: EFFORT SEEKS TO 
PUBLICIZE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT SPECIMENS, SUCH AS NEWBURY PARK'S 300-YEAR-OLD 
SYCAMORE.

<P>
 For a tree, the Hunt olive has a pretty bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local history buffs believe the 200-year-old tree at Lynn Road and 
Hillcrest Drive once served as a gallows, with a hangman's noose dangling from 
its broad boughs. Others believe it marks the spot where a mythical Mr. Hunt 
took a fatal tumble off his horse as he galloped across the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the truth, Bryan Badgett thinks people should know that the Hunt 
olive has a history much, much older than the city of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking up a concept that former city Arts Commissioner Cate Brown proposed 
several years ago, Badgett is launching a program called Designation of 
Patriarch Trees. The goal is to identify, map and publicize the Conejo Valley's 
most magnificent trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks has been one of the leaders in protecting oak trees, but I want 
to take it one step further," said Badgett, a landscape architect and city arts 
commissioner. "There are a lot of other beautiful trees here worthy of 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there's the 300-year-old sycamore on the grounds of Newbury 
Park's Stagecoach Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated a historical landmark, the tree is famous for one knobby branch 
that points directly to a brook. Legend has it that when Native Americans 
stumbled across the stream centuries ago, they bent the tree's bough into a 
right angle to signal the presence of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few miles from the Stagecoach Inn, another group of sycamores has 
earned its place in local lore. 
</P>
<P>
 To preserve the sycamores, which line Hillcrest Drive between Lynn and Ventu 
Park roads, the Thousand Oaks City Council had to approve an expensive 
engineering trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of paving over the sycamores' extensive roots -- which might have 
killed the centuries-old trees -- the city's Public Works Department agreed to 
build Hillcrest Drive about 30 feet above ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 Elevating the road left the trees unscathed. And the engineering feat has held 
up over time -- the sycamores are thriving, drawing nutrients from an aquifer 
three stories below the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hunt olive tree wasn't so lucky. Circuit City's builder could not 
construct the electronics store around the huge tree, so crews excavated its 
massive bulk and moved it to the corner of the property. The transplanting, 
conducted with city approval, was a success and the olive tree is now 
flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other trees have also earned special treatment from Thousand Oaks' Public 
Works Department. Hodencamp Road swerves suddenly between Hillcrest Drive and 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard, for instance, simply to save a stately oak tree that 
now stands in the median. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some truly significant trees here," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Badgett and Brown agree wholeheartedly. And they want to spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "All too often our eyes stay at eye level when we're walking," Brown said. "We 
never look at the trees overhead. This program would help people be aware of 
some of the beautiful trees we have here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she named the program Designation of Patriarch Trees, Brown said she 
won't insist that the trees be identified as father figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patriarch, matriarch, call them whatever you want," she said. "Just save 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Once they have identified the most important specimens, Brown and Badgett hope 
to put up plaques describing each tree's history. They would also like to print 
a brochure outlining walking tours of Thousand Oaks' best-looking trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "School kids can learn that there is age, there is history to this city," 
Badgett said. "A lot of kids think trees are always here. We can tell them, 
'Hey, these trees have historical value, so let's keep them around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Designation of Patriarch Trees project would supplement efforts by the 
Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board, which is responsible for identifying 
the region's most historically significant trees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three decades, the board has designated only 10 trees as 
historical landmarks, including the Hunt olive, the Stagecoach Inn sycamore 
and, most recently, the C Street palms in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trees have to have some age and historical significance for us to recognize 
them," said Madeline Miedema, chairwoman of the Cultural Heritage Board. "It 
seems to me that the (Thousand Oaks) program is a worthy project because it 
could help preserve more of the beautiful trees."

SLAIN DETECTIVE IS NAMED HONORARY MARSHAL OF ST. PATRICK'S PARADE

<P>
 Oxnard Police Detective Jim O'Brien, killed in a shootout with slain 
mass-murderer Alan Winterbourne, has been named honorary grand marshal of the 
sixth annual Ventura St. Patrick's Day Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade organizers announced the decision at their annual Green Pig Party 
fund-raiser Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people might not feel too good about it, but everyone who knew Jim 
knows he would have loved it," said Nan Drake, who serves on a committee 
putting the parade together. "This fits him like a glove." 
</P>
<P>
 Before making their announcement, organizers approached the family to ask what 
they thought of the idea, Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked his brother and he said Jim loved parades," she said. O'Brien was 
proud of his Irish heritage and participated in Irish folk dancing with his 
family, according to Drake. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the parade will be "Our Fighting Irish Heroes" and is intended to 
also honor all police officers. Organizers expect to have about 100 floats. The 
O'Brien family and members of the Oxnard Police Department will lead the 
parade, Drake said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you think it's going to be a somber event, you don't know the Irish," said 
Ventura City Council Member Jim Monahan, who heads the committee. "The Irish 
never have somber occasions. They always honor their dead in such ways."

2 INJURED IN THOUSAND OAKS GANG DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two men were injured in a fight that erupted when members of one gang tried to 
crash a rival gang's party, a Ventura County Sheriff's Department spokesman 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Adkins, 21, of Thousand Oaks was stabbed twice and severely wounded late 
Friday when the car in which he was riding was attacked on the 500 block of 
Oaktree Lane by 15 to 20 gang members attending a party there, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adkins underwent emergency surgery at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in 
Thousand Oaks, and was listed in fair condition Saturday, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. Two other people in Adkins' car reportedly ran from the scene 
as the car was pounded with rocks and clubs. They escaped without injury, a 
Sheriff's Department report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other vehicles accompanying Adkins' car sped from the scene when his 
car was attacked, the spokesman said. Shots were fired from one of the 
vehicles, and another one of the cars hit 19-year-old Lance Banglos, a 
spokesman said. Banglos was treated at the hospital and released, a spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the injured pair were from rival gangs, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle involved in the hit-and-run was abandoned a short distance from 
the scene, according to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after the incident, a man identified by witnesses as the driver of 
the car telephoned the East Valley Sheriff's Station to turn himself in, a 
sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Jones, 19, of Thousand Oaks was arrested at Los Angeles International 
Airport and was booked at the East Valley Jail on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon. His bail was set at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No other arrests have been made in the incident, which is still under 
investigation.

LET THE D.A. INVESTIGATE DEATH OF DEPUTY; * THERE'S NO REASON STATE SHOULD TAKE 
OVER INQUIRY INTO DARRYN ROBINS' KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no reason to question the independence of the Orange County district 
attorney's office in investigating the death of a deputy sheriff who 
authorities say was shot by another deputy on Christmas Day. Let Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi do his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates has come under criticism from community groups, notably a 
coalition of black leaders, following the tragic death of Deputy Darryn Leroy 
Robins, an African American who, authorities say, was shot by training officer 
Brian Scanlan, a deputy who is white, during an informal training exercise in a 
parking lot behind a Lake Forest movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, apparently seeking to cover his flank, wrote to state Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren seeking Lungren's involvement in the case on the ground that the "daily 
working relationship" of the Sheriff's Department with the county district 
attorney had prompted some "mistrust" in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the request, a spokesman for Lungren stated the obvious: There is 
no ground for state participation at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the state's decision not to intervene, black leaders have called 
for a federal investigation into possible civil-rights violations in the 
shooting. The U.S. attorney's office has said they would look at the request 
and determine whether a federal investigation was warranted. That's fine, but 
there should be no reason on the face of it to presume at this point in the 
investigation that the district attorney cannot do the job adequately. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates recently acknowledged that the shooting probably involved a violation of 
departmental policy barring the use of loaded firearms during training 
exercises. His belated public comments on the incident certainly were welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 However, questions remain about a needless shooting in a very public place. 
Any concern about a racial component can be addressed properly within the 
purview of the larger inquiry. And while it is useful that the Orange County 
Human Relations Commission is monitoring the case, the district attorney is the 
right person to look into all the pertinent aspects of this inquiry.

INCLUDE ADULTS IN BIKE-HELMET LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am a high school student who has just heard of the new laws starting this 
year. Some of these, as you are probably aware, include: the bike helmet law; 
the teen-age DUIs; the no-smoking-in-a-public-building law and also the 
seat-belt-in-the-back-of-trucks law. 
</P>
<P>
 I am in total agreement with all the new laws I listed, however, I do have a 
concern about the bike-helmet law. 
</P>
<P>
 The law states that all kids under the age of 18 should be wearing a helmet 
when riding a bicycle. My only question is why does the age limit stop at 18? 
</P>
<P>
 This law is for the safety of the bicycler. Well, can't people over 18 be 
unsafe? 
</P>
<P>
 I want to know what it would do to just make sure everyone is wearing helmets. 
The law may very well benefit some irresponsible adults as well as children. 
Motorcyclists, no matter what age, have to wear a helmet. Even though I know 
motorcycles are usually more dangerous than bikes, both vehicles can kill when 
(the rider is) not wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 I just do not understand why the bike helmet law was not made for adults as 
well as kids to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad, though, the law was made. I sure hope this law will bring down the 
percentage of head injuries resulting from bicycle accidents.

FOREMAN DIDN'T SPEAK FOR ALL JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the interest of moderating the tone of the article "Brothers Win $105,000 
in 0.C. Police Suit" (Jan. 7); the article could have made it more evident that 
the jury foreman, who seemed to feel that this case was based on race, was 
expressing his personal opinion in using the terms "outrageous" and "Gestapo 
tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the jury felt that the officers involved acted without malice 
or malicious intent but erred in the judgment of a situation.Race was not seen 
to be an issue. It took some time to moderate the (unseemly) amounts that a few 
of the jurors suggested. Fortunately, the jury system is made up of "12 good 
men (and women)" and cooler heads prevailed.

PROTECTING SANTA ANA NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am an active member of the Washington Square Neighborhood Assn. in Santa 
Ana. I strongly object to the negative tone toward neighborhood associations 
that was expressed in The Times Column One article, "Digging In to Defend Their 
Turf," Dec. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has lived in Santa Ana for the past 10 years can see the results of 
inept, apathetic or downright greedy city officials and developers. In many 
cases new developments in our city have turned out to be overcrowded 
high-density housing and strip malls. Which in turn created caldrons of drug 
dealing, prostitution, traffic congestion and contributed to blight in the 
surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the pursuits of neighborhood associations are at times 
misguided and trite, but most of the time we find ourselves fighting the good 
fight against bona fide threats to the sanctity of our neighborhoods. By virtue 
of grass-roots efforts such as designing traffic mitigation plans and opposing 
questionable development in or near our neighborhood, we have managed to 
salvage what is left of a quality life in our city. 
</P>
<P>
 These actions do indeed partially close the neighborhood and lend to the 
perception of protectionism. If you take a closer look at the concerns of most 
neighborhoods, you may see that it is not only the value of our homes, but also 
the safety and character of our neighborhoods that we wish to protect.

DITCHING DOGMA TO LIMIT INTOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Jeffrey Michael Raines' statement to the court, prior to his sentencing for 
beating Loc Minh Truong nearly to death because he thought Truong was gay, is a 
perfect example of one major contradiction expressed in the Catholic and 
fundamentalist Christian religious teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Raines stated that the Catholic Church taught him to love all those around him 
and "that's how I'm going to be the rest of my life."This is indeed a great 
challenge to the faithful whose religious leaders preach the "love one another" 
message of Christ and in the next breath condemn homosexuals as deviants 
deserving of God's wrath and ours as well. They are taught to "love the 
'sinner' and hate the 'sin.' " This is an impossible task (even forgiving for a 
moment the fact that this message requires mere mortals to pass judgment on one 
another), because sexual orientation cannot truly be altered, nor can those who 
try to repress their nature live fulfilling and healthy lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to ditch the dogma and teach people to accept the full spectrum of 
human reality and apply Christ's message to every living creature, regardless 
of sexual orientation, religion, race or gender. This will go a long way toward 
eliminating intolerance and hate crimes. I won't say that Raines was a victim 
of his religious education, but he sure learned this lesson the hard way.

NO EXCUSE FOR LETHARGY: REOPEN PCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It's a given that the wheels of politics and progress move slowly, unless of 
course you live in south Orange County, where they don't move at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point, that closed stretch of Pacific Coast Highway that remains 
buried in dirt from last winter's mudslide.Any child that has ever played with 
a Tonka truck knows that with a dump truck, some initiative, and perhaps a 
little common sense, this problem on PCH could be resolved in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 What are we waiting for -- the one-year anniversary of its closure? Traffic 
and businesses are being adversely impacted! 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any real excuse for this lethargy? I say, no, none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if I am not alone in this thought and there are others like me out there, 
perhaps jointly we can light a fire under all this bureaucratic gas and get 
done what should have been done last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, maybe a volunteer from the railroad will step forward and show 
these elected salted snails how to move dirt from Point A to Point B. 
</P>
<P>
 This slide didn't hinder the train system more than a day, and they move far 
less people through this area than those who rely on PCH. 
</P>
<P>
 This road should be open to motorists, joggers, bicyclists, and yes, even the 
morons we put in office to see that these things get done.

HIGH SCHOOL GAY-SUPPORT CLUB APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial ("Gay Students' Rights Must Be Affirmed," Jan.3) that 
advocates allowing a homosexual club to meet at Fountain Valley High School is 
looking at the situation incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue here is that the public schools should not allow an organization to 
meet that actively advocates illegal behavior. California Penal Code makes 
sexual intercourse among minors illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the Los Angeles Times endorse a campus club that affirmed marijuana use? 
How about a Spur Posse club that affirms male sexual conquests over young 
women? 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress passed the Equal Access Act, in no way did they imagine that it 
would be used to allow clubs that advocate illegal activity to meet on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools should be teaching the 3 Rs, not promoting homosexuality.

 * On your article "O.C. School's Gay-Support Group Wins OK" (Jan 12), let's 
reflect on the real issue. Something funny happened on the way to the school 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect those boasting such passion to attend the hearing (and those loudly 
protesting at the Fountain Valley High School) didn't notice as they marched 
over the unaddressed concerns like drugs, gangs, failing grades and promoting 
hatred against ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Are all school board meetings met with such passion and interest? I think not. 
Regular attendance at these meetings is as limited as some people's concerns 
for one other. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue is building academic excellence in our schools. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be achieved if the protagonists were equally as captivated with 
one's schooling as with their sexuality.

only one who read that as "Fag Basher."

can no longer hide behind the flag.

TIME TO BITE BULLET ON SPECIAL DISTRICTS; * OFFICIALS SHOULD ABOLISH, MERGE 
UNNECESSARY GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's special districts, the handlers of such matters as water and 
sewage services, park and cemetery maintenance, are receiving deserved scrutiny 
again. The county has too many of them, as new studies likely will reaffirm. 
But then will come the tough, but essential part: abolishing or merging 
fiefdoms ruled by politicians reluctant to abolish their own jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors this month approved a $37,600 contract for the Orange 
County Grand Jury to hire an accounting firm to study possible benefits of 
merging five agencies that provide water to Orange County. Many of the agencies 
are intermediaries, buying the water and then passing it on to cities or to 
other water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is expected to coordinate its study with a similar but separate 
inquiry being conducted by the Local Agency Formation Commission. That's a 
sensible approach. Too many special districts seem to duplicate services; 
investigators should not also overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 LAFCO has begun its review of special districts by looking at Dana Point. 
After being run by the Board of Supervisors as an unincorporated community, 
Dana Point became a city in 1989. Yet it still has seven districts dealing with 
water and sewage, plus other districts that oversee things like community 
services. Add them up and you wind up with 52 elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, before the county grew to include 31 cities, special districts were 
considered good ways to provide specific services to a community without 
elected mayors and councils. Locally elected districts could provide local 
knowledge and monitor how the water was distributed or the cemetery maintained. 
But cityhood has removed the reason for the existence of many districts; the 
directors, enjoying the stipends they receive for meetings and the limelight 
and power of elected office, refuse to vote an end to districts' existence. 
</P>
<P>
 There are indications that at least some directors of special districts 
realize they are not essential and are willing to merge with other agencies. 
One reason is that special districts that receive some funds from property 
taxes, as many do, are seeing that revenue source cut as the state takes more 
property taxes for itself. That sort of financial strain was one reason cited 
when the Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District, whose territory was the 
same as the Dana Point boundaries, wisely let the city take it over in 
November. More such reasonableness is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 A perennial problem is voter unawareness of special districts. In too many 
cases, there are not even enough candidates for directorships. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of apathy and lack of oversight increases the chances that something 
will go wrong, as the county grand jury warned in 1982 and again in 1988. Last 
year, disclosures of the free-spending ways of executives of the Santa 
Margarita Water District prompted investigations by the FBI and the county 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as the 1970s, the county chapter of the League of Women Voters 
said the districts needed "increased accountability, responsiveness and public 
visibility." Two decades later, that's still a good prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a reduction in the number of special districts that should be the 
goal. By LAFCO's count, Orange County has more than 80 special districts, and 
more than 30 of those are independent of county or city control. That's too 
many. The grand jury and LAFCO reports should spell out steps to reduce the 
number. The problem has been known for decades. It's time for solutions.

AFTER THE CONVICTION, A NEED FOR CONTROLS; * TRIAL OF SHELTER PROGRAM'S 
EX-DIRECTOR SHOWS CRITICAL NEED FOR FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when the number of homeless in Orange County has grown dramatically, 
the embezzlement conviction of the former executive director of an Irvine 
organization established to help those without shelter is especially troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury last week found Clyde E. Weinman, former executive 
director of Irvine Temporary Housing, guilty of 13 charges of forgery and grand 
theft. He could be sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Weinman netted more than $400,000 in funds that were intended 
to help the homeless. Weinman claimed that he put $65,000 of his own money into 
the nonprofit agency to keep it afloat and was forced to forge checks to 
himself to cover his own bills. He contended he was a scapegoat for poor 
management by others. 
</P>
<P>
 He is right about poor management. The judge in the case said the agency was 
run "very shoddily." Someone at the agency or on its board of directors should 
have spotted the discrepancies much earlier. Weinman joined Irvine Temporary 
Housing in 1989 and was arrested in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman's arrest proved a setback for the housing agency, which was founded in 
1985 to find short-term shelter for the homeless in the Irvine area. Potential 
donors were understandably upset about the allegations and demanded an audit. 
That scrutiny showed no evidence that federal funds had been misused, and as 
the months went by, some donors have again helped the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Irvine assisted too, providing Irvine Temporary Housing with 
$82,000 and four condominiums last year. City officials wisely promised to 
continue to keep an eye on the charity's books and urged the agency to improve 
its financial controls and accounting practices. Another boost came from more 
than a dozen contractors, who helped refurbish two of the more than a dozen 
units the agency uses to shelter the homeless after it said it lacked the 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 The Homeless Issues Task Force reported recently that an estimated 12,000 
people were homeless in Orange County, an increase of 20% over the estimated 
number only two years ago. Anywhere from 30% to 50% of the homeless are thought 
to be children. As many as 40% may be mentally ill. Public agencies and 
citizens need to provide more resources to help the homeless, with shelter, 
training and jobs. But agencies like Irvine Temporary Housing must be prudent 
stewards of the funds they receive, and make sure they are spent the way donors 
intend.

PARADISE HAS BEEN LOST IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * At the risk of asking whether the emperor is wearing any clothes, perhaps 
Irvine Mayor Michael Ward or City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. would be kind 
enough to tell Irvine residents precisely how it will be possible to cut 50 
full-time and 20 part-time staff positions, continue to "reduce the cost of 
doing business in Irvine," and yet still "provide the same level of service 
citizens have come to rely on" from city government. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a miracle must also be accomplished as the city continues to grow, 
increasing demands for municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the mayor and city manager have discovered a magic formula to squeeze 
the same amount of work out of city staff already decimated and demoralized by 
cutbacks and pay freezes over the last few years. If so, Irvine residents are 
entitled to know what it is. Maybe the city can patent and market it to make up 
the $4.5-million budget shortfall! 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, why should anyone in Irvine expect city staff to work 25% harder to 
provide the "same level of services" and for basically the same pay? 
</P>
<P>
 There probably is no magic formula beyond the typical smoke and mirrors of 
budgetary planning and we probably can't (and have no right to) expect city 
staff, already understaffed, to take up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, it's time we all began discussing what municipal services Irvine 
may no longer be able to offer at all or locate the courage to raise revenue to 
pay for the services Irvine residents have come to expect.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Irvine residents were promised a paradise. But paradise has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice residents and city leaders face today is not complicated. Either 
the city finds a reasonable and fair way to continue providing services at the 
current level or Irvine residents begin to lower their expectations of what to 
expect from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is and should be ours.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER LEADERSHIP DESERVES A CLOSER LOOK, CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There have been several articles and editorials lately about the resignation 
of the UCI Medical School Dean (Dr. Walter L. Henry). 
</P>
<P>
 The picture being painted is not entirely accurate, and may even lead to the 
impression that "the sky is falling" on the medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not lose sight of the fact that UCI is one of this nation's 
up-and-coming youngest universities. 
</P>
<P>
 It brings to Orange County tens of millions of dollars of government and 
private money each year, and is the third largest employer in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's role and impact on the burgeoning Orange County biomedical technology 
companies is crucial to the success of that industry. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's medical school has become one of the country's leading centers for 
research in such areas as Huntington's disease, brain and other neuroscience 
diseases (UCI is ranked sixth in the nation in the field of neurosciences), and 
neonatal medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, UCI's cancer research and clinical cancer program is likely to 
receive major recognition as a regional cancer program by the National Cancer 
Institute very shortly. (UCI) Medical Center has been operating in the black 
for the past several years following a long history of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 This is largely due to the business skill of the hospital's executive director 
(Mary Piccione). 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, UCI's hospital is one of the few (if not only) public academic 
hospitals in the state that has been in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chancellor is taking the helm of an institution that has grown both in 
national stature and in its role as a crucial player in the future of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 She has an unparalleled opportunity to bring UCI into the very top ranks of 
U.S. universities and to provide Orange County with the resources and talent 
that it will need to maintain its position as a desirable place to live, raise 
a family, and to do business in the 21st Century.

 * ragMary Piccione, executive director of the UCI Medical Center is the person 
responsible for the financial turnaround. She accepted the directorship knowing 
of the red ink that flowed at the time. Quietly, she developed a plan to make 
the center fiscally solvent.  
</P>
<P>
 In the opinion of many, she has never been fully recognized for that feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Walter Henry had been a major player in bringing the biotech industry to 
the campus, but he should not be credited with the financial miracle at the 
medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 JUDY B. ROSENER 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * The story of Dr. (Walter) Henry's plight in dealing with (Chancellor Laurel 
L.) Wilkening truly proves the ineptness of many political appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of you who have employed people realize that true leadership abilities 
will be found in less than 5% of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at Dr. Henry's qualifications, it is obvious that a replacement will 
be very hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Henry has requested the creation of a subordinate position and Ms. 
Wilkening refuses to face the responsibility to do this. This shows real 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 We are losing the man who has probably saved the California taxpayer $50 
million to avoid a new burden of possibly $15,000 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick look at Dr. Henry's responsibilities leads me to believe that this man 
puts in at least 80 hours per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Henry has taken an increasingly complex task and restored order and 
sanity, while dealing with the growing burden of uncompensated care for the 
newly poor, the "undocumented" who cannot get care elsewhere (especially in 
their countries of origin) and the insurance companies with their "managed 
health" systems. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only hope that something can be worked out that will benefit the 
taxpayers, even if there is a little damage to Ms. Wilkening's ego.

SCOUT SHOULD BE PRAISED, NOT FINED

 * I read with astonishment about Richard Wright's good deed in aiding the 
Coast Guard and sheriff's rescue units in finding the pleasure craft in 
trouble, and the reaction of the Moulton Parkway Assn. No. 1 to his 
humanitarian act ("Scout Fined for Using CB in Boat Rescue," Jan. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 Many issues that we face in life are clouded with uncertainties, making a 
correct choice difficult.This one was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Wright made the only choice possible -- one that I hope my children and 
grandchildren would make if faced with such a situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Come now, is the precious association conformity to be given higher priority 
than the saving of human life?

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON BEACH CLOSURES; BALANCING RIGHT OF ACCESS 
AND NEED FOR SAFETY A LOCAL DILEMMA; DECISIONS ABOUT CURFEWS ARE BEST LEFT TO 
THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED AND NOT THE STATE COASTAL COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA MOULTON-PATTERSON, Linda Moulton-Patterson is mayor of Huntington 
Beach and a member of the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission recently became alarmed when, to protect the 
public safety, both state and local agencies began the late evening closure of 
beaches and beach parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, closures were brought about because angry residents were 
annoyed by the traffic and noise created by beach visitors. In other instances, 
closures were primarily made for public safety reasons or a lack of public 
funds to patrol beaches after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have asked why the Coastal Commission cares if a beach is closed during 
the late evening hours. In fact, many law-abiding citizens use the beach at all 
hours of the evening for fishing, swimming and evening walks. It is a citizen's 
constitutional right to do so and this right should only be curtailed if there 
is a compelling reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, our urban communities face enormous problems involving criminal acts of 
violence, vandalism and theft. Many coastal communities find these problems 
spilling over to the beaches and therein lies the delicate issue of balancing 
the right of public access with the need for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As a democratic people, we should not trample on our fundamental freedoms and 
the rights of honest citizens to enjoy our beach merely to get at the gangs and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But we should also not deny the greater threat that violence and gangs pose to 
our society. It is this threat that overwhelmingly concerns most people today. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Coastal Commission must continue to objectively develop policies 
which protect our beaches, coastal agriculture, wetlands and the public's right 
of access to the coastline, it must also be mindful of the public's genuine 
concern for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the rise of urban crime and violence, local and state agencies must 
have all the tools necessary to cope with these increased threats, not just in 
temporary or emergency situations but also for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Local agencies responsible for law enforcement, marine safety and beach 
maintenance must be given the authority to set hours of operation based on the 
agency's logistical and financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, it may be necessary to distinguish between the closure of a 
sandy public beach and closing related facilities such as parking lots, access 
ways, piers and boat ramps. In other instances, closing a beach may be the 
wrong response to a public safety problem. That was the case in San Diego, 
where the city's request for early closure of some beach parking lots was 
opposed by law enforcement officials who were concerned that even greater 
problems would result among young people with fewer places to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the Coastal Commission has been responsible for setting policy 
regarding development within the coastal zone. The issue before the Coastal 
Commission is now whether such public safety closures constitute "development." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is also trying to decide whether it should hold public hearings 
and determine closure policies or whether that responsibility should be left to 
local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In my view, public safety closures in no way constitute "development" by any 
stretch of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, each coastal community has unique public safety problems which need 
to be resolved on a case-by-case basis by those most closely affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's rights in these matters can be protected if local agencies adhere 
to Coastal Commission policy requiring local agencies to hold a public hearing 
to determine when such closure hours are necessary for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a shame that some of our coastal cities find themselves in a position 
where they must consider beach curfews to protect the public safety. Beaches 
are one of our most beautiful natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 From my point of view, sitting on both sides of the issue as mayor of 
Huntington Beach and as a member of the Coastal Commission, I am personally 
saddened by the limited choice presented to us. However, I am unwilling to turn 
over our beaches to gangs and violence. The decision is best left to the 
communities that are affected. I hope that other members of the Coastal 
Commission will agree with me on this.

A WEAK CASE ON BEHALF OF ILLEGAL WORKERS 
</P>

 * Wednesday's Orange County section had a couple of pieces dealing with 
illegal immigration. They had to do with (Assemblyman) Tom Umberg's recently 
proposed legislation, AB 2404, to penalize employers who hire undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 What really irritates me are some of the spurious arguments foisted on us by 
the employers and immigrants-rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The agriculture industry raises the specter of discrimination against workers 
here legally solely based on appearance. Hogwash! 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the vast majority of workers refused employment based on 
physical appearance and language skills only would be illegals. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the minute percentage of documented workers discriminated against 
wouldn't be afraid to complain to authorities. These same employers would be 
unlikely to hire them because they would demand a legal wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the unscrupulous employers who regularly hire undocumented workers do 
so for at least a couple of reasons. The illegals will work for next to 
nothing, and they will tolerate abysmal working conditions and all the physical 
and verbal abuse that these low-rent employers care to dispense. 
</P>
<P>
 I have intimate experience with this situation. As a youngster, I grew up in 
the San Joaquin Valley and worked in fields and saw how the illegals were 
treated. The documented workers were referred to as braceros at that time. 
Today, I work in an area of Los Angeles where a large number of illegals are 
employed. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's dispense with the smoke and mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service already knows who and where the 
offending employers are. The immigrants-rights groups are keenly aware that 
most of their arguments have no validity. 
</P>
<P>
 In California we have a history of kissing up to and caving in to the 
minorities. Let's get down to business and solve a problem that is eminently 
solvable.

NON-ELECTED LIFERS INSIDE THE BELTWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Catherine Whiting's article (Jan. 5) about "Term Limits for Those Other 
Politicians" was a witty reminder of a weak link in our democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar weakness has roots in our non-elected bureaucracy, and the Capitol 
teems with them. 
</P>
<P>
 These are bona fide CDCOs (Certified DC Occupants), folk who hustle to 
Washington when friends come to office and have a finger in the appointment 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Few are world-class specialists, but -- not to worry -- all know if they screw 
up too badly at what they are appointed to do, they'll be transferred (up a 
notch, usually) to something else. 
</P>
<P>
 If the private sector followed this jolly folkway, we'd hire a plumber to come 
fix a leak, discover after a while he doesn't know how, so be obligated to keep 
him on to paint the house.

TRANSIENT ARRESTED IN 6 SANTA ANA FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A transient has been arrested on suspicion of trying to burn down six vacant 
houses and a car in the central part of the city since November, a fire 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses identified Jim Gregory Tuner, 28, through photo lineups as the man 
who was near the blazes either minutes or hours before they were found, 
Battalion Chief Tom Skelley said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires were not accidental, investigators said, and the suspect did not set 
fires in the vacant homes and car for warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no clear understanding of why he is setting the fires," Skelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the fires, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the houses had been scheduled for demolition and were not near other 
residences, he said. The first fire caused $75 in damage, but the monetary loss 
increased with each arson. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth home, at 1419 W. Richland St., was being remodeled and is located 
near other homes, Skelley said. The Tuesday blaze caused $75,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on both sides of the house evacuated during the blaze, and their 
homes were not damaged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuner was arrested Thursday and was being held at the Santa Ana Jail on 
$10,000 bail, officials said.

EDITORIAL ON GUNS MISSED THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My immediate and angry reaction to the editorial "Gun Violence Is Out of 
Control" (Jan. 3) was to cancel my subscription. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving it a little thought, however, three reasons to continue receiving 
The Times on Sunday became apparent: I enjoy the Sunday comics section; the 
large format television guide has my cable system's channel breakdown and is 
therefore more convenient than the alternatives, and I and all freedom-loving 
Americans must keep abreast of the enemies of liberty in this country, though 
it galls us to subsidize them by subscribing to their publications. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not disagree that violence of all types -- including that in which guns 
are involved -- is on the rise. I do not disagree that something must be done. 
I just don't support solutions that restrict or eliminate my constitutional 
rights or those of other law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times apparently does not believe in punishing criminals but in 
restricting the rights of the victims of crime. Nowhere in the offending 
editorial was there mention of mandatory sentencing, better and larger police 
forces or other measures aimed at the criminals in our society.

SUPERVISORIAL CANDIDATE DESERVES A CLOSER LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times' smug prediction of the certain winner of the 3rd District 
supervisor's race (Valley Newswatch, Jan. 3) left me questioning how fair your 
paper really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent from the paragraph touting Zev Yaroslavsky as the sure winner in a 
campaign only insomniacs would love is any mention at all of Yaroslavsky's 
worthy opponent Don Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was Wallace, who served nearly three years as field deputy for Supervisor 
Ed Edleman, completely ignored in the summary? 
</P>
<P>
 Why weren't Wallace's credentials as a credible candidate sung as loudly as 
Yaroslavsky's? 
</P>
<P>
 I would think that the people of the 3rd District would welcome news on 
someone with fresh ideas that challenge Yaroslavsky's worn-out and hollow 
political solutions.

IT'S TIME TO TOUGHEN LAWS ON DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A few days ago, Barbara Paull was driving with her best friend, Stephanie 
Tourikian, and as they were crossing the intersection of Corbin Avenue and 
Roscoe Boulevard in Northridge, another car broadsided their car, killing both 
instantly. The driver, who has been charged with drunk driving, survived the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Paull was a neighbor of mine, someone I've known since she was a 
little girl toddling around with my kids on our front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years I watched Barbara mature into a young lady. There wasn't a 
time we passed each other on the street when she didn't wave to me with a 
bright, congenial, pixie smile. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't help getting very angry when I think of the Paull and Tourikian 
families and how they will never again be able to enjoy a child's innocent 
smile or playful touch without recalling their own deep loss. 
</P>
<P>
 A drunk driver is no better than the most vicious of killers, and it's time 
the laws were changed to bring back some balance of fairness and propriety to 
this malignancy which destroys the lives of innocent, law-abiding and 
responsible people.

ARTICLE ON MOONING WAS A LOONY IDEA 
</P>

 * Too bad Scott Harris couldn't find a more positive topic than a story about 
two drunken adult delinquents ("A Random Act of Mooning," Jan. 6).

 Too bad the Los Angeles Times couldn't find a more positive article to fill 
that space -- better to have left it blank.Who knows how many other morons will 
now want to cheer us with such a view? 
</P>
<P>
 Since I live in Studio City and have to drive that area on Moorpark Street 
between Colfax Avenue and Laurel Canyon Boulevard, I'm worrying whether the 
other drivers will be looking around for the next mooning. And who will 
shoulder that responsibility -- Scott Harris or the editor who approved the 
column for printing? Accountability is for everyone.

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; BERNSON DOES THE RIGHT THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last August, the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission and the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission exposed an intricate money laundering scam that 
was designed to hide the source of contributions to politicians' campaigns. The 
case led to the largest penalty of its kind in U.S. history -- an $895,000 fine 
against Evergreen America Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the not-so-insignificant matter of $170,000 in tainted campaign 
contributions to more than 20 state and local candidates. In response, the 
city's Ethics Commission rightfully ordered local candidates to pay to the city 
treasury the money they had received from Evergreen. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only two local politicians to balk was L.A. City Councilman Hal 
Bernson, who said he deserved a hearing, had already spent the money, and had 
satisfied the spirit of the law by contributing to charity an even larger 
amount of money. He also said that he should not have to raise funds to cover 
money that he had accepted in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ethics Commission officials had already removed the taint of suspicion 
from the candidates by stating that the Evergreen contributions had been 
accepted unwittingly. The commission's goal was reasonable: riding the 
political system of tainted money. 
</P>
<P>
 We're pleased to note now that Bernson has decided to donate an amount equal 
to the Evergreen money he received ($11,000) to police in his district. That 
sounds like an excellent way to meet the Ethics Commission demand. We only wish 
that Bernson had acted as quickly as the other candidates so ordered.

IT'S CALLED THE BOOB TUBE FOR A GOOD REASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Apparently Michele Lingre is not a child psychologist, educator, media 
analyst or other type of "expert." Perhaps that is why she displayed such 
uncommon common sense in identifying what so many seem unable -- or unwilling 
-- to acknowledge: Television viewing has profound affects on children.(Let's 
not forget the same is true for teen-agers and adults, but because their brains 
are more fully developed, the magnitude of the effect is minuscule by 
comparison.) 
</P>
<P>
 In her Jan. 9 commentary, "Turning Off TV Gives Child a New View of Life," 
Lingre points to the core issue: Television watching as an activity should be 
the focus of the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Our societal debate regrettably has been refocused such that we now consider 
only the effects of content , specifically sex and violence -- and of late 
simply violence. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, these have substantial effects on viewers young and old. But in 
light of numerous brain wave studies proving TV's mind-numbing impact, no one 
should be surprised that a generation of kids raised on six-plus hours of 
television daily have record-low test scores, short attention spans, impaired 
learning abilities and lack of initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Television acts on the mind in ways similar to many drugs. In the '60s and 
'70s, anti-drug campaigns asked, "Why do you think they call it dope?" Maybe we 
should ask ourselves "Why do you think they call it the boob tube?"

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; HELP AND HOPE FOR THE CHILDREN; COUNTY ANSWERS A PLEA IN 
THE HIGH DESERT AFTER ABUSE CASES SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fall of 1992, a story by Times reporter John Chandler revealed a 
staggering toll of child abuse deaths in the Antelope Valley. Six children had 
died from physical injury in slightly more than one year's time. The story also 
noted that the high desert area had one of Los Angeles County's highest rates 
of reported abuse against children. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the county government's awareness of the problem, and its 
response, left much to be desired. For example, the closest county dependency 
court to the Antelope Valley was shifted last year from Van Nuys to Monterey 
Park, leaving high desert families with a 70-mile trip to court. The dependency 
court handles cases of child abuse and neglect. Moreover, the county skipped 
over the Antelope Valley as a possible test site for a family preservation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, county officials have responded to their most vulnerable residents in the 
manner that they deserve. They have finally fulfilled promises made last year 
for improved services to the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, perhaps, was the long-anticipated opening of a satellite 
juvenile court in Lancaster for child abuse and neglect cases. That alleviated 
the need for exhausting, 140-mile round trips every time a child or a family 
had to make a court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most interesting and welcome development for a county that is 
hard-pressed to assign people to such far-flung regions involves the medical 
examinations that are used to determine whether physical abuse has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this past week, such examinations had to be done at County-USC Medical 
Center -- some 75 miles away -- because each exam had to be witnessed by Dr. 
Astrid Heger, director of the county's Center for the Vulnerable Child. Now, 
using video equipment, a magnification device and a special telephone link, 
those examinations can occur at an Antelope Valley hospital. Heger can direct a 
nurse through the examination or can review the results later. Moreover, the 
video images can be stored on film or printed for later use as evidence during 
court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, this new program also creates a system in which the abused child 
need only take part in one or two interviews by law enforcement or medical 
officials, down from the grueling eight interviews that had usually been 
necessary to mount criminal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 With round-trip distances to court and medical facilities of 140 to 150 miles, 
the county had been engaged in its own peculiar form of mistreatment of 
Antelope Valley children. County officials have finally taken the steps 
necessary to speed up investigations and lessen the burden on youths who have 
already suffered the traumas of physical abuse and neglect. It's about time.

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; GIMMICKS WON'T PROTECT YOU ON THESE MEAN STREETS; SOME TRY 
TO CASH IN ON FEAR BUT BEING ALERT AND INVOLVED ARE BETTER BETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several highly publicized carjackings in the San Fernando Valley last year led 
to all manner of ambulance-chasing sales pitches for devices that would keep 
crooks at bay. For the most part, these items offered little more than a costly 
and false sense of security. They might have even added to the dangers faced by 
their owners. How? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the supposedly lifelike mannequin who is assigned to ride next to you 
to deter crime. These might tend to make their owners less vigilant. And any 
reasonably observant crook might see the situation precisely for what it is: 
potential victims riding around with plastic dummies in the passenger seat. We 
also have a problem with those expensive devices that render hijacked cars 
undrivable. Think about it: They disable the car when the gun-toting carjacker 
is right there with you. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a variation on the same "We Sell Safety" theme has sprung up. This time 
the entrepreneurs are targeting people who have legitimate concerns about their 
children. These worries increased last summer with the news of sexual assaults 
on children in Pacoima. In November, parents learned that a serial child 
molester had been operating in the West Valley since February. That same month, 
an 8-year-old girl was kidnaped outside her Woodland Hills home and choked to 
death, allegedly by a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of all this, folks taking advantage of the fear are hawking such 
products as a hand-held electronic alarm that emits a shrieking noise when 
activated. Fine, but which of the following two scenarios would you, as a 
parent, really prefer: to have your child trained to sprint as fast as possible 
away from suspicious strangers while screaming at the top of their lungs, or to 
have him or her standing there, trying to remember where they put this little 
alarm, in the book bag, lunch bag, coat pocket, pants pocket. . . .? 
</P>
<P>
 Another gem is a beeper-type device that supposedly monitors a child's moves 
and allows a parent to page a child. Let's see if we've got this straight. 
There's your child, nine-tenths of the way to school, and he or she then has to 
stop and wander around to find a pay phone to respond to a page? A glorified 
pager is supposed to make a child safe? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the worst, however, was the martial arts/self-defense instructor who 
made this statement about children: "They can defend themselves. It's not that 
hard to take out a human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Really? Perhaps the instructor had not heard about the case of Veronica 
Estrada, the 29-year-old Santa Clarita martial arts instructor who was so adept 
at tae kwon do that she was a nationally ranked black belt. She was choked to 
death in Canyon Country last month by a perpetrator who remains at large. So 
much for kids with a few hours of self-defense courses being able to defend 
themselves from determined adults. Worse, those children might be overconfident 
enough to ignore dangerous situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, as usual, there are no easy answers or foolproof solutions. The 
good news here is that the best advice is also the least expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 As instructor Ellen Snortland wrote last month on the Times Op-Ed page, 
children need to be taught to scream "911" or "I need help!' at the least sign 
of attention from a stranger. Better to yell and make a scene and be 
embarrassed -- and safe -- if it turns out to have been a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 The School-Community Alliance near El Camino Real High School in Woodland 
Hills has taken steps that can be duplicated. It stations adults around a 
four-block radius of the school to watch over students. In Sylmar, parents at 
El Dorado Elementary School are gathering every day to escort their children. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also another laudable development that could be put to good use on 
behalf of the Valley's children. Between January and December of last year, the 
number of Neighborhood Watch block captains in the Valley doubled to 3,330. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't think of a better resource: People who can poll neighborhood adults 
to determine who among them might be available as escorts, for street-corner 
vigilance or to offer rides to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Things can be made much safer for children in the Valley, but gadgetry and 
gimmickry are not sound solutions.

STORY DID NOT GIVE BEGLEY A FAIR SHAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Ed Begley Jr. and the eight-member Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Board 
did not get a fair shake from your Dec. 30 story "Ed Begley Jr. Nominated for 
Conservancy Board." 
</P>
<P>
 It is too bad that most of your story was taken up with information about 
someone who didn't get the appointment. Anton Calleia's wise counsel and 
experience will be missed, but Begley is an excellent person to serve both the 
city of Los Angeles and the conservancy. Begley is nationally known as a 
committed environmentalist. His personal commitment is extraordinary: When he 
can't bicycle, he drives his electric car. He knows the Santa Monica Mountains 
from his own experience. Begley's concurrent position on the Environmental 
Affairs Commission will bolster coordination between the conservancy and the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conservancy board is low profile, as the article intimates, perhaps 
this is because reporters -- including those from The Times -- almost never 
cover its meetings. We hold our meetings in the evening (after The Times' 
deadline) to accommodate public participation. Calling staff afterward does not 
give your readers the true flavor of the deliberations. No wonder, in the minds 
of your reporters, the board "does not have the highest profile." 
</P>
<P>
 A conservancy board meeting is an example of successful citizen government in 
action. Volunteer board members thoughtfully resolve difficult environmental 
problems. If reporters covered these meetings, perhaps then we wouldn't see any 
more snide references to "park agency to the stars." The Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy is the park agency to all 10 million Southern Californians who 
enjoy the 20,000 acres we have protected.

SUNSHINE CANYON HARM CANNOT BE MITIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The North Valley Coalition has been opposed to the destruction of the 
Sunshine Forest ecosystem for many years. Turning this oak forest into a dump 
will represent the largest removal of land from a designated significant 
ecological area (SEA) in county history.  
</P>
<P>
 This is not a 200-acre deletion, as Don P. Mullally states (Valley Commentary, 
Jan. 9), but a 542-acre deletion that has already been approved. These SEAs 
were identified to be protected and remain as relics of what once was found 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 We share Mullally's desire to see more parkland, but the loss of this 
ecosystem, as even the county admits and the environmental impact report 
states, can never be mitigated. We are fighting for the preservation of all 
SEAs. Having BFI mitigate the loss by paying for a study of SEAs is rather like 
destroying Yosemite and mitigating it with a study of national parks. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mullally himself once wrote: "Changing the county master plan and causing 
the cancellation of 540 acres of a SEA, leading to complete biological 
destruction, sets a dangerous precedent. The entire SEA system, therefore is in 
jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the dumps proposed by the county are either in SEAs or national 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 We see here the danger of well-meaning environmentalists looking for 
trade-offs. Should Rustic Canyon be traded for parkland in Sullivan? Should 
Blind Canyon be sacrificed for land in Townsley? The coalition will never yield 
to pressure to pit one SEA against another. They all must be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition has presented practical alternatives, such as adding landfill to 
already scarified land, long haul, increased recycling and composting. Rather 
than consider these alternatives, Mullally wants to accept a back-room deal 
that would sacrifice the irreplaceable forest and its use by future 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The project significantly puts a large animal and raptor population at risk. 
The approval by the county to remove 3,000 protected oaks (the largest permit 
for the removal of oaks in county history) and the intent to remove 8,600 oaks 
as the dump enlarges is, as Mullally once said, the "loss of the densest, most 
extensive and mature coast live oak forest and woodland in the Santa Susana 
Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Again we quote Mullally: "The full mitigation, the one recommended most 
highly, is no expansion of the landfill in Sunshine Canyon into unincorporated 
county land. . . . Destruction of the ecosystem cannot be mitigated, despite 
the arguments to the contrary by BFI." We still believe this to be true and are 
not being intractable, only faithful to a remarkable forest whose trees, plant 
communities and wildlife have no voices but ours.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; CONTROLLED BURNING IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO PREVENT LETHAL 
FIRES; IT'S NATURE'S METHOD AND IT WORKS. A DECISION NOT TO DO IT IS A DECISION 
TO ALLOW A HOLOCAUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON N. ANDERSON, Don N. Anderson is an engineer who has lived in Topanga 
Canyon for 30 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fires that killed three people and destroyed 390 homes in Topanga alone 
were not preventable -- but the damage that they did was. The fire was routine. 
The disaster was human-caused. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting of fires, whether by arsonists, cigarette throwers or lightning, 
is inevitable, a routine event. We cannot prevent fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But we can prevent a fire from developing into a holocaust. A holocaust cannot 
develop unless large amounts of fuel are available. To prevent disaster, we 
must continually reduce the long-term accumulation of fuel on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanically removing the brush is infeasible because of the enormous cost. 
Mother Nature's method is the only one that works. It's called controlled 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
 The safe and economical way to remove the lethal brush is to burn it under 
conditions when it is impossible for a fire to propagate itself, that is, when 
the ground and vegetation are wet. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, firebreaks should be burned through the heavy brush mass. Then the 
areas between the breaks can be burned at times when a fire will barely sustain 
itself. The result will be a checkerboard in which some sections have burned 
more recently than others. 
</P>
<P>
 A natural fire control system is compatible with both populated and wild areas 
and highly likely to work. In effect, it is the system nature used for millions 
of years to control the fire process and make it useful. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-phase program is needed: 
</P>
<P>
 1. A scientific investigation to prepare the way for the fire-control system. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A test to assure it works. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Operation. Once the protective mosaic has been established, the system is 
completely self-maintaining and very low in cost, providing that fires occur 
often enough in all areas of the mosaic. If they do not, fires must be started 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The result will be the complete elimination of the lethal brush fire and 
mudslide danger that now has California in thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to see a modern-day example of how Mother Nature handles the brush 
problem if left alone, you need only fly over Mexico. It has many areas of 
chaparral similar to ours. You will see the mosaic pattern of natural 
protective burns, and one must ask why we so rarely hear of disastrous 
firestorms in Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past, controlled burns have worked until one gets out of control and 
creates some damage. Then the whole idea is dropped. No one seems to realize 
that a decision not to do controlled burning is, in effect, a decision to allow 
a holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlled burning under this system should be exempt from air-pollution 
regulations. Stopping disasters is far more important to our health than any 
problems from a small amount of natural fire emissions. The burning would be 
done in the wet season when air quality is higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should individual property owners be able to prevent controlled burning by 
withholding their permission.  
</P>
<P>
 Politicians have ignored this lethal problem. It's time to let them know that 
we expect them to solve it, either as I am proposing or in some other way.

4 VITAL MINUTES; OUTLYING COMMUNITIES CAN'T COUNT ON TIMELY EMERGENCY SERVICE. 
A NEW ASSESSMENT DISTRICT MAY BE THE ONLY SOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. FLEMING , David W. Fleming is an attorney with Latham & Watkins, 
vice president of the Los Angeles City Board of Fire Commissioners and a past 
chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The acronym is EMS. 
</P>
<P>
 It stands for the emergency medical service which the city provides you and 
your family when you phone 911. Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics arrive 
on the scene to help you -- fast! -- most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the 104 operating fire stations in the city were positioned to 
serve densely populated areas. In central parts of the city, fire stations tend 
to be closer to one another than elsewhere. Their normal response times are 
within the department's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you happen to live in some areas on the outskirts of Los Angeles, 
say Hidden Hills, Sun Valley, Tujunga or the Pacific Palisades Highlands, or if 
your home is located in some of the hillside areas, paramedic help cannot get 
to you as fast as you may need it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is delayed because of long distances between homes and the nearest fire 
station or because of miles of winding roads in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite best efforts, in some parts of the city paramedic help is several 
minutes away, longer if the team closest to you is on another call. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the victim of a severe heart attack, a seizure, choking, a possible 
drowning or electrocution -- one whose breathing has stopped -- unless 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation is administered within four minutes, the chances 
of survival drop precipitously. 
</P>
<P>
 If six more minutes elapse, recovery is virtually out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department and the city's newly appointed Board of Fire Commissioners 
are aware of this problem. Faced with a severe shortfall in revenues in the 
coming months, the city's budget constraints have indefinitely postponed any 
plans to construct new fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution that has been suggested is asking residents of the few areas at 
risk if they want to form special assessment districts. This idea is worthy of 
careful consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 If an area approved such a district, the plan would work roughly like this: 
Bimonthly charges would be added on water and power bills to residents. The 
money would be used to build, equip and staff new fire stations in those areas. 
The response to both fires and medical emergencies would be speeded up. 
</P>
<P>
 An objection to this idea has been voiced based on the assumption that 
paramedics in the district could not help people who live outside it but 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 That should never be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharing of fire resources (including EMS) is an overriding and 
well-accepted rule in this region. We see it every time an emergency arises. We 
saw it happen in the fall brush fires. Firefighting units arrived on the scene 
from hundreds of miles away -- even from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 When a community has an emergency, nearby communities pitch in with whatever 
help they can reasonably provide. Emergency help should never be denied because 
of boundary lines, whether they be city boundaries, state boundaries or special 
assessment district boundaries. That should be agreed upon before a district is 
formed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We need to make the best of a difficult situation. No person should be 
deprived of fast, efficient medical emergency service when needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we cannot build additional resources without more revenues, and since a 
general tax increase is politically out of the question, some program of direct 
financial assistance to the city, approved by a majority vote of those living 
in underserved areas, should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not let those people who prefer the more open spaces or mountaintop views 
decide for themselves? I, for one, would welcome the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 One more step should be considered. That is referring many of the 60,000 
non-emergency calls the Fire Department receives each year to private medical 
care givers, as our fire chief proposed a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about such things as stubbed toes and splinters. They account for 
three-fourths of the runs made by our EMS teams. Turning them over to the 
private sector would save $6 million in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, we don't have enough money, people or equipment at enough 
locations to respond to every call within four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 As with national health care, EMS policy making is fraught with danger. There 
are always misunderstandings and misplaced expectations lurking about. Clearly 
there are political risks inherent in making any changes in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate becomes a process of deciding which advantages are most important 
to the public and which disadvantages (costs among them) the public is willing 
to live with. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, lives hang in the balance. It's a growing problem that 
demands a solution -- now.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; IT'S HIGH TIME FOR MTA TO GET ITSELF ON THE RIGHT TRACK; THE 
BELEAGUERED TRANSIT AGENCY HAS BEEN DERAILED BY BUDGET AND SERVICE PROBLEMS 
SINCE ITS FORMATION. ITS BOARD NEEDS TO END THE BACKBITING AND TO CUT WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZEV YAROSLAVSKY, Zev Yaroslavsky represents the 5th District on the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency responsible for building 
and operating Los Angeles' rail and bus transit systems, is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Metro Rail project is running $200 million over budget, making our subway 
mile for mile the costliest built in the United States in recent years. The 
cost of some subway construction contracts has ballooned by as much as 81% over 
the competitively bid price. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels on our subway cars are wearing out too soon. And many segments of 
the subway tunnel are walled with concrete that is four to six inches thinner 
than designed (and four to six inches thinner than paid for) -- possibly 
reducing the subway's chances of withstanding a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 These are just MTA's subway problems. They've got trouble elsewhere, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MTA buses are criticized as unsafe, dirty and covered with graffiti. Due to 
the agency's high administrative costs and outdated work rules, these buses 
cost more to run than cleaner, safer ones in many surrounding cities. Yet MTA 
has been slow to resolve these problems, and as a result we will soon have to 
consider burdening commuters with fare increases, service reductions or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent news reports have focused on excessive expenditures by MTA board 
members and staff on junkets, dinner and doughnuts. The agency has bought into 
questionable financing schemes with offshore Caribbean banks. It has tried to 
bypass money-saving competitive bidding in the selection of investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA expects to face a $126-million operating shortfall for the 1994-95 fiscal 
year. In fact, the agency has experienced operating shortfalls for the past 
three years, and has closed the gap each time by using reserve funds instead of 
cutting costs. For 1994-95, there are no reserve funds left and so far no 
consensus on the tough choices that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA was created by merging the old Southern California Rapid Transit District 
with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. There was hope that this 
would create a more effective organization that would be able to cut costs, 
provide more efficient service and put an end to constant feuding between what 
were then rival agencies. However, MTA has been slow to realize the benefits of 
consolidation, maintaining duplicate staff in many areas, including lobbying, 
for several months after the merger took place. Even today, duplication, 
backbiting and power plays remain the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the MTA board doing to address these concerns? Not nearly enough. 
The board itself is practically paralyzed by lobbyists and is close to breaking 
down under its own weight. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA board members may not vote on matters involving most campaign contributors 
(and MTA alternates, like myself, are also prohibited from voting on matters 
involving anyone who contributed to the appointees for whom they serve as 
alternates). Inasmuch as there are more than 1,200 lobbyists registered at MTA, 
every vote of consequence on the board is an exercise in lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that MTA is the only government agency in town with money to spend is 
not lost on our lobbyist friends. Competition for MTA business is so intense 
that wanna-be contractors and lobbyists can subscribe to not one but two 
private newsletters detailing MTA affairs. When I walked into my first MTA 
board meeting, the "lobbying energy" in the room was so thick you could cut it 
with a campaign check. Is this how we want transportation decisions made? 
</P>
<P>
 The conduct of the MTA board is problematic too. When I was first elected to 
the City Council, I was joining an institution with a structure and established 
rules to follow. The MTA, in contrast, is about as orderly as the Wild West. 
There are no rules and no protocol. The board is overwhelmed with minutiae and 
regularly underbriefed on the items -- often worth millions of taxpayer dollars 
-- on which it must decide. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, MTA management is starting to pull itself out of the morass. We 
now have a strong chief executive officer, Franklin White, who is trying hard 
to rein in the beast. We have a first-rate inspector general who will be on the 
lookout for corruption and waste. With the help of the news media we have begun 
to focus public attention on MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much more remains to be done. MTA must end the backbiting, streamline 
operations, cut out waste, eliminate duplicate functions and institute the 
normal governmental checks and balances. This means reforming the board process 
by establishing rules of procedure and strict disclosure of lobbying activity, 
scheduling more frequent board meetings and eliminating the alternates who now 
double the size of the already-cumbersome 13-member board. MTA must get its 
fiscal house in order. It must spend and commit to spending only those tax 
dollars it has to spend. It must put a stop to hanky-panky in the contracting 
process by establishing a protocol that is firm, fair and free from question. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a tall order, but MTA must do it if the public is to gain confidence 
in this most important local agency.

ORANGE COUNTY BLACKS SHOW NEW POLITICAL CLOUT; ACTIVISM: LOCAL AFRICAN AMERICAN 
LEADERS, LONG QUIET IN THE REGION, HAVE MOBILIZED AND ARE WIELDING INFLUENCE IN 
THE WAKE OF A SHERIFF DEPUTY'S FATAL SHOOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When a La Habra mother was beaten to death in a mall parking lot last 
September after a shouting match that was reportedly laced with racial slurs, 
police said initially that her attackers may have killed her because she was 
black, and prosecutors even added charges -- subsequently dropped -- that her 
death was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was no outcry then from Orange County's black community -- no 
meetings with top county officials, no impassioned press conferences, no 
demands for a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no response, and there should have been," said Randall Jordan, a 
minister who publishes a black monthly newspaper in Orange County. "I guess 
everybody thought it may have been a futile effort. At that time, I just don't 
think there was the organization between the various black groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Now jump ahead four months to January, 1994: A sheriff's deputy -- a black 
deputy -- has been shot and killed by a fellow officer in what authorities 
describe as a tragic Christmas Day training mishap. Black leaders -- often 
virtually invisible in local politics -- are angry. 
</P>
<P>
 They hold press conferences. They meet with county politicians. They criticize 
the slow and incomplete release of information. And, in a move stunning even 
some longtime county-watchers, they persuade Sheriff Brad Gates to request a 
state investigation into the shooting. All this in a case in which no evidence 
has surfaced to suggest that race played any part. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference this time, some black leaders say, can be traced to a meeting 
in Irvine three months ago at which black groups from the business, religious 
and civic communities came together to mobilize their sparse resources in a 
renewed push for empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some remain skeptical that a group comprising less than 2% of the county 
population can ever achieve much of a political voice. But the events of the 
three weeks following the death of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins have caused 
others to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been surprised that the black community has gotten as deeply involved in 
this issue as they have," said Dan Wooldridge, a political consultant who 
worked with the Sheriff's Department for years and as an aide to 
then-Supervisor Don R. Roth. "There's a heightened perception now that the 
black community will continue to play a higher-profile role in decisions that 
affect not only their community, but the whole community." 
</P>
<P>
 But if black leaders have staked out a higher ground on the Robins issue, 
their role has also attracted derision from people who accuse them of inflaming 
an already volatile issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they want to do is pursue their own agenda. They don't give a damn about 
Darryn Robins," said Robert MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County 
Deputy Sheriff's Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I have heard about this case from the beginning indicates (the 
shooting) was an accident, and there was absolutely nothing racial about it," 
MacLeod said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders "infuriated the vast majority of Orange County sheriff's 
deputies with their quotes in (the newspaper), and that's black deputies, white 
deputies, men and women, young and old," he said. "They say, 'He's one of our 
own,' but they're out there disrupting the grieving of the family. . . . All 
they're doing is rubbing salt in the wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, is survived by a wife and a daughter, now 18 months old. Family 
members in the Los Angeles area have declined to discuss the Orange County 
black community's role in the case, saying they want to await the results of 
the district attorney's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the Dec. 25 
incident behind a Lake Forest movie theater to determine whether the shooter, 
Deputy Brian Scanlan, 32, of Anaheim should face criminal charges. Officials 
are looking at the possibility that Robins, playing the part of a suspect in a 
car stop during an informal training session, startled Scanlan by reaching for 
a gun hidden behind his car visor, and that Scanlan then shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Unanswered in the case is the critical question of why deputies were training 
in a public area with a loaded weapon -- in apparent violation of Sheriff's 
Department policies.  
</P>
<P>
 Local officials challenged Gates from the outset over that issue, and black 
leaders joined in soon after the shooting to question whether the district 
attorney's office faced a conflict of interest in investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1985 county policy sets out procedures for the district attorney to 
investigate all officer-involved shootings, and no one has suggested that 
prosecutors have misstepped in their investigation. Some black leaders insist 
nonetheless that the office may be too close to the Sheriff's Department to 
offer an unbiased assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week of the shooting, about 40 members of a loosely formed coalition, 
representing some 15 groups from various facets of Orange County's black 
community, met to discuss how to respond to the shooting, said Jordan, 
publisher of the Black Orange, a monthly newspaper with a circulation of 2,500 
in the local black community. Their ranks included members of the Black Chamber 
of Commerce, the Baptist Ministers Fellowship Conference, the National Council 
of Negro Women, the Prince Hall Masons and other groups, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the group met again. Some two dozen people showed up, Jordan 
said. It was not a dramatic turnout, but it was a start. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the black community has usually held little political voice in a 
county that spent years trying to shake its image as a home to the John Birch 
Society: There are no blacks elected to any of the city councils, the county 
Board of Supervisors, or state or federal offices. More often than not, Latinos 
and Asians, rather than blacks, have been the ones to press issues of 
minority-wide interest, such as electoral redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
 And even when cases affecting blacks have proven controversial -- such as the 
September death of the woman in La Habra, where some witnesses said she may 
have instigated and prolonged the fight with two white women that caused her 
death -- local black leaders have been criticized as too slow to take up the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robins case may change that, some black community members suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody that reads the paper and watches the television knows that 
there's a new black voice in Orange County . . . since the shooting," said 
Eugene Wheeler, a health care administrator who heads a business and civic 
group called 100 Black Men of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said black leaders knew when they began speaking out on the Robins 
case that there would be opposition. But he said dialogue between blacks and 
other county groups -- both pro and con -- is essential to political growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we're talking now," Wheeler said. "It wasn't happening before 
because there wasn't any major effort. But at some point, when we feel 
something is unjustly done that affects the African community, we need to speak 
out and be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 One pivotal development in the black community's response to the Robins case 
came two weeks after the shooting, when Wheeler and Jordan met with 
Undersheriff Raul Ramos for some two hours to press their case about the need 
for an independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, Gates pointed to community concerns in asking state Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren to intervene in the case and open an investigation. The 
attorney general turned him down, but even so the request itself marked a 
newfound credibility for a black community struggling to gain recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even within the black community, there have been differences of opinion 
over how aggressively to push the Robins case. 
</P>
<P>
 George Williams, executive director of the Orange County Urban League, says it 
is premature to talk about civil rights violations in the deputy shooting when 
the basic facts have yet to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know" what happened, Williams said. "That's the pain that surrounds 
this whole issue. Nobody is coming forward with any information that satisfies 
our need to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he has discussed the shooting with black community leaders in an 
attempt to devise an appropriate response. However, Williams said he doubts 
there is much black leaders can do until the district attorney's office 
completes its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as some urge patience, others suggest that the official silence 
surrounding the Robins case has only fueled wild and sometimes sinister 
speculation in the black community.

ACTIVISTS ARRESTED IN AUTO SHOW PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Saturday arrested two environmental activists who scaled a Los 
Angeles Convention Center tower to hang a banner accusing an auto company of 
destroying the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainforest Action Network staged the protest as the Greater Los Angeles 
Auto Show was taking place inside the convention center.Three other members of 
the environmental group were cited for trespassing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After scaling the building, protesters unfurled a large banner that said: 
"Welcome to the Show, Boycott Mitsubishi -- World's 1 Rainforest Destroyer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Two of them were up there trying to hang up a sign while the other three 
people were down below cheering them on," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jay 
Moberly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Custer, spokeswoman for Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, said the parent 
firm has a trading company that is separate from the auto company. "They are 
involved in trading of materials in Burma involving lumber and have very 
limited forestry," she said. "This is a fund-raising ploy raised by a group of 
environmentalists who don't have their facts straight."

MAN CHARGED IN AIRLINE EXTORTION TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI agents arrested a man who allegedly tried to extort $1.5 million from 
United Airlines by threatening to shoot down an airliner bound for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Orvile Spence, 48, was arrested Friday night in the Lennox area as he 
attempted to pick up the money he demanded, said Charlie Parsons, special agent 
in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 About noon Friday, Spence telephoned United Airlines officials in Chicago and 
threatened to use a Vietnam War-era weapon known as a Law rocket to shoot down 
a Los Angeles-bound passenger jet, Parsons said. Spence also made similar calls 
to United Airlines in Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence was arraigned Saturday and charged with extortion. If convicted, he 
could face 20 years in federal prison and a fine of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials did not say where Spence lived and were unsure whether he 
possessed a Law rocket.

ROYAL TREATMENT; FOR SOME SOUTHLAND HOMEOWNERS, THEIR HOME IS THEIR CASTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Don Brownstein feels like the king of his block. When he turns into the 
driveway of his Northridge home, he usually finds the street clogged with cars 
full of gawking picture-takers. 
</P>
<P>
 Passersby stare because Brownstein lives in a recently completed, 
7,800-square-foot medieval castle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You only live once," Brownstein said, "so we wanted to build something we 
love. And I've always had a fascination with things that are medieval and 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
 A castle in Southern California? It seems a hopelessly odd mix -- an ancient 
building designed for military defense plunked down in a city protected by 
electronic security alarms. Castle owners may be out of step in the land of 
youth, surfing and instant mini-malls, but they care not. Eschewing trendy 
high-tech styles, equipped with large budgets or small, local castle owners 
create medieval fortresses where they are shielded from the bustle of urban 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Brownstein and his wife, Renee, had always been interested in ancient 
architecture. After a search for larger quarters yielded nothing located closer 
to Brownstein's Vernon-based recycling business, the couple decided to start 
from scratch on their existing lot and build a one-of-a-kind castle. They even 
found a way to recycle their original, 2,600-square-foot house -- instead of 
tearing it down, they donated it to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new three-story home has classic castle features, including a 300-pound 
wooden front door, battlements and hidden passageways, as well as Brownstein's 
whimsical "physical jokes" -- two-way mirrors, carved figures tucked into every 
corner and a torture chamber/workout room adorned with realistic paintings of 
whip-wielding taskmasters and snarling dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 New materials were often used to create the appearance of age. Concrete and 
stucco, painted to look like old stone, were used for the entryway flagstones 
and some interior and exterior walls. The Brownsteins were influenced by 
castles they saw in Europe, as well as Hearst Castle and Disneyland. "We'd be 
on the Haunted Mansion ride admiring the wall sconces," Brownstein said. The 
result is "a vaguely European feeling without being any particular style." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are faces in the balusters, jokers and dragons, gargoyles on the 
outside parapets," Brownstein said. To complete the look, Brownstein is having 
a fire-breathing bronze dragon sculpture installed to guard his front yard, 
which will eventually include a moat. 
</P>
<P>
 But dragons aside, what the family really enjoys about the house is the sense 
of privacy, of being away from the modern world. While their children Erin, 11, 
and Adam, 14, frolic with playmates in the hidden passageways, Brownstein can 
hole up in his office or work out in the torture chamber. "What I like is I can 
go up into my own area and not be bothered," Brownstein said. "It's peaceful 
and quiet. It's just a fantasy house." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood castle owner Chuck Friedman feels the same way about his 
18-year-old, two-story medieval home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live a fairy tale here," he said of the 6,000-square-foot castle he built 
gradually, as finances allowed. The final design includes two main living areas 
surrounded by battlements, waterfalls, a winding moat and drawbridges. At one 
point the property also housed horses in suitably ancient-looking stables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year we added something," he said. "It was ad-libbed. There was no 
architect." 
</P>
<P>
 For Friedman, the castle motif was actually his second choice, selected after 
he learned that building codes prohibited construction of a ship-shaped home in 
the style of a Spanish galleon. Friedman decided a hilltop castle would be the 
next best thing. Back then, the area was more rustic, he recalled: "You could 
take your horse, go out the back door and go seven miles without hitting a 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Friedman's castle has been the setting for many Hollywood 
movies and television shows, as well as charity events, including Halloween 
costume parties and sword-fighting demonstrations. "I've never yet had someone 
have a bad time here," Friedman said. "The house takes on a lot of beautiful 
atmospheres, particularly if it's a foggy night." 
</P>
<P>
 Atmosphere -- an air of sophistication, actually -- was what early Southern 
Californians sought when they built ornate European-style castles, many of 
which have not survived. Hollywood historian Marc Wanamaker said the years 1910 
to 1930 saw construction of many of the grandest castles. Two of the most 
impressive were within sight of each other: Castle Sans Souci, owned by Dr. A. 
G. Schloesser, and Castle Glengarry, which stood at Franklin Avenue and Argyle 
and was owned by actor Sessue Hayakawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of interest in Europe," Wananmaker said, "particularly in 
people who moved here from back East and the Midwest. They'd seen how the 
Vanderbilts and Rockefellers lived, and they wanted houses with that royal, 
noble feeling. It was a way of showing you had culture." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of those early castles are still standing, but have fallen on hard 
times. A 1927 castle on Peck Avenue in Point Fermin was subdivided into 
apartments before World War II. An 8,600-square-foot 1920 castle built by 
farmer Sylvester Dupuy, which still stands on Grandview Avenue in Alhambra, was 
also subdivided and fell into disrepair. In 1985, an American businessman based 
in Hong Kong bought it and announced plans to spend $500,000 to restore it. But 
it seems he underestimated the extent of the castle's dilapidation, for the 
property's ownership has now reverted to the mortgage holder, Bank of Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 In the exclusive Orange Country community of Cowan Heights, a half-built 
castle became a modern-day ruin amid luxury estates, and eventually was leveled 
without ever being completed. One mysterious castle, almost completely hidden 
in the hills near Laurel Canyon Boulevard, has bars on the windows and a tarp 
covering the roof. The reclusive original owner, Hjalmer Lindquist, made the 
papers when he died in 1962 and a will was found leaving the property to two 
neighbor ladies -- to whom he had never spoken until asking them for help on 
the day he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Many castle dwellers share Lindquist's passion for privacy, preferring to 
place their battlements alone and undisturbed. Among the castles whose owners 
beg anonymity are Malibu Castle, a prominent Malibu landmark visible from 
Pacific Coast Highway near Webb Way; the French-style Wolf's Lair, visible from 
Chuck Friedman's castle in the Hollywood Hills, and the immense, 
22,000-square-foot Rock Castle in Gardena. Despite living in exceedingly 
ostentatious surroundings, these castle owners insist they are really very 
quiet people who crave no publicity, please. 
</P>
<P>
 The love of privacy goes double for castle-owning celebrities. Don't even 
think about disturbing Madonna at her recently purchased home, Towerhill Castle 
in the Hollywood Hills, built by John DeLario and the site of many movie 
shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 And famed palimony-lawsuit filer Marvin Mitchelson is now the owner of Castle 
Kalmia on Sweetzer Avenue. His home is better know as the Castle of the Fairy 
Lady because of the generosity of the original owner, philanthropist Hersee 
Moody Carson, who used to open the castle for disadvantaged children to visit 
on the holidays in the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 While all castle owners share a dream of living a medieval lifestyle, one 
actually located her castle through a dream of sorts. In 1947, newly divorced 
Illinois resident Ethel Mills Bartholomew, had "a kind of vision that there was 
a castle out there for her," her son Dennis recalled. Mrs. Bartholomew lived in 
San Francisco and then in San Diego before finding her modest two-bedroom 
castle in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1928, the pink stucco castle features an entryway turret and a 
secluded, tiny moat and drawbridge, which face an inner courtyard hidden from 
the street. She hired artists to paint vines and flowers in the kitchen and 
dining room, and lived there until her death in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Bartholomew had intended to retire to the castle, which he lived in for 
just two years before taking a job in Sacramento. But he has now married and is 
looking for larger quarters. So the castle is going up for sale, along with the 
property's back yard apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Bartholomew should take inspiration from Robert Bond and Nancy Oliva. 
In 1986, they bought what they describe as a "rundown piece-of-junk 
1,400-square-foot house" and remodeled it into an authentic, 11th-Century 
Scottish castle more than four times larger. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial planner, Bond began formulating his castle-building strategy in 
1974, and even used it as a classroom example of how to achieve long-term 
goals. After finding and purchasing the perfect corner lot in the Valley and 
amassing three large boxes of information on low-cost and energy-saving 
materials, products and designs, the couple lived on-site during the two-year 
construction. "There was a plastic sheet for the east wall," Bond recalled. 
"People could have walked in at any time of the day or night!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Bond and Oliva think the energy-efficient result was well worth the 
hardships endured. "This is a happy castle," Bond said. "There's no dungeon. 
It's part playhouse, part treehouse. We're romantics." The couple held their 
wedding in the castle, complete with period music, dress, food -- and a 
castle-shaped cake. Oliva and Bond have also held numerous concerts and charity 
fund-raisers at the castle, which has excellent acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day when I came home, for years," Oliva said, "I'd take a tour around 
the house. It's not coming home to a house -- it's coming home to an 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 They've adorned the castle with authentic period herbs, and enjoy the view of 
the garden from their turret bedroom -- or dorter, in Scottish castle lingo. 
Even the bathrooms -- er, garderobes -- keep with the castle theme; they 
feature towels labeled "Her Royal Highness" and "His Majesty." 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sunday mornings we stretch out toe-to-toe on the window seat in the grand 
hall, read the paper and look at the trees, which are all flowering," Oliva 
said. "People who visit breathe a sigh of relief because it's just so peaceful 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their enjoyment of the castle, Oliva and Bond are considering a move 
to Raleigh, N.C. They plan to put their castle up for sale in June, 1994. "I 
fulfilled this dream," Bond said. "Now we'll simplify our lives and let someone 
else enjoy the beauty of this place."

HOT PROPERTY: ALEXIS DECAMPS FOR POINTS EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress JOAN COLLINS has sold her Beverly Hills home of seven years for just 
under $2 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, who was in more than 50 movies and 30 TV series before she became 
known as the "beauteous bitch" Alexis Carrington Colby on the nighttime TV soap 
"Dynasty," first put the house on the market in 1989 at $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "She spends a lot of time in Europe, so there is no need for her to have such 
a big spread here," said listing broker Paris Moskopoulos of Paris Realty, 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, 60, has homes in London, New York and Saint Tropez, sources say. "But 
she is thinking of buying a pied-a-terre here, where she has some projects," 
Moskopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress, also a best-selling novelist, appeared on TV last January in a 
guest role as Roseanne Arnold's British cousin. Last August, Collins reached a 
settlement for an undisclosed amount in a $20-million invasion-of-privacy 
lawsuit against a tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
 The home that Collins sold was built on a 1.6-acre knoll in the mid-1960s by 
late British actor Laurence Harvey. The one-story, 7,500-square-foot home was 
later owned by late comedienne Totie Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 After Collins bought it, she redecorated it, creating an all-pink master bath 
and other "Dynasty"-like features. "It's very dramatic, all marble and white," 
a former listing broker has said. The seven-bedroom home has views from nearly 
every room plus a mirrored bar, two-story guest house and fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins leased out the home twice at $50,000 a month -- once to actor Paul 
Hogan for nearly four months, sources say. The rest of the time, Collins used 
it, said Moskopoulos, who is retiring after many years as a Beverly Hills 
realtor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be going back and forth to Greece, where I was born and spent 18 years 
as an actor," he said. He plans to continue his sideline of chartering yachts 
as a business there. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Nelson of John Bruce Nelson & Associates represented the buyer, 
described as "a local banker" who had been living in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime "General Hospital" heartthrob STEVE BOND and his wife, CINDY, have 
put their Hidden Hills home on the market at $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "They built the home in 1990 and are selling now because they want to build 
another house in the area," said listing agent R. J. Thompson of Prudential 
Rodeo Realty in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond, who also starred in the soap "Santa Barbara," built a five-bedroom 
house; tennis court and lagoon pool with a waterfall on his 2.5-acre estate. An 
avid polo player, he also built stables and a riding arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles developer ALEXANDER COLER, who filed for bankruptcy last year, has 
dropped the asking prices on his Palm Springs homes by $1 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the homes, which he built in the 1980s, is on 18.5 acres and has a 
10,000-square-foot main house, 6,000-square-foot guest house, 52-foot-long 
swimming pool, sunken tennis court and three-green, nine-hole golf course. It's 
now priced at $4.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 His other home is on four acres and has a 7,000-square-foot main house, built 
in 1928; two guest houses and a pool house. The home was owned for many years 
by late oil tycoon Arthur Cameron, who was married to actress Ann Miller. It's 
priced at $2.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Both estates, which are in the old Las Palmas area of town -- settled by movie 
stars and industrialists -- are listed with Vic Domines, president of Bayside 
Investment Realty, a division of Bayside Financial Corp. in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Coler . . . his Beverly Hills house, once listed at $32.5 million 
but sold in a court-ordered sale last fall for $11.5 million, is back on the 
market at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Youri Fadayev, the young Russian banker who bought the house last November in 
a spirited bidding war with prices leaping as much as $500,000 at a time, has 
re-listed it with Bruce Nelson of John Bruce Nelson & Associates and Dan Cristo 
of Gilleran, Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-bedroom, 37,000-square-foot home, which Coler built in 1988, has two 
bowling lanes, a cut-crystal dining-room floor looking down to an indoor pool, 
and a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Former "Night Court" writer/producer KEVIN KELTON has purchased a four-story 
home in the hills of Sherman Oaks for more than $1 million below the original 
asking price of $1.5 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelton, whose TV credits include writing for Eddie Murphy and Billy Crystal 
during two seasons with "Saturday Night Live," bought the 5,000-square-foot 
house, built four years ago but never occupied until now, for an estimated 
quarter of its $1.7-million assessed value. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which has an elevator and panoramic Valley views, had been listed 
with Roy Sulka of Jon Douglas Co.'s Encino office.

CONDO Q & A: CAN ASSOCIATION CHARGE RENTAL 'MOVE-IN FEE'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hickenbottom is a past president of 
the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), 
a national nonprofit research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My condominium association recently billed me for a "move-in fee" 
because tenants moved into the unit that I own. I think that charging a move-in 
fee is illegal. A former manager stated that the association can charge only 
for damage that occurs during the move. Does the association have the authority 
to charge this fee? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The association has the right to bill the owner for any damage that 
results from a move. In addition, if the association can substantiate the fee 
based on actual services that are provided to the new resident, then the 
association has the right to pass the cost along to the owner. It is illegal 
for the association to charge an unreasonable fee that is unrelated to the 
association's actual costs. All owners should be treated equally, whether they 
are living in their unit or renting it out to tenants. In my opinion, it would 
be discriminatory to charge a move-in fee only when the unit is rented to a 
tenant. All owners should be informed about any fees that the board establishes 
for move-in or move-out or other special circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 You have a right to know the reason for the fee. You may be unaware of the 
services that were provided to your tenant, so ask for an explanation. Costs 
might result from staff services relating to elevator use, providing common 
area keys, changing the directory listing or setting up the entry phone 
connection. Should Board Replace Play Equipment? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our homeowner association's five-member board is considering the 
replacement of expensive playground equipment that was vandalized by some of 
the older children in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Our association cannot afford to purchase unnecessary items. Our financial 
condition is suffering because of some delinquent owners. 
</P>
<P>
 We have two owners who want the playground equipment replaced because they are 
providing child-care services. Two children have had minor injuries in the past 
so we are concerned about the association's liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Two board members have their units listed for sale so they want the playground 
equipment to make their units more desirable to potential buyers. The other 
board members do not feel that we are obligated to replace the equipment, 
especially since it may be destroyed again. Perhaps the decision should be put 
to a vote of the owners because of all of the complicating issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Three board members do not want to replace the equipment but the other two 
board members constantly bring up this matter. Are we wrong if we don't vote to 
replace the equipment? Should all of the owners vote on it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It sounds like you have already taken a board vote but the three that were 
in the majority are still feeling the pressure from the other two. I'm sure 
that you don't want animosity among the board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Your dilemma could be resolved by discussing the following questions: What is 
fair for everyone? Should the day-care providers expect the association to 
replace the equipment even if it is a hardship for the association to pay the 
cost? Do the day-care providers have adequate liability insurance and have the 
parents of the children signed an agreement freeing the association from 
liability? Is the playground an important amenity for all of the owners? Does 
it enhance the value of the property? Does it increase the association's 
liability or insurance costs? Is it fair to all of the owners to vote and let a 
simple majority decide the fate of an amenity? Would a special assessment be 
needed or does the association have reserve funds to pay for the replacement? 
Are these reserve funds needed for other immediate priorities? Could the 
association recover the cost from the owners whose children were responsible 
for destroying it? Does the association have insurance to cover vandalism? What 
is the best solution that is fair and reasonable? Is the solution good for the 
whole association? 
</P>
<P>
 If the association does not have the funds to replace the equipment, the board 
should provide all of the pertinent details to the owners and invite their 
input at a board meeting. If a majority of the board members want the owners to 
vote, then do so at a special meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, the equipment should probably be replaced unless the board 
determines that it would be highly imprudent to do so after weighing all of the 
issues. After the decision is made by either a board vote or owners' vote, the 
board members should agreeably abide by the decision of the majority and 
refrain from reviving the controversy at subsequent meetings. Number of Renters 
Disturbs Residents 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We reside in a homeowner association in Orange County. The association's 
declaration states that the homes are "single-family residences." One of our 
neighbors has six or eight male boarders. Some of these men share one room, 
sleeping in the bed in shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 We are worried about the welfare of our children because of the large number 
of renters who are strangers. We also have a parking problem because of limited 
parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any way that the association can enforce the single-family concept 
and get rid of the large number of renters? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you live in an incorporated area of Orange County, you may get some help 
from your city officials. Find out if the city allows bedroom rentals. Your 
neighbor may be in violation of local zoning codes or health and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the wording in the association's declaration of covenants, conditions and 
restrictions (CC&Rs) is clear and specific, you may be able to prohibit or 
limit the number of your neighbor's tenants. For example, if the association's 
legal documents clearly limit occupancy to two people per bedroom, then 
enforcement of that restriction is more likely. The association board should 
seek the advice of an attorney who specializes in community association law to 
find out if the wording in the governing documents is enforceable. If so, then 
the association should vigorously pursue enforcement before rentals and 
overcrowding become more prevalent.

YOUR MORTGAGE; QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN SCREENING TO FIND BEST LENDER FOR DEAL

 How do I shop for a loan? 
</P>
<P>
 In order to meet the customary 30-day financing contingency deadline, a lender 
must be selected and a loan application completed within several days after the 
purchase contract is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 First you need to know where to look for a loan. Most buyers get home loans 
from savings and loans, mortgage banks or commercial banks. These are referred 
to as lenders. Many buyers use the services of a mortgage broker who acts as an 
intermediary between the borrower and the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask friends and associates who bought a home or refinanced recently for a 
recommendation if they were satisfied with the service they received. Your real 
estate agent can provide you with lender rate sheets and can make 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 After you've generated a list of possible money sources, call a representative 
of each and ask the following questions:  
</P>
<P>
 -- What types of home loan programs do you offer? Not all lenders provide all 
loan programs. For example, if you want an adjustable rate mortgage with an 
interest rate that's fixed for more than a year, your financing sources will be 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What are your current interest rates? For ARMs, you'll also want to know 
how long the initial interest rate will be in effect; the fully indexed rate; 
the margin; the index; the interest rate and monthly payment adjustment 
schedule; the interest rate caps (periodic and lifetime); if negative 
amortization is possible, and if the loan is convertible to a fixed rate at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What are your loan fees and when are they paid? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What are your qualifying ratios? Briefly review your financial situation 
with each lender to make sure there's a good chance you'll be approved for a 
loan before you apply. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) or an impound account (for property 
taxes and insurance) be required? What will this cost? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is it possible to lock-in an interest rate? When can a rate be locked-in? 
What will it cost? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How long will it take to approve a loan? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does loan approval and processing occur locally? Processing a loan long 
distance can result in frustrating delays. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will you give me a written loan commitment? Some lenders only give verbal 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do your loans have prepayment penalties? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do you require termite work to be completed by closing? 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the sellers have agreed to pay for some or all of your non-recurring 
closing costs, ask if the lender will allow this. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will you provide references of recent customers? Be sure to check 
references. You're looking for a loan you can live with, and also for someone 
who'll process your loan efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find this list daunting, or if you're short on time, you may want to 
use a mortgage broker to shop for a loan for you. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: There's usually an inverse relationship between the interest 
rate and points (origination fees) charged on a loan: the lower the interest 
rate, the higher the points, and vice versa. Points on a purchase loan are tax 
deductible in the year of purchase, so you may want to pay higher upfront fees 
for a lower interest rate. If you're cash-strapped, however, you may need a 
low-point loan with a higher rate. Be aware that some no-point loans have 
prepayment penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: Buyers of homes in new developments are wise to use a lender 
who's experienced in financing new homes. You may get the best service by going 
with a lender who has processed loans for other buyers who have purchased homes 
in the same development.

'SHORT' SALE MAY HAVE TAX CONSEQUENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with great interest your headline article titled "Strapped Homeowners 
Sell 'Short'," (Dec. 19) a very well researched and written article, although I 
would like to add a little. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two paragraphs state that homeowners who have refinanced should be 
aware of the tax consequences of a short payoff.In fact, any situation where 
the lender is not paid in full (foreclosure or paid as agreed) the seller owes 
taxes for the theoretical gain. I only point this out because readers may 
decide that they can escape payment of taxes and then have their plans ruined 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously the best thing in such a situation would be to go for the short pay 
and save one's credit. But how this is done can be critical. Thus anyone in a 
short pay situation should contact a good real estate attorney and then a good 
real estate broker who can advise them of all their options and save them from 
some very dangerous people who could take advantage of a sad situation.

FLYERS CREATE CRIME AND LITTER HAZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Safe at Home: Local Crime Prevention Efforts are Neighborhood's Best 
Protection" (Dec. 19) was an excellent survey of steps each of us can take to 
minimize the risk of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 However getting someone to "pick up your mail, newspapers of other items that 
signal that no one is home" is easier said than done. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since postal rates began to climb so have the number of hand-delivered, 
unsolicited commercial flyers thrown on our front porches and driveways, hung 
from door knobs, tucked into door jambs and even affixed with tape to our front 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 On some days delivers by one service are made in the morning while another 
service adds to the litter in the afternoon. Our residentially zoned homes are 
being usurped for commercial billboards without our consent or compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is first and foremost a matter of public safety. When a resident is 
planning to be out of town, they can ask the newspaper and post office to stop 
delivery. This cannot be done with the various companies and individuals who 
are continually distributing these flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for First Amendment protections -- distribution of newspapers, religious, 
charitable and political messages is clearly protected. It's time our cities 
had ordinances to put a stop to this growing, crime-inducing, litter-creating 
problem of the hand-distribution of unsolicited commercial advertisements.

EXPERIENCE COUNTS IN DESIGN PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Designer/builders do not like the inference that builders and contractors are 
not professional, as suggested by architect Andres M. Cardenes of Culver City 
(Dec. 12) where he states: "The builder is a business person, the contractor is 
a service person and the architect is the professional." 
</P>
<P>
 While we contractors are not "the pharmacist" that he suggests and the 
architect is not "the physician," we all learn in life by our education and 
training and by our years of experience that one earns plaudits not by dictum 
nor by license, but rather by performance. 
</P>
<P>
 As my design/build life evolved through the years, I came to respect talents 
as they applied to the specific task. I found that all architects are not 
specifically capable of designing all types of projects, nor am I.

 Once again we builders, struggling to preserve our sense of worth and ability, 
have been attacked in the media. Not only are we witness to endless editorials 
about how disreputable we are, but now we are attacked by architects, no less, 
in the Letters to the Editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners and architects must awaken to the fact that the building process must 
include the designated contractor from the inception of the project. Not only 
will that insure that what might look good on a plan can be actually built and 
function, but that the home can even afford to be built. Project cost analysis 
is not a requisite to join the American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to the architect in the Dec. 12 letters, I have a more appropriate 
analogy: 
</P>
<P>
 If your car breaks down, who would you rather have under the hood; a qualified 
mechanic or some dreamer in Detroit who decided that he just had to have that 
third tail fin?

 I read the two letters Dec. 12 from the architects who were concerned that 
calling a contractor first for rebuilding or new construction was not the 
correct procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I believe Gina G. Moffitt, AIA, who feels that the contractors have 
no knowledge about city and state requirements such as grading, drainage, 
Coastal Commission, etc., to be shortsighted and incorrect. Any contractor who 
has experience knows these codes and laws very clearly. If they build one house 
with all the above requirements, they've gone through the process.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Spray for pests and diseases now while your garden is dormant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give the lawn a light feeding now to give it a boost prior to spring.  
</P>
<P>
 * Plant azaleas and camellias this month. They're in bloom so you can select 
your favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perk up the garden with ornamental vegetables such as flowering kale and 
cabbage.  
</P>
<P>
 * Pre-emergence control for crabgrass can be applied to your lawn this month.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: REMOTE-CONTROL GAS FIREPLACE IS EFFICIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I'm tired of the mess when I burn wood in my fireplace. Can I 
replace it easily with a new remote-controlled gas fireplace? Is a gas 
fireplace efficient and what features should I look for in one? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: With new gas fireplaces, it is difficult to distinguish the gas log 
flames from real wood flames. Special burner materials and orifice patterns 
create the natural look. The rest of the fireplace front is identical to a 
wood-burning model in appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the golden flame color, some gas fireplaces have efficiencies as 
high as 80%, probably more efficient than your furnace. Most designs have 
air-circulation blowers and wall thermostat options. With a 40,000 Btu/hour 
heat output, a gas fireplace can easily heat a small house. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't currently have a fireplace, there are easy-to-install 
"zero-clearance" gas fireplaces available. Zero clearance means that they have 
multi-layer insulated sheet metal sides. 
</P>
<P>
 This allows you to build them into a wall, directly against the studs, without 
creating a fire hazard. These can vent flue gases horizontally through an 
outside wall so you needn't build a chimney. If you install one in an existing 
fireplace, you can vent it vertically up the chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 The convenience features of gas fireplaces also increase their efficiency. 
From your sofa, you can use a hand-held remote control (like a TV remote) to 
start the fire, control the blower speeds and heat output. This avoids wasteful 
overheating and longer fires than are actually needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealed direct vent designs are energy efficient and safe. Flue gases vent 
directly out the fireplace back to outdoors. Through the same double-wall 
concentric pipe or a separate pipe, outdoor combustion air comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 This eliminates the loss of heated room air up the flue and chilly drafts 
inside your home. Since there is adequate outdoor air intake, the chance of 
incomplete combustion and backdrafting fumes into your room is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Multi- or variable-speed room air-circulation blowers improve comfort and 
energy savings. A wall-mounted thermostat connected to your gas fireplace, like 
a furnace thermostat, maintains a fairly even room temperature. It switches the 
burners up or down depending on the heating needs. 
</P>
<P>
 A few models have variable heat output burners. With three or four heat 
levels, you can maintain a constant room temperature. The burners are located 
forward and rear, so even on low, the flames look like wood flames.

ASK THE INDOOR GARDENER; WHAT, WHEN TO FEED HOUSEPLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rapp is a Los Angeles free-lance writer 
who, as Mr. Mother Earth, has written several best-selling books on indoor 
gardening. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: How often should I feed my houseplants and what kind of fertilizer 
should I use? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Indoor plants should be fed once a week during their growing season, 
which is roughly from spring through fall.In southern California one might 
think the growing season for houseplants would last all yearlong, and that is 
essentially true. But growth slows considerably from the beginning of December 
through the end of March, so your plants should be given a rest from feeding 
during those months. Use a good liquid houseplant food (such as Miracle Gro or 
Shultz) mixed with water according to bottle directions. Do Houseplants Live 
Longer in Clay Pots? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A friend of mine told me that houseplants live longer in clay pots than 
plastic pots? Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not exactly. What your friend meant was that since clay (terra cotta) pots 
are porous and plastic pots are not, there's less chance of overwatering plants 
in clay than in plastic, and since overwatering is the number one cause of 
houseplant death, putting all your plants in clay pots is a very good idea. 
When whitish deposits appear on the sides of your clay pots, simply wash them 
off with soapy water. And if moss develops on the sides of the pots, leave it 
on -- that look is very much "in" these days!

LOAN DEFAULTS DROP STATEWIDE FOR THE THIRD MONTH IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of recorded notices of default dropped for the third month in a row 
in November, indicating that foreclosure activity in California has peaked and 
is on its way down, a real estate information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders started foreclosure proceedings on 9,112 homes last month, down from 
9,663 in October, 10,138 in September and 10,954 in August, Dataquick 
Information Systems reported. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-time statewide peak was reached last June with 12,054 recorded notices 
of default. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does take a while for these properties to work their way through the 
system. The market will be absorbing distressed homes for most of 1994 and 
overall prices will be held down, which is good for potential buyers," said 
Donald L. Cohn, Dataquick CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is good to see that the worst of the problem is behind us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A notice of default is the first step in the formal foreclosure process. It 
can take a lender up to six months or more to complete the process, which is 
halted if the homeowner brings mortgage payments current, or sells the property 
and pays off the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreclosure hits at all segments of the market. In Beverly Hills there are 
currently 45 homes being foreclosed on, 28 in the Bel Air area and 21 in 
Malibu. There are 108 homes in foreclosure statewide that were originally 
purchased for more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the foreclosure homes, though, are middle-of-the-road 
three-bedroom, two-bathroom houses bought for $150,000 to $200,000 four years 
ago when prices were increasing rapidly. Home Loan Defaults in '93

 It was almost two years ago that 15-year-old Adam Bischoff was swept to his 
death in the rain-swollen Los Angeles River. Rescuers tried in vain to catch 
Adam, who fell in the river in Woodland Hills during a heavy rainstorm and was 
carried 10 miles downriver. Since then, swift-water rescue procedures have 
improved and ongoing training in the Los Angeles city and county fire 
departments has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a few inches of rain can make the normally quiet flood-control channel a 
raging river. Officials report an average of six drownings a year in the 
county's more than 600 miles of flood-control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Both city and county fire departments deploy their swift-water units when 
intense rain is expected. The county has trained personnel in swift-water 
rescue since the mid-1980s, while the city is fairly new to the procedure. 
Saving a Life 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue depends on the situation -- a victim injured or weak from 
hypothermia can't grab a thrown flotation device, making the rescue more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of Los Angeles River rescues are shore-based, which requires 
rescuers to either go into the water to grab a victim, throw a flotation device 
or use a rescue net. Helicopters are used only as a last resort. Both fire 
departments are testing the use of fast, small water craft like jet skis. 
Mapping a Rescue 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers with the L.A. City Fire Department have a Los Angeles River map 
programmed into their computers giving width, depth and length of the river 
along certain stretches. Given the victim's location and speed of the river's 
flow, rescue units are deployed to points downstream from the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifics from a section of map from Calabasas Creek to Sepulveda Flood 
Control Basin, a distance of 5.5 miles: 
</P>
<P>
 Channel width: 70 feet to 120 feet 
</P>
<P>
 Channel depth: 18 feet to 27 feet 
</P>
<P>
 From Reseda Boulevard to flood basin: Would take victim 9 minutes, 27 seconds 
to float 1.75-mile distance at average peak flow of 11 m.p.h. River Dynamics 
</P>
<P>
 For most of its 58-mile length, the Los Angeles River is concrete with sloped 
walls. The most dangerous spots are where there are drops in elevation and 
vertical walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloping walls: Angle of river walls varies from 30 degrees to 90 degrees. 
Small parts of the river bottom are natural but for most of its length the 
bottom is concrete, which is difficult for victim or rescuer to hold onto. 
</P>
<P>
 Vertical walls: There are spots where the river drops in elevation, forming a 
small waterfall that leads to a narrow channel. Water passing through this 
channel churns rapidly, causing a "hydraulic effect," where the current 
reverses and recirculates over the same area. Firefighters call this area a 
"death trap" or "drowning machine" because it is nearly impossible for a victim 
to escape. Gear 
</P>
<P>
 Swift-water rescuers are outfitted to deal with slippery concrete surfaces and 
cold water. Goggles Helmet Whistle Tennis shoes or dive booties Neoprene 
wetsuit Inflatable vest Obstacles 
</P>
<P>
 Strainers: Firefighters call river obstructions "strainers." Strainers -- 
rocks, trees, furniture or fencing -- are dangerous in rescues because a victim 
or rescuer can get caught in them and drown. 
</P>
<P>
 Force of water: Fast-moving water can quickly sap a victim's strength. It 
takes 300 pounds of pressure for a victim to extract himself from a strainer in 
water moving 9 m.p.h. The force of water moving 30 m.p.h. is about 1,600 pounds 
per square inch. Hypothermia 
</P>
<P>
 Hypothermia can occur even during warm months, but it is hastened with cooler 
air and water temperatures. Hypothermia weakens muscles and slows heart rate, 
which may stop if body temperature falls below 90 degrees. The L.A. River 
averages about 50 degrees in the winter. Below is a chart estimating how much 
useful work a rescuer can accomplish at varying temperatures and how long it 
takes to become unconscious: 
</P>
<P>
 * Temperature: 40 degrees Useful work: 7.5 minutes Unconscious: 30 minutes 
</P>
<P>
 * Temperature: 50 degrees Useful work: 15 minutes Unconscious: 1 hour 
</P>
<P>
 * Temperature: 60 degrees Useful work: 30 minutes Unconscious: 2 hours Bridge 
rescue 
</P>
<P>
 Spotter stands on upstream side of bridge, tells whether victim is moving 
"river right" or "river left." Two rescuers on downstream side hold 25 feet of 
inflated fire hose by two ropes, dropping hose into water as victim approaches. 
Curtain rescue 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue curtain is strung across river at about a 60-degree angle to prevent 
drag. At least two rescuers stand on each shore, holding ropes attached to 
curtain bottom. Curtain slides on top rope, which is anchored to shore, as 
rescuers pull bottom ropes to position curtain near victim. Curtain acts as 
net, entangling victim who may be too weak to grab. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtain: Made of 1-inch nylon webbing with 2-inch border, strength to 4,000 
pounds. Size is about 6x20 feet, with 12-inch diameter holes.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FOLLOW THE FRAGRANCE TO DYNAMITE THAI FOOD 
</P>

 Although the Noochlaor siblings had no restaurant experience while growing up 
in Thailand, they did have the daily benefit of their mother's fragrant 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 When they moved to Los Angeles, the memories of those good home meals turned 
into their livelihood -- the two brothers and one sister each own a restaurant. 
The most acclaimed is younger brother Soporn's storefront Thai restaurant, Vim, 
on the eastern fringe of Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Soporn Noochlaor began his restaurant career in 1971, washing dishes at his 
brother's restaurant while going to school at night. He landed a job at General 
Motors but grew weary of layoffs -- five times in seven years -- and decided to 
strike out on his own. In 1982, he took over Vim from his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 The only splashes of color are the fresh carnations on each Formica table. The 
main visual delights are the heaping portions of colorful Thai food. 
</P>
<P>
 You can be assured of getting good fish here; five days a week, Noochlaor 
shops at the fish markets of Downtown and Chinatown. One Vim dish that I drive 
out of my way for is the oysters with ginger and oyster sauce ($5.95). Five 
plump, succulent oysters are joined in the rich sauce with red bell peppers, 
green onions and plenty of button mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Other good selections are the crispy sliced catfish with a spicy hot sauce 
($6.50) and the tender beef with green chiles, garlic and mint ($5.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Vim offers 17 soups, the most popular being the spicy seafood soup ($7.50), 
chicken stock enhanced with peppers and Thai spices and crammed with fresh crab 
meat, squid, mussels, shrimp and red snapper. Although not listed on the menu, 
ask for the pineapple rice ($5.95), a pineapple shell filled with rice, 
chicken, shrimp, pork and chunks of pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vim is at 831 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 480-8159. Open Wednesday 
through Monday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

GRATEFUL GRIDDERS FINISH SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
 The varsity football players and coaching staff of Jefferson High School would 
like to thank you for your support and interest during the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, many people are involved in the football program in one way or another. 
Without the support of parents, teachers, administrators, friends, students and 
others, we could not function.

THANKS FOR THE FIRESTONE MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed your historic look at the Firestone sheriff's station ("A Farewell 
to Firestone," Dec. 19) -- it brought back some unusual memories. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a reporter for the Los Angeles Mirror starting in 1957.My beat was the 
Firestone sheriff's station. It was the first time that a reporter had been 
assigned there, and in fact, about the first time a reporter ever even stopped 
in there to look at the press board. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a few weeks for them (Ralph Wyatt and Sid Jolivette were there then) 
to get accustomed to having a reporter just hang around. 
</P>
<P>
 As you may know, the relationship between the media and the cops was different 
35 to 40 years ago. If a robbery came down, chances are I'd be sitting at some 
vacant desk in the detective bureau and would run out with the assigned 
detectives to the scene. They really liked to see their "pix" in the paper, and 
that helped pave the way for a working relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, thanks for the chance to relive a little of that past life.

GAME OF THE WEEK; CRENSHAW MAKES SHORT WORK OF BANNING, 54-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bad news for the Banning High School basketball team was that they trailed 
Crenshaw by 40 points only 3:05 seconds into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for Banning was that the game was called when Pilot Coach Marc 
Paez was ejected after receiving his third technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw won the Southern Pacific game, 54-14, at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Paez) complained about the hard play because Crenshaw was doing a lot of 
hand-checking but that's going to happen," said six-year referee Eugene Conner. 
"When a coach is assessed a technical foul, he loses the opportunity to use the 
coaches' box and can't pace the sidelines. I talked to him and warned him to 
stay seated but he persisted." 
</P>
<P>
 Federation rules state that if a coach receives three technical fouls the game 
is over. "In Los Angeles City Section, since there are not paid assistant 
coaches, when the head coach goes, the game is over," City Section Athletic 
Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Crenshaw (13-2, 2-0) was playing, having the game stopped was the best 
thing that could have happened for Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars took an early 12-1 lead while shooting 16-for-19 from the field -- 
an uncanny 84% -- in the first quarter. During one stretch, Banning went 5:04 
without a field goal. Crenshaw closed out the quarter with a 20-3 run to lead 
39-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Tremaine Fowlkes, who scored 11 points and grabbed six rebounds, had 
eight points in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Banning made only five out of 15 shots in the game, going 
3-for-10 in the first quarter. The Pilots were 4-for-11 (36%) from the line 
while Crenshaw made seven out of 10 free throws (70%). 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilots' leading scorer for the season, Jason Pickett, missed both of his 
shots in the first quarter and went 0-for-4 in the game. Banning was paced by 
forward Brian Perkins who had seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's trio of Fowlkes, Kris Johnson (12 points) and Reggie McFerren (21 
points) combined to shoot 17-for-21 (81%) from the field to score 44 of the 
Cougars' 54 points. 
</P>
<P>
 CRENSHAW -- Davis 7, McFerren 21, Davis 3, Fowlkes 11, K. Johnson 12. 
</P>
<P>
 BANNING -- McCrimmon 6, Perkins 7, Patterson 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Crenshaw 13-2, 2-0.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; SECOND EFFORT LIFTS LACC OVER TRADE TECH, 69-58 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Los Angeles City College is playing the best basketball among local community 
colleges. But before the third-ranked team in the state could stake its claim 
to No. 1 in the area, it had to beat last year's best, Trade Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing 39-32 at halftime, LACC scored the first nine points of the 
second half en route to a 69-58 win Friday night in a Southern California 
Athletic Conference game at Trade Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked up the intensity in the second half because we knew whoever wanted 
to win the most would," said LACC guard Markee Brown, who scored a game-high 19 
points. "Tonight, I had to step up my game." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Terry Green, who led the Beavers with 18 points, shouldered much of 
the offensive burden for Trade Tech (12-11, 0-1 in conference) in the second 
half. Green hit back-to-back three pointers to bring Trade Tech to within two, 
45-43, early in the second half. Green also had five rebounds and two steals 
and scored 12 points in the first half to help give Trade Tech an early 18-14 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 After Trade Tech's second-half scoring run, Brown capped a 14-7 LACC run with 
a short baseline jumper to increase the Cubs' lead to 59-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Sai Tuialii scored 18 points, 14 in the second half, for LACC (19-3, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. CITY COLLEGE -- Muhammad 4, Bean 2, Higgins 9, Brown 19, Tuialii 18, 
Moore 2, Dorsey 8, Thomas 2, Cotwright 5. 
</P>
<P>
 TRADE TECH -- Lew 10, Dawson 3, Crutchfield 9, Green 18, Wesby 5, Yoakum 2, 
Martin 4, Wade 2, McDowell 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: LACC 19-3, 1-0 in conference; Trade Tech 12-11, 0-1.

MANUAL ARTS FALLS TO WESTCHESTER, 86-78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westchester discovered the best way to defend David Rickenbacker of Manual 
Arts was to prevent the 6-foot-5 forward from getting the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickenbacker scored 21 points, most from inside the key, but was not much of a 
factor as the Comets beat the Toilers 86-78 Wednesday in a game matching the 
two best teams of the Coastal Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester (16-3), which used an effective pressure defense and prevented the 
Toilers from setting up their offense, also made 21 of 24 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got to every loose ball and hit their free throws," Manual Arts Coach 
Randolph Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester held its largest lead, 44-26, after Cullen Countee made a 15-foot 
jump shot to start the third quarter. The Toilers fought back and outscored the 
Comets, 17-9, before Rickenbacker sat down with his third foul with 4:17 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes later, the Toilers (12-4) had a chance to cut the deficit to six, 
but forward John Thompson missed a shot when he was fouled hard by Comet 
forward Kelly Washington. Thompson was given a technical foul when he threw the 
ball at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Toiler guard Jasmine Johnson hit a three-point shot at the end of third 
quarter and Thompson hit another three-point shot to begin the fourth quarter 
as the Toilers pulled to within three, 60-57. 
</P>
<P>
 But a six-point Comet scoring run was followed by a 10-minute delay in the 
game as school police broke up a fight in the visitors' seating area, and the 
momentum seemed to shift again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the technical foul and the fight took away our momentum," Simpson 
said. "We beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 MANUAL ARTS -- Johnson 3, Dawson 6, Rickenbacker 21, Thompson 25, Carter 9, 
Luckett 8, Pinckney 4, Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
 WESTCHESTER -- Smith 4, Sanders 5, Washington 6, Countee 20, Young 6, Hart 6,

<P>
 Bell High thrashed defending City Section champion Fremont, 5-0, on the 
Eagles' home field Wednesday, avenging last season's 2-1 semifinal loss to the 
Pathfinders in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory makes Bell the Central League conference leader with a 6-0-1 
overall record. The Pathfinders are 3-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles offense broke loose after 15 minutes of relatively even play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their first two goals were a result of beating our offsides trap," said 
Fremont Coach Luis Rosales. "After that, they took control and then there was 
never really any doubt of Bell's domination." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell striker Jorge Iberri scored the first two goals, both on breakaways. 
Oswaldo Williams put the Eagles up 3-0 by the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Orellana scored early in the second half and Dennis Vela's header into 
the net completed the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Wednesday games: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson 1, Lincoln 1 -- The Democrats scored in the first minute on a 
defensive mistake and Melvin Hernandez evened the score from 25 yards out in 
the 35th minute of the Northwestern League match. Lincoln goalie Jose Guevara 
made two critical one-on-one saves late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont 6, Marshall 0 -- Jose Salmeron, Jose Ramirez and Eric Hernandez each 
scored twice for the Sentinels' Northeast League blowout at home. Salmeron 
tallied Belmont's only first-half goal. Hernandez made his team's fifth goal 
late in the second half, scoring on a fine individual effort by beating three 
defenders and the goalie at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson 2, Hollywood 1 -- The Sheiks scored an own goal with five minutes 
remaining to give the Mules a Northern Conference victory; Mule striker Victor 
Arana was awarded the goal. Rene Gonzalez stole the ball from a Hollywood 
defender three minutes into the first half and passed it to Victor Arana, who 
scored after dribbling past two defenders and beating the goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro 2, Crenshaw 0 -- Marcos Vargas and Michael DiMassa scored on passes 
by Ive Grgas to give the Pirates their fourth consecutive victory in Southern 
Pacific Conference action. Early in the first half, Grgas cut down the middle 
of Cougar territory and made a short pass to Vargas, who shot the ball from 
just inside the penalty area. DiMassa scored on a breakaway with a powerful low 
shot early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield 3, Jordan 0 -- Romeo Cordova scored twice and Julio Munoz capped it 
off with a third goal for Garfield in an Eastern League win at home.  
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt 3, Huntington Park 0 -- Luis Contreras scored 14 seconds into the 
game to put the Roughriders on the road to victory in an Eastern League game. 
After forward Vicente Mejia stole the ball from a Spartan player at kickoff, he 
sent a long pass into the penalty box where Alfonso Fuentes trapped the ball 
and shot it. When the Spartan goalie couldn't handle the ball, Contreras 
rebounded for the only goal in the first half. In the 70th minute Roughrider 
Agustin Lopez scored off a cross from David Medina. Contreras scored again with 
two minutes remaining on a deflection at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts 3, Palisades 1 -- Forward Jorge Escobar hit the ball on a corner 
kick, curling it inside the Dolphins' far post in the first half to lead the 
Toilers to a Coastal Conference win. Gustavo Moran tallied on a cannonball 
outside the goal area in the 48th minute and Edwin Rivera converted a penalty 
kick in the 58th minute. Palisades scored its only goal in the 70th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate 2, Locke 1 -- Ram midfielder Carlos Osorio scored the winning goal 
on a rebound from a scrimmage inside the penalty box in the Central League 
contest. Striker Eric Salazar scored the first goal for South Gate on an 
individual play and Saint forward Ricardo Chavez put in the equalizer 10 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield 1, Roosevelt 0 -- Julio Munoz put in the winner Monday in a tight 
Eastern League victory at Roosevelt.

VOICES: LESSONS FROM THE DEEP SOUTH; A POLICE CAPTAIN FINDS THE SILVER LINING 
OF HIS SEGREGATED UPBRINGING, CREDITING IT WITH GIVING HIM A USEFUL TALENT FOR 
DIPLOMACY AND CULTURAL TOLERANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIE L. PANNELL, Los Angeles Police Capt. Willie L. Pannell, 46, commander 
of the Southeast Division, grew up in the segregated South. He credits his 
background with teaching him tolerance and enabling him to achieve a role of 
responsibility. He was interviewed by Laurie K. Schenden. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We were sharecroppers. I started working with my grandfather as a child, and 
worked cotton and corn till I was about 17. We owned our own mule and got 
one-third of the gross for working the entire property. One year we made $300.  
</P>
<P>
 We lived in Phoenix City, Ala., about 35 miles south of Columbus, Ga. In 
school we had chores -- we filled the potbellied stove with coal to keep warm; 
we got our water from the well. 
</P>
<P>
 I never thought about anything different from this life until we got 
electricity. It was the early '50s when we first heard radio. When I was 8 or 9 
years old, some people in the neighborhood got a TV. On certain nights, 
everybody in the neighborhood would come to that house to watch TV. Communities 
were very strong then. 
</P>
<P>
 We would drive our wagon and tie the mule to a tree -- no one would think of 
stealing it -- and we would board the bus. The blacks got on the back part of 
the bus, and whites came in the front door. There was a line that divided the 
two areas. I realized at that point already where I stood. I never ate in a 
restaurant. We got our food out of a little hole in the back of the building. 
It didn't make me angry; it made me tolerant.  
</P>
<P>
 You grew up knowing where your place was, and if you didn't understand that, 
you were in trouble. It gave me tolerance to understand you ain't going to gain 
anything by standing up and publicly challenging people. You start to look at 
how can you work things out diplomatically. My granddad always told me, "Son, 
you've got to educate yourself, you've got to be the best you can be, work as 
hard as you can. You can't be considered shiftless and lazy. Don't compromise 
your principles, but be a diplomat." 
</P>
<P>
 So what I've worked on is not compromising my principles but not being 
confrontational. When working with people, particularly dealing with the power 
structure, you have to give people room to compromise.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't think, if my grandfather saw where I am today, he'd know how to handle 
it. My granddaddy never lived past segregation; he couldn't fathom me sitting 
in a restaurant in a fashionable area of Los Angeles, ordering anything I want 
without having to go to the back door to get it.  
</P>
<P>
 Are all these things still with me? Sure they are. When I first came on the 
job in 1969, I'd been here about a month and a training officer said: "You 
know, I'm going to have to fire you, because you black folks are all lazy. What 
is it with y'all that you only work if a white man is sitting beside you with 
his foot in your behind?" 
</P>
<P>
 I said to myself, if I say what I want to say to this guy, I'll be fired 
within the next 15 minutes and I'll never have a chance to be in a position to 
help anybody else -- to make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone else. The 
only way you can make sure is to promote yourself in the position where you 
have the power to control those kinds of things.  
</P>
<P>
 That became a goal: to put myself in the position to have some kind of 
positive influence on society and the people around me. A lot of people fear 
that if there's a black captain, he'll just be looking out for black folks. 
What I am is a captain of police for the city of Los Angeles. About 50% of my 
employees are male whites, and I have to be able to get them to work for me. I 
have to treat them fairly. The idea is to make sure no one gets stepped on 
because of ethnicity or gender or lifestyle, those kinds of things. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast Division is a very high crime area. In the last couple of years 
there's been mistrust by the citizens of police officers. There are officers in 
this area who do not have the best interest of the community in mind, while 
others will risk their lives for the community. The few bad ones will make 
things bad for everybody.  
</P>
<P>
 I ask my officers, do you understand why, when you talk to a black male, he 
appears to be hostile? He may even threaten to fight you. If you saw the 
difference between that and if you stopped a male white in West L.A., I'd say 
that the difference is that the guy in West L.A. has access to an attorney. He 
knows how to get in contact with a councilperson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young black doesn't have any other way of venting his frustration 
other than verbally. And so you find yourself on a confrontational level. The 
officers don't understand some of those things. 
</P>
<P>
 What we do here is talk about things that are unique to our area. There are 
some 150 languages spoken in Los Angeles. Cultural things that happen in the 
homeland just don't leave these people when they move here. Officers need to 
understand the cultures.  
</P>
<P>
 In Watts, there are subcultures. Not everyone listens to rap and drinks 40 
ounces. Not all black males have their pants hanging off them, not all are 
involved in drive-by shootings. You have to understand the problems to deal 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 You ask why do some people stand on the corner drinking beer. There are no 
theaters, there are no activities, so you make your own recreation here. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandfather, as much as I knew he loved me, would give me a whoopin' if I 
did wrong. If you don't get the right training and you don't have the right 
attitude when you're young, if you don't plan to do something you can be proud 
of, then you won't do anything. If you want to excel, you can't be satisfied, 
you have to continue to set goals.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents need to start young with discipline. If you wait till a kid gets (to 
be) a certain age, they're not going to accept it. When I grew up, everybody 
got their behinds whooped. If you acted the fool, even the neighbor could whoop 
you.  
</P>
<P>
 As time goes on and those values change, we've become a more transient 
society. Most big cities have folks spread all over the place; there aren't the 
communities there were. One thing that hurts the black community is that a lot 
of people came here and didn't have jobs. The men were sitting idle and very 
soon getting involved with police and getting criminal records and becoming 
unemployable. 
</P>
<P>
 All these kinds of things plague the black community -- high unemployment, 
high dropout rates, high levels of teen-age pregnancy. It's going to take 
corporate, government and private people, educational institutions to try to 
work and offer mentoring, a lot of emotional support, a lot of telling the 
truth.

VOICES: SCHOOLS NEED PARENTS' HELP, NOT CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEME KELLY, Meme Kelly, an eight-year resident of Windsor Hills, is a writer 
and former owner of a paralegal company. Faced with growing disillusionment 
with life in Los Angeles, Kelly turned to writing. She has completed a novel, 
On Edge, about an African American attorney struggling in Los Angeles and is 
looking for a publisher.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a disgruntled parent of a child attending a Los Angeles Unified School 
District public school, I had a vision of what a positive school experience 
was: supportive, satisfied and positive teachers; parents involved in their 
children's education; bright, cheery schools and classrooms, and a supportive 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt overwhelmed by the reality year after year in Los Angeles public 
schools: little parental support, as shown by low turnout at events such as 
back-to-school night; dreary-looking schools in need of paint; no computer 
labs; no or few field trips, and generally, little enthusiasm for education and 
the educators' ability to reach children. 
</P>
<P>
 So I placed one of my sons, Rennie Jr., who has learning difficulties, in a 
private school. And I enrolled Corey, my other school-age son, in Warner 
Elementary School in Westwood. I had heard wonderful things about parent 
involvement and the caliber of education at Warner. This school, I was told, 
had a vision of how children were to be educated, and the parents were making a 
difference through this vision. 
</P>
<P>
 When Corey and I arrived to register, I saw a freshly painted school, 
reminding me of positive childhood memories. There were flowers in the 
courtyard, and Jeffrey Felz, the principal, greeted me on the first day with a 
bright smile, warm eyes and firm handshake. I could tell that he was excited to 
be there and excited about educating children. 
</P>
<P>
 I had realized my vision, but something deep in me felt slighted that public 
schools in white, affluent areas are freshly painted, adorned with flowers, and 
have nice principals and eager parents, while many schools in less affluent 
areas don't. Why were there such vast disparities? Did the Los Angeles Unified 
School District blatantly discriminate?  
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of school my questions were answered. I thanked God that the 
answer was not that Los Angeles Unified discriminates and only paints and 
plants flowers at schools in affluent areas. What I found was that the parents 
at Warner, through their PTA and Booster Club, not only painted the school 
themselves, but had carnivals, boutiques and barbecues to raise money. When Los 
Angeles Unified faced a budget crunch, the parents banded together and raised 
money for salaries for the aides.  
</P>
<P>
 At Warner, there is a "room parent" for each classroom and an assistant that 
acts as a liaison between the parents and the school. The parents have a 
newsletter. During the first week, all the parents are asked to schedule time 
to assist their child's classroom. The booster club and the PTA sell cookbooks 
and sponsor the school yearbook. It seems there are more activities sponsored 
by parents than by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents at Warner were everywhere, doing everything. In fact, I could not 
get into Corey's classroom the first day of school because many parents, armed 
with video cameras and Polaroids, were blocking my entrance. Every day there 
are parents in Corey's classroom helping out. There is a feeling that educating 
one's child is the most important task given to a parent.  
</P>
<P>
 Where is this school? ask my African American friends. Westwood, I answer. No 
wonder, my friends say. It is not so much that these people have such great 
vision, but that they have been born into such wonderful circumstances. They 
have money and most of the mothers don't work, the argument goes.  
</P>
<P>
 But how often have we had barbecues, albeit not done specifically to benefit 
the kids? Wouldn't it be fun, I asked, to have a carnival, just for the kids? 
Wouldn't it be fun to have a "Paint the School Week" party and ask businesses 
to donate the paint? Couldn't we all arrange with our employers for at least 
two hours a month for school time, perhaps working late or coming in early to 
make up the time? 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't we plant some flowers at the school? Couldn't we make our own 
directories with contact names so that anyone who wants to help knows whom to 
call to get involved? Shouldn't we attend every single PTA meeting? 
</P>
<P>
 My middle-class, African American friends have no answers, except that 
circumstances are hard in the '90s, a comment with which I tend to agree. 
Circumstances are hard in the '90s and, in the words of Corey, "the bad people 
are winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, something inside me wants to be able to tell him, "Yes, circumstances are 
hard, the bad people do win sometimes, and mommy is doing all in her power, 
with her vision and eyes on the prize, to change the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 By attending PTA meetings, by finding a couple of hours to donate to Corey's 
class, by participating in fund raising, I am part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 We must instill in our schools the attitude that educating our babies is the 
most important task in the world, regardless of our economic status, regardless 
of tough circumstances, regardless of the policies of the school district or 
the state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 We parents must ensure that our babies receive the education they deserve.

A CRUSADER'S LONELY VIGIL; ACTIVISM: BY URGING IMMIGRANTS IN WATTS' TOUGHEST 
HOUSING PROJECTS TO REPORT CRIME, JAIME ZELEDON HAS ANGERED GANG MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His bedroom windows have been shot out, he's been robbed at gunpoint, and he's 
been called "snitch" more times than he cares to remember. But Jaime Zeledon 
remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing gang members rob, assault and kill other Latino immigrants, 
Zeledon started a one-man anti-crime crusade. For the past year, he has walked 
the city's tough housing projects in Watts, urging immigrants who have been 
crime victims to call police and even taking reports on his own. He has done so 
with no pay and at great risk, sparking the ire of the gang members whom 
authorities blame for much of the violence in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my commitment to the community," said Zeledon, 41, a resident of the 
Jordan Downs housing project. "People have to speak out so that the police know 
what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts come as the Los Angeles Police Department is planning to begin a 
major campaign this month to reach out to the growing Spanish-speaking 
community in South Central and Southwest Los Angeles. Faced with language and 
cultural barriers or fearful that police will turn over illegal immigrants to 
federal authorities, many Latinos in the area do not report crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeledon wants to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 With his mild manner and soft voice, the bespectacled father of four looks 
more like the elementary school principal that he was in Nicaragua than the 
crime fighter that he is at Jordan Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are afraid, but they have to understand that we have power when 
we unite," Zeledon said as he walked past the dreary blue buildings of the 
690-unit Jordan Downs project. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeledon, his wife and his three children left war-torn Nicaragua in 1984, 
hoping for a better life in the United States. Laid off from a janitor job at 
the Los Angeles International Airport last year, he works part time for the 
California Literacy Project teaching immigrants to read in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Active with student and labor groups in Nicaragua, Zeledon quickly became 
involved in the community after moving to Jordan Downs nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a board member of the project's Resident Advisory Council and is a 
co-chair of its Unity Committee, which was formed to ease tensions between 
African Americans and Latinos after a September, 1991, arson fire that killed 
five members of a Latino family. The suspects were black and Latino, but Latino 
residents initially believed they were all African American. Two men were 
convicted in December of first-degree murder and arson for their role in the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zeledon is also a member of the Watts/Century Latino Organization, serving as 
its anti-crime organizer in the Nickerson Gardens, Imperial Courts and Jordan 
Downs projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jaime is a peacemaker. Although he and his folks have been victimized by some 
of the brothers, Jaime believes in unity," said Fred Williams, executive 
director of the Common Ground Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works 
to keep youths out of gangs and in school. Williams and Zeledon worked closely 
last year to improve relations between African Americans and Latinos in the 
area after a rash of crimes against Latinos allegedly committed by black gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Notebook in hand, Zeledon moves comfortably through the pillbox-like projects, 
where he is often met with the respectful Spanish salutation "Don Jaime." He 
also carries crime-report forms, which are printed by the Watts/Century 
organization, to document incidents for police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Zeledon was pressed into action. A woman had been 
robbed at Nickerson Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be afraid. You have to go the police, or else no one will be able 
to help," Zeledon told the sobbing mother of two, who said her purse was stolen 
by a gun-wielding boy of about 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, fighting back tears, refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I call the police? They can't protect me and my family (against 
retaliation) at night." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was played out again the next day. This time, however, the results 
were different. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Jordan Downs resident Elvira Leon and her two children, ages 5 and 17, 
had been shot at by a masked gunman outside their apartment. Zeledon was called 
by Leon's neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Leon," Zeledon said, sitting in the family's shabby apartment, "be 
brave. I'll take you to the (manager's) office. . . . Come with me, and 
everything will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Without saying a word, Leon sat on a tattered sofa in her living room as 
Zeledon explained that she and her family were in danger and that they should 
request a transfer to another housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 They then went to the manager's office, where Leon reported the shooting to 
Housing Authority police. She and her family were transferred about two weeks 
later to another project. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Zeledon has not escaped the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he and his 13-year-old son, Jaime Jr., were confronted at night by 
an armed robber as they walked through the dimly lit project. With a handgun 
pointed at his head, Zeledon handed over $79 as his son ran screaming to the 
apartment. Both were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also last year, as he and his wife slept, Zeledon was awakened by shouts of 
"Snitch!" Then came a quick burst of gunfire, he recalled, followed by glass 
shattering on the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeledon reported the crime to police, but the attackers were never caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're cowards," Zeledon said of the gang members who he suspects were 
behind the shooting. "They don't want us to organize the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeledon's wife would like him to stop his crime-fighting crusade. In fact, she 
is so sensitive about the subject that she does not discuss it with visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police officials praise Zeledon's dedication, they would prefer that 
Latino crime victims go directly to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand what he is doing and applaud it, but I hope that with time we 
can encourage people to report crimes directly to us," said Deputy Chief Mark 
A. Kroeker, commander of the LAPD's South Bureau. "Unless those crimes are 
reported through official channels, we can't use them to request more 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to seize on Zeledon's efforts, Kroeker said he planned to invite the 
anti-crime activist to become a member of the South Bureau's Latino advisory 
committee. The group, which is being formed, will advise the Police Department 
as it begins a campaign this month to win the trust of Latinos and increase the 
reporting of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Through community input, Spanish-speaking officers and other measures, police 
hope to bridge the gap between immigrants and the department. "We want to bring 
the Police Department and the community together," Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the meantime, though, Zeledon plans to continue his work. Hopefully, he 
says, Latino immigrants will eventually go directly to the police. "For now, I 
have to do it," Zeledon said, as several young men drank and gambled near his 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous, but somebody has to do something."

KOREAN DRAMA'S APPEAL CROSSES ETHNIC LINES; MULTICULTURAL VIEWERS APPRECIATE 
SOAP OPERA'S EMPHASIS ON FAMILY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN E. KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are no explicit bedroom scenes, evil twins or ex-husbands back from the 
dead in this soap opera. Instead, the audience is transfixed by mothers-in-law 
tribulations and the trials of being a modern young woman in a traditional, 
male-dominated society. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to "Missing You," a Korean television daily drama that bears only a 
remote resemblance to American TV soaps. It airs weeknights with English 
subtitles on Korean Television Enterprises Channel 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The nighttime drama has little violence, racy language or passionate kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 But what "Missing You" does have is a surprising number of non-Korean viewers, 
who have stumbled across the show by accident or tuned in on the advice of 
Korean friends and gotten hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like the fresh approach that gives you some sense of drama and 
romance without having overlying sex and violence. The main focus tends to be 
on relationships and on changes going on around the people and their society," 
said Pasadena attorney David Mans, who watches the show nightly with his 
Korean-born wife, Sunhee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that the American soaps are much more obsessed with sex and violence 
and they treat it in a titillating fashion. The Korean drama deals with sex in 
a very straightforward manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Korean Television Enterprises, based in Koreatown, airs the show with English 
subtitles so that young Korean Americans, many of whom speak limited Korean, 
can watch television along with their Korean-speaking parents and grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the subtitles have also served a group other than the target audience 
since "Missing You" started airing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Korean network broadcast the show without subtitles one night, the 
station was hit with dozens of calls the next morning from non-Koreans 
complaining that they had missed their favorite show. "A lot of 
English-speaking people like this program. They all called to complain -- 
Mexican people, Japanese, American, Chinese," said Seung Lee, a network 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Phuong Nguyen Sovan, a Covina manicurist born in Vietnam, started watching 
"Missing You" when it came on after a Japanese movie. "I don't speak Korean. I 
just watch the subtitles, but I love it because the story is the same Oriental 
story as in my country. It's like the same as our family -- love, family, 
problems. Just like in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 The story line of "Missing You" centers around a young couple starting their 
life together in downtown Seoul. Other Korean daily dramas -- which don't have 
subtitles and are not popular with non-Koreans -- concern historical drama, 
family dynasty and even farm life. The dramas run for six months to a year, 
conclude their story lines and are replaced by new shows. 
</P>
<P>
 For a Korean drama, "Missing You" is surprisingly modern in its treatment of 
the changing role of women in society. After all, heroine Sin-hee is a working 
woman with a strong individualistic streak who wants to continue her decorating 
career after her marriage. Her husband, Myong-jun, is willing to stand up to 
his dowry-grubbing mother to defend his beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Korean males like their wife to belong to them," Lee said. "He has 
enough self-confidence in his own character to let his wife have her own 
identity. He does not want to be influenced by his family structure." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Korean society, where feminist ideals are only slowly taking hold, this is 
tantamount to revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Sin-hee is very smart and she sort of knows how to make things come 
about for herself. In the old times, I don't think they could get away with 
that," said Korean-born Carolyn Choe of Downey, who watches the show along with 
her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Susan Yang, public relations coordinator for the Korean Cultural Center in 
Koreatown, sees Sin-hee in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think she's independent and career-oriented, but I see her as 
very selfish," Yang, 25, said. "She's taking advantage of the guy because he 
loves her so much and she's not a very good daughter-in-law. The reason she 
married her husband was not for love but because it would be easier for her to 
pursue her career with her mother-in-law doing the cooking and housekeeping." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sin-hee chose her husband over another suitor, Yang said. "The other guy 
didn't want her to work," Yang explained. "He wanted her to be a traditional 
wife. Korean women today don't have to be traditional wives; they can have a 
marriage and a career. But you have to balance the two, you can't be a 
superwoman." 
</P>
<P>
 Most younger viewers are fascinated by "Missing You" because it deals with 
modern challenges to the traditional Korean social structure. But many of their 
elders are not so accepting. 
</P>
<P>
 "For my parents, they can't accept the woman trying to control the man," Choe 
said. "I don't think they like that drama for that reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Yang said she sympathizes "more with the mother-in-law than Sin-hee. "She 
portrays my mom's generation. They had to sacrifice for their family, and 
society didn't allow them a choice between marriage and a career. Now she looks 
at her daughter-in-law and feels that her own life is very empty." 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that each viewer's spin on the story depends on whether one 
relies on the subtitles or not. "The subtitles are OK but not great," said 
Yang. "It would be hard to translate everything, and even then you can't get 
the nuance of the Korean." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Matthieu, assistant director of the Korea Society/Los Angeles, agreed. 
"The subtitles are really simple and they skip a lot. You miss some of the 
essential Koreanness of the dialogue. You get just the gist of what's going 
on," Matthieu, 24, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Missing You," like all Korean dramas broadcast in the United States, is 
produced in Seoul, Lee said. After each episode is broadcast in Seoul, the 
costly English subtitles are supplied by a Hawaiian television network. The 
show airs in the Los Angeles area about a week after it is first broadcast in 
Korea, said Kwan Kim, a producer at Korean Television Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he thinks the story of Sin-hee and Myong-jun has attracted such a 
following, Kim laughs. "It's a love story -- that's why people like it."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; CLASSES TO START AT ELAC SATELLITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bent over a table, her two children beside her, Elizabeth Uriarte carefully 
filled out a college application. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours earlier, she had no idea that she would be registering for classes 
in business administration and real estate. But when the mail arrived with a 
flyer announcing the opening of the East Los Angeles College satellite in town, 
she dashed to 2677 Zoe Ave. to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployed for five years, Uriarte, 31, sees higher education as her best bet 
to rejoin the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the perfect time to open this (satellite) here," said Uriarte, who was 
last employed as a receptionist in a doctors' office. "It's really helping me 
out. I really needed something because I was at a dead-end. This is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Uriarte had tried to take classes elsewhere, but like other students attracted 
to the satellite campus, she said the long bus ride to other schools made it 
too difficult to schedule classes. Now she lives just two blocks from school.  
</P>
<P>
 Classes at the new campus start Tuesday, just five months after Huntington 
Park Mayor Ric Loya publicly proposed the idea. After a rocky start, the 
proposal gained support from state officials and surrounding cities, received 
$100,000 in start-up funds from East Los Angeles College and has six months 
free rent in the Pacific Bell building. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where 70% of all adults have not finished high school, the new 
campus can help residents work toward a new future, Loya said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most exciting thing I've seen in this community in 22 years," 
Loya said. "Education is the key." 
</P>
<P>
 About 57,000 flyers were mailed throughout the Southeast area to generate 
interest. Six hundred phone calls flooded the admissions office and about 187 
students applied during the first five days of registration. Once news about 
the satellite campus spreads further, the site will serve from 700 to 1,500 
students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, most registrants are women who are trying to break into the job market 
and need to update their skills, said Olga Dominguez-Gary, college counselor.  
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Park campus currently offers 32 courses, including classes in 
accounting and business, child development, health, mathematics, real estate, 
political science and Spanish. Classes cost $13 per credit and most credits can 
be transferred to four-year state schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The new campus also offers a five-semester curriculum that allows students who 
are employed full time to meet general education requirements through night 
classes once a week and some weekend and video classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes in English as a Second Language and citizenship will be offered free. 
Courses will be expanded to include computer classes and other subjects, based 
on demand, in upcoming semesters, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope we will have an East Los Angeles College Southeast campus that would 
have every service and the same type of classes that we offer here" at the main 
campus, said Herman Bacchus, dean of academic affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The school could also prove something of an economic boon to Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookstores, copy shops and other businesses may spring up near the new campus, 
which is just a block east of Pacific Boulevard, the city's main downtown 
shopping street, Loya said. Existing businesses should also benefit -- students 
represent potential consumers.  
</P>
<P>
 "The students have to do their shopping somewhere," said Jack Wong, Community 
Development director. "They have to get their lunch and buy their pencils 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Ripke, 27, of Cudahy, who had been attending classes in Long Beach, 
said studying at the satellite will help her feel more connected to her 
community.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they tried to shut it down now, I'd be the first to protest," Ripke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal registration ended last week, but students can still register by going 
to classes and making arrangements with instructors. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; SALT LAKE PARK GETS POLICE

 Salt Lake Park will be safer now that the Police Department has opened a 
substation there, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two full-time officers have been assigned to the substation, located in a 
recreation building, in an effort to rid the park of drug dealers, gangs and 
transients, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began the program Dec. 1. About two weeks later the substation had its 
grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
 A park substation had been high on the community wish list, Councilman Raul 
Perez said. Drug sales in the park had become so blatant that "no one could 
walk around there without being offered a few grams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Frank Sullivan said: "We've had ongoing enforcement at the park, 
but every time we drive (them) away, the problems would come back. Now, we're 
there to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries for the additional officers will be paid from $82,000 raised through 
a utility users tax passed by the city last year, Sullivan said. MARY HELEN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; NEIGHBORS POOL THEIR EFFORTS TO SAVE LAKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents has formed a new community organization dedicated to the 
preservation of Echo Park Lake and improving the recreational activities and 
programs in the park that surrounds it. 
</P>
<P>
 United by a common love for the urban oasis, Friends of Echo Park Lake came 
together in December. Its second meeting will begin at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at 
the Central City Action Committee office near the lake, at 1160 Glendale Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The loosely knit, grass-roots group wants to develop educational programs so 
students can use the lake and park for ecology and art lessons. Among its other 
goals, the group hopes to return the "Lady of the Lake" statue, which has been 
in city storage since the lake's refurbishment a few years ago, to its former 
lakeside location. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members also want to lobby city Recreation and Parks officials to provide 
activities for teen-agers at the Echo Park Recreation Center across the street 
from the lake. Community activist Karen Jaeger, one of the founding members of 
Friends of Echo Park Lake, said she would specifically like to see co-ed sports 
teams and a supervised boxing program for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "We each have our own issues," agreed founding member Gloria Sohacki, a 
seven-year resident of Laguna Avenue, which overlooks the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Known locally as "The Duck Lady" who feeds the flocks daily as she walks to 
work at the Central City Action Committee youth agency, Sohacki said the group 
grew out of her desire to protect the lake's wildlife. Loud quacking that wakes 
her in the middle of the night and rumors of duck poaching, she said, have left 
her concerned for the waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sohacki said she also was motivated by the state Department of Fish and Game's 
practice of stocking the lake with catfish and trout for free community 
fishing. When a state biologist asked her to help promote the fishing 
opportunities, Sohacki contacted her neighbors and learned that many of them 
had concerns about the future of the lake. So she brought them together to form 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Sohacki said she also wants to get local youths involved in regularly checking 
the lake's water quality and monitoring the wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing recreational activities for teen-agers is crucial because of their 
vulnerability to area gangs, Jaeger said. To this end, she plans to talk to 
police and city parks officials about starting a "safe, gang-neutral" boxing 
program at the recreation center at 1632 Bellevue Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city offers only baseball and basketball for elementary 
school-aged boys and dance classes for young girls at the center -- activities 
that are "gender-stereotypic" as well as age-restrictive, Jaeger said.  
</P>
<P>
 But this is because the city has designated the Echo Park center as a facility 
for younger children, said Linda Davis, senior recreation director. The center 
is licensed to provide child care from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays, and is 
restricted from offering adult or co-ed programs, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other facilities and community organizations, including the Boys' and Girls' 
Club of Echo Park and area churches, provide activities for teen-agers, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger acknowledged these programs, but said the number of youths far 
outnumbers the facilities. IRIS YOKOI

 A South-Central man is the second landlord in three months at a Coronado 
Street apartment building to be convicted of slum charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Florence Rivas Bonilla, 29, pleaded no contest Jan. 4 to six violations 
of health and building codes and was sentenced to pay $4,274 in fines, court 
costs and contributions to a local charity.Los Angeles Municipal Commissioner 
Barry Kohn also placed Bonilla on three years' probation and set a Feb. 22 
deadline for repairs to be made at the two-story, 12-unit building at 430 N. 
Coronado St. 
</P>
<P>
 City prosecutors said Bonilla assumed ownership of the troubled building in 
August and failed to fix deficiencies left by previous owners Thomas and Adela 
Bueno, who pleaded no contest in October to 10 slum charges. 
</P>
<P>
 During inspections between April and June last year, city inspectors found 
missing and broken smoke detectors, stair railings, plumbing fixtures and an 
illegal lock that could trap residents in a fire. The city attorney's office 
filed charges against the Buenos in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buenos then transferred ownership of the building to Bonilla without 
making repairs, according to the city attorney's office. The Hollywood couple 
later entered the no-contest plea and were sentenced to pay more than $1,200 in 
fines and serve 400 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new owner of the building, Bonilla was aware of the court case and was 
responsible for making the repairs, prosecutors said. But city inspections 
conducted a few days after the Buenos were sentenced revealed that Bonilla had 
made few repairs, prosecutors said. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; JAPAN BESTOWS HONOR ON LOCAL ARCHITECT

<P>
 Like many Japanese Americans sent to internment camps during World War II, 
Toshikazu Terasawa became more involved in civic and community activities after 
the war in an effort to prevent further acts of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought one way was to promote closer relationships between Japan and the 
United States," the 70-year-old Los Angeles native said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terasawa's efforts to promote understanding and improve relations between the 
United States and Japan were recognized by the Japanese government recently 
when it awarded him the prestigious Order of the Rising Sun. Accompanied by a 
certificate with the Japanese emperor's seal and the prime minister's 
signature, the medal is one of the highest honors presented to individuals who 
contribute to the Japanese American community or to the strengthening of 
U.S.-Japan relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles presents eight of the official 
government awards to community residents each year. Former Mayor Tom Bradley, 
other civic leaders and various experts in medicine, agriculture and the arts 
have received the award in past years. 
</P>
<P>
 Terasawa, one of four Southern Californians who received awards last fall, is 
believed to be the first architect bestowed with the Order of the Rising Sun, 
which was instituted in 1875, according to Japanese Consulate officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The consulate takes nominations from local organizations, such as the Japanese 
American Cultural and Community Center and the Japan Business Assn., then 
forwards the names, with detailed resumes, to Tokyo. Japanese government 
officials painstakingly check each nominee's background information, according 
to Nancy Hamai-Smith, a consulate staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 Terasawa, a second-generation Japanese American, is founding partner of 
O'Leary Terasawa Partners, a 45-year-old commercial and industrial design firm 
west of Downtown. Born in Wilmington and raised in Boyle Heights, the Roosevelt 
High School graduate was interned at camps at Manzanar and Tule Lake during 
World War II. After the war, he earned his architectural degree from USC and 
later served on its faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 First appointed by Mayor Sam Yorty in the 1960s, Terasawa served 17 years on 
the Los Angeles Building and Safety Commission. He also recently completed a 
nearly two-year stint on the Los Angeles Harbor Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But Terasawa always found time to work with the Japanese American community. 
He helped shape the development of Little Tokyo and initiate the sister city 
relationship between Los Angeles and Nagoya, Japan. He is chairman and past 
president of the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center and governor 
of the Japanese American National Museum, among a long list of affiliations, 
and has been the recipient of numerous civic awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marina del Rey resident said the medal from the Japanese government is 
"probably one of the highest honors I've ever received." And the award is 
especially precious because it recognizes his dedication to global unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Terasawa said that although U.S.-Japan relations have improved since World War 
II, "there still has to be a better understanding of each other's culture." 
People in both countries continue to have misconceptions about each other and 
don't recognize their similarities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having been brought up by Japanese parents under the American educational 
system and in the midst of American culture, I'm in a good position to build a 
bridge between the two (cultures)," Terasawa said. IRIS YOKOI

 At 17, Billy Brown has already garnered invitations to play before thousands. 
Now he and the other members of the Washington High School marching band and 
jazz ensemble have received another: to take part next month in the Mardi Gras 
parade in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the way I'm dressed people might think I'm a gangbanger," said Brown, a 
lanky drummer who frowns with concentration as he practices. "But when they see 
the determination on my face and when I play, then they look at me in a 
different way." 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to play venues such as the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood 
Bowl or an L.A. Rams football game at Anaheim Stadium is one benefit of 
Washington's music program. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they played the Playboy Jazz Festival and were on that stage, they got 
to do what a lot of professionals still haven't gotten the chance to do: to 
share a stage with musicians like Branford Marsalis," said Fernando Pullum, 
director of the 130-member band and drill team. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Marguerite LaMotte said the band needs more instruments and funds. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, several band members had to borrow instruments from other schools 
to participate in the city marching band championship, in which they placed 
first. "I watched some of the kids on the field playing imaginary instruments 
during rehearsal as if they had the real thing in their hands," LaMotte said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of funds also threatens to cancel their trip to New Orleans. Although 
students have raised about $20,000 through bake sales, raffles and donations, 
they still need $40,000 for transportation and additional instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a shame if the kids don't get a chance to go," Pullum said.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside the small band room, students echo Pullum's words. Amid the sounds of 
impromptu jazz quartets, students use words such as discipline, sacrifice and 
respect to characterize their experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn a lot about self-discipline," said Damien Crawford, 16, a trombone 
player. "When you have discipline here you learn to have discipline for 
yourself at home." 
</P>
<P>
 "And it keeps us busy," said Dontoe Phillips, 15. "When you get to go and play 
for a lot of famous people, how could you ever get bored?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus," said Antwan Rachal, 17, who plays the cymbals, "band can help you out 
in school because you have to have a C average, so you have to do well in order 
to stay in band. And then there are the scholarships you can apply for." SANDRA

 Operation Hope founder and financial consultant John Bryant is banking on yet 
another project to help improve the sluggish local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, 27, is scheduled to open Vision Center, a loan-processing and 
financial counseling center, on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the Vision Complex Theater on Degnan Boulevard, the center will be 
under the auspices of Operation Hope, the nonprofit banking consortium that 
Bryant founded in the wake of the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 With loan officers from financial institutions on staff to help process 
applications, Bryant said the center will help increase the number of home 
loans, and therefore the number of homeowners, in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 "Owning a home is the backbone of the American Dream, and not enough folks in 
the inner city have access to it, or believe they do," Bryant said. "The Vision 
Center will act as a liaison between banks and minority communities." 
</P>
<P>
 The center will also offer financial counseling to applicants who do not 
qualify for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Hope case managers will work with these clients at no charge for a 
year, monitoring payments on everything from utilities to car insurance, so 
that clients can eventually qualify for loans funded by a "safety net" pool set 
up by the participating financial institutions. The institutions have agreed to 
contribute $200,000 on each $1 million they loan to that fund. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a cooperative, shared-risk approach that will make it possible for all 
the participating institutions to make home loans to those who would otherwise 
be turned down, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to expand the pool of qualified home buyers," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Banks can only make decisions based on TRW reports and certain other 
information," Bryant said. "They may want to help someone qualify for a loan, 
but their hands are tied. Operation Hope can act as that helping hand, the 
third party that goes between the bank and the borrower. And everybody 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of six financial institutions that Bryant hopes will provide staff for 
the center are still in negotiations with Operation Hope and could not be 
named. But the Glendale-based Fidelity Federal Bank, which is also a member of 
Operation Hope, has agreed to work with the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great idea," said Walter Morris, executive vice president of 
Fidelity Federal. "From our standpoint, it's part of an overall effort to try 
different ways of going after good business. The borrower information component 
is particularly crucial. It's a prime example of how private and nonprofit can 
come together to increase home ownership in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant has garnered media attention and community praise the past year for his 
efforts to help rebuild the riot-torn economy of South-Central Los Angeles 
neighborhoods. A few days after forming Operation Hope, Bryant had coordinated 
efforts among nine lenders to fund $370,000 to rebuild Handler's Pharmacy, a 
20-year-old business at 48th Street and Western Avenue that burned to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bryant insisted there's no magic to what he does: "Look, we just want to 
benefit the community. Our mission is to drive ourselves out of business. 
People ultimately just want a hand, not a handout." ERIN J. AUBRY

 Wearing orange T-shirts and white hard hats, 10 men dug a trench in a driveway 
of Estrada Courts last week in what is being hailed as the first effort to hire 
residents to maintain and improve the city's aging housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the workers, making as much as $18 an hour including workers' 
compensation benefits, competed with 40 other applicants to replace the housing 
project's water and sewer system. They say they are now the envy of their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty good (pay), but we work hard for it," said Jesse Larios, 20, who 
wears an elastic waist guard because he works the mechanical shovel most of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Patron, 21, who said he has lived at Estrada Courts since he was 1, had 
worked in low-paying department store sales jobs. "Sometimes other people ask 
me if they're going to be hiring, but I don't know," Patron said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more jobs, officials said, but when they will materialize is 
uncertain. Maria del Angel, treasurer of the nonprofit Estrada Courts Resident 
Management Corp., said that the three- to six-month sewer project will be 
followed by others to replace security doors and windows at the 50-year-old, 
413-unit housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction project is unusual in that residents formed their own 
nonprofit corporation -- one among five in the city's 21 housing projects -- 
underwent management training, and received help from the Southern California 
Gas Co. to train the workers in safety and mechanics, said Donald J. Smith, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The training allowed the residents' corporation to bid for the jobs, provided 
that it links up with an established business entity -- in this case the East 
Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU) -- to insure the construction bonds, get 
the building permits, handle the equipment and provide the technical expertise. 
About one year ago, the residents' corporation received a $700,000 grant from 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the improvements, which 
started in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 "This work would have been going on, but it wouldn't have been done by the 
residents," Smith said. "This way, the residents get the opportunity to bid and 
do the work themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar effort using resident workers to modernize Nickerson Gardens will 
soon get under way, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opening celebration of the Estrada Courts project, TELACU President 
David Lizarraga said that future work in poor communities must include those 
for whom the work is being done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are talented people who live here that want to work. This is a 
tremendous opportunity that we have, the first in the nation, giving the 
opportunity to residents to gain skills and go to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Shuldiner, an assistant secretary at HUD, had worked on the early 
stages of the effort to hire resident workers at Estrada Courts when he was 
executive director of the Los Angeles Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission to provide decent housing for people of low income is a very 
simple mission," he said. "We're talking about the quality of life and in many 
ways it's a transition . . . to stabilize families and give them the economic 
incentive to move on." MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 A $2.1-million renovation began last week on the 1916 building that housed the 
Lincoln Heights branch of the public library.  
</P>
<P>
 The building at 2530 Workman St. will undergo earthquake reinforcement, 
renovation and a 50% expansion with money from the sale of bonds approved by 
city voters in 1988, said Robert Reagan, public information director for the 
Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation of the Lincoln Heights library, or the Biblioteca del Pueblo de 
Lincoln Heights, will take about 18 months, with a grand opening expected in 
the summer of 1995, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch has been operating out of a temporary site, at 2217 N. Broadway, 
since March, 1990, after officials determined that the Workman Street building 
was not earthquake-safe, Reagan said. Thirteen of the city's branch libraries 
that did not meet safety codes are being renovated or replaced with new 
structures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With $53.4 million from the bonds, the city is improving 22 of its 63 
libraries and building three libraries in the San Fernando Valley. MARY ANNE

 The Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment will offer a free course in small

</P>
<P>
 The program will cover marketing and merchandising, business math, pricing and 
inventory, bookkeeping and accounting, advertising, customer relations, taxes, 
business planning and law. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-week, 40-hour course begins Jan. 31. Applications are being accepted; 
20 will be selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is geared toward store owners, although employees who are thinking 
of opening their own stores will also be considered. Applicants should be Los 
Angeles residents or have a store in Los Angeles and must be able to read, 
speak and understand English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small grocers are out there in the trenches," said Kerry Doi, the 
consortium's executive director. "Many are just getting back on their feet 
after the riots. We want to help them make their operations profitable so they 
can expand, hiring people from the neighborhoods where they do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members of the consortium's Business Development Center will teach the 
course with assistance from consultants in the grocery industry. The program 
also offers graduates five hours of free technical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the technical assistance portion of the program is the real key to 
its success," said Tim Maschler, director of the Business Development Center. 
"Often graduates leave a training program with lots of ideas, but no hands-on 
way of applying them. This program addresses that by having seasoned 
professionals actually visit the stores and make direct suggestions on the 
improvement of operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The training program will be conducted at the consortium's Community Wholesale 
Grocers store, 13719 Crenshaw Blvd. in Hawthorne.  
</P>
<P>
 Applications are also being accepted for the consortium's next entrepreneur 
course, which begins Feb. 7. This free course is for low-income entrepreneurs 
who want to start or expand their own businesses. Maschler said about 17 
applicants will be selected for the course at the consortium's office, 2525 W. 
8th St. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the consortium has 20 spots open in its free job-training program 
for low-income residents, funded under the Job Training Program Act. 
Participants will be able to learn clerical skills, including word processing, 
office management and business math.

THEY WANT THEIR 'M' TV (MULTIETHNIC, MULTILINGUAL); WITH NEARLY HALF OF THE 
COUNTY'S 8.9 MILLION RESIDENTS SPEAKING A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME, 
KMET-TV CHANNEL 38 IS FINDING AN AUDIENCE WITH ITS SMORGASBORD OF PROGRAMMING.

<P>
 With her eyes glued to her 32-inch Mitsubishi TV, Eun Jeong begins to sing a 
Korean love song, using her telephone as a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eee ma-um tashi yogi-eh," Jeong croons, which means, "My heart is again here 
for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it seems Jeong is simply singing along with one of her favorite music 
videos, her voice is being broadcast over the television. She is live on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Koreatown resident said it was the fourth time she has 
participated on "The Interactive Karaoke Show." This time, Jeong received 
Korean pastries and skin care products for her efforts -- a prize she sneered 
at and offered to give away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch the show every day," said Jeong, who practices at home with a laser 
karaoke machine. "Sometimes, I feel shy. But sometimes, I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Interactive Karaoke Show" is one of several unique programs on KMET-TV 
Channel 38, Los Angeles' newest television station specializing in multiethnic 
and multilingual programs. Despite an already jammed local television market, 
KMET's arrival has come at a time when about half of Los Angeles County's 8.9 
million residents speak a language other than English at home, according to the 
1990 U. S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's extremely healthy for the public," said Joe Saltzman, a 
journalism professor at USC who teaches broadcasting. "What's nice about this 
concept is that you don't need a million viewers. You are only trying to target 
a small audience." 
</P>
<P>
 KMET went on the air in May, after waiting the typical 10 years to receive a 
license from the Federal Communications Commission. The station, which is owned 
by Venture Technologies Growth Inc. of Calabasas, is likely to be the last 
station to be licensed in Los Angeles County because of the lack of available 
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcasting from the Television Center studios in Hollywood, KMET offers 
programs in English, Italian, German, Russian, Spanish, Korean, French and 
Hindi and soon will be adding shows in Japanese and Tagalog. It is also the 
only local station with African and Salvadoran programs. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager Charles Lohr said KMET's goal is to offer Southern 
California's diverse population multilingual shows, preferably ones not being 
offered on other stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, we don't want to concentrate on Mexican programming because 
that's being done already,' Lohr said. "We want to concentrate on Central 
American programming because that's not being done." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Interactive Karaoke Show," which airs weeknights at 6, is produced by 
Korean American Television and broadcast on Los Angeles' Continental Cable's 
Channel 52, as well as on Channel 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Jung Kim, one of the show's hosts, said the show never has a dearth of willing 
participants. Although most callers request Korean songs, viewers also can 
choose from a selection of English, Spanish and Chinese songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Han Pil Lee, the other host of the show, said people from South Korea love to 
sing because it's one of the few forms of entertainment they had in their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most entertainment was reserved for the elite class," Lee said. "There's no 
football or baseball, so singing is one of the few things you can do to have 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other stations, KMET does not pay for most of its shows. Although some 
of its independent producers run commercials to offset costs, most producers 
use their own money to pay for production fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The station is going to have to rely on people in the community who have a 
message and are willing to pay for it to go on air," Saltzman said. "It takes 
lots of money to produce shows like 'Murphy Brown' or 'MacNeil/Lehrer,' so you 
won't see shows like that on a station like KMET. You will see the cheapest 
type of programming." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some viewers may prefer watching more high-quality productions, 
Saltzman said, the station can be successful if it is able to generate a loyal 
following. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, local television personalities become so popular that (they) gain 
a large following," he said. "This is what every station hopes it can develop." 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for its dozen employees and other expenses, KMET runs its own local 
commercials and also receives a fee for broadcasting "The Home Shopping 
Network" six days a week. Although the station's revenues exceeded its $1 
million budget in 1993, KMET has not done much to advertise itself. It relies 
mostly on word-of-mouth to gain viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're somewhere between a commercial and a non-commercial station," Lohr 
said. "We're probably the smallest station in Los Angeles, but not the least 
important. We try to reach markets that are underserved because our goal is to 
bring more people into television." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reach out to the estimated 500,000 Salvadorans in Los Angeles, 
KMET in March began televising "Asi Es Mi Tierra," a one-hour Spanish-language 
magazine show produced and taped in El Salvador. The show, which is on every 
Sunday morning at 10, used to be televised on four other stations but is now 
being broadcasted exclusively on KMET. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of showing areas of El Salvador that have been ravished by war, 
producer and host Jose Trinidad shows footage of the country's beaches, 
marketplaces and other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do is show to people that after 12 years of war, El 
Salvador is still a beautiful place with lots of things to see," said Trinidad, 
who goes to El Salvador every other week to tape the show. "My feeling was that 
the information being put out about the country wasn't fair. It only showed the 
bad part." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 5, Trinidad and KMET co-sponsored a telethon to benefit the children 
of El Salvador and promote tourism in the country. The eight-hour event, which 
featured a variety of Salavadoran leaders and entertainers, attracted more than 
10,000 people to the station's studios. Along with several local performers, 
Salvadoran performers La Cinco De Yuca, Chilango Tony Acosta and Fermin 
Iglesias entertained the crowds.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were amazed by the turnout," Lohr said. "But it showed us that this is our 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Trinidad, who said he nearly has gone bankrupt trying to produce his show, 
believes the rewards of providing local Salvadorans with footage from their 
homeland are worth the costs. Trinidad says it costs about $5,000 a month to 
produce the show, but his traveling expenses are picked up by a local travel 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "People living here in Los Angeles cry with me when they see the show and 
smile with me," he said. "Whenever I go to a Salvadoran restaurant or business, 
people recognize me and say, 'Excellent show.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trinidad took out a fan letter he recently received. Holding up the letter, he 
said the writer "said she doesn't care how tired she is. She will always wake 
up Sunday morning to watch the program no matter how late she stays out the 
night before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Along with producing his own show, Trinidad receives weekly tapes of Latin 
American soccer games, which are broadcast in their entirety on KMET from 3 to 
5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love the soccer games," Trinidad said. "One time, the show came on 
three minutes late, and people started calling up to find out what happened. 
Some people drove up here when the soccer didn't show up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although KMET has an estimated 100,000 viewers per day, it has a long way 
before it can catch up with KSCI-TV Channel 18, an affiliate of the 
International Channel Network, which is the oldest and highest-rated 
international station in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 KSCI general manager Rosemary Danon said that her station, which began its 
international format eight years ago and broadcasts in 18 languages, serves 
about 2 million viewers throughout the day. Danon added that she is not worried 
about losing viewers to the newest station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider them competition," she said. "They're low power." 
</P>
<P>
 While KSCI has a power transmitter with 3 million watts, KMET's weaker 
100,000-watt signal isn't as clear as KSCI's in many areas. For instance, 
viewers in south Orange County and in some parts of Los Angeles County do not 
receive a clear signal when they tune into Channel 38. The station plans to add 
a transmitter in Riverside County next month, which will allow viewers in the 
Inland Empire to tune in. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike KSCI, which is carried by about 90 cable systems, KMET is carried 
only by Cala Vision in Calabasas, Valley Cable in San Fernando and Hidden Hills 
Cable. It is also available on Channel 24 in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lohr, who used to be the station manager at KSCI, said he believes KMET is 
already highly competitive with Channel 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very loyal audience . . . and I'm very happy with that," Lohr said. 
"The most important thing we can do is to provide a good TV signal and a 
consistent schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lohr said KMET is likely to expand its Central American programming, 
it also airs programs appealing to a mostly Mexican audience. But unlike other 
local television stations, KMET has tried to broadcast shows that are produced 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the Spanish-language programs now on the air come from Venezuela, 
Mexico or Miami," said Chris Garcia, co-producer of CadenaVision, which 
produces four Spanish-language entertainment shows for KMET. "We only use local 
artists and crews." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent AIDS-awareness episode of the "America Al Dia" talk show, host 
America Bracho encouraged one of her guests to show viewers how to use a 
condom, demonstrating with a cucumber. "It's better to die of embarrassment 
than to die of AIDS," Bracho told viewers in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mondays and Wednesdays at 5:30 p.m., KMET airs "La Quebradita Show," which 
shows groups performing banda music. CadenaVision also produces a salsa show 
and a Spanish rock music program. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, 25, and his partner, Gabriel Marco Meza, 26, said their target 
audience is Latinos in their teens and 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people comment about our age, but I think the television industry 
needs young people with new ideas and energy," said Garcia, who was born in El 
Salvador and grew up in Pico-Union. 
</P>
<P>
 KMET also has an extensive international news lineup, offering live segments 
via the Cable News Network, Deutsche Welle from Germany, France 2, RAI from 
Italy and News 1 from Moscow. It even broadcasts a live European news program 
in Spanish on weekdays at 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday afternoons at 1, KMET viewers can watch music videos from Africa, 
interviews with members of the local African community and segments about 
African culture. Those who tuned in to a recent episode of the African Network 
Television saw a music video of one of Zaire's most noted performers, Dongu, 
and a video of Nigerian singer Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey performing the 
popular juju music. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel (Broe) Bassey, the host and producer of African Network Television, 
originated the program because he was frustrated that many people in the United 
States have an image of Africa as a remote place where slaves came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think Africa is like a jungle," said Bassey, a native of Nigeria. "I 
wanted to do something to expose African music, culture and stories to people 
so that they know what it's really like." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the show premiered in September, Bassey has received calls and letters 
from people of all backgrounds. And although the show is taped in a small 
studio in South-Central and is not as sophisticated as programs on MTV or VH-1, 
it has gained a loyal following. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any African shows, so when I heard there was going to be a 
special show, I was very excited," said Asuquo Attah, a native of Nigeria and 
regular viewer of the African Network Television program. "It's something 
unique and it keeps you in touch with what's really going on."

SWAP MEET FOES MAKE PUSH FOR STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In addition to a new supermarket and drugstore, the redesigned Midtown 
Shopping Center will have a remodeled and renamed swap meet. But to some 
neighbors, a swap meet by any other name is still a swap meet, and they don't 
like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30,000-square-foot swap meet will be renamed the Midtown Shops and 
redesigned along with other structures at the center owned by Jim Young and the 
Midtown Shopping Center Associates Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The redesigned center, in the 4700 block of Pico Boulevard, will include an 
Alpha-Beta supermarket and a Sav-on Drugs store. Construction is scheduled to 
begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Wilshire Area Community Coalition and the Southwest 
Assn. of Neighborhoods told Young that because a swap meet does not cater to 
the tastes of middle-class residents and generates no sales tax or employment 
except for vendors, they would like another kind of store, such as a Target or 
K mart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no place for middle-class shoppers to shop in this community, but 
there are at least five swap meets," said Lauren Schlau, chairwoman of the 
neighborhood association. "No one seems to think that people will support a 
middle-class shopping center. We say: 'Build it and we will come.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Young said several chain stores have rejected the site because it is too 
small.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Young said, the swap meet does service a sector of the community and 
he has a responsibility to the vendors, most of whom are still trying to 
recover from the 1992 riots. "We have 40-some families in place with bona fide 
leases, and their livelihood depends upon that," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Blackwell, a consultant for Young, urged residents to suggest ways in 
which the swap meet could be made more appealing and could recruit additional 
vendors from within the community.  
</P>
<P>
 Marie Gaines, president of the Wilshire area coalition, said her group will 
continue to push for an "anchor store that will serve the entire community" to 
replace the swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 But others at the meeting hoped more energy would be focused on improving the 
existing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean vendors would like to be in better surroundings, and they will 
cooperate with the community if given a chance," said Daniel Oh, a 
representative of the Korean swap meet vendors. "But don't kick out the 40 
tenants. That's a lot of money for the Korean community."

LOAN PROGRAM TO HELP STIFLE HOME EQUITY SCAM ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to rid South-Central and East Los Angeles of home-equity scam 
artists and to help homeowners who have fallen prey to them, the City Council 
has approved a pilot loan program that will go into effect by Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The Home Equity Fraud Intervention Program, a revolving loan fund, was created 
by representatives of the Legal Aid Foundation, the Los Angeles Housing 
Authority and Communities for Accountable Reinvestment to allow low-income 
homeowners to avoid foreclosure and retain their homes while trying to get back 
on their feet financially. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund will have an emergency loan pool of $250,000 from federal Community 
Development Block Grant funds. Eligible homeowners will receive loans averaging 
$5,000 at 3% to 5% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be open to all low-income homeowners, especially those living 
in South-Central and East Los Angeles, where 60% of housing fraud scams occur, 
according to law enforcement officials and public-interest attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans will be distributed by Broadway Federal Bank, Founders Bank and 
Family Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies that assist scam victims will make referrals to the participating 
banks for the pilot program. The agencies include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bet Tzedek Legal Services, (213) 939-0506; 
</P>
<P>
 * South-Central Legal Aid, (213) 971-4102;

<P>
 * East Los Angeles Legal Aid, (213) 266-6550;

LAWMAKER OPPOSES SITE FOR SCHOOL; EDUCATION: DENSITY THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A 
TEMPLE-BEAUDRY FACILITY IS 'NOT GOOD PLANNING,' ASSEMBLYMAN RICHARD POLANCO 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) has joined critics who oppose the 
Los Angeles Unified School District's plan to buy a 24-acre site in 
Temple-Beaudry to build a high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco said he opposes the construction of a 2,800-student high school at the 
site, bounded by 1st, Toluca and Colton streets and Beaudry Avenue, two blocks 
from Belmont High School and next to an adult school and a planned middle 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 If the high school is built, he said, "there will be over 10,000 teen-agers 
within a six-block area. That's not good planning." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Polanco and many community activists oppose a school on the hilly 
lot overlooking Downtown because it was previously a proposed site for Central 
City West, a housing and commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a housing site, and I support the community's desire to see housing 
here to replace the houses that were demolished to prepare for the Central City 
West development," said the 45th District assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the collapse of the local real estate market, the principal developer in 
the Central City West plan offered to sell the land to the school district, 
reportedly for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board's interest in the Temple-Beaudry site follows its abandonment 
of a plan to build a Mid-Wilshire high school on the Ambassador Hotel site, 
which the district had proposed buying from developer Donald Trump and his 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
 A jilted Trump has vowed to sue the district, saying its eminent domain action 
stopped him from developing the site for four years.  
</P>
<P>
 Polanco said he is angry at the prospect of losing money in a court battle and 
ending up without a Mid-Wilshire school.  
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of students are bused out of Mid-Wilshire every day," Polanco said. 
"We should finish what we started at the Ambassador site. We worked hard to 
obtain money for that site. It's a complete waste of taxpayers' dollars to pay 
damages to the Ambassador owners and receive nothing in return for the school 
kids of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from several community groups, including Grupo Latino Echo 
Park, Concerned Property Owners of Temple-Beaudry and the L.A. Crusaders, said 
a new high school belongs in Mid-Wilshire, not Temple-Beaudry. 
</P>
<P>
 "All along we've fought for housing at this site," said Laurrie Garner, 
president of the property owners group. "We don't want to be stuck in between 
two schools. The school district should think again. This is not the site for a 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Luisa Padilla-Mavropoulos, executive secretary of Grupo Latino Echo Park, 
urged other elected officials to "wake up and see what the needs of the 
community are. We've been ripped off enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which needs state approval to buy the Temple-Beaudry site, is 
considering a plan proposed by board member Vickie Castro to set aside a 
portion of the lot for housing. But most of the community groups involved in 
the issue have come out against that mixed-use plan.

BELL WRESTLES SOME RESPECT FROM VALLEY SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The house that Frank O'Connor has built at Bell High School has taken only 
three seasons to complete. O'Connor started the Eagles' wrestling program in 
1990, and three years and three Central League titles later, Bell has yet 
another sports champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bell won its first City Section title, breaking the Valley schools' 
nine-year stranglehold. Bell posted a tournament-best 195 points against El 
Camino Real (which won City titles in 1986, '88, '89, '90 and '92), San 
Fernando (1985, '87 and '91), Chatsworth and Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our goal: to get to the City Section championships in three years," 
said O'Connor, who has watched Bell soar since its inception to an impressive 
50-14 record, including 11 tournament victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was important for us to win it, because the Valley schools have a 
somewhat superior attitude when it comes to competing against City schools." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's 14-4 team returns four of the six individual City champions from 
last year's squad: Jose Gonzales, who won at 103 pounds, Charles Zabala at 112, 
Frank Ordorica at 160 and Juan Alcala at 171.  
</P>
<P>
 "I may coach 25 more years and never have another group like this," O'Connor 
said. "They're something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Zabala, 18, and Ordorica, 17, are perhaps the team's most talented 
wrestlers. Zabala wrestled in the 112-pound class last year, compiling a 25-5 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Zabala, who also played tailback on the Bee football team, said the quickness 
that enabled him to elude defenders on the field also helps him pin opponents 
on the mat. "My biggest asset is my quickness, because I depend on it to do 
takedowns and outmaneuver my opponents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am also working out with weights to improve my strength," said Zabala, who 
has put on weight to move up to the 119-pound class this year. His record is 
20-3 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles is a gifted athlete," O'Connor said. "He was a key player on the 
football team, set a record on the track team and is a vital member of this 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordorica, who amassed a 26-4 record last year in the 160-pound class, is one 
of four wrestlers -- Ramses Ochoa, Jesus Orozco and Adolfo Padilla are the 
others -- who have been on the team since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the ninth grade, Frank has worked on his body and technique," 
O'Connor said. "His biggest assets are his determination, endurance and drive 
to win." Ordorica, 19-3 on the season, has moved up to the 171-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordorica's off-season schedule, like most of his teammates, includes 
weightlifting and running. 
</P>
<P>
 But he adds a mental element. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physical training is important, but it's also important to think about 
wrestling," Ordorica said. "Whatever I do (during the off-season), I 
concentrate on wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Zabala's and Ordorica's dedication to the sport, it is not 
surprising that neither has had problems making weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always smaller, so I had no need to diet," Zabala said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I eat whatever I want," Ordorica said. "I just work out and run to keep my 
weight down." 
</P>
<P>
 Their success has earned them respect from their peers and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 An All-Eastern League linebacker in football, Ochoa has played three years of 
varsity football and four years of varsity wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football players are always recognized for being tough," O'Connor said. "And 
since he is a member of both the football and wrestling teams, he adds 
legitimacy to our program because we gain recognition for having tough players. 
Ramses is the toughest guy at Bell High School." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa won a City championship as a sophomore at 140 pounds but lost, 6-5, in 
last year's finals to Rafael Palacios of Canoga Park, who was the defending 
135-pound City champion and voted the tournament's outstanding wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa, 16-5 on the season, is aware of his role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring confidence to the team," he said. "Football helps to make me more 
aggressive and gives me the heart to win." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor accounts the winning tradition at Bell High for his team's quick rise 
to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school was able to take on another sport and all the teams are 
successful," O'Connor said. "(The competitive) nature of the school influenced 
these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem that Bell has encountered is a lack of local competition. 
Football rivals such as Garfield, South Gate, Roosevelt and Huntington Park do 
not have wrestling programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's Central League opponents in the City Section include Fremont, Monroe, 
Granada Hills and Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles' main competition remains Canoga Park and San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a shortage of wrestling coaches in our area, but I don't know why, 
because wrestling is a popular sport," O'Connor said. "We need coaches and 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever Bell wrestles, competition is hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 8, Bell took first place in the 18-team Santa Fe High Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Zabala and Ordorica both finished second in individual competition, and 
Orozco, who is 21-2, took first place at 189 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 That same day, Bell finished third in Sierra Vista's 32-team frosh-soph 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Said O'Connor: "We don't rebuild, we reload."

LOCAL PLAYERS MAKING THEIR PRESENCE FELT; PAC-10: ISAAC BURTON IS BECOMING A 
STANDOUT PLAYER FOR ARIZONA STATE. KENYA WILKINS HAS STARTED EVERY GAME FOR 
OREGON.

<P>
 Two hometown basketball players, Isaac Burton of Arizona State and Kenya 
Wilkins of Oregon, are making an unexpected impact this season in the 
Pacific-10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton of Washington High was the 1993 Most Valuable Player at East Los 
Angeles College before transferring. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the 6-foot-4 junior has quietly become one of the best players in 
the conference for the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 He is playing 35 minutes a game and leads Arizona State in scoring with 18.7. 
His free-throw percentage (82.9%) is first in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect to play this much, only about 25 minutes a game," Burton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton had been expected to share playing time with starting point guard 
Marcell Capers (Manual Arts) and guard Quincy Brewer. But Capers is out for the 
season and Brewer is out until at least mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton opened the season with a 28-point performance in a 106-95 win over BYU, 
and that seemed to be a prelude of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored a career-high 29 points against fifth-ranked Arizona on Jan. 5 and 
28 points against then-No. 8 Oklahoma State. Both were losses.  
</P>
<P>
 He also was sought as a baseball player, a 27th-round selection in 1991 by the 
Cincinnati Reds. He may play baseball at Arizona State, but only if the Sun 
Devils do not get in a post-season tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State plays at USC Thursday and UCLA Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally impressive is former Dorsey High School standout Kenya Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins has started every game for Oregon at point guard, and has averaged 9.6 
points and 4.2 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month he scored a career-high 23 points against Oregon State in the Far 
West Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored 17 points, including two three-point shots, and made four steals 
against fifth-ranked UCLA in an 89-73 loss on Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at Dorsey, Wilkins led the Dons to the City 4-A championship game 
against Crenshaw, the eventual state championship, and lost 92-71. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Quarterback Eric Scott, who graduated from Crenshaw High School in 1993, will 
transfer from Northwestern at the end of the school year and is considering 
UCLA.COLLEGE ATHLET

 Fire officials are investigating a blaze at the Family Farm Market that caused 
more than $1 million worth of damage and injured three people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building was heavily damaged," said Jim Wells, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. "There was heavy smoke by the time firefighters 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze at 4322 S. Central Ave. began shortly before 9:42 p.m. Jan. 9 at the 
one-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 Two firefighters suffered minor injuries and one woman was treated at the 
scene for minor respiratory problems, said Jim Wells, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said the fire was being investigated as an independent incident and 
declined to say where the fire began. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 Betting on a new name and $1 million in remodeling, the owners of the Holiday 
Inn Crowne Plaza Los Angeles Downtown are hoping to attract more business 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to tap into that market now that the new convention center has 
opened so close by," said Albert Salah, general manager at the Holiday Inn at 
3540 S. Figueroa St., which is across from USC and about a mile south of the 
Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're changing the image to a higher standard through our association with 
the Crowne Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list of changes will be remodeling of the hotel's lobby, ballroom 
and conference rooms, Salah said. The renovations are expected to be completed 
by next month.  
</P>
<P>
 The hotel switched names on Jan. 1 from the University Hilton Hotel. It will 
remain under the same management and ownership, Salah said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to switch franchises was in part because Pacific West Company, 
the owners of the property, wanted to tap into Holiday Inn's international 
reservation system, which includes more than 1,500 hotels worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 236 Hilton hotels worldwide, according to a Hilton spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, the reason to switch was that Holiday Inn is larger than Hilton, and 
we feel we could get into the national and international market this way," 
Salah said. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; RIORDAN STRESSES JOBS AND SAFETY AT 
MEETING

<P>
 Calling safety the top priority of his administration, Mayor Richard Riordan 
has urged members of the Southern California Organizing Committee to support 
plans for additional police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs will come to a city that is safe and friendly to businesses, especially 
small businesses," Riordan said at the Wednesday night meeting at Phillips 
Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's appearance comes amid criticisms that he has failed to meet with 
area residents and leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm meeting regularly with groups in the area," said Riordan, adding that he 
plans a community forum this spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with the committee's leaders was aimed at getting city and county 
officials to pledge their support for the anti-gang Hope and Youth program as 
well as developing a job summit this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke were both asked to help 
secure more than $7 million in city and county funds for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said this year's budget request will contain $5 million for the 
program; however, Burke declined to commit to setting aside $2.9 million for 
it, citing the county's financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a financial crisis and we don't want to have to close a hospital, but 
I will work with SCOC," Burke said. "But you can't get blood out of a turnip." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people attended the meeting, where jobs, education and racial 
unity were addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Paul Stewart drew applause from the mostly Latino and African 
American audience at the start of the meeting when he called for unity among 
area residents and an end to immigrant bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when immigrants are bashed and ridiculed for coming to America, 
SCOC is working to bring together Latinos, African Americans and others," he 
said. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-47th District) has announced 16 local recipients 
of the Community Architect Awards, an honor her office gives every three years 
to residents and organizations that have demonstrated an exceptional commitment 
to their community. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those from Baldwin Hills and Crenshaw who will be honored at a Jan. 23 
reception are: 
</P>
<P>
 * James Burk, director of the William Grant Still Arts Center; * Gary Jones, 
director of Blackstreet U.S.A. Puppet Theater; * St. Elmo Village; * Chilton 
Alphonse, director of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation; * 
Institute for Black Parenting; * Lauren Schlau, chairwoman of Southwest Assn. 
of Neighbors; * Walter Dubuclet, longtime member of the Windsor Hills-based 
United Homeowners Assn.; * Lula Washington, founder of the Contemporary Dance 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore started the awards in 1979. Committees representing community business 
people, residents and other groups vote for award recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlau, a West Adams resident whose community coalition represents 2,500 to 
3,000 residents and business people, said she was gratified to have her group's 
networking efforts recognized. "We've noticed our accomplishments, but didn't 
think anyone else did," she said. "It was great to get this kind of thumbs-up."

 The Police Department's 77th Street Division has begun foot patrols along 
Crenshaw Boulevard between Vernon and Manchester avenues, City Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter announced last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Two patrols of two officers each operate from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.Funding 
for the new patrols is being provided through Project Safety L.A., a funding 
program approved by the City Council last month that uses police overtime pay 
for extra patrols.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to shift to community-based policing in our district, and we're 
starting with Crenshaw," said Jeffrey Prangm, an aide to the 6th District 
councilwoman. "These patrols are part of a long-term plan to implement more 
community involvement with the police. The whole idea is for beat officers to 
get to know their neighborhoods. We want to nip any fears business owners or 
others might have in the bud."  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Watt, who owns Cebu Restaurant on Vernon Avenue near Crenshaw, said that 
although increased patrols should improve the safety of those businesses in 
shopping centers, such as The Boys supermarket at Rodeo Road and Slauson 
Avenue, the same needs to be done along Crenshaw north to the Santa Monica 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more people parking along Crenshaw at that point, and more need for 
foot or bike patrols," he said. "Hopefully, that's next." ERIN J. AUBRY

 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown has announced the start of a state program 
designed to make more loans available to small, recession-battered businesses 
that are trying to expand and create jobs, particularly those in the inner 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear a lot of talk from Sacramento about rebuilding California's economy 
job by job," said Brown during Tuesday's news conference at Founders National 
Bank, "but those are just empty words unless we provide small businesses with 
the capital to make the investments they need to grow and hire new workers." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, the Capital Access Program, creates a form of loan insurance, 
allowing lenders to make loans to small businesses carrying higher-than-normal 
risks that they otherwise would not make. A pool consisting of premiums paid by 
the borrower and lender, as well as matching contributions by the state, will 
serve as a reserve fund to provide protection against potential defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The state will draw on private funds from large companies that obtain 
financing through the California Pollution Control Financing Authority. The 
program will be administered by the authority, and reserve funds for loan 
insurance will be placed in its Small Business Assistance Fund. Any bank or 
savings and loan can participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the $2 million in start-up funds, it's expected that about 800 loans 
averaging $50,000 will be made to small businesses this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority also provides an added incentive for lenders who do business in 
riot-affected or severely depressed areas: For each loan made, it will 
contribute 50% of the premium payments made by the borrower and the financial 
institution combined to the reserve account. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the program will give us ability to access capital better 
than those that require a lot of equity," said Bill High, who owns First 
Defense Protection, a fire protection company in the Crenshaw area. "I'll be 
able to get the $30,000 for marketing and advertising I've needed for a while, 
but had to put on the back burner." 
</P>
<P>
 Founders National Bank President Carlton Jenkins said the program will 
ultimately help his institution assist businesses such as High's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard economic times have fallen even harder on communities such as ours," 
Jenkins said. "That means my business is riskier. But this program gives me a 
real financial comfort I didn't have before. It'll mean my bank can do more to 
help the community." ERIN J. AUBRY

PAKISTAN, INDIA NEGOTIATE -- BUT TENSIONS INCREASE; SOUTH ASIA: THE TWO 
COUNTRIES TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF KASHMIR, THEN LAUNCH INTO A WAR OF WORDS. 
NEITHER SIDE TRULY WANTS A SOLUTION.

By Jennifer Griffin, Jennifer Griffin, a contributor to the Asian Wall Street 
Journal and the London Observer, has written extensively on Asian affairs.

<P>
 Their differences include a decade-old war atop a Himalayanglacier, 
accusations of cross-border terrorism and the specter of human-rights 
violations by the Indian army in what Pakistan has termed "occupied Kashmir." 
Neither side is without obstinate views on these issues. Indeed, neither side 
has softened its stance since partition and the end of British colonialism in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks earlier this month between the two countries' foreign secretaries 
resulted in little progress. But it was the first time in 14 months that India 
and Pakistan have agreed to sit down and talk about their differences -- and 
the first time Kashmir was on the agenda. With each side adhering to its 
long-held stance on Kashmir, it became evident that neither has the political 
will or domestic strength required to end the low-intensity battle between 
India's armed forces and the Muslim Kashmiris, whose fight for independence 
intensified in 1990. An estimated 8,300 people have died in the conflict in the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot pronounce that this (territory) is part of India and still say 
that we want to negotiate," said Shaharyar M. Khan, the Pakistani foreign 
minister two days after the talks. In his office is a life-sized portrait of 
Pakistan's founding father, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who first proposed partition 
from India and the creation of a Muslim state. "How can you begin to negotiate 
if the other party says this territory is non-negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Indian officials contend that Kashmir -- the northwest mountainous region 
given to India by the Maharajah Hari Singh in 1947 -- is an integral part of 
India. The conflict, they say, represents a domestic law-and-order problem. 
They accuse Pakistan of aiding the militants. In response, Pakistani leaders 
claim that the people of Kashmir must decide in a plebiscite whether they want 
to remain with India or become a part of Pakistan, as envisioned by the 1949 
U.N. resolutions on the settlement of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 With little new to say, the talks seemed doomed from the start. Public 
statements issued from Islamabad before the meeting came across as 
antagonistic. Senate resolutions virtually tied the hands of Pakistan's 
negotiators. "An impression was created that the obituary of the talks was 
being written before they were even held," said India's High Commissioner to 
Pakistan, S.K. Lambah. "In spite of that we decided to go ahead with the 
talks." 
</P>
<P>
 At a joint news conference, the foreign secretaries proclaimed the talks a 
small step forward in Indo-Pak relations. Within a week, however, a war of 
words erupted across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao said, in reference to Pakistan, that India 
was ready to combat any external threat at any time. Pakistan's foreign 
minister, Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali, warned that a nuclear war might engulf South 
Asia if Pakistan's territorial dispute with India weren't resolved. 
Negotiations seemed only to inflame tensions between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did India and Pakistan agree to talks on Kashmir? Both sides apparently 
agreed to meet to appease growing international pressure. India wants a 
permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. Instigating talks with Pakistan 
would show the international organization that it is serious about defusing the 
tension in Kashmir, where it is accused of violating human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan wants to improve relations with the United States. Late last year, it 
agreed to withdraw a U.N. resolution criticizing India's human-rights 
violations in Kashmir, and to talk with India, at the behest of the United 
States. In October, 1990, the United States froze relations, along with aid, to 
Pakistan when it became apparent that Pakistan was capable of building a 
nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States sees a solution to Kashmir as a first step toward solving 
nuclear non-proliferation in the region. Pakistan agrees the two issues are 
related. "We feel insecure, because we are the smaller of the two, and for 40 
years we have gotten the short end of the stick. If Kashmir is settled, then 
this issue of non-proliferation is easy to solve," said Pakistan's High 
Commissioner to India Riaz Khokar. "Our insecurity results because of our fear 
of India. We have a major problem that is outstanding with them." 
</P>
<P>
 But India does not want to see the nuclear issue linked to negotiations on 
Kashmir. It would not view a Pakistan offer to allow inspections of its nuclear 
plants as a concession, according to senior Pakistani officials. India needs to 
maintain its nuclear threat to balance power with China to its north. If 
Pakistan agrees to inspections, India also might be pressured to agree to 
inspections with no guarantee that China will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason for the hardening of positions after the recent talks was a 
concern for public opinion back home. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto received 
heat from her opposition in Parliament for agreeing to withdraw the U.N. 
resolution against India and sit down to talks. The Muslim League began a 
campaign to paint her fledgling government as having betrayed the people of 
Kashmir and sacrificing Pakistan's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks lack public support in Pakistan, where the issue of Kashmir is 
integrally linked to Pakistani national identity. The entire justification for 
partition rests on the premise that Muslims need a separate homeland to escape 
Hindu domination. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan's Senate passed a resolution, even before the foreign secretaries 
began talking, urging the government not to enter into any separate agreements 
on Siachen glacier, where thousands of Indian and Pakistani troops have been 
engaged in an expensive battle for more than a decade.  
</P>
<P>
 Each year, more soldiers die as a result of avalanches and frostbite than they 
do from enemy fire. Hopes were high that progress would be made on Siachen 
because both sides would benefit financially from ending this conflict, but now 
both sides are backtracking away from agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pakistan were serious about a breakthrough, it would be discussing 
independence as a third option for the Kashmiris, but Bhutto has made it clear 
there are only two options: integration with India or integration with 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Public outcry also would erupt in India should its negotiators concede 
anything on Kashmir. If India were to agree to a plebiscite in Kashmir, other 
separatist movements might gain momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 In both India and Pakistan the emotional attachment to Kashmir is too strong 
for any major progress to take place at the foreign-secretary level. At that 
level, the spotlight is on both parties to take a hard line. If the two sides 
had really wanted a breakthrough, more behind-the-scenes negotiations would 
have taken place at a lower level so that the foreign secretaries could simply 
finalize the agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should the international community be concerned that the talks failed and 
that tensions are once again high between India and Pakistan? For one, the 
dispute remains a flash point with the potential for confrontation. Both sides 
have nuclear capability and, on more than one occasion, they have threatened 
nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, it seems unlikely that the two sides will return to the 
negotiating table. The tactics being used are designed to win support at home 
and abroad, not to resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pakistani foreign minister's statement that nuclear war could sweep Asia, 
should the conflict not be resolved, is designed to draw the United States and 
others into bilateral dispute and raise international concern about the plight 
of the Kashmiris. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, Bhutto plans to be in Switzerland, where she may lead a 
delegation to Geneva to table a resolution against India at a meeting of the 
U.N. Human-Rights Commission. Such a move may score points at home, but will 
speed resumption of talks between the two powers, which represent nearly 
one-fifth of the world's population. For this reason, we should be concerned.

TIME-LIMITED WELFARE -- A REFORM FOR THE '90S?; SUCCESS OF IDEA LIKELY TO HINGE 
ON HELPING PEOPLE SHIFT INTO THE WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years on welfare and that's it. This provocative policy prescription for 
welfare reform is gaining currency at the White House and several statehouses. 
But the idea can work only if adequate supports are provided for a transition 
from welfare to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Time-limited welfare is the brainchild of welfare expert David T. Ellwood. He 
outlined how it could succeed in his noteworthy book, "Poor Support: Poverty in 
the American Family," published in 1988. Ellwood, then a Harvard professor, 
linked limited benefits to job training, education, public service jobs, 
universal health care, adequate child care, greater child support enforcement, 
an enhanced earned income tax, an increased minimum wage and other steps that 
attack the causes of poverty and make work worth more than welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellwood is now a chair of President Clinton's welfare reform task force, which 
is considering fundamental changes in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, 
the nation's largest welfare program. A veteran advocate for the poor, Ellwood 
rightly insists that government should expect more from poor parents and 
provide more to help them become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Public Welfare Assn., which represents state and local welfare 
directors, last week outlined a sophisticated plan that parallels many of the 
Clinton Administration recommendations. It calls for more government services 
such as education, job training and public service jobs as a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare directors' plan would require new recipients to participate in job 
training or classes for two years and then take the first job they found -- or 
a government-provided job. If they refused a job, they would lose 25% of their 
cash benefits and food stamps. That penalty, we think, is preferable to ending 
all cash assistance after two years, which is what Gov. Pete Wilson recently 
proposed here in California and which Wisconsin will try next year in two 
counties that have low unemployment rates. Taking away all benefits could 
dramatically increase the growing number of homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-year limit would not affect the 30% of parents who use welfare as a 
temporary bridge over hard times. It would put newcomers on notice that the 
rules are changing, and give them time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term recipients, the 30% who stay on much longer than two years, would 
get more time to become employable under the welfare directors' plan because 
that would be phased in over six years. Many would need the extra time because 
they have no skills and no work experience. Although these poor parents would 
not have to find jobs as quickly as new recipients, they would be expected to 
do something -- take classes, attend drug counseling, care for a disabled child 
or work in a community service job -- in exchange for benefits. Requiring some 
sort of service or obligation would encourage independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare directors' pragmatic plan acknowledges the reality that some 
welfare recipients would refuse to take jobs. Local welfare departments would 
evaluate those parents to determine whether they couldn't work because of a 
physical illness or emotional problem and should receive federal disability 
aid. If competent, able-bodied recipients refused to work or improve their 
skills, they would lose some benefits. Exemptions should be made for welfare 
recipients who must care for a disabled child or elderly relative, and for 
emergencies such as loss of housing, inadequate child care or lack of 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare directors estimate that their plan would cost $15 billion over six 
years. That price tag generates no enthusiasm in Washington. Nor does their 
recommendation that the federal government increase its share of welfare costs 
from the current 60% to 90%. But perhaps Congress would go along if it could be 
persuaded that, in the long run, reform would reduce welfare costs (AFDC 
expenditures are about $25 billion annually). It would also help if the 
Administration identified new revenues or made budget cuts so as not to add to 
the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans cannot be ignored on welfare reform. They too have some ideas 
about how to put poor parents in jobs. Common ground is possible -- as the 
consensus in the bipartisan welfare directors' group proves. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans want welfare reform. A reasonable time limit coupled with 
transitional support would encourage work, independence and responsibility 
without hurting poor children.

HUBBLE: FROM FIASCO TO SUBLIME; AFTER A TITANIC STRUGGLE, THERE'S A MARVELOUS 
WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has taken a while and cost a bundle, but the Hubble Space Telescope appears 
finally to be peering sharply into some of the far reaches of the universe and 
producing images of truly remarkable clarity, just as it was designed to do. 
Indeed, says Daniel S. Goldin, the administrator of NASA, "the spacecraft is 
operating beyond our ambition." While a lot more testing of the $1.5-billion 
orbiting telescope is still to be done, astronomers are excited by the early 
signs of success. 
</P>
<P>
 The shame is that the Hubble wasn't in the same condition when it was launched 
nearly four years ago. NASA thought it had a winner then, too. But two months 
after the launching, NASA had to admit that the telescope's 94.5-inch-diameter 
mirror had been improperly ground at the edges, a flaw that surely should have 
been found and rectified on the ground. It took the skills of seven astronauts 
aboard the space shuttle Endeavor to correct the Hubble's problems. Their 
tricky, $629-million rescue mission last month was a feat in itself, and it's a 
credit to those who designed and carried it out that it seems to have succeeded 
so well. 
</P>
<P>
 An orbiting observatory gets around the problem of atmospheric interference 
that Earth-based telescopes confront, making more detailed images of outer 
space possible. The Hubble, even in its flawed state, was able to send back 
images that could be strikingly enhanced by computers on the ground, but the 
sharper focus it's now expected to have will lead, Goldin promises, to 
discoveries that until now were beyond reach. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its key objectives will be to search for black holes, those theoretical 
points in the universe that are believed to be the remains of ancient stars 
that have collapsed into themselves, reducing enormous objects to diameters of 
perhaps only a few miles. A black hole, it's hypothesized, consists of matter 
so dense and thus of such powerful gravitational force that whatever is nearby, 
including other stars, is drawn into its center. Since not even light can 
escape from the gravitational grip of a black hole, its existence can only be 
inferred. The Hubble, among its other potential achievements, might finally 
provide the means for proving that these fascinating objects are in fact out 
there. Knowledge of the universe may at this moment stand on the threshold of a 
great expansion.

MOVING TOWARD THE LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On more than one occasion, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles has spoken 
out forthrightly and eloquently about the illegal immigration issue. His 
continuing observations constitute a considerable public service at a time when 
the issue is generating too much heat and precious little enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 While not gainsaying in the slightest the need to enforce the laws and 
maintain control over U.S. borders, the cardinal believes that the whole 
illegal immigration issue has been overly simplified, politicized and 
trivialized. Mahony's perspective is that to lose sight of the fundamentals -- 
which is that the people in question are not mere statistics or simply fodder 
for politicians but human beings with dignity and spirituality -- is to lose 
sight of our basic decency as a society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prophetic vision will emerge when we are willing to include the moral 
dimension in the discussion," he said to a legislative committee in Sacramento, 
"when we are able to recognize the immigrant as a sister or brother, not the 
enemy; as an opportunity to strengthen our community, not a problem to be 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration into this country, he says, will not be controlled by simple 
devices, simplistic speeches or magical policy prescriptions. Nor should the 
effort to come to grips with the problem undermine basic respect for the 
individuals involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respect for human dignity and human life is not negotiable," he said. "Human 
dignity is not determined by social class, citizenship, race or ethnicity."

WHY LAWYER-HATING IS AN AMERICAN PASTIME; LAW: TOO OFTEN, LEGAL-ETHICS COURSES 
TEACH STUDENTS THE WIN-AT-ANY-COST APPROACH. IF THE PROFESSION DOESN'T CLEAN UP 
ITS ACT, OTHERS ARE LIKELY TO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lincoln Caplan, Lincoln Caplan is the author of Skadden: Power, Money and 
the Rise of a Legal Empire (Farrar Straus & Giroux). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans hate lawyers because they charge too much, and earn way too much. 
Because they are ruthless adversaries and feckless allies. Because they engage 
in double talk, manipulate the judicial system for their own ends and leave 
people feeling abused. Because they hide behind noble-sounding ideas -- 
"serving justice" -- while playing a meaner game. 
</P>
<P>
 Take lawyer jokes as a source of insight instead of laughs. Americans regard 
lawyers as base and disloyal (Q: Why don't snakes bite lawyers? A: Professional 
courtesy). And liars (Q: How can you tell a lawyer is about to lie? A: His lips 
begin to move). The lowest of the low (Q: Why are lawyers buried in deeper 
graves than other people? A: Because, deep down, they're not so bad). 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey by the National Law Journal found that only 5% of American 
adults want their kids to become lawyers. During the past generation, when the 
number of lawyers (now more than 800,000) has risen at four times the rate of 
the nation's population, the profession's reputation has plummeted even faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? In part, the legal profession is paying the price of false expectations 
built up for a century and a half. No observation about the profession has been 
more misleading than Alexis de Tocqueville's widely quoted dictum that lawyers 
make up an American aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers were instrumental in forming America as a rule-of-law nation. But 
hostility to lawyers, and to the idea of law, is also deep-rooted in the 
American mind. This is not simply the biblical problem of lawyers drawing 
criticism for defending the crimes and chicanery of clients. Even in his own 
time, de Tocqueville was chided for overlooking widespread distrust of the 
bar's dominance, which was definitely warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The first major American bar group was formed, in 1870, expressly to reform 
the practices of lawyers and to refurbish their honor in the wake of damaging 
scandals caused by legal corruption in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 This century, the bar has been regularly criticized. Prohibition-era lawyers 
were blamed for the spread of bootlegging and related crimes. Depression-era 
lawyers were accused of abandoning all but the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar's opposition to proposals for independent regulatory agencies during 
the New Deal led to charges that it was aligned with big corporations to the 
detriment of the country. The low point may have come in the late '40s and 
early '50s, with the American Bar Assn.'s sustained leadership in the national 
witch hunt for communists. 
</P>
<P>
 But misconceptions about what lawyers actually do have fueled American disgust 
far more than misunderstandings about their role. "Lawyers lull the public into 
a view of the lawyer's role as less client-centered and as more 
public-interest-oriented than it really is," said Stephen Gillers, an expert on 
legal ethics. "The client is the center of the lawyer's universe." 
</P>
<P>
 The common wisdom among lawyers is that they have a duty to advocate their 
clients' interests zealously, no matter what the circumstances, exploiting 
every advantage -- including the wealth of their clients and the resources it 
buys. "The difficulty with such an ethic," said Robert Gordon of Stanford Law 
School, "is that it is a recipe for total sabotage of the legal framework." 
</P>
<P>
 When law schools taught legal ethics a generation ago, the courses were 
usually minor add-ons. At best, they were considered uplifting, at worst, an 
irrelevant bore. Today, because law schools are as concerned about the state of 
the profession as some practitioners, these are major courses. But, even if 
inadvertently, they often teach a gutter mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of imparting respect for the law and a commitment to helping clients 
comply with the law's requirements, legal-ethics courses teach students that 
it's their job to master a negative: what future clients can get away with, 
without punishment. They provide a road map for steering around the law's 
requirements, and reflect a cynicism that has increasingly marked U.S. law. 
Legal ethics have become a paradoxical element of competition among lawyers: 
Those who practice closest to the line without crossing seem to gain an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade and a half, leaders of the American bar have been brooding 
about the problem of the bar's character. Yet, many analyses of the 
"professionalism problem," as lawyers often call it, boil down to blaming it on 
the system -- on the American system of justice that relies on lawyers arguing 
as unfairly as possible for their client's interests on the theory that the 
process will yield the highest form of justice. According to these views, bar 
reform can only come about if the entire system of justice is changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar association just played the blame game shamelessly, when it announced 
a plan for convening a high-profile "public jury," of lawyers and non-lawyers, 
to consider ways of improving the courts and the profession. "Justice in the 
United States takes too long, costs too much and is virtually inaccessible and 
unaffordable for too many Americans," intoned a group spokesman. The ABA is 
right about the system of justice. But, rather than attacking the profession's 
problem, the group is dodging responsibility for it more brazenly than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The profession's problem has a more immediate solution: self-help. The 
downward spiral of the bar's ethics parallels the general fraying of the social 
fabric, for which the family is increasingly seen as the locus of repair. The 
best place to improve the performance of the bar may be at the legal equivalent 
of the family -- the law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 A law firm is usually led by a senior lawyer who is guided by a committee of 
peers. It's made up of partners, associates and other types of lawyers. The 
partners own it and, after paying the firm's expenses, split its profits among 
themselves. The associates do the firm's heavy work, and some (between 10% and 
25% at big firms) become partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm is seen as the villain in the bar's story -- with good reason. 
Many firms make partners of lawyers who reflect the win-at-any-cost mentality. 
No matter how high-minded a new associate might be, he or she learns the real 
values of the profession from hard-edged partners and senior associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many firms reinforce this Darwinian lesson by dividing money solely on the 
basis of worth as measured by a calculator -- how much business a partner 
generates, how many hours she bills. So they reinforce ethics that have gotten 
the legal profession in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 If lawyers don't heal themselves, however, they run the risk of having 
non-lawyers impose standards on them. And if they don't fix their profession 
soon, they run the risk of dragging down the bar's reputation even farther, 
speeding the likelihood of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers are on the verge of getting this -- even if the ABA doesn't. At bar 
meetings, it's clear lawyers lack confidence in the values at the core of what 
they do. That they've never been richer or had more influence over the shape of 
this society makes the problem epic. 
</P>
<P>
 The central role of lawyers in American life makes it imperative for all of us 
that the bar resolve its crisis. If it doesn't, whether lawyers like it or not, 
they'll get avid help.

WHITEWATER: WHEN SCANDAL SEEMS AS STYLIZED AS KABUKI; POLITICS: WASHINGTON HAS 
SHIFTED INTO DAMAGE-CONTROL HIGH GEAR. BUT CAN ANYONE IDENTIFY WHAT IS WRONG? 
OR IS THIS SMOKING GUN JUST SMOKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Act One of the Whitewater scandal ended last week on a disorderly note. 
President Bill Clinton, in the midst of his Eastern European trip, suddenly 
decided to accept political reality and ask the attorney general to appoint a 
special counsel to conduct an inquiry. At the same time, in an attempt to 
escalate hostilities, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole charged that Congress' 
regular Democratic leadership could not be trusted to probe the mess and called 
for the establishment of special Senate and House committees. But the 
President's announcement stepped all over Dole's lines. Congressional 
Democrats, gratefully seizing on the President's surrender, stoutly resisted 
the Republican call for Iran-Contra-style hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clinton did a prudent thing. But from a scientific point of view, his 
announcement was too bad, because the Washington community was on the verge of 
acting out the following thought experiment: If in today's Andy Warhol world 
you can now be famous for being famous, can you also be guilty of being thought 
guilty? How far can the scandal process go before someone finally has to say 
just what the accused official is guilty of? 
</P>
<P>
 Our political scandals have now become as stylized as Kabuki. There is the 
character of the High Official, brought low by long-ago sins. The Opposition 
Leader, pressing the scandal forward as far and fast as possible. The Inquiring 
Journalist, nobly enraged by lack of access to documents. The smooth Damage 
Controller. The Shady Character from the High Official's past. 
</P>
<P>
 Have we gotten so good that we no longer need any substantive information to 
keep the drama going? The Whitewater dance was on the verge of supplying some 
answers to this question. 
</P>
<P>
 As of a month ago, what we generally knew about Whitewater was that: (a) the 
First Couple had some savings-and-loan connections that could signify either 
foul crimes or just garden-variety Southern friends-and-neighbors politics; (b) 
a lot of papers were missing, and (c) a close Clinton aide in the White House 
had committed a surprising suicide several months before. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a whole lot -- and not much more of a fundamental nature has 
emerged since then. Instead, the current scandal burst upon us for reasons that 
were formal and technical. 
</P>
<P>
 First, in late December it became public that after Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s 
death, papers in his office concerning the Clintons' personal business affairs 
had not been given to investigators. Thus, the charge of cover-up -- which, in 
turn, was taken to imply that there must be something to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the media community had just been jolted by the trooper scandal, in 
which Arkansas police gave details of the President's past sexual exploits 
during his days as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, opinion-makers had grown increasingly queasy about their 
role in spreading such tales. And if there was any sex scandal to upset the 
faint of stomach, it was the trooper stories: They described highly private 
behavior, most already known in outline to the electorate that voted Clinton 
into the presidency in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, over there, shimmering on the horizon, was the aptly named 
Whitewater scandal: a nice, clean scandal, fit for prime-time and family 
newspapers. By pursuing Whitewater, you could avert your eyes from the 
troopers' tales, yet show you were not a Clinton patsy. Thus, the burst of 
media enthusiasm for James B. McDougal and his Madison Guaranty Savings and 
Loan was, in part, a great, windy sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 So here we were, in the Washington political audience, with our newly 
intensified interest in -- well, we still didn't know exactly what. But the 
Clintons, bless them, kept us going with their not-atypical evasiveness and 
their inexplicable insistence that Whitewater fell inside some sacrosanct "zone 
of privacy" where the press had no right to tread. This claim had approximately 
the same effect as stamping a document "Top Secret Unbelievably Classified One 
Eye Only." Media enthusiasm was sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 If everyone had continued to play his or her role as written, the next steps 
might have gone like this: Dole calls for select committee to investigate 
Whitewater. Committee appointed. Editorial opinion massively in favor of 
independent investigation. Congress quickly reauthorizes independent counsel. 
Independent counsel appointed. Independent counsel in clash with committee over 
issues of subpoenas, witness immunity. Reporter from Arkansas Stiletto finds 
witness alleging he saw Mrs. C. receiving cash in brown paper bags. Witness 
testifies. Insurance, pharmaceutical industries attack First Lady as profiteer. 
Whitewater documents turn up in abandoned car in Little Rock parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, this is a somewhat fanciful version of the future -- but not by much. Most 
Americans still do not care much about Whitewater, any more than they cared 
about those shocked Arkansas troopers. Yet, among the chattering classes, the 
Clintons are profoundly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 In his case, deep doubts persist about whether he is a President -- strong, 
stable, and capable -- or an amiable kid. 
</P>
<P>
 In her case, the situation is more poisonous. Hillary Rodham Clinton has 
become, for reasons not all of her own making, a dramatically polarizing public 
figure. She has many admirers. But her enemies are bitter. One measure of this 
is the gleeful snickering you hear around Washington as it becomes clearer that 
she, rather than her husband, played the major role in the couple's 
relationship with Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the sorts of people who lie in wait. So perhaps it is not so 
surprising that in the Whitewater matter, a modest tendril of scandal smoke 
quickly turned into the monster blaze that ate Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the rapid development of this scandal tells as much about our system of 
political communication as it does about the Clintons. We simply do not need 
much fuel any more to get ourselves going. With just a small piece of 
encouragement, we are capable of attaining critical mass and becoming 
self-sustaining in our production of scandal energy. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Clinton has pulled the rods out of the reactor. His acceptance 
of a special prosecutor has heartened his own party. It gives his people 
another justification for not making the Whitewater documents more public. The 
special prosecutor's scope and reporting requirements are not clear and may be 
subject to negotiation. The investigation will drive the case underground for 
some period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's reprieve can only be contingent and temporary. Rep. Jim 
Leach ((R-Iowa), who has been pursuing the Madison matter, is fighting with the 
Office of Thrift Supervision about access to that agency's documents. At the 
Office of Professional Responsibility, the investigation into Foster's death 
is, as they say, widening. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is investigating 
Hillary Clinton's law firm to see whether she and her colleagues misled 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has never given a clearer demonstration of the fact that it is an 
exceedingly dangerous place.

VIGILANTE JUSTICE; THE REAL MEANING OF THE MENENDEZ AND BOBBITT CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ESTRICH, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
 This was the week that privates upstaged a President. While President Bill 
Clinton was in Europe restructuring the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
seeking agree ment from Ukraine on nuclear weapons and meeting with Boris N. 
Yeltsin, millions of Americans, along with CNN viewers around the world, tuned 
in to nonstop coverage of Lorena Bobbitt's trial for assault on her husband. A 
wife cutting off her husband's penis -- how could mere diplomacy, nuclear 
weapons and the post-Cold War alliances ever hope to compete for our attention? 
Only the declaration of a mistrial in the Erik Menendez murder trial managed to 
nudge John Wayne Bobbitt's genitals off center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The extravagant coverage of the Bobbitt and Menendez cases is, in part, a 
reflection of the triumph of tabloid journalism, and its infection of what used 
to be the legitimate press. But there is more to our national fascination with 
these horrors than just the grisly fulfillment of our worst nightmares and the 
guilty pleasures of voyeurism. At issue, as well, is the place of vigilantism 
in a society supposedly governed by the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bobbitt and Menendez cases, like the recent trial of Damion Monroe 
(Football) Williams and Henry Keith Watson for the assault on Reginald O. Denny 
during the Los Angeles riots, represent a challenge to two of the most 
fundamental tenets of a civilized society: personal responsibility for criminal 
conduct, and the primacy of the rule of law. By arguing that the criminal is 
really the victim in disguise, defense attorneys have sought to win the 
sympathy of juries and their approval of what is, at best, unlawful 
vigilantism. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal law defines very narrowly the circumstances where an individual 
is allowed to use deadly force: Only when he reasonably believes that he, or 
another person, is facing imminent death or serious bodily harm. To be guilty 
of manslaughter rather than murder for an intended killing, an individual must 
believe his own death is imminent. Lorena Bobbitt was not facing imminent death 
from her sleeping husband. Lyle and Erik Menendez were not facing death as 
their parents sat in the television room eating berries and ice cream -- let 
alone as their mother crawled on all fours on the floor while her sons went 
outside to reload their guns and then came back to shoot her. Williams and 
Watson were not being threatened by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can any of these people claim to be insane as a matter of law. Insanity, 
too, is narrowly defined -- limited to people who do not understand the nature 
of wrongfulness of their conduct. Beyond that, we are expected to control 
ourselves. Most criminals kill for a reason. There is almost always an 
argument, a wrong, a slight, a deal gone bad. It is precisely when the urges 
are strongest that the need for control, not sympathy, is greatest. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the jury is to determine guilt or innocence -- not to solve 
society's problems. Jurors who are doing their jobs should find the facts and 
apply the law as stated to them, not rewrite the law to excuse criminal conduct 
because one or more jurors feels sorry for the defendent, or is moved by the 
underlying injustices that the defendant has faced in his life. The inability 
of the Erik Menendez jury to reach a verdict suggests that something more is 
going on in our courtrooms these days than the mere application of established 
law to essentially uncontradicted facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial injustice is real, and needs to be addressed. Wife beaters should be 
punished, severely. Child abusers should be punished, even more severely. But 
in a civilized society, punishment must be inflicted by the courts and the 
criminal-justice system, not by knife-wielding wives or gun-toting children -- 
let alone out-of-control rioters visiting their anger on innocent men. Even if 
one believes the essential details of Mrs. Bobbitt's claims, and the 
Menendezes' -- and I do not, at least in the Menendez case -- the fact remains 
that their appeal to sympathy is nothing more or less than an effort to give 
vigilantism a good name. Mr. Bobbitt was sleeping. The Menendez parents were 
watching television and eating ice cream. The best that can be said for Lenora 
Bobbitt and the Menendez sons is that they were getting even. That is 
vigilantism. It is sugar coating for an assault on the rule of law. It is, 
unfortunately, working. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's no stopping it. If battered wives are allowed to mutilate their 
sleeping husbands, and grown men allowed to shoot their supposedly bad parents, 
and angry teen-agers allowed to beat an innocent man nearly to death because 
they are part of a riot occasioned by racial injustice, who can condemn police 
officers who overreact because some African-Americans are indeed armed and 
dangerous. Shouldn't we feel sympathy for them, too? 
</P>
<P>
 And how about the Korean grocer working in a high-crime neighborhood, feeling 
terrorized by teen-agers, who shoots a 12-year-old shoplifting orange juice? 
Doesn't she deserve as much sympathy as Watson? And what about Ellie Nesler, 
who executed the man charged with molesting her son while he sat shackled to 
the defense table? Any parent can understand how angry she was. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no end to the possible syndromes defense attorneys can develop to 
excuse criminal conduct. Something for everyone. You simply cannot limit it to 
battered wives, or abused children -- even if the Bobbitt and Menendez 
supporters claim that they will go no further. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in Milwaukee, a teen-ager argued that he deserved leniency for a 
killing he admittedly committed because he had seen so many friends die. Can 
gang-member's syndrome be far behind? What kind of world will it be when, 
instead of controlling ourselves, people are excused precisely because they are 
out of control? 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt is a criminal, not a feminist heroine. Those feminists who have 
flocked to her defense have done a disservice not only to the cause of 
feminism, but more important, to the real victims of battered wives' syndrome 
-- the millions of women who are beaten by their husbands and do not respond by 
assaults on their organs. They are the women who deserve sympathy and 
attention, and support from the criminal-justice system -- not Lorena Bobbitt.

FAMILY PSYCHODRAMAS ACTED OUT ON A WORLD STAGE

 Calling all adult children of unelected despots: Now there's a 12-step 
recovery plan just for you, reduced to only four steps in our Big January 
Therapy Clearance! Here's how to overthrow and garrotte your inner parental 
tyrant and throw the carcass to the vultures. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Finish School . Adult children of tyrannical despots all too often receive 
little or no formal education and a huge allowance. The combination can be 
lethal! 
</P>
<P>
 Let's call him "Baby Doc." Millions in Swiss banks, a plush villa on the 
French Riviera -- and he's miserable. And why not? Baby Doc has the I.Q. of a 
mango; his papa gave him cars, girls, drugs -- everything but a sound grounding 
in the three R's. Now he sits around all day watching French TV -- too dumb to 
be bored! 
</P>
<P>
 2. Don't Hold Your Fire! Svetlana S.'s daddy gave her a tank factory, a 
province and the head of her hated geography teacher for her ninth birthday -- 
but no hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all too many adult children of tyrannical crackpots, Svetlana sniveled 
away in corners for years instead of venting her feelings of rage against an 
uncaring pop. Then, when she finally did summon the nerve to sneak up from 
behind, press her tiny derringer to his temple and squeeze the trigger -- it 
was at his State Funeral and he was already expired! 
</P>
<P>
 The joke was on Svetlana. Instead of emotional catharsis and release, she got 
12 months in a state lunatic asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Look Out for Numero Duo . Show trials instead of Broadway shows; beloved 
nannies who go to lunch and never come back again, ever; bodyguards who use 
your pet hamsters for target practice. After all you've been through as the 
child of a despotic tyrant, living well -- like the poet said -- is indeed the 
best revenge. Go to it, but . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Vamoose, by all means," advises the high-style international fugitive we'll 
call "Wendi Noriega." "But don't flee the palace until you've fleeced it!" 
Funnily, you'll finally earn the respect of that mean ol' family Generalissimo 
if you make you getaway hauling a pillow case stuffed with cash, silverware and 
jewelry. That's what he'd have done! 
</P>
<P>
 "He always says I am a wimp," recalls the recent Caribbean self-deportee we'll 
call "Fidel's Little Girl." "I am wonder what El Supremo Big Shot think the 
other morning, when he reach over to the bed table only to find him Rolex -- 
the one Leonid Brezhnev gives to him personally -- gone!" Which brings us to . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 4. Insert Knife -- Then Twist! That plucky senora we call "Fidel's Little 
Girl" promptly pawned her bad ol' Daddy's souvenir timepiece Stateside for 
enough dinero to finance an extended nationwide book tour -- then sent a 
postcard, telling him so! 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, kids of the killer-tyrant parents all agree on one thing: Escaping a 
dysfunctional, abusively neglectful hooligan-criminal family-in-name-only is 
sweet. But revenge is even sweeter. So spill your guts. Rip the lid off. Let it 
all out. You'll feel better -- and so will your agent!!!

RETHINKING NATO: GIVING EVERYONE A SEAT AT THE TABLE; ALLIANCE: CLINTON SHOULD 
LOOK TO THE 1815 CONCERT OF EUROPE AS HIS MODEL. INCLUDING RUSSIA AS PART OF 
THE NEW SECURITY COMMUNITY IS THE KEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles William Maynes, Charles William Maynes is editor of Foreign Policy 
magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The past week may convince Bill Clinton that his most recent predecessors were 
right: Foreign policy is every President's strong suit. It offers political 
escape, personal prestige and policy dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his trip to Europe, the President was on the defensive. The Whitewater 
affair was stalking him politically. Health-care reform was under attack by 
some Democrats and all the various interest groups. His nominee for defense 
secretary turned out not to have paid Social Security for his maid. And critics 
denounced as inadequate the Administration's "Partnership for Peace" proposal, 
which denied the Eastern Europeans security guarantees against aggression while 
allowing Russia, as well as the Eastern European countries, to establish closer 
ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern European leaders vied to heap scorn on the proposal before it had even 
been presented. The French were threatening to rain on the President's European 
parade by pressing Clinton at the NATO meeting for military commitments on 
Bosnia he did not want to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Brussels trip. Suddenly, a man known as Bill Clinton at home was 
presented to the world as William J. Clinton. The man known at home as the 
Democratic occupant of the White House was transformed abroad into the 
President of all Americans. The headlines abruptly turned favorable. Foreign 
carping ceased. The Eastern Europeans signed on to "Partnership for Peace." The 
French compromised on Bosnia. The President announced an agreement among 
Russia, Ukraine and the United States that will lead to the destruction of 
nuclear-tipped missiles on Ukrainian soil now targeted against the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, it was a pretty good week. How did such a reversal of fortune occur? 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that, in the final analysis, the East and West Europeans really 
had no choice but to follow the American lead. The Eastern Europeans may have 
wanted formal security guarantees and immediate entry into NATO. But if they 
could not get these, were they going to turn down closer military ties with the 
West? 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Europeans may have wanted to press the Americans to become more 
engaged militarily in the Bosnian imbroglio. Yet, if Clinton had said the 
United States was willing to take decisive measures militarily, would they have 
followed? 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important reason for the President's triumph last week is: He was 
more right than his critics about his "Partnership for Peace" proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics contend that a historic opportunity may be lost. They worry that 
NATO must be "out of area or out of business." They urge, in the words of 
Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, that NATO "project stability beyond 
NATO's current borders;" that it engage in crisis management and peacekeeping, 
and that it "lay the foundation for the integration of the East through 
expanded membership." But it is highly questionable whether the expansion of 
NATO could accomplish any of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Europe had common borders with the Soviet Union but does not with 
Russia. Stability is threatened in that region not because of a threatened 
Russian attack but because of boiling ethnic and economic conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Slovakia have made it clear that the reason they want to enter NATO 
is not because they fear an attack from Russia but from Hungary, which is 
troubled over the plight of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. Hungary is also 
troubled by discrimination against Hungarians in Romania. Poland recently 
revived the fortunes of former communists because of the economic effects of 
shock therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther east, there are legitimate concerns about relations with Russia, but 
no one is proposing to extend NATO to the Baltic states, Belarus and Ukraine 
because that would clearly trigger an immediate Russian reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would an expanded NATO be better equipped to engage in crisis management 
or peacekeeping than the current NATO. It would still be ineffective in Bosnia 
for the same reasons: Because no major state wants to send large numbers of 
troops into combat to end what is largely a civil war. That reality will not 
change if Polish or Czech defense ministers sit at the table in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the inclusion of the Eastern European states into NATO "lay the 
foundation for their integration into the West?" What the Eastern Europeans 
need is entry into the European Union. Postponing full membership, the EU has 
signed association agreements with several Eastern European states in the past 
two years. But EU members have delayed ratification for months. Portugal has 
claimed it was short of translators. Belgium has complained about "internal 
procedural problems." France cites legal difficulty. And Germany has been held 
hostage by the doctor's lobby, which objects vehemently to a provision that 
permits Eastern European doctors to practice in Germany. The EU now enjoys a 
trade surplus with impoverished Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry into NATO could marginally increase the pressure on the EU to be more 
responsive to the Eastern Europeans. But the question for the United States is 
whether the purpose of NATO should be distorted to provide a minimal boost to 
the membership prospects of Eastern Europeans in the EU. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics denounce the Clinton Administration for being too Russocentric. They 
are concerned by the rise of Strobe Talbott to the position of deputy secretary 
of state because he is the driving force behind current policy toward Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration deserves credit for leaving open a critical 
choice facing the West in the way it approaches the security issue in Europe: 
Does it want to preserve a security alliance or create a security community? 
</P>
<P>
 A security alliance requires an enemy and it is clear who the critics have in 
mind. The president of Poland says he wants Poland to join NATO to put Russia 
in a "cage." Most of the advocates of NATO expansion in the United States adopt 
a similar view but with softer edges. They propose increased contacts with the 
Russians to reassure them, but in the end they want the Eastern Europeans in 
Europe and the Russians out. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it possible to freeze out a major state from the decision table? 
History offers some interesting lessons on this. In 1815, and again in 1918, 
Europe faced a fundamental choice in dealing with a powerful, defeated power. 
In 1815, the victorious powers decided to create a security community -- and 
included France in the Concert of Europe. In 1918, the victorious powers 
decided to put Germany in a cage and deny it a place at Europe's decision 
table. The choice in 1815 allowed the Europeans to go nearly 100 years without 
a major war. The choice in 1918 lasted little more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, events in Russia could make the creation of a security community 
impossible. In that event, the Eastern Europeans will be eager to accept 
whatever guarantees the West will grant them. But the approach of the Clinton 
Administration is sound. Its model should be Robert Stewart Castlereagh, the 
British foreign secretary in 1815, not Woodrow Wilson, who failed in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a criticism that one can make of the Administration, it is that 
its vision has not been bold enough. It has not clearly stated that its desired 
outcome would be Russian participation in Western institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 During the formulation of the Marshall Plan, the United States invited the 
Soviet Union to participate. Josef Stalin refused because he did not want to 
open up his system. That choice was fateful. But even at the beginning of the 
Cold War, U.S. decision-makers made it clear that they considered Russia part 
of Europe. We should learn from their example.

NATO: IS IT A BRAVE NEW WORLD FOR THE OLD MILITARY ALLIANCE?; POLITICAL 
FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What will the North Atlantic Treaty Organization look like by the year 2000? 
The Times asked six former government officials and scholars. Paul H. Nitze 
</P>
<P>
 Former deputy secretary of defense during the Reagan Administration and a 
special presidential adviser on arms control.  
</P>
<P>
 I think that NATO will be essentially unchanged. I don't know whether it will 
grow. That's not important. The important thing is that the United States is 
now the sole superpower and if force is to be used in any way, we have to use 
NATO as the organization through which that force is applied. Even if we'd like 
to get out of these obligations, we can't do it. Zbigniew Brzezinski 
</P>
<P>
 Former national-security adviser during the Carter Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, NATO will be widened -- Central European countries will be 
part up of it and, hopefully, Ukraine and the Baltic republics will be linked 
closely to NATO. NATO will also have a relationship with Russia -- that is the 
purpose of policy. However, if we continue drifting like we are now, NATO will 
be in a state of dissolution, Germany will be flirting with Russia and Central 
Europe will be a dangerous security vacuum. But I think this is avoidable. 
James R. Schlesinger 
</P>
<P>
 Former secretary of defense during the Nixon Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 I would expect that NATO will have expanded by the year 2000 picking up some 
of the former (Soviet) satellites. I think NATO represents a kind of embodiment 
of the Atlantic alliance that continues to be quite important.  
</P>
<P>
 However, what its specific functions in the military realms will be, are only 
possibilities. The European members of NATO may come increasingly to believe 
they have the responsibility to limit instability in Eastern Europe and 
Southeastern Europe and might involve themselves in the future in Bosnia; but 
it might not include the U.S. Among the most interesting developments in recent 
weeks is the recognition that European members of NATO, if they have a mission, 
will be entitled to use the NATO infrastructure. Richard N. Perle 
</P>
<P>
 Former assistant secretary of defense during the Reagan Administration and now 
a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 If we fail to define a new sense of purpose for NATO, it will not survive 
until the year 2000. A missed opportunity (last week) was the decision not to 
admit Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to full membership. They came 
close, but no cigar. Because NATO was created to deal with the military threat 
of the Warsaw Pact, over time, there will be an erosion of sense of purpose, 
whereas enlarging NATO would bring in some new members who worry about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to expand the sense of NATO purpose is to look beyond the 
traditional, to the southeast, where instability is chronic -- the Persian 
Gulf. Given the importance of the Gulf to NATO, they should take some 
responsibility for security in the region. But I don't see things moving in 
that direction. I see no desire on the part of the allies to assume 
responsibility. Unless that changes, NATO will be increasingly irrelevant. 
Raymond L. Garthoff 
</P>
<P>
 Former ambassador to Bulgaria in the Carter Administration, now a senior 
fellow at Brookings Institution.  
</P>
<P>
 I think NATO will probably have some form of expanded membership, something 
that would go beyond Partnership for Peace, where they have membership in the 
NATO Council without being part of the military committee. . . . NATO as NATO 
could be superseded by another body or it could take on functions previously 
held by other organizations. For example, it could take on some peacekeeping 
functions handled by the United Nations. As (NATO membership) broadens, its 
commitment to military assistance may not be the same in the future. . . . 
People would be concerned about open-ended commitments, considering that local 
frictions might develop into conflicts between members. Greece and Turkey are a 
good example, and there are similar possibilities with Hungary and Slovakia. 
George Bunn 
</P>
<P>
 Former arms negotiator and member in residence of the Center for International 
Security and Arms Control, Stanford University.  
</P>
<P>
 I think NATO is going to grow and this will lead to more problems in domestic 
politics: Congress doesn't want to be online to defend a lot of other 
countries. There was a question after the Soviet Union disintegrated as to 
whether (NATO) was relevant. But it's clear that to Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary and Slovakia, NATO is very important.

WHY MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IS A GAY-RIGHTS HERO; HIS LIFE AND HIS MESSAGE 
RESONATE BEYOND THE FIGHT AGAINST RACIAL PREJUDICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT DAWIDOFF and MICHAEL NAVA, Robert Dawidoff is a professor of history 
at the Claremont Graduate School. Michael Nava is a lawyer. They are co-authors 
of Created Equal: Why Gay Rights Matter to America, to be published in April by 
St. Martin's Press.

<P>
 One heated controversy in the civil-rights community is whether the struggle 
by lesbian and gay Americans for equal citizenship is a legitimate part of that 
movement. Increasingly, lesbians and gays are using the imagery and rhetoric of 
the traditional civil-rights movement for their own struggle. This was 
symbolized at the April 1993 March on Washington -- the tactic itself borrowed 
from Martin Luther King Jr. -- by a placard that read "Thank you, Dr. King." 
Some civil-rights leaders like Coretta Scott King, Benjamin Chavis of the NAACP 
and Jesse Jackson have made it clear that sexual orientation is a civil-rights 
issue and must be regarded as such; other leaders of the coalition that 
comprised the civil-rights movement have been reluctant to make the leap from 
race to sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong religious roots of the crusade for African American freedom are a 
frequent stumbling block on this issue. Like most churches, black churches are 
at best divided over homosexuality. Many tend to accept the disputed notion 
that homosexuality is a sin and to ignore the considerable evidence that 
whatever revelation there is on this subject is human, not divine. The 
appropriation by gays and lesbians of the rhetoric and imagery of the movement 
in which these churches and their religious imagery played so crucial a role 
must seem not merely insulting, but sacrilegious. 
</P>
<P>
 There also exists an understandable feeling of the part of many African 
Americans that the civil-rights struggles and its heroes such as King belong to 
them. It is unarguable that the struggle against discrimination by women, 
ethnic and sexual minorities and the disabled appropriate the history of 
Africans in the United States. Only native Americans can be simply said to have 
so powerful a hold on the notion of justice in this nation. It is possible 
still to say with Abraham Lincoln and W.E.B. DuBois that the test of America's 
principles is how they remedy the injustices on its population of African 
origin. This sense of the dimensions of their persecution and their heroic 
movement for equality gives many black Americans the feeling that civil rights 
is theirs and that its use by other groups, especially homosexuals, is a 
distortion and a theft. 
</P>
<P>
 A third problem in addressing gay rights from the civil-rights perspective is 
prejudice. The prejudice against lesbians and gay men and the routine dismissal 
of their claim that homosexual and heterosexual should be equal under the law 
is entrenched in society. This prejudice is reinforced by the tendency of other 
minorities to see gay rights as a movement of affluent white men. This 
misperception does incalculable harm to the lesbian and gay members of their 
own communities, who are thereby doubly marginalized by race and sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can gay men and lesbians claim Martin Luther King Jr. as our hero? He 
appears to have been relatively unbiased against gays, but never saw them in 
civil-rights terms. He relied on Bayard Rustin (and resisted many attempts to 
purge this brilliant strategist) and read James Baldwin, but a private 
appreciation of gays, without public acknowledgment, is nothing new. What makes 
King our hero is his life and his message. 
</P>
<P>
 Like gays, King met with as much resistance as support from the churches, 
black and white, that now routinely honor him. Like so may other great 
preachers and leaders, King transcended the roots of his own commitment, 
although he never abandoned them. His theological and philosophical journey 
took him to Gandhi and Thoreau and Niebuhr, and he brought them back with him. 
When the civil-rights movement seemed to stall in the mid- and late '60s, as 
legal racial segregation was being dismantled, it was King who saw that war and 
class, poverty and urban realities were also civil-rights issues. We tend to 
forget how little welcome that message was and how many of his old allies 
deserted and dismissed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The parallels between gay rights and traditional civil-rights causes are real. 
Slavery and racial segregation were defended from the pulpit using some of the 
same biblical texts, including Leviticus, that are used to stigmatize gays. The 
major obstacle to gay rights is prejudice, supported, as is racial prejudice, 
through stereotypes. Like blacks, gays are regularly subjected to grotesque 
sexual slander. Like the notorious color line that enacted segregation, sodomy 
laws, state and local propositions and the ban against gays in the military 
enforce a lavender line of inequality for gays. The threat of violence easily 
gives way to violent acts against lesbians and gay men who threaten that line. 
</P>
<P>
 For King, the point of the civil-rights movement was to secure equality and 
justice. He insisted that everybody must learn this lesson. He did not 
distinguish between the victims of injustice. He also realized that social 
justice and civil equality are not fixed commodities and that extending them to 
one disenfranchised group need not mean taking them away from others. King 
understood how abiding prejudice is and how many reasons people can find to 
rationalize their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 It is often hard to tell the difference between honoring King's memory and 
carrying on his work. His reach was so large and his concerns so many that 
reasonable people are bound to disagree about what his example means. It is 
exactly right for lesbians and gay men to claim King for our hero because ours 
is a civil-rights movement. Our crusade for equal protection of the laws, the 
cessation of routine violence against us and our right to live morally serious 
lives in inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.

COLUMN LEFT / BERNARD SANDERS: WHITHER AMERICAN DEMOCRACY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNARD SANDERS, Bernard Sanders, an Independent, is Vermont's lone U.S. 
representative. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Americans no longer see the relevance of government to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only Independent in Congress, I have the responsibility to raise issues 
that my Democratic and Republican colleagues choose not to deal with. Let me 
briefly touch upon three issues of enormous consequence that, while ignored in 
Congress, must be addressed by the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States is, increasingly, an oligarchy. The richest 1% of our 
population now owns 37% of the wealth, more than the bottom 90% of the people. 
The chief executive officers of the Forbes 500 corporations earn 157 times more 
than their average worker. The gap between the rich and the poor is wider than 
at any time since the 1920s. From 1983 to 1989, 55% of the increase in family 
wealth accrued to the richest half of 1% of families, while the lower-middle 
and lower classes lost more than $250 billion of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Oligarchy refers not just to the unfair distribution of wealth, but to the 
fact that the decisions that shape our consciousness and affect our lives are 
made by a very small and powerful group of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The mass media (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, publishers, movie 
and video companies), for example, are largely controlled by a few 
multinational corporations that determine the news and programming we see, hear 
and read -- and, ultimately, what we believe. While violence, scandal, horror, 
sports and Rush Limbaugh are given much attention, we are provided with 
virtually no in-depth analysis of the problems facing working people or their 
possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic decisions that wreck the lives of millions of American families are 
made by a handful of CEOs. While these corporate leaders bemoan the breakdown 
of "morality" and "law and order," they close down profitable companies, cut 
wages and benefits, deny retired workers their pensions and transport our jobs 
to Third World countries. American workers, who have often given decades of 
their lives to these companies, have absolutely no say as to what happens to 
them on the job. They are powerless and expendable, which is what oligarchy is 
all about. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States is becoming a Third World economy. The standard of living 
of the average American worker continues to decline. The real wages of American 
production workers have dropped by 20% during the past 20 years, as millions of 
decent-paying jobs have disappeared. The new jobs that are being created are 
largely temporary, part-time, low-wage and with few benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, the United States led the world in terms of the wages and 
benefits our workers received. Today, we are in 12th place. Our wages, health 
care, vacation time, parental leave and educational opportunity lag behind much 
of the industrialized world. Much of our economic and social life is more and 
more resembling that of the desperate Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two percent of our children live in poverty. Five million kids go 
hungry. About 2 million Americans now lack permanent shelter or sleep out on 
the streets -- many of them mentally ill. One in every 10 American families now 
puts food on the table only with the aid of food stamps. Tens of millions more 
survive, on bare subsistence, from paycheck to paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 In more and more abandoned neighborhoods in America, a lack of jobs, income, 
education and hope has created an extraordinary climate of savagery and 
violence surpassing that of many communities in Latin America, Africa and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The suffering and desperation in the Third World that we have distantly 
observed is now coming home, as we become a Third World economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States is fast becoming a non-democratic country. We have the 
lowest voter turnout of any major industrialized country -- 55% in the 1992 
presidential election. It is expected that the 1994 off-year election turnout 
will be about 36%. In local elections, the turnout is often far lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple fact is that the majority of Americans, and the vast majority of 
poor and working people, no longer believe that their government is relevant to 
their lives. They understand very clearly that real power rests with a wealthy 
elite and that voting for Tweedle-dee or Tweedle-dum is not going to change 
that reality or improve their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 If democracy is going to survive in this country, tens of millions of poor and 
working people are going to have to see the connection between their economic 
condition and the political process. They must vote not for the lesser of two 
evils, but for jobs, income, health care and the dignity to which they, as 
human beings, are entitled. Only when that occurs will American democracy 
become revitalized.

WESTSIDE WATCH: MAGAZINE GIVES LOCAL PRESCHOOLS 'E' FOR EGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The February issue of Spy magazine includes a none-too-flattering look at how 
rich L.A. parents scheme to get their kids into exclusive power kindergartens. 
</P>
<P>
 Singled out for a good thrashing is the Westside's very own Crossroads School, 
described by Spy as a "funky campus overlooking the Santa Monica Freeway" with 
a non-traditional program that has attracted the children of Barbra Streisand, 
O.J. Simpson, Bob Dylan and Robert DeNiro. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine also dings two other Westside institutions: the Center for Early 
Education, "founded by psychoanalysts," and Circle of Children, "the preschool 
to the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are schools," says one unnamed observer quoted in Spy, "where they 
can't guarantee whether your child will be able to read or write when they get 
out, but their sense of self-esteem will be firmly in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads Headmaster Roger Weaver, a former Spy subscriber, termed the story 
"shabby and pointless." He accused the magazine of obsessing over Hollywood. "I 
wish Spy magazine would get over their fetish with the film industry in L.A.," 
he said.

 INCH BY INCH: If progress is measured in inches, frosh Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) gained a few of them last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In her second attempt to advance campaign finance reform legislation, two of 
six committee members voted to move her bill forward. That's two more than last 
time around, when her legislation died in silence for lack of a motion to 
consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 But alas for Bowen, her latest measure died in a 2-2 deadlock, with Westside 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) one of two committee members who 
missed the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disappointment, Bowen said, but not a surprise in hidebound 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are accustomed to doing business under the current system," she said. 
"They know where the deep pockets are." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen says she'll make her next try after the November election, when more of 
the legislative Old Guard will fall by the term-limits wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WAYWARD SITCOM: Does anyone want to be here anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 We're all familiar with the exodus from Southern California, the residents and 
businesses fleeing for greener pastures. But now the flight has hit the 
situation comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "These Friends of Mine," an ABC sitcom to debut this spring, was originally to 
be set on the Westside. Its main characters, Ellen Morgan (Ellen DeGeneres) and 
Adam (Arye Gross) were to live in the Fairfax district. 
</P>
<P>
 But nooooo : The show will be set in San Francisco instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't like L.A. and if you're not in (show) business why would 
you live in L.A.?" DeGeneres said. "(San Francisco) is a more interesting 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 The series will still be shot on a Culver City sound stage, though. So eat 
your heart out, city by the Bay.

FROM BUST TO BUSTLE; PLAN TO REVIVE WESTWOOD VILLAGE INCLUDES A MAKE-OVER AND 
NEW BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure, Tom Carroll wants to see Westwood Village rise from its slumber. Why, 
just the idea of having its theaters, restaurants and shops bustle again with 
customers sends Carroll's hard-charging personality into overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever you do, don't ask the village's 45-year-old business consultant 
and marketing manager about returning Westwood to the boom town days of the 
1970s and early 1980s. Because the way Carroll sees it, what got Westwood into 
trouble in the first place was its onetime status as Los Angeles' premier 
nightspot. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, Westwood was the place to go for first-run movies. It was the 
place people came to on dates and for dinner," said Carroll, executive director 
of the Westwood Village Management Corp. "So there was this enormous pressure 
on Westwood and its businesses. . .and to a certain degree, it blew up on them. 
So, we're not looking to be a boom town. . .boom town was a boon and then a 
bust." 
</P>
<P>
 The decline was long and painful. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, village restaurants and shops were in dire shape. After large 
crowds and parking problems led some to shy away from the village, other 
problems such as the recession, competition from other plazas and several 
well-publicized crimes contributed to Westwood's downward spiral. This time 
last year, more than 15% of the village's 300 or so stores stood vacant and 
those still open were hurting for customers. So troubled was the village that 
the Los Angeles City Council earmarked $600,000 from a special parking fund as 
seed money for the area's make-over. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as Carroll approaches the end of his first year with the village's 
management company, he and others say a revival of Westwood is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in six or seven years, we have seen people talk positively 
about the future of the village. That you can do business there. That people 
have invested in the place," said Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose 
district includes Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the corner has been turned," added Rich Given, president of the 
Westwood Village Assn., a 150-member nonprofit group made up of merchants, 
homeowner groups and representatives of local schools and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October's Westwood Village Celebration, a two-day festival that drew 
some 10,000 people, the village has been renewed with a sense of hope, Given 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are now seeing some positive differences in the physical appearance of 
Westwood Village. You see new trees. New (sidewalk) furniture. Even new trash 
receptacles," he said. "You have seen the beginnings of what will come." 
</P>
<P>
 The new vision for Westwood is a place with wide, tree-lined sidewalks dotted 
by outdoor cafes, clubs and new nationally known retailers. A place that will 
lure people from Westwood neighborhoods, Wilshire Boulevard office towers and 
UCLA. A place where the crowds may be a bit older and moneyed than at other 
shopping plazas such as the one Carroll last helped revive: Santa Monica's 
Third Street Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Monica was a hard eight-year job," Carroll said, recalling the complete 
make-over for that long-dormant outdoor mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This month, Carroll said, the village revamp will surge forward when the 
Westwood Village Management Crop. signs a contract with at least one more major 
retailer and announces the results of a traffic study vital to construction of 
a parking deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "January," Carroll said, smiling, "will be sort of a coming-out party for the 
village." 
</P>
<P>
 By month's end, officials hope to advance the village's make-over in several 
ways: 
</P>
<P>
 A long-awaited traffic study will be released to pinpoint the demand for a new 
$5-million-plus parking structure on Broxton Avenue. Once the amount of new 
parking is determined, officials hope to begin construction of the structure 
within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The village's so-called Streetscape, an ambitious renovation that includes new 
storefront designs, sidewalks and landscaping, will be unveiled Thursday to the 
merchants association. The $2.8-million plan, developed by Gruen and Associates 
of Los Angeles, calls for complementing the village's Mediterranean-style 
architecture with wide promenades decorated with jacaranda trees and other 
flora. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of new businesses -- particularly restaurants -- will be in full 
swing. A leas for a Circuit City electronics store, the village's first major 
new retailer in decades, is expected to be signed this month. Construction also 
is slated to start on a Jerry's Famous Deli, a 250-seat version of the popular 
Studio City-based restaurant chain. And two other popular franchise 
restaurants, Arizona-based Maloney's Taverns and Texas-based Hooters. A sports 
bar featuring barbecue are under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 While enthusiastic about the long-term plans, Carroll is particularly excited 
about what is already in the works because he believes the soon-to-open stores 
and restaurants will be the first test of Westwood Village's promise. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Circuit City, for example, Carroll notes that the village has 
not had another large retailer selling electronics since Sears, which left the 
area in the 1950s, "So this is the biggest retailers of its kind to come here 
in practically 40 years. And that is a major change," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed location of the 26,000-square-foot store, at Gayley Avenue and 
Lindbrook Drive, also will serve as a commercial anchor for downtown Westwood, 
Carroll said, because it will be at the southwest corner of the village. 
Bullock's, the only other large retailer, is at the northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he says, Circuit City officals anticipate that the store's annual 
sales will top $20 million, a volume that will mean a significant number of 
shoppers.

COURTHOUSE PLAN IS CASE OF ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT; CONSTRUCTION: SUPERVISORS 
SHELVE SITES IN SANTA MONICA AND WEST L.A., BUT WORK WILL PROCEED ON FACILITY 
NEAR LAX.

 Los Angeles County Supervisors have dropped the gavel on plans to build new 
courthouses in Santa Monica and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed structures will be put on indefinite hold. But in a mixed verdict 
that offered some hope of relief from chronic courtroom crowding on the 
Westside, the supervisors decided to go ahead with construction of a new 
courthouse near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building at 111th Street and Aviation Boulevard in Westchester, which 
has already cost the county $23.2 million in preliminary development costs, is 
expected to serve an area stretching south of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, expected to be completed in 1996, would relieve pressure on 
existing courts in Santa Monica and West Los Los Angeles while serving the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors' 4-1 decision Tuesday also promised funds to add a 
new hearing room to the courthouse in Malibu, which would allow for the 
transfer of a Superior Court judge from Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will make more space here and we can really use it," said David Rothman, 
supervising judge of the Santa Monica courts, where unused jury rooms have been 
pressed into service as jurists' chambers as the caseload mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Probation offices will also be moved into leased quarters elsewhere, freeing 
up more space at the Civic Center facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we're not getting a courthouse, we're getting a lot of help here," 
Rothman said. "We have to male some major renovations he to make it possible to 
survive the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of Westside courthouses was decided as part of a decision to 
indefinitely postpone six proposed projects on which the county has already 
spent $16 million. Aside from Santa Monica and West Los Angeles, the others are 
in Lancaster, North Hollywood, Pasadena and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would have faced deficits of up to $312 million over a nine-year 
period if it had continued with plans to build all the courthouses envisioned 
in a plan dating to the early 1980s, county Chief Administrative Officer Sally 
R. Reed told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven new and replacement structures have been built in that period, she said, 
resulting in an increase of more than 100 courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But projected costs have gone up dramatically, and court-imposed penalty fees 
that were supposed to fund the new courthouses have been difficult to collect 
because they have proved unaffordable to many. 
</P>
<P>
 Courthouse construction money comes from two different funds that tap general 
court fines, court-imposed traffic school fees and parking citations. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising through the late 1980s, the annual revenue for courthouse 
construction and related costs has dropped steadily from $46.4 million in 
1989-90 to $35.3 million in the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, only the Westchester project and another in Chatsworth 
were approved, largely because so much money has been spent on them so far.  
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for there to be no expansion in staff to run the new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hoped that construction of a new courthouse here would relieve the 
problem," said Ray Hart, supervising judge at West Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're going to have to deal with what we have and hope that construction 
of the courthouse at the airport will proceed with all due diligence," he said.

BRIEFLY; POLITICS: NOVEMBER VOTE ON CIVIC CENTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of the Santa Monica Civic Center redevelopment plan don't know yet 
whether their referendum has qualified for the ballot, but they do know which 
ballot they want it on: November's. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate letters to Mayor Judy Abdo state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) 
and the opponents' group, Citizens for a Better Civic Center, urged delaying a 
vote until November to save money.They claim it will be $80,000 cheaper than a 
special election and $50,000 cheaper than adding the referendum to the June 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Abdo said her preference is to deal with the matter sooner rather than 
later. Art: Getty Names Curator of Paintings

FANS OF TANGO KING WANT STAR TO SHINE ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Devotees of tango titan Carlos Gardel are doing their darndest to gain a 
posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for a man they compare to James 
Dean, Al Jolson, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Julio Iglesias and Maurice 
Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, hardly anyone north of the Panama Canal had ever heard of 
Gardel when the legendary Argentinian crooner, composer and actor died in a 
plane crash in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 Local emigres have been working toward a shot at sidewalk immortality for 
Gardel, known to his fans as Carlitos, since 1985 -- the 50th anniversary of 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Gardel name has yet to ring any bells at the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce, which is responsible for the Walk of Fame. The Chamber, after all, is 
looking to honor stars who will attract the young American tourists that make 
up the bulk of the Walk's business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been deceased so long, and an awful lot of deceased people don't get 
in," said Johnny Grant, head of a secret committee that sifts through hundreds 
of nominations and comes up with no more than 20 honorees a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardel, the son of an unmarried French immigrant washerwoman, grew up in the 
slums on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. As a youth, he sang for centavos at the 
open-air Abasto market, moved sets at the opera and won his first acclaim as a 
performer of Gaucho-style country music. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking up the tango and changing his image to that of a sleekly-coiffed 
man-about-town, he made records that sold wildly as the slinky touch dance 
caught the fancy of the international elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Hailed by singers from Bing Crosby to Placido Domingo, dozens of his albums 
and CDs are still in print. A recently published discography was titled, "Time 
Goes On, Carlitos Remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, admirers often put lighted cigarettes between the fingers of the 
grinning statue that marks his grave in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardel's tenor voice was the first and greatest vehicle for the tango, the 
sexy and soulful lament that rivals grain, beef and hides as Argentina's 
greatest export. His voice has yet to be surpassed among tango singers, said 
Luis Riccheri, Argentina's consul general in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today you can listen to the radio in Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, 
Uruguay and you will find they still have records played by this guy who left 
60 years ago," said Riccheri. Elvis-like sightings have been reported over the 
years, and his fans like to say, "He's singing better every day," whenever 
Gardel's name is mentioned. Said Riccheri, "It's a crazy attitude, but it's 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardel never made it big in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 His height was modest and so were his looks, at least by U.S. standards, the 
entertainment industry daily Variety said in 1935. "Carlos Gardel was tops in 
his own field..." Variety said. "It is a bit hard for the average non-Latin to 
figure out just why." 
</P>
<P>
 And letters to the Hollywood Chamber from local officials such as Los Angeles 
City Councilwoman Laura Chick do not appear to have advanced Gardel's cause 
much. Chick wrote at the request of a constituent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of letters from politicians," Grant said. "If he's going to get 
it, it's because the board thinks his achievements have gotten it for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant may know his board, which is made up of anonymous representatives from 
radio, music, movie, television and theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does not know the devotion of Gardel's fans, organized as the Comite 
Gardeliano de California (Carlos Gardel, Presidente Honorario y Eterno). 
</P>
<P>
 "You always go back to your first love," their hero sang in one of his most 
popular tangos, and so they have. Having picketed at Hollywood and Vine and 
threatened to start their own Walk of Fame in downtown Los Angeles, they are 
now trying to get the help of actor Robert Duvall, who nurses a passion for all 
things Argentinian. 
</P>
<P>
 In a neat little bungalow in La Canada, the group's chairman, Enrique Zayas, 
presides over all things Gardelian, his study a shrine to Gardel. "I am an 
American," said Zayas, who emigrated after the fall of Juan Peron in 1955. "I 
am very busy with the church and I volunteer for the city. But one piece of my 
heart I keep for Argentina."

URGENT CARE; THE NUMBER OF GENERAL PRACTICE PHYSICIANS IS IN A VIRTUAL 
FREE-FALL, BUT NURSES WITH ADVANCED TRAINING ARE TAKING ON MORE 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Chanel Ko does not trust doctors. Not after what happened last year. That is 
when the 36-year-old dental student went to a Westwood gynecologist to seek 
treatment for a lingering bacterial infection But two months, a dozen tests and 
more than $4,000 later -- the uninsured Ko's life savings -- her infection was 
worse than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so upset, I spent my money for nothing," Ko said. She then followed a 
recommendation and visited the Westside Women's Clinic in Santa Monica, where 
nurses gave her antibiotic that cleared up her infection within a week. Since 
then, Ko has remained a regular patient of the nurse-staffed clinic, depending 
on it for routine checkups, medical advice and her birth control needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Even) if some doctor offered me the same price, I would still come here," 
said a still-indignant Ko. "The nurses here are very professional. They see us 
as an individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the brave new world of American health care, and to the medial 
providers helping usher it in: nurses. No longer just doctors' assistants 
relegated to office work and taking blood pressures, advanced-practice nurses 
today are performing more and more complex medical procedures than ever, 
supplementing and sometimes supplanting the care of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend, due mainly to a worsening shortage of general practice doctors, is 
evident on the Westside and throughout Los Angeles. At clinics, HMOs and in 
private-practice settings, advanced-practice nurses are providing primary care 
services such as suturing wounds, prescribing drugs, ordering tests, even 
performing spinal taps and tracheotomies. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA's School of Nursing, which because of budget cuts may lose its 
undergraduate program, officials recently unveiled a special one-year 
curriculum designed for advanced-degree nurses to deliver primary care. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA program, scheduled to begin in the summer, will be the only one of 
its kind offered through the University of California system. School of Nursing 
officials say they were showered with responses from prospective applicants 
when they proposed the program, which will train students to become family 
practice or pediatric nurse practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest appears to be justified. With the Clinton Administration 
promising to provide health coverage for 35 million to 40 million previously 
uninsured Americans, experts expect that in the coming decades, nurses will 
bear an ever-increasing burden of the nation's primary care needs. Already, 
says Bonnie Faherty, a UCLA School of Nursing lecturer, the need for nurses is 
so great there are four jobs for every nurse that graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics tell the story. The type of medical care Americans receive most 
often is primary care: basic, initial treatment that includes portions of 
general and internal medicine, family practice, general pediatrics and, in some 
cases, obstetrical and gynecological care. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the number of physicians practicing general medicine in the United States 
has been in a freefall for several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, barely two of every five physicians practice general medicine, compared 
with four of five 60 years ago. Projections are that by 2010, only 28% of 
physicians nationwide will be generalists. Recent medical school surveys 
indicate that only 14% of students intend to enter general practice upon 
graduation, an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
 A key reason is economics: Doctors earn far more in specialized practices. 
According to Medical Economics Magazine, the net income of plastic surgeons in 
1991 was $209,840, compared tot he $101,160 of family practitioners and the 
$86,820 of general practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a supply of primary care physicians," said Rick Wade, a senior 
vice president with the American Hospital Assn. "Even if we turned our medical 
schools upside down for the next five years, there's only so many primary care 
physicians being trained." 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses are in many cases filling the void. At CIGNA HealthCare of California, 
40 nurse practitioners staff the HMOs 28 Los Angeles offices. Specializing in 
pediatrics, adult medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology, they share practices 
with CIGNA's 250 primary care physicians. At the HMO's Fox Hills office, four 
nurse practitioners provide care to up to 80 patients daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures provided by the American Nurses Assn., a federation of 205,000 nurses 
and the nation's largest nursing organization, illustrate how much nurses can 
do, and at what cost. According to the organization, between 60% and 80% of the 
primary care administered by doctorscan be delivered just as well by nurses 
with advanced training, at a cost of up to 40% less. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses also earn far less than physicians: about $42,000 annually compared to 
the average doctors' salary of $170,000. And while there are only 100,000 
advanced-practice nurses delivering primary care nationwide -- compared to 
approximately 200,000 general practicedoctors -- the ANA says 700,000 more 
nurses could provide such care with an additional one to two years of training. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need as much preparation as physicians have to provide primary 
care," Faherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such assertions, however, are hotly disputed by doctors and the largest 
organization of physicians, the 300,000-member American Medical Assn. They 
concede there is a shortage of doctors providing primary care. But they argue 
that if health care reforms prompt a surge in demand for primary care, 
specialists will be retrained to help meet it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they question whether advanced-practice nurses can dispense primary 
care as well as doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primary care is not just checking someone's eyes, ears, nose and throat and 
giving them a shot," said Dr. James Seidel, chief of general and emergency 
pediatrics at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance. "It's a lot of 
anticipatory guidance and education." 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses, however, insist that their goal is not to operate independently of 
physicians, but rather to obtain a greater amount of freedom while working with 
them. Already, in many cases, nurses order tests and perform routine checkups 
on patients who then see their doctors only perfunctorily. 
</P>
<P>
 And while nurses still are not wholly guaranteed the ability to seek 
reimbursement from insurers, state law allows nurse practitioners and certified 
nurse midwives to prescribe drugs under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's nurse practitioner program is being launched as the highly regarded 
School of Nursing faces major downsizing in a university-wide cost-cutting 
effort. The cuts might affect UCLA's standard two-year nurse practitioner 
program, university officials say, but not the new curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the one-year program has been strong. When they asked nursing 
students whether they would be interested in the curriculum, UCLA officials 
received 120 affirmative responses -- three times the number of available 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The curriculum, although uniquely designed for advanced-degree nurses-will 
nevertheless offer a typical nurse practitioner's training. In the program, 40 
students will learn to identify and manage acute and chronic conditions such as 
cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory and cardiac problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is that eventually they can aid doctors in the direct management of 
patient care. "Its not that we're substituting for each other," Faherty said. 
"We both have very specific abilities and we're complementing each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses also contend that they can provide primary care in areas where 
physicians are reluctant to go. Rural dwellers are used to having 
advanced-practice nurses substitute for doctors, but inner-city clinics as well 
are increasingly being staffed by nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 In downtown Los Angeles, UCLA's School of Nursing operates two clinics for the 
uninsured, undocumented and homeless. On average the two clinics see 75 
patients daily. At one clinic in the garment district, the nurses see mostly 
women and children and provide a large amount of preventive, prenatal and 
family care. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other clinic, on Skid Row, most of the patients are men needing 
treatment for episodic disease or illness. "Nurses are very interested in 
providing care to underserved populations," said Colleen Keenan, assistant 
professor of nursing at UCLA. "There aren't any physicians working in those 
clinics." 
</P>
<P>
 And nurses see a continuing role for themselves in promoting wellness care and 
health education. Given the prominence recently of health-care cost 
containment, attention is focusing on preventing illness, which is far cheaper 
than treating it. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, small investments in preventive care can reap big benefits. 
According to ANA Studies, of the $600 million spent on U.S. health care in 
1990, less than $18 million was devoted to preventive care. Yet, the same study 
concluded that every dollar spent on preventive care and education saves four 
dollars in eventual health care expenditures. "You get bigger bang for your 
buck with preventive care," Faherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such benefits, experts say, will be impossible without nurses actively 
involved in the delivery of primary care. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's obviously a need for someone to provide these services," said the 
AHA's Rick Wade, who says polls indicate that 60% of Americans would see nurses 
for their primary care. "There's going to be a whole new look at what nurses 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan agrees. "A hundred years ago, blood pressure was not taken by nurses 
because that was practicing medicine," she said. "Nurses are never going to do 
neurosurgery, but nurses in collaboration with physicians do lots of medical 
procedures (now) because we can." Disappearing Doctors 
</P>

scarce. Increasingly, health-care providers are looking to specially trained 
nurses to fill the void. Share of U.S. physicians in general practice:
