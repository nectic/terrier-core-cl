DODGERS' WALLACH MAKES IT QUICK AND PAINLESS, 7-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Walker lost count, Pedro Martinez lost a game, Tim Wallach lost two 
balls deep into the left field stands and the Dodgers avoided a lost weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a night of relief for the Dodgers, both comic and otherwise, Wallach's two 
two-run homers against his former Montreal Expo teammates and Pedro Astacio's 
complete-game performance led the Dodgers to a quick-and-easy 7-1 victory 
before 38,817 at Dodger Stadium on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, the 2-hour 23-minute victory was especially sweet coming on 
the heels of Saturday's four-hour-plus, come-from-ahead extra-inning defeat in 
which they not only blew two leads but lost second baseman Delino DeShields in 
a scary collision with Raul Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sensed we really needed a win," Wallach said. "That's about as solid a game 
as we've played all year." 
</P>
<P>
 It came at the expense of Martinez (0-2), the popular younger brother of Ramon 
Martinez who was traded from the Dodgers to the Expos last winter in exchange 
for DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who came within three outs of a no-hitter April 13 against the Reds, 
was tagged hard and early by the Dodgers, giving up a double to leadoff batter 
Brett Butler in the first, followed one out later by Piazza's home run to 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they know how I pitch," said Martinez, who struck out nine in his 6 
2/3 innings but gave up six runs. "I know them, too, but they got me this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitches I was throwing with runners on base, they were hitting. Maybe 
next time I'll get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, who also struck out twice against Martinez, said his home run against 
Martinez in the third inning was a matter of connecting with one of the few 
hittable pitches Martinez threw him. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Martinez) was throwing good," Wallach said. "I think you'd better be ready 
when he's out there. He throws hard, he's got good off-speed pitches. If you're 
not ready, he'll do what he did to me the other two times. He abused me those 
two at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach's second home run, his sixth of the season, came on the first pitch 
from reliever Jeff Shaw in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, who has batted .225 or worse in each of his last three seasons, has 
six home runs and 19 runs batted in in the last 15 games, and including the 
home run he hit against Montreal on Saturday, had three home runs in two days 
against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't question why people would question me," Wallach said. "Because I 
haven't done the job I think I can do. I have something to prove, yeah. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no question the last two weeks probably have been as well as I've 
swung the bat in three years. I haven't had a run like this in quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite Wallach's two home runs, the most memorable moment of the game was 
Walker's trip down the right field line in the third inning, when he lost track 
of the outs. 
</P>
<P>
 After catching a Piazza flyball, Walker, thinking it was the third out -- it 
was the second -- handed the ball to a boy in the stands, allowing Jose 
Offerman to move from first to third, from which he scored on Wallach's first 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Walker was joking about the incident and most of the Dodger players 
were simply happy it did not happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came up to bat afterward and said, 'That has to be the most embarrassing 
thing I've ever done,' " Piazza said. "I said, 'I'm not saying anything. ' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the guy who forgot to call time out and allowed a guy to steal home on 
me. And it's funny, the same umpire (Steve Rippley) was behind the plate 
tonight who was at third when I did that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it's hard to count to three sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio (1-2), who entered the game with a 9.18 earned-run average, made 
proper use of the big hits and the big breaks he got, cruising to his first 
complete game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw a total of 108 pitches -- 67 for strikes -- and neither walked nor 
struck out anyone. The Expos got seven hits against him, but none for extra 
bases and scored their run on a fielder's choice after two singles in the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good to see Astacio pitch well," Pedro Martinez said. "You know, I had 
fun hitting against him."

NFL DRAFT; SURPRISES START AT 5TH PICK; NFL DRAFT: FORM FOLLOWS UNTIL COLTS 
BYPASS DILFER FOR ALBERTS, A DEFENSIVE PLAYER FROM NEBRASKA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Ohio State defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson very much the widely ballyhooed 
"Big Daddy" of the first round, the opening four picks of the NFL's 59th draft 
went precisely the way most insiders and outsiders had predicted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It only took 30 seconds of the allotted 15 minutes for the Cincinnati Bengals 
to make the 6-foot-3, 315-pound Wilkinson their first choice, even if 
negotiations to sign him between Bengals owner Mike Brown and agent Leigh 
Steinberg have not gone especially well over the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a player is drafted No. 1, he should be compensated as No. 1," Wilkinson 
said in a conference call from Newport Beach, near Steinberg's office. "There 
shouldn't be any kind of prejudice just because I'm a defensive lineman and the 
pretty boys are drafted later." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson's selection was followed by the pick of two widely regarded pretty 
boys -- San Diego State running back Marshall Faulk by the Indianapolis Colts 
and Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler by the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler's selection over Fresno State quarterback Trent Dilfer was followed by 
the Patriots choosing USC linebacker Willie McGinest. At that point, the 
first-round trend definitely turned, with nine of the next 10 selections 
defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 But after McGinest, it began to get very interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the past few weeks, the Rams had indicated that if Dilfer, a 
strong-armed pocket passer, was available, they'd take him. That's known as 
blowing smoke, because the Rams -- apparently satisfied that recently-acquired 
quarterback Chris Miller's knee is sound -- traded their fifth pick to the 
Colts for Indianapolis' No. 7 pick in the round and the Colts' third-round 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts also had talked seriously about Dilfer, rated by most scouts along 
with Shuler as the No. 1 or 1A quarterback in the draft. Indianapolis also was 
thought to be in dire need at the position, what with journeyman Jim Harbaugh 
their main man -- acquired through free agency -- after trading Jeff George to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 But heavens to Mel Kiper Jr., the Colts instead went for defense with the 
choice, taking Nebraska's 245-pound Trev Alberts, projected either as a 
defensive end or linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 News of that move was treated with some derision among the 400 draft fans 
packed into the New York Marriott Marquis ballroom, and also set up an ugly 
nationally televised exchange between Kiper, ESPN's so-called draft expert, and 
Colt General Manager Bill Tobin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who in the hell is Mel Kiper anyway?" Tobin asked ESPN viewers. "In my 
knowledge of him, he's never put on a jockstrap in his life. All of a sudden 
he's an expert. We don't have to take anyone Mel Kiper says we have to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at draft headquarters here, Kiper fired right back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a right to my opinion, and he has a right to his," Kiper said on the 
air. "To me (taking Alberts over Dilfer), it's a mistake. When you have Jim 
Harbaugh as your quarterback, you take Trent Dilfer. That's why the Colts are 
the laughingstock of the league year in and year out." 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer, for one, insisted he was delighted with the outcome, resulting in his 
selection with the sixth pick by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He had played golf a 
month ago with Tampa Bay Coach Sam Wyche. He said his wife -- a triathlete -- 
would love moving to Florida to train and "work on her tan. And he said the 
Bucs' dismal history of losing many, many games made no difference to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because they haven't won in the past doesn't mean they can't win in the 
future," Dilfer told reporters here. "And drafting Trent Dilfer, they've taken 
a big step in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer also said that neither he nor Shuler, who he described as a good 
friend, had any idea who the Redskins were going to take up until the moment 
the call was placed from Redskin Park to draft headquarters halfway through the 
team's 15-minute time limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough up until No. 3," Dilfer said. "I knew I would be close behind. I 
have great peace of mind wherever God chooses me to go. I'm fired up. . . . I 
thought the Colts were interested, up until today. . . . A lot of teams told me 
they wanted me." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he still thought he was the best quarterback in the draft, Dilfer 
said, "There was no doubt about it in my mind. I believed that from Day One. I 
truly thought I was the best. . . . Tampa Bay is very fortunate to get me, and 
I'm fortunate to be in Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Heath was a great pick for the Redskins, but I can't worry about 
being No. 3 or about being No. 6. . . . We're friends. We've been together five 
times, and we just hit it off. We put our egos aside. He and his girlfriend and 
me and my wife are going on vacation together in a month. . . . I hope Heath 
wins all his games, except when they play Tampa Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony late in the first round, a coin was flipped to determine the 
first pick in the 1995 draft between expansion franchises in Charlotte where 
the Carolina Panthers will play and the Jacksonville Jaguars. . . . Charlotte 
got the call.

ANGELS THE WORST IN FIRST AFTER LATEST FENWAY FLOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You invite Bill Murray if you want to make your party a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 You call Barbra Streisand if you want someone to entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 You summon George Will if you desire a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you want victories at Fenway Park, you schedule a weekend engagement 
against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Red Sox, leaving the Angels battered, bruised and bewildered, 
defeated them once again Sunday, 5-4, completing a three-game sweep before 
32,521. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who became the worst first-place team in baseball history with 
their ninth consecutive defeat at Fenway, fled town before anything else could 
go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In a weekend that might haunt them the entire season, the Angels lost three 
games, two relievers, a starting catcher and a bullpen catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 If they never believed in the evil spirits of Fenway before they arrived, 
they're convinced now, and already are making plans to call the Psychic Hotline 
before their next visit in July. 
</P>
<P>
 How else do you explain reliever Ken Patterson arriving from triple-A 
Vancouver to replace Mike Butcher, and six pitches into his season debut, 
hearing a loud pop and feeling an immediate burning sensation in his left 
elbow? Patterson, who never had an elbow problem, is scheduled to undergo 
diagnostic testing today in Inglewood. But Red Sox physician Arthur Pappas, who 
examined Patterson, thinks the reliever likely suffered a torn ligament in his 
elbow that could sideline him for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who watched Butcher leave town just a few hours earlier, will wait 
until they return home Wednesday before summoning another pitcher. They would 
like to bring up veteran John Farrell, but considering that he is not on their 
40-man roster, they want to evaluate their options. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been something eerie about this place," Patterson said. 
"Crazy, weird stuff always happens here. I mean, today, I throw a good 
forkball, and it was like somebody shot me with a gun right in my elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things happen here that don't make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty scary thing." 
</P>
<P>
 How else do you explain catcher Greg Myers' injury Saturday when he suffered 
torn cartilage of his left knee, a mishap that will keep him out four to six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers' departure leaves the Angels with two catchers owning a total of 38 
games major league experience. Chris Turner, who's batting .103 this season, 
has caught 37 games. And Jorge Fabregas has caught one inning, making his major 
league debut Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said Turner and Fabregas will be kept on the 
big league roster but he will attempt to acquire a veteran catcher. The team is 
pursuing Bob Melvin, 32, who was released during spring training by the Boston 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 How else do you explain bullpen catcher Mick Billmeyer's broken left arm while 
warming up John Dopson on Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
 How else do you explain the Angels losing Friday night on a steal of home, 
losing Saturday when Red Sox outfielder Mike Greenwell's fly ball hit the 
bullpen fence and bounced over for a homer, and losing Sunday when Red Sox 
third baseman Scott Cooper hit two homers in a game for the first time? 
</P>
<P>
 And, in perhaps the most bizarre development of all, how in the world do you 
explain the Angels sitting in first place in the American League West with an 
8-11 record? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first time in baseball history a team has been three games under .500 
and in first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad news is that we got swept," Rodgers said, "but the good news is that 
everybody else in this division is (awful)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, losing their seventh one-run game of the season, can at least take 
pride in becoming the first team to score more than three runs off Red Sox 
pitcher Aaron Sele, who was making his 22nd start. The Angels overcame their 
3-0 deficit by scoring four runs in the third inning, but then watched Cooper 
do his impersonation of the Babe. Cooper, who already has five homers this 
season -- four shy of his high -- hit a home run in the fourth inning to right 
field, and a homer in the sixth inning to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first one, I really came in on, but he got it in the wind," said Angel 
starter Phil Leftwich (0-3, 7.15 ERA). "The second one, (pitching coach) Chuck 
(Hernandez) said, 'Look, the wind's really blowing to right, so pitch him away. 
I pitch him away, he hits the ball, and the wind starts blowing to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who grew up nearby: "Hey, man, it's 
Fenway Park. A lot of weird things always happen here. Why should anything 
change now?"

NBA ROUNDUP; DALLAS HAS MINNESOTA'S NUMBER FOR FIFTH TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves hit their magic numbers Sunday 
night -- 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Already having locked up lottery spots, Dallas and Minnesota played out their 
seasons against each other at Dallas, with the Mavericks winning, 116-102, 
behind a season-high 22 points from Tony Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Mavericks (13-69) wouldn't have been the worst team in the league -- 
again -- had they played the Timberwolves more often. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of Dallas' 13 victories came against Minnesota (20-62), which tied for 
the league's second-worst record and ended the year with 10 consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks actually went out on several positive notes. It was their second 
straight victory, fourth in their last seven and enabled them to avoid setting 
two more NBA futility marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas missed becoming the first team to lose 70 games in consecutive seasons, 
and its sixth home victory kept it from the worst-ever home winning percentage. 
The Mavericks finished at 14.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 115, Houston 107 -- Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf's second free throw of the game 
fell short, and so did his bid to break Calvin Murphy's NBA single-season free 
throw percentage record at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Rauf missed his second free throw with 6:50 left in the third quarter to 
finish 219 for 229 for the season, or 95.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who set the record in 1980-81 while playing for the Rockets, missed 
nine free throws in 215 attempts, an NBA record 95.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon had 34 points, 13 rebounds and 11 blocked shots for the 
Rockets, who completed their best regular-season record ever (58-24) despite 
finishing with losses to Dallas and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 120, New Jersey 91 -- Shaquille O'Neal's 32 points weren't enough to 
overcome David Robinson for the NBA scoring title as the Magic won at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who ended the season with a 29.35 average to Robinson's 29.79, could 
only shake his head when teammates told him late in the first half that 
Robinson scored 71 points in the Spurs' 112-97 victory over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's point total meant O'Neal would have had to score 68 to overtake 
him. When O'Neal got the news, he had only 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 110, Portland 108 -- Gary Payton and Vincent Askew led a second-half 
rally that brought the SuperSonics back from a 17-point deficit at Portland as 
they ended their most successful regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Askew made four free throws in the final 16 seconds to clinch the Sonics' 63rd 
victory of the season, the most in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 117, Boston 91 -- The Cavaliers set up another playoff series with 
longtime nemesis Chicago as John Williams scored 22 points at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland (47-35) is the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and will open 
the first round Friday at Chicago against the third-seeded Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics (32-50) finished their worst season since they were 29-53 in 
1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 92, Chicago 76 -- Patrick Ewing scored 25 points and the Knicks used 
their rugged defense in the regular-season finale at historic Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks' victory was only their third in the last 28 games in Chicago, 
including the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 105, Golden State 97 -- Spud Webb scored 25 points, including a key 
layup with 31 seconds left, to help the Kings end their ninth consecutive 
losing season with a victory at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, coupled with the Clippers' loss to San Antonio, gave Sacramento 
the league's eighth-worst record for the upcoming NBA lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 110, Detroit 102 -- Orlando Woolridge had 24 points and 10 
rebounds and Johnny Dawkins scored 14 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter at 
Philadelphia to help hand the Pistons their 13th consective defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory snapped a five-game losing streak and gave the 76ers a 25-57 
record. The Pistons finished at 20-62, the most games they have lost since they 
were defeated 66 times in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 117, Charlotte 99 -- Tom Gugliotta scored 31 points and 7-foot-7 
rookie Gheorghe Muresan had a career-high 21 at Washington to help the Bullets 
close out a dismal 24-58 season.

MORNING BRIEFING: CHARLES APPEARS TO BE ALL BARK WHEN IT COMES TO GOLF GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns told Golf Digest that he has a 14 
handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my size," he said, "I have trouble with longer clubs. But my short 
game is fine. I have a lot of confidence in my hands. I have a good touch, and 
that's what you need for short shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Mickelson, a fellow Arizonan who has played with Sir Charles and is one 
of the magazine's playing editors, rolled his eyes when told of Barkley's 
self-assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he does try hard," Mickelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which country won the first World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 Age-old problem: Said Dick Pole, pitching coach of the San Francisco Giants, 
after suggesting that Giant pitcher Salomon Torres, 22, needed to work on his 
concentration: "It's the same old story with him. It's youth, but that youth 
thing gets old after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Double duty: After Swiss soccer Coach Roy Hodgson relaxed his controversial 
ban on sex for his players during the World Cup tournament, saying that wives 
would be allowed into the players' hotel rooms after games against the United 
States and Colombia, the story ran in the Swiss tabloid Blick under the 
headline: "Roy's Boys Can Do It Twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Why should they be?Said tennis player Jeff Tarango, who is ranked No. 100: "I 
can't imagine a guy out there who doesn't think he can beat me. I don't think 
anyone is intimidated by me." 
</P>
<P>
 No argument here: When referee Victor Drakulich separated junior middleweights 
Julio Ceasar Green and Lonny Beasley during the 12th round of a closely 
contested fight last week in Las Vegas, he apparently pushed Beasley a little 
too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Beasley fell flat on his back, didn't get up, and was counted out by 
Drakulich, who was chased out of the ring by one of Beasley's angry cornermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Drakulich: "If they're not able to remain standing when you break them 
up, they shouldn't be allowed to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Build a bunker, Don: Wrote Dave Kaplan of the New York Daily News, noting that 
Steve Carlton (329-244, 3.22 earned-run average) is headed for the Hall of Fame 
and Don Sutton (324-256, 3.26 ERA) is not: "Alas, Sutton was hardly the world 
thinker Carlton is." 
</P>
<P>
 Hold your tongue: Wrote Bob Kravitz of the Rocky Mountain News: "It's fine if 
Madonna wants to buy an NBA team, but I would hope she'd watch her language 
around the locker room." 
</P>
<P>
 Too big a stretch: English golfer Peter Baker said of a stretching program he 
recently started: "I don't enjoy it. Give me a paper and a bag of crisps 
(potato chips) and I'll happily sit in front of the TV. Lying on the floor 
rolling around in funny positions doesn't appeal to me, especially on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Uruguay, in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Pitcher Charlie Hough of the Florida Marlins, after getting three 
hits in his first two starts: "It's not my fault. The balls hit my bat." JERRY

LAKER MISERY ENDS, THE OVERHAUL BEGINS; PRO BASKETBALL: GM JERRY WEST PROMISES 
BIG CHANGES AFTER 103-97 LAST-GAME LOSS TO JAZZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, that's about enough fun for one season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday afternoon, when the 1993-94 season mercifully ended for the Lakers, 
they did the proper thing, vowing to clean up the mess they had made over the 
previous months. Players got started by removing belongings from the locker 
room after the season-ending 103-97 loss to the Utah Jazz at the Forum and then 
removing themselves to await a very uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker management gets its turn now, and the fallout from a 33-49 season, 
capped by the first 10-game losing streak in franchise history, figures to be 
of air-raid proportions. The team will bring in a new coach, preferably, 
General Manager Jerry West said, one with previous NBA experience. A mostly new 
roster is also desired. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a lot of these players," West said, "I don't think I'd buy a home." 
</P>
<P>
 So noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely not a comfort zone in here," guard Doug Christie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the ominous overtones as the Lakers begin the off-season, West 
signaling an aggressive approach to player changes and owner Jerry Buss more 
suited than ever to help because his Ph.D. from USC is in chemistry. That is 
the biggest problem, after all. Bad chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very bad," said Magic Johnson, now the former coach. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of ways to go. The Lakers will draft 10th unless they beat 
big odds and move up to first, second or third via the lottery. They will have 
available salary slots to sign free agents, even if the $1.75 million from Dan 
Schayes and the $1.4 million from James Edwards don't reel in the top-liners 
like Danny Manning and Horace Grant. They will have players to trade, looking 
to break a glut at shooting guard and small forward.  
</P>
<P>
 The last significant business Sunday was whether Nick Van Exel would break the 
record he has chased for weeks, the rookie mark of 125 three-pointers set by 
Orlando's Dennis Scott in 1990-91. Van Exel got a record, but not the one he 
wanted -- his 16 three-point attempts were the most by a Laker and tied the 
third-most in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel made three of those to fall two short of Scott. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade Divac had hoped he would return after sitting out the previous two games 
because of a sprained ankle, but did not play. He finished as the Lakers' top 
scorer at 14.2 points, the lowest for a team-leader in the Los Angeles era, but 
became the first Laker to lead in scoring and rebounding since Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar in 1984-85. . . . Magic Johnson stuck by his plan to start James 
Worthy, Kurt Rambis and James Edwards. Worthy got a partial standing ovation as 
fans acknowledged what might have been the last game of his career, then said 
later he has not made any decisions on the future. Said Johnson: "I don't know 
if he will be willing or able to sit on the bench, because that's how it will 
be. . . . If I were to tell him anything, I would tell him to retire and go out 
the right way." Worthy has two years left on his contract, including a 
$7.2-million balloon payment next season, and is not likely to walk away from 
that. A buyout remains a possibility. "I'm sure we'll have some talks with 
him," General Manager Jerry West said. . . . Johnson finished 5-11 as coach. 
What effect did he have at the turnstiles? The Lakers were averaging 12,815 at 
the Forum when he arrived, No. 25 in the league and better than only Dallas and 
the Clippers. In the 10 home outings since, they averaged 14,865 and had only 
one game of fewer than 13,000. Attendance Sunday was 15,338.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; FOR THIS BREWER, HAVING A COUPLE OF EXTRA PITCHES 
MAKES A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With some new pitches, Ricky Bones has found himself in a new position -- No. 
1 on the American League's earned-run average list. 
</P>
<P>
 Bones pitched his first shutout, yielding six hits and leading the Milwaukee 
Brewers over the Kansas City Royals, 7-0, on Sunday at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bones (3-1), making his 74th start in the majors, ended the game by getting 
Dave Henderson to ground into a double play with the bases loaded. He lowered 
his ERA to 0.80. 
</P>
<P>
 "In '92 and '93, he didn't have but one pitch -- his fastball -- that he could 
throw when he got down early in the count," Brewer Manager Phil Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is now throwing a slider, breaking ball, two kinds of fastballs and a 
changeup. And he's very comfortable with throwing any one of those in any 
situation." Bones struck out three and walked one in his second complete game 
of the season and fifth of his career. He did not allow a runner past second 
base until the ninth inning. Opponents are hitting .194 against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's building my confidence is that I'm able to use more and more pitches," 
Bones said. "It's a great feeling for my personal goals, for the team goals, 
keeping that momentum alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Bones never faced more than four batters an inning until the ninth, when he 
faced five. He got 12 outs on ground balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee won its fourth in a row. The Brewers have won six in a row against 
Kansas City, and completed their first sweep against the Royals since April 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers took a 4-0 lead in the first inning, taking advantage of an error 
by first baseman Wally Joyner and four consecutive hits off Mark Gubicza. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out, Joyner mishandled a grounder by Turner Ward. Brian Harper 
followed with a single. Dave Nilsson singled home Ward, Kevin Seitzer hit a 
run-scoring double and Jody Reed hit a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Oakland 2 -- Jim Abbott had a no-hitter for 7 1/3 innings at 
Yankee Stadium and Don Mattingly hit his second homer in two days as the 
Yankees extended their winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott (2-2), who pitched his first no-hitter last Sept. 4 at home against 
Cleveland, stopped the A's until Geronimo Berroa blooped an opposite-field 
single to right. Abbott yielded one run and three hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly, homerless in the Yankees' first 15 games, hit a three-run shot off 
Bob Welch during a four-run third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 A's Manager Tony La Russa said Abbott made his team look punchless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He changed speeds well, he had a little bit of a break," he said. "He was a 
very tough pitcher, he picked the plate apart." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the sixth in a row for Oakland.  
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 7, Toronto 3 -- Kevin Tapani kept the Twins in the game at Toronto, 
giving up three runs in seven-plus innings, to help them end a three-game 
losing streak. The loss also ended the Blue Jays' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapani became the club's first starter to reach the eighth inning this season. 
The game also marked the first time this season that the Twins have held the 
opposition to fewer than four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Cole gave Tapani a run to work with when he led off the game with his 
first home run. Cole, who had never homered in 1,317 at-bats, hit Juan Guzman's 
2-1 pitch 390 feet over the fence in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's Joe Carter increased his team RBI record for April to 28, driving in 
a run with a groundout in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 7, Baltimore 6 -- Ken Griffey hit a long three-run homer in the eighth 
inning to help the Mariners break a four-game losing streak and improve to 2-9 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle, which was 0-9 when trailing after seven innings, loaded the bases 
against Jamie Moyer. Brad Pennington came in and threw a wild pitch, allowing a 
run to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey hit Pennington's next pitch over the 25-foot wall in right, his fifth 
of the season. The drive was measured at 438 feet and landed 25 feet short of 
the warehouse that stands beyond the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the closest anyone has come to hitting the warehouse in a game, 
although Griffey did it last summer during the home-run hitting contest a day 
before the All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle committed three errors, leading to three unearned runs. The Mariners 
have committed 22 errors in their first 17 games and have given up a major 
league high 23 unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 7, Chicago 6 -- The White Sox were trying for their first three-game 
series sweep against the Tigers at Cominsky Park since July 2-4, 1984, but 
Cecil Fielder, who hit a three-run homer in the fourth inning, singled home the 
go-ahead run with two out in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Phillips led off with a walk and Lou Whitaker sacrificed. Reliever Dennis 
Cook struck out Kirk Gibson, but Fielder, who was called out on strikes in his 
previous at-bat in the seventh with the bases loaded, singled off Roberto 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to stay on top of the ball," Fielder said. "A lot of times when 
you get a full count (in the ninth), the pitcher's got to make his pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 "A single -- that's his best hitting," Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson said. "He 
gave us a good at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 12, Texas 7 -- Albert Belle and Manny Ramirez each drove in three 
runs to lead the Indians at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, who has driven in nine runs in the last seven games, hit a two-run 
homer in the third inning to give Cleveland a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez hit a two-run single in the first and singled in a run during a 
four-run fourth that made the score 10-2.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GWYNN GETS A LITTLE MESSAGE, THEN TIES TWO PADRE 
RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before tying a Padre record with his eighth consecutive hit, Tony Gwynn got 
hit with the first pitch of the game Sunday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks he knows why. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all stemmed from last night. When I was on second base in the fourth 
inning, Ben Rivera thought I was giving signs to the hitter," Gwynn said after 
San Diego took a six-run lead and held on to beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 
6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn, who had five hits in five at-bats Saturday, said he tried to convince 
Rivera and catcher Darren Daulton he wasn't stealing signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even read their signs," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curt Schilling (0-3) said he wasn't trying to hit Gwynn. The ball struck Gwynn 
just below the right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's got eight straight hits," Schilling said. "You've got to pitch 
inside. Obviously, he was feeling pretty comfortable up there because he 
couldn't get out of the way. I've got all the respect in the world for Tony 
Gwynn. He's a .330 hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn and Schilling exchanged words and Schilling received a warning from 
plate umpire Bob Davidson, but no punches were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I don't know is if Schilling hit me on purpose or if he was 
ordered to hit me," Gwynn said. "I'm not going to charge the mound and get 
suspended four games and fined $5,000 for getting hit by a pitch. But at the 
same time, there's nothing that's going to stop me from trying to go up the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn singled in the third and fourth before hitting into a double play in the 
sixth and singling in the eighth. The eight straight hits tied the record set 
by Dave Winfield in 1979. Gwynn also tied a team record -- held by himself and 
Bip Roberts -- by reaching base nine consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Benes, meanwhile stopped his nine-game losing streak as San Diego 
completed a three-game sweep. Benes (1-4) won for the first time since last 
Sept. 1 against Florida, yielding five runs -- four earned -- and six hits in 7 
1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 12, Colorado 4 -- Rookie right-hander Steve Trachsel, the Cubs' 
first-round draft choice in 1991 from Long Beach St., pitched his first major 
league complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel (2-1), making his seventh career start, yielded seven hits, struck 
out four and walked four before 71,329, the seventh-largest crowd in the 
Rockies' history. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's first five batters got hits, starting with Karl Rhodes' 416-foot 
homer into the right field bleachers. The Cubs, who finished with a season-high 
16 hits, scored four runs in the first, getting a run-scoring single from 
Derrick May, an run-scoring double from Sammy Sosa and a run-scoring groundout 
from Shawon Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 3, Pittsburgh 0 -- Greg Maddux ended the Braves' longest losing streak 
in a year at four games, pitching a three-hitter and striking out a career-high 
11 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (4-1) gave up three singles in lowering his earned-run average to 0.88. 
He retired 16 of the last 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-hander, who has won the National League Cy Young Award two 
consecutive years, walked none in his second complete game this season and 
first shutout since last Aug. 15. It was his 51st complete game and 15th 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta hadn't had a longer losing streak since losing five in a row last 
April 25-29. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 4, New York 2 -- Matt Williams hit a two-run homer, tying Jeff 
Kent of the Mets for the league lead, to help the Giants win at Candlestick 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' eighth homer helped send Bret Saberhagen (2-1) to his first loss 
since June 25, 1993. Saberhagen, injured at the end of last season, had won six 
consecutive decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Giants trailing, 2-0, Darren Lewis led off the sixth with a bunt 
single, stole second and scored on Todd Benzinger's single. Williams homered on 
the next pitch for a 3-2 lead, giving him five homers in nine games and a 
team-leading 17 RBIs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 John Burkett (2-1) gave up six hits in seven innings, struck out six and 
walked one. Dave Burba pitched a perfect eighth and Mike Jackson pitched a 
perfect ninth for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm progressing to the point where I feel like I did last year," said 
Burkett, who was 22-7 last year. "Saberhagen was pitching well, so I just 
wanted to keep us close." 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, Florida 2 -- Reggie Sanders tripled in the first inning, doubled 
in the fourth inning, then drove a three-run homer into the second deck in the 
fifth inning at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' homer, his fourth, came after pitcher Tom Browning singled and Hal 
Morris walked in the fifth. Cincinnati added a run in the eighth when Kevin 
Mitchell doubled and scored on Brett Boone's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning (2-0) pitched a three-hitter for his second consecutive complete 
game, struck out five and walked none as the Reds won for the eighth time in 10 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to last Sunday's two-hit shutout against Philadelphia, Browning hadn't 
thrown a complete game since July 24, 1991, at Chicago. Against Florida, he 
retired the side in order six times. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 5, Houston 4 -- Bernard Gilkey scored on a wild pitch by Mike 
Hampton to cap a three-run eighth inning at St. Louis as the Cardinals rallied 
past the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis trailed, 4-2, in the eighth when Ray Lankford led off with a double 
against Shane Reynolds. Gregg Jefferies singled to drive in Lankford, then took 
third on Todd Zeile's single against Tom Edens (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies scored on Gilkey's groundout. Brian Jordan's double sent Gilkey to 
third, and Gilkey scored on the wild pitch by Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
 Astro starter Greg Swindell yielded two runs and four hits in seven innings. 
His 17-inning scoreless streak ended in the first on Jefferies' sacrifice fly.

OJAI TENNIS; USC'S BLACK, STANFORD'S UNHERALDED DE SILVA WIN TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They don't look like heavyweights, but in the world of college tennis, they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wayne Black of USC proved he was the tougher competitor Sunday, winning 
the Pacific 10 Conference men's singles championship in the Ojai Valley 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, ranked second nationally, defeated fourth-ranked Sargis Sargsian of 
Arizona State, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, to become the first Trojan Pac-10 singles 
champion since Robert Van't Hof in 1980. Black, a 5-foot-7 junior, skipped 
USC's 1992 fall season while he represented his native Zimbabwe in Davis Cup 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sargsian, a 5-11 junior transfer from Yerevan, Armenia, advanced to the 
singles final of the National Intercollegiate Clay Court event in his first 
collegiate tournament last October. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, Sargsian scored his only victory over Black in five meetings. But 
all of their matches have been close, including Sunday's.  
</P>
<P>
 Sargsian looked strong in winning the first set before Black decided to mix up 
his game by moving to the net, and took the second. Black then took control of 
the third set and held off his opponent to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the men's, the Pac-10 women's singles final was a battle of low-ranked 
players. And Sandra De Silva of Stanford, ranked 75th, broke tradition when she 
upset No. 32 Pam Nelson of California, 2-6, 6-0, 6-4, in the final.  
</P>
<P>
 All at once, De Silva earned a scholarship, a probable invitation to the NCAA 
singles tournament at Athens, Ga., next month, and a promotion. De Silva, a 
freshman, has played No. 6 singles for Stanford, going 21-0 in dual matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shows you what a lousy coach I am: I've got the Pac-10 champion at No. 
6," Stanford's Frank Brennan said. "I don't think I'm going to keep her at six 
after this." 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan has had the luxury of playing De Silva at No. 6 because of the 
strength of his lineup, which includes top-ranked senior Laxmi Poruri, who was 
upset by Nelson in Saturday's semifinals, 6-1, 6-3.  
</P>
<P>
 De Silva was not even entered in the conference singles draw until Wednesday, 
when an Arizona State player withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, De Silva is not unknown in tennis circles. In 1992, De Silva, from San 
Marino and who played for Pasadena Poly High, was top-ranked in Southern 
California and ninth-ranked in the nation in girls' 18-and-under. She postponed 
college for a year to play professionally in 1993.

GOLF ROUNDUP; SPRINGER WINS GREENSBORO BY THREE SHOTS DESPITE A 72 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Springer led the Greater Greensboro (N.C.) Open from start to finish, but 
he didn't make it easy on himself during Sunday's final round. 
</P>
<P>
 He closed with a par 72 for a total of 13-under 275 and his first tour 
victory. He finished three shots ahead of Ed Humenik, Brad Bryant and Hale 
Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer became the first to lead all the way since Tom Weiskopf in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tough day today," Springer said. "I had some problems with the putter. I hit 
a lot of good putts. They just wouldn't go in the hole. They kept lipping out." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin was the biggest threat -- and the biggest disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin sealed his fate on 18. His second shot went over the green and rolled 
down the hill behind it. His chip shot tangled in the deep rough and his shot 
to save par was short. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made some mistakes early and I couldn't get out of my own way," said Irwin, 
who was looking for his second consecutive victory on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 At 17, Springer saw Irwin's bogey at 18 go up on the leader board. Springer 
was on the green, needing a short putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I could squeeze that thing in there and get a good shot in the 
fairway on 18, then it's my tournament," Springer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did both, padding his victory with a birdie at 18 and earning $270,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lohr was alone in fifth place at 279 after a 69. John Morse and Donnie 
Hammond were at 280. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocco Mediate, last year's champion, did not play in the tournament because of 
a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Gilbert closed with a three-under 67 and rallied from three shots behind 
to win the Reunion Pro-Am in Dallas by a stroke, his first victory in two years 
on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert finished at eight-under 202 on the wind-swept Oak Cliff Country Club 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert hit an eight-iron to within a foot of the cup at par-3 No. 17 to break 
a three-way tie with George Archer and Rocky Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in shock," Gilbert said after winning $75,000. "It was the best 
shot I ever made under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert rolled in his birdie putt about the same moment Thompson was taking a 
bogey at par-4 No. 16. There, he hit a tree and overshot the green before 
leaving a 10-foot putt on the lip of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Archer shared second at 203. Both had closing 68s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just (blew) it," Thompson said with a shrug. "Ain't no doubt about it."

SAILING; LAST BOAT FINISHES 27 HOURS AFTER CONNER'S STARS & STRIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steady winds produced one of the fastest of the 47 Newport-Ensenada 
International Yacht Races, with all official finishers crossing the line before 
midnight Saturday. A few other boats among the 401 starters dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 John Haupt III's 42-foot wooden-hulled At Ease finished at 11:42 p.m. 
Saturday, some 27 hours after Dennis Conner's 60-foot catamaran Stars & 
Stripes, which broke its own record in 8 hours 29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Campbell's Andrews 70 Victoria from Long Beach finished in 14 hours 12 
minutes but was well off the record of 12:13 by Dennis Choate's 68-foot Saga in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing at 5:55 p.m. Saturday was Out Patient, a Cal 29 skippered by Doug 
Milne, a paraplegic, with a crew of handicapped sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars & Stripes sailed the 125-mile course so fast that it crossed the line 
half an hour before the race committee boat arrived at Ensenada and had to 
clock itself in. Late Friday night a woman handed the boat's finish slip to a 
Newport Ocean Sailing Assn. official and said Conner had asked her to deliver 
it before he headed home by automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're accepting Dennis at his word," press chairman Fred Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the record, Stars & Stripes' handicap was so low that it placed only 
seventh in the Ocean Racing Catamaran Assn. class on corrected time. RICH

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; THIS TIME, RANGERS USE A FAST FINISH TO BEAT ISLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Rangers finished fast after a slow start and finished the New 
York Islanders for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Islanders came out strong, but we kept our composure," goaltender Mike 
Richter said after the Rangers beat the Islanders, 5-2, Sunday at Uniondale, 
N.Y. to complete a four-game sweep of their first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the series, the Rangers fell behind at the start of the 
game when the Islanders scored on their first two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rangers rallied with five consecutive goals, two by Mark Messier, to 
finish off the Islanders and advance to the second round of the Eastern 
Conference playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impressive," Richter said. "I went to the bench when we were down two 
early goals. And all the guys were talking about keeping our oomposure, wearing 
them down, taking control." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who won the first three games by scores of 6-0, 6-0 and 5-1, fell 
behind as the Islanders came out strong trying to avoid their first four-game 
sweep in playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, it was the highlight of the game for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 2, St. Louis 1 -- Mike Modano scored both goals at St. Louis, including 
the game-winner on a power play with 3:49 to play, as the Stars completed a 
four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Modano took a pass from Russ Courtnall and scored his fifth goal of the 
playoffs from the right circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal came with Steve Duchesne in the penalty box for hooking and right 
after St. Louis penalty-killer Rick Zombo broke his stick. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in four games that Dallas won late. The Stars scored 
twice in the final 3:49 to win Game 1, 5-3, and got an overtime power-play goal 
from Paul Cavallini to win Game 3, 5-4, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 3, Vancouver 2 -- The Flames won their second consecutive road game 
with another third-period rally that left the Canucks on the verge of 
elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-period goals by Wes Walz and Theo Fleury carried the Flames to a 3-1 
lead in the best-of-seven series that continues Tuesday in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Toronto 3 -- Jeremy Roenick scored one minute, 23 seconds into 
overtime at Chicago, enabling the Blackhawks to tie the Western Conference 
quarterfinal series at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Roenick made a 20-foot shot from the right faceoff circle past Felix Potvin. 
Gary Suter of Chicago scored his third goal of the game with 7:25 left in the 
third period tied the score at 3-3.

SOUTHERN RHYTHM WINS LEXINGTON; DERBY PREPS: HE DEFEATS SOUL OF THE MATTER BY 2 
1/2 LENGTHS AS GOMEZ SCORES A WEEKEND 3-YEAR-OLD STAKES DOUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Kentucky Derby gained two and possibly three starters Sunday when Southern 
Rhythm scored a 2 1/2-length victory over favored Soul Of The Matter in the 
$137,250 Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he finished third, 7 1/2 lengths behind Southern Rhythm, Ulises might 
also run in the Derby at Churchill Downs on May 7. Ulises, undefeated in four 
races in Panama, was running in the United States and beyond six furlongs for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Rhythm capped a lucrative weekend for Garrett Gomez, who rode the 
Lexington winner after winning the $500,000 Arkansas Derby aboard Concern, a 
20-1 shot, at Oaklawn Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez and his agent drove 12 hours to reach Keeneland. Gomez, who never has 
ridden in a Derby, isn't faced with a choice at Churchill Downs because Richard 
Small, Concern's trainer, said that his colt will skip the Derby to run in the 
Preakness on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, who had never ridden Concern, picked up the mount on the colt Saturday 
after Aaron Gryder was injured while jogging. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Anita Sunday, trainer Jack Van Berg said Blumin Affair, the 
second-place finisher in Arkansas, will run in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Yakteen, who is supervising Charlie Whittingham's operation at Santa Anita 
while the head trainer is back in Kentucky with Strodes Creek and Numerous, 
said Numerous is scheduled to run in the Derby Trial at Churchill Downs next 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Jones, who trains undefeated Lakeway, said Sunday that the 3-year-old 
filly probably will run in the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill on May 6 rather than 
battle males in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd hate to go to the Derby on someone else's bad luck, but that's what it 
would take," Jones said. "A few horses would have to get hurt for us to run in 
the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 The Derby favorite, Holy Bull, had his first workout Sunday since winning the 
Blue Grass Stakes and went five furlongs in 1:02 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulises led the 1 1/16-mile Lexington for three-quarters of a mile before 
Southern Rhythm, a son of Dixieland Band, made his winning move on the far 
turn. Coming out of the turn, Southern Rhythm took the lead while bumping Soul 
Of The Matter and won in 1:39 2/5, paying $9.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter made his first start since winning the San Felipe Stakes on 
March 20. A skin infection forced trainer Richard Mandella to scratch him from 
the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He swallowed a lot of dirt today," Mandella said after the Lexington. "He got 
tired, but this is a tiring track."

U.S. IS IN DEEP FREEZE AFTER LOSING TO ICELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gang that can't shoot straight was off target again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio Reyna fired a shot from point-blank range high over the crossbar. Jeff 
Agoos hit a drive that flew just wide of the right post. Hugo Perez watched his 
attempt deflect off the goalkeeper and over the bar. Cobi Jones had no better 
luck with his shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The net result was that Iceland, hardly a soccer power, scored a 2-1 victory 
over the United States before 3,017 at Southwestern College in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 The match proved one thing: Iceland is closer to being ready for its fall 
qualifying campaign for the 1996 European Championship than the United States 
is to being ready for the World Cup that kicks off in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 And the excuse that the Americans did not have their foreign-based stars does 
not wash, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were without five or six of our best players," said Iceland Coach Asgeir 
Eliasson, who was diplomatic nonetheless. "They (the U.S. team) did not have 
their full squad. They've got good technique. I'm sure in their World Cup group 
they can be a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Not based on Sunday's performance.  
</P>
<P>
 In a match in which Iceland took an early lead when striker Helgi Sigurdsson 
scored on a breakaway in the 20th minute, the U.S. team stumbled about in 
search of direction.  
</P>
<P>
 Matters improved after a tedious first half when Coach Bora Milutinovic made a 
couple of key substitutions. Suddenly, the U.S. team seemed to click a little 
better and, two minutes into the second half, it tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Klopas, who until then had been enduring an uncomfortable time as the 
lone striker, latched onto a pass inside the Iceland penalty area, turned and 
fired a low shot that snuck into the net just inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iceland then caught the U.S. defense napping in the 86th minute. Forward 
Olaf Pordarson's fierce shot struck U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel in the chest 
and rebounded over his head and rolled into the net for a 2-1 lead.

TITANS' WAGNER WINS 10TH IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Wagner, a sophomore right-hander, won his 10th consecutive game as Cal 
State Fullerton beat Pacific, 4-1, in a Big West Conference baseball game 
Sunday in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner (10-0) gave up seven hits, an unearned run, and struck out four in 6 
2/3 innings.Ted Silva gave up a hit and no runs in the final 2 1/3 innings for 
his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ferguson hit a two-run homer in the third to give the Titans (34-8, 11-3) 
a 3-1 lead. Dante Powell had a single and stole second before Ferguson's fifth 
home run. It was Powell's 33rd stolen base. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson scored Fullerton's final run on a wild pitch in the eighth. Brian 
King had an RBI single in the second for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive loss for Pacific (30-13, 4-7).

SHOP TALK: COMPUTER MUST MEET TWO IRS CONDITIONS TO BE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shop Talk, is a forum for readers to ask questions about on-the-job 
situations and get answers from specialists on workplace issues. This week's 
experts are Judith A. Golden, public affairs officer for the Internal Revenue 
Service in Laguna Niguel, and Ron Riggio, professor of industrial and 
organizational psychology at Cal State Fullerton.

 Question: I work full time and recently bought a home computer that I often 
use for work-related matters. A co-worker says that, in order for me to write 
off the computer as a tax deduction, I must have a letter from our employer 
saying that the computer is a requirement for my job. Is that true, even though 
the computer is an obvious benefit to me in my work? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.G., Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. For you to deduct a depreciation expense for a home computer, two 
rules apply. Use of the computer must be: 1) for the convenience of your 
employer; and 2) required as a condition of your employment. Though your 
computer may be helpful for your work assignments, for it to be a tax 
deduction, it must be a documented requirement of your job. 
</P>
<P>
 If the expense is deductible, you must itemize your deductions on Form 1040, 
Schedule A. It will be taken as a depreciation expense under "employee business 
expenses." The deduction will be limited by the percent of business use and 
subject to the 2% adjusted gross income (AGI) limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that there are always exceptions to the general rules. So before you 
claim such a deduction, I recommend that you consult a tax practitioner or 
review some of the free IRS publications that deal with this and other employee 
business expense issues. 
</P>
<P>
 To request publications on employee business expenses, depreciation and 
itemized deductions, call (800) 829-3676. That's (800) TAX-FORM.

 Question: I am a manager at a medium-sized manufacturing plant. It seems to me 
that employee morale is getting worse and worse. Is this a trend, maybe as a 
result of the recession? Are other companies having the same problems? What can 
I do to improve morale? 
</P>
<P>
 -- K.S., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Job dissatisfaction in an entire company or in a large group of its 
employees is usually a symptom of an underlying problem. The best way for 
managers to find out why morale is low is simply to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, employees may not be honest if they fear retribution. And different 
employees may have different interpretations of what the problem is, so it is 
important to solicit responses from many people. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to evaluate dissatisfaction companywide is with a comprehensive 
employee attitude survey. If the study is anonymous, people can feel free to 
speak up and voice their concerns. Some of the available "job satisfaction" 
surveys ask about all facets of the employee's job, including attitudes about 
management, the company's policies and practices, pay, benefits and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that an anonymous survey would let you know just what is causing the 
decline in morale. 
</P>
<P>
 As for whether low morale might be due to the recession, research that we have 
done at Cal State Fullerton over the past dozen years indicates that employee 
satisfaction doesn't seem to decline during poor economic times. But the 
reasons for employee satisfaction or dissatisfaction do seem to change. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, during a recession, people become more worried about job 
security and less concerned with pay raises and benefits. During good times, 
concern with security decrease and interest in financial rewards goes up. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that your morale problem will simply go away when the economy 
improves. So what can you do? 
</P>
<P>
 The first step is to diagnose the problem. If you don't do an employee survey, 
consider setting up complaint-suggestion boxes or arranging other ways to "ask" 
people what's wrong. It is difficult, if not impossible, to solve a problem 
until you have figured out what it is.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: EL TORO AIR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Hick; Mark Pinsky, ; April Jackson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CHANGING SCENES: The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, facing closure by the 
end of the decade, will be the scene of the solemn arrival of the body of 
former President Richard Nixon on Tuesday afternoon. But by the weekend, the 
mood will shift, as a million people are expected for the annual three-day air 
show. A pilot's death marred last year's event, but officials say they're ready 
for any emergencies. The show, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday through Sunday, is 
free. Gates open two hours beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 BLUES ARE BACK: If you attended the air show last year, you missed seeing the 
Blue Angels, the Navy/Marine flight demonstration team, known for breathtaking 
maneuvers. But they headline in their return this year. Says Larry Mutz, 
consultant for the air show: "When the Blues do their solos, the oohs and ahs 
from the crowd are the loudest all day." . . . New acts include the U.S. Navy 
Parachute Team and the civilian GI Joe Skydiving Team. 
</P>
<P>
 PILOT'S SEAT: This is Mutz's 14th year running the spectacle. He hadn't 
expected to be back after retiring from his Department of Defense civilian job 
two years ago. "I moved to Tennessee to kick back and fish," Mutz says. "But 
when the general called, I couldn't say no." . . . It's 10 arduous weeks of 
work, but Mutz, 47, says it's worth it: "It's in my blood. There's nothing to 
compare to the expression on youngsters' faces when they see those jets 
overhead." 
</P>
<P>
 GROUND MANEUVERS: The only bad part of going to the air show is fighting 
traffic to and from. The California Highway Patrol recommends that visitors 
from the south exit the Santa Ana Freeway at Jeffrey Road or Culver Drive, 
rather than Sand Canyon Avenue, which is bound to be choked. . . . From the 
north, take the Alton Parkway exit. After that, don't worry: "We're going to 
have lots of CHP and Irvine police directing people," says the CHP's Angel 
Johnson. "It'll be fairly easy to know which way to go." . . . But she warns: 
"Don't stop on the freeway to watch the show, because we're going to give 
tickets for non-emergency stopping."

<P>
 A 12-mile stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike was shut down for nearly two 
hours Sunday as firefighters battled a five-alarm brush fire along the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which started at 3:45 p.m., covered a wide area, from Ridgefield, 
N.J., to Newark, along I-95. Police said the cause of the fire was unknown. The 
turnpike was reopened at 5:20 p.m., they said.

BRAZILIAN PRIEST PUTS FAITH IN HIS REVOLVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Thou shalt not kill" is one of the most sacred commandments, but that has not 
stopped one Brazilian parish priest from putting his faith in a six-shot 
revolver to defend his church from thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Aluisio Weber keeps the .22-caliber revolver within easy reach as he 
goes about his duties at the Sao Paulo Church in Foz do Iguacu in the southern 
state of Parana. He armed himself after thieves robbed his church on 11 
separate occasions, shooting dead an assistant priest and stealing an organ, 
sound equipment and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Would he use the weapon? "If it's in self-defense, then it's not a sin," he 
told Brazilian television.

MISTER ROBINSON INDEED!; PRO BASKETBALL: SPURS CENTER "EMBARRASSES" CLIPPERS 
WITH 71 POINTS EN ROUTE TO SCORING TITLE IN 112-97 ROUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers, the NBA's worst defensive team, gift wrapped the NBA scoring 
title for All-Star center David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson piled up 71 points, 47 in the second half, in Sunday's 112-97 
season-ending win over the Clippers at the Sports Arena to edge Orlando Magic 
center Shaquille O'Neal for the NBA scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up at the scoreboard and I said, '71 points. Oh, my goodness!"' 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson finished with 2,383 points in 80 games, an average of 29.788 points, 
to win the NBA's closest scoring race since 1978, when George Gervin of the 
Spurs scored 63 points in the final game to edge David Thompson, who had scored 
73 points in an afternoon game. Gervin finished with 27.22 points to Thompson's 
27.15. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who had 2,345 points going into Sunday's night's season finale against 
the New Jersey Nets, needed 68 points to win the scoring title, but he got 32 
points and finished with 2,377 points in 81 games, an average of 29.346 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Robinson covet the scoring title? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not until today did it really become something that was very important," 
Robinson said. "I've always tried to focus this year on winning games, but 
today coming in here everybody talked about, 'hey look, we've got a couple guys 
out (Dale Ellis and Willie Anderson), you just go ahead and shoot.' So it was 
nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about scoring titles or MVP, that stuff will wear you out if 
you think about it every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins, who had 16 points in what could 
have been his last game with the team, said the Clippers (27-55) should be 
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disappointing is an understatement for this season," Wilkins said. "There's 
no pride here. If you can look at yourself in the mirror after a game like that 
and be happy with yourself, something's wrong. Nothing against David, he's a 
great player, but how can you let a guy get 71 points? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous. We helped him get 71 points. If they want to play 
him the whole game that's fine, but the way we played him, it's like we helped 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like this in my career, let me tell you the truth, 
never. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game probably got him MVP." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most points scored in an NBA game this season and the most since 
Thompson scored 73 points against Detroit on April 9, 1978. Only four players 
have scored 70 or more points in a game -- Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 72 or 
more points five times, Thompson, Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor, who had 
71 points against New York on Nov. 15, 1960, and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he could have had 80 points tonight," said Spurs forward Dennis 
Rodman. "He missed a few free throws and a couple easy baskets. They don't 
think David deserves the MVP because of our record (55-27), but that's . . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Before a sellout crowd of 16,005 that included Madonna, who walked off the 
court with her arm around Spurs Coach John Lucas and prayed with the Spurs in 
the locker room after the game, Robinson made 26 of 41 shots, including a 
three-pointer, to eclipse his career high of 52 points. Robinson, who broke 
Gervin's franchise record of 63 points, made 18 of 25 free throws and grabbed 
14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who scored 18 of the Spurs' 20 first-quarter points, had six points 
in the second quarter, 19 in the third and 28 in the final quarter. Robinson, 
who got a standing ovation with 1:49 left, spent the last few minutes of the 
game cherry picking under the Spurs' basket to pad his point total. The Spurs 
also intentionally fouled the Clippers late to gain possession so Robinson 
could score. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas, who played Robinson 44 minutes, said he was trying to get Robinson the 
scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were a legit 71 points," Lucas said. "He played 44 minutes when he 
should have played 48." 
</P>
<P>
 Were the Clippers angry that the Spurs left Robinson in the game? 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't really matter," Wilkins said. "It's up to us as players to have 
some pride and say, 'hey, I don't care how long you stay in the game you're not 
going to make me look like a fool."' Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson, who has three years left on his contract, indicated he 
wants to be traded. "If you are not committed to winning, I don't want to be 
here. And I think tonight shows no commitment toward winning.". . . . Clipper 
General Manager Elgin Baylor, deflecting speculation on whether the Clippers 
will buy out the remaining two years of Coach Bob Weiss's contract, said he'll 
meet with Weiss and the coaching staff next week for an evaluation of the 
season. . . . Clipper guard Ron Harper on the season: "I'm just glad its over. 
. . . Will I be back? I'll see you somewhere down the road.". . . . Weiss on 
the season: "It was a horrible season for all of us, the worst that anyone in 
the locker room could has ever seen, except for the CBA guys. . . . Dominique 
Wilkins said he was too upset to discuss whether he'll return. "The way I feel 
right now I'd rather not even answer that question right now," he said. NBA's

LAST GAME ON BENCH FOR UNSELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pro basketball: He retires from coaching Bullets after seven seasons with a 
202-345 record., From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington Bullet Coach Wes Unseld shocked a capacity crowd by announcing his 
retirement from coaching moments after his team defeated Charlotte, 117-99, in 
the season finale Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I planned to do was to announce to the players that this was my last 
game as head coach," Unseld said to the 18,756 in attendance, "but I thought it 
would be more fitting to tell you -- the fans -- first. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've been very patient, kind and very encouraging, and I wanted to say 
thank you. I also want to say I don't know what people hope for in life, but I 
hoped for an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old Hall of Fame center said he is ending his seven-year tenure -- 
the longest of any active head coach -- but will continue his duties as vice 
president of the team and Centre Group Partnership, the umbrella organization 
that guides the Bullets, the NHL Capitals, Centre Management and TicketMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he did it the way he wanted to," guard Rex Chapman said. "He's a man 
I'll always look up to. He's probably the most respected person in this 
league." 
</P>
<P>
 Unseld will perhaps best be remembered as a teaching coach, working hands-on 
with his players and helping guide Harvey Grant (1989) and Pervis Ellison 
(1992) to Most Improved Player honors. Don MacLean is considered a top 
candidate to win the award this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseld was 202-345 in his seven years as coach and made the playoffs only 
once, but he never lost the respect of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury-riddled team limped to a 24-58 mark this season. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a replacement, John Nash, Bullet vice president and general manager, 
said the search is in its preliminary stages.

 Larry Walker and a kid in the Dodger Stadium stands had an entertaining 
give-and-take during the third inning of Sunday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, the Montreal Expo right fielder ran down a Mike Piazza fly ball 
and caught it as he crossed into foul territory, ending up against the short 
railing in front of the first row of seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking the side was retired, and not realizing Jose Offerman was tagging up 
at first with only two out, Walker nonchalantly handed the ball to a boy in the 
first row. Offerman was around second before Walker realized his blunder, 
whirled back and got the ball back from the surprised boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Walker handed the ball off, it was declared out of play, and Offerman had 
to stop at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who already had an error in the first inning when he failed to dig out 
Brett Butler's line drive double into the corner, earned his second error of 
the game for allowing Offerman to go to third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of things in 25 years in baseball," said Fred Claire, Dodger 
executive vice president, "but I've never seen that." 
</P>
<P>
 When he went back onto the field in the bottom of the fourth, Walker took 
another ball out to the boy. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Expo Manager Felipe Alou entered Sunday's game having used reliever Mel Rojas 
in five consecutive games and said he would have no qualms at all about calling 
on him for a sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 With closer John Wetteland on the disabled list because of a hamstring injury, 
Rojas, who has saves in four consecutive appearances, is the only reliever in 
the Expo bullpen who was the stuff to finish close games, Alou said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we need him today, hey, we have a day off tomorrow," Alou said with a 
smile. "We ask him, 'Are you OK to throw today?' He says yes, then we pitch 
him. He said he was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The Expo record for consecutive appearances is six by Dale Murray in 1975 and 
Jeff Reardon in 1982. TIM KAWAKAMI

<P>
 The Angels, after learning Sunday that catcher Greg Myers must undergo surgery 
for torn cartilage in his left knee that will sideline him for at least a 
month, have begun negotiations with veteran catcher Bob Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin, 32, who has played eight seasons as a backup catcher, was released 
this spring by the Boston Red Sox. He is a career .234 hitter, batting only 
.222 with three homers and 23 RBIs last season for the Red Sox, but is 
considered strong defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are attempting to sign him to a triple-A contract, according to 
General Manager Bill Bavasi. Melvin would be Vancouver's everyday catcher and 
be available if the Angels become uncomfortable with rookie catchers Chris 
Turner and Jorge Fabregas. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers suffered the injury Saturday in a home-plate collision with Red Sox 
outfielder Mike Greenwell. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson, who struck out swinging in the eighth inning with runners on 
second and third with one out, says there's no secret to the Fenway mystique. 
</P>

 "It's the hardest ballpark in the league to play in," he said. "During the 
day, you can't see those pitches coming out from those white uniforms. It's 
like hitting a needle in a haystack. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I know if we can't see him, the umpires sure can't. That's why you see a 
lot of bad calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying. We're trying. And everybody's screwing up."

 Angel right fielder Tim Salmon, after being informed that the Angels have yet

 Angel catcher Chris Turner extended his hitless skein to 19 at-bats, and has 
failed to produce a hit since April 9. He has failed to hit the ball out of the 
infield in 13 consecutive at-bats, striking out in eight of them. . . . Red Sox 
second baseman Scott Fletcher stole a hit away from Gary DiSarcina with a 
basket catch in short right field in the ninth, and on the very next pitch, 
dove in the air to his right and stole a hit from Damion Easley. He received a 
standing ovation. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SCHERBO, MILLER PROVE THEY BELONG AT TOP; GYMNASTICS: BELARUS' CHAMPION WINS 
TWO MORE GOLDS AND AMERICAN EARNS SECOND GOLD.

<P>
 Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus and American Shannon Miller confirmed their status 
Sunday as the world's top gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo won two gold medals on the final day of the World Championships to 
finish with three golds and a bronze in the competition. Miller earned her 
second gold, winning the women's beam, after having won the all-around gold 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo, winner of six gold medals at the 1992 Olympics and three at last 
year's World Championships at Birmingham, England, added the vault and 
horizontal bar titles to the floor exercise gold he won Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old from Minsk got 9.674 points in the vault. Li Xiaoshuang of 
China finished second with 9.618 points and Yeo Hong-Chul of South Korea was 
third with 9.600. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo then capped his performance by winning the horizontal bar title with 
9.687 points. Zoltan Supola of Hungary was second with 9.537 and Ivan Ivankov 
of Belarus third with 9.500. Chainey Umphrey of Los Angeles finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivankov dethroned Scherbo as all-around champion Thursday night, but Scherbo, 
regarded as the greatest gymnast of his generation, rebounded impressively 
after winning only a bronze in that event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disappointed that I made two big mistakes in the all-around 
competition," Scherbo said. "That was unbelievable. After that I told myself I 
had to win a couple of gold medals." 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo said he hoped the four-medal haul would help secure his financial 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this will help me for sponsorship and marketing," he said. Scherbo is 
paid a grant of $70 a month by the Belarus government. 
</P>
<P>
 Huang Liping of China won the men's parallel bars title with 9.775 points. 
Rustam Charipov of Ukraine won the silver with 9.612 and Alexei Nemov of Russia 
the bronze with 9.575. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller won her second gold, taking the women's balance beam event with 9.875 
points. She fell in the beam final last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's composed, fluid routine gave her a clear victory over silver medalist 
Lilia Podkopayeva of Ukraine, who had 9.737 points, and bronze medalist Oxana 
Fabrichnova of Russia, with 9.712. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year did cross my mind, but I tried to keep being positive," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavinia Milosovici of Romania, winner of the beam at Birmingham, finished 
fifth behind teammate Nadia Hategan, while American Dominique Dawes was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's victory continued a remarkable return from injury for the 17-year-old 
from Edmond, Okla., who sat out two weeks of training in early March after 
suffering strained stomach muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best routine Shannon has done since we got here," Coach Peggy 
Liddick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liddick said Miller had not felt any pressure after winning three gold medals 
at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we teach Shannon is that pressure is only how you perceive it," Liddick 
said. "We tell her she's prepared and she knows she's prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller could not, however, win a third medal in the women's floor exercise, in 
which she was the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dina Kochetkova of Russia, the final competitor to perform, won with 9.850 
points. Milosovici was second with 9.837 and vault gold medalist Gina Gogean of 
Romania third with 9.762. Miller finished fourth with 9.687 after stepping out 
of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was still pleased overall," Miller said. "I tried new skills in almost 
every event and I made most of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kochetkova finished with one gold and two bronze medals, Milosovici with two 
silvers and one bronze and Svetlana Chorkina of Russia with two silvers.

CSUN ALLOWS 11-RUN INNING IN 14-6 WAC LOSS TO SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After Cal State Northridge stumbled to a 14-6 loss to Cal State Sacramento in 
a crucial Western Athletic Conference game at Matador Field on Sunday, the 
writing was on the wall for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters were somewhat blurry, but they appeared to spell out . . . The 
End. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (winning the division) won't be easy," said first baseman Jason Shanahan, 
who had four hits. "Nothing's been easy all year. But it's still possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento (22-21, 9-9 in the WAC) put the game away by scoring a record-tying 
11 runs in the seventh. The Hornets also put Northridge (22-24, 10-8) in a deep 
hole in the WAC West Division. With six WAC games remaining, the Matadors are 2 
1/2 games behind first-place San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost two of three against Sacramento, marking the first time the 
Matadors lost a series at home in four seasons of NCAA Division I competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento's 10-hit seventh broke by one the Northridge record for hits 
surrendered in an inning, set in 1961. The 11-run inning tied a Northridge 
record for runs allowed set in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding injury to insult, shortstop Chad Thornhill was hurt in a collision at 
first base. He left the field with his right arm in a sling. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento led, 3-2, entering the seventh. Northridge pitcher Marco Contreras 
(6-5) committed a fielding error on a bunt play with two on and none out, then 
forced home a run with a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Beeman -- who hit for the cycle -- tripled to clear the bases. 
Sacramento sent 17 batters to the plate in the inning.

BRAWLEY LOSES TO DEFENDING CHAMPION IN OJAI FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean Brawley beat former Australian Open champion Roscoe Tanner in straight 
sets in the semifinal round and what did he get for his effort? 
</P>
<P>
 A spanking in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Brawley, once a standout at Newbury Park High, was defeated by defending 
champion Pat Crow, 7-5, 6-2, in the men's open singles final of the 95th Ojai 
Valley Tennis Tournament Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brawley, 33, led early in the match -- 3-1 in the first set -- but not for 
long. Crow, 28, from Long Beach, broke serve to pull even at 4-4, and did it 
again in Game 12 with a backhand passing shot to win the first set. It was all 
Crow thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a little too strong for me right now," Brawley said. "My legs are very 
sore from the tournament. I served pretty well for a time, but then he got 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Crow served three love games and Brawley was outscored, 24-2, in five of 
Crow's last six services. He broke Brawley twice again in the second set with 
match-point coming on a forehand pass down the line off Brawley's serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Crow made some spectacular shots, as he did in 1993 when he beat San 
Fernando's Desi McBride in the final. In the second set against Brawley, Crow 
hit a backhand winner down the line, a forehand pass, and a backhand crossing 
winner, to break and lead, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 After holding serve to lead, 5-2, Crow stunned Brawley with a seemingly wide 
return that curved and dived inside the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got that from bowling," Crow shouted across the net. Four points later the 
match was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't give me much pace," said Crow, who, at 6-foot-2, 200 pounds is four 
inches taller and 30 pounds heavier than Brawley. "He doesn't hit the ball as 
hard has what I'm used to. I sensed (he was tired) after the first few games. 
He had a tough match against Tanner yesterday."

SANTA ANITA; BIEN BIEN CARRIES WEIGHT WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The weight that Bien Bien has been gaining hasn't been coming from the racing 
secretary's office, which is the way trainer Paco Gonzalez likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I weighed him after his last race, I was surprised," Gonzalez said. "He 
had picked up 12 pounds, to 1,060 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sunday's $400,000 San Juan Capistrano Handicap, Bien Bien was the 
highweight, but it was only 122 pounds, two less than he carried in winning the 
San Luis Rey Stakes on March 27. Bien Bien was nipped at the wire by Kotashaan, 
the eventual horse of the year, in last year's San Juan, but this time there 
was nothing resembling Kotashaan in the field. Chris McCarron didn't need his 
whip as Bien Bien won by three-quarters of a length over Grand Flotilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Earning $220,000 for his owners, Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan, Bien Bien 
paid $2.80, lowest win price in a series that was first run in 1935. The time 
for the distance of about 1 3/4 miles was 2:46 3/5, which was 1 3/5 seconds 
slower than Kotahsaan's track-record time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla, who moved to the front in the run down the backside, finished 
two lengths ahead of Alex The Great. 
</P>
<P>
 A $100,000 yearling purchase, Bien Bien has won nine of 25 starts and earned 
$2.2 million. His grass record is eight victories in 17 starts, and Gonzalez 
said his next start is expected to be on May 30 in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf 
Handicap, a race he won last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves the turf course at Hollywood," Gonzalez said. "After that, we might 
consider putting him back on dirt again, in the Hollywood Gold Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 The $750,000 Gold Cup is scheduled for July 2. Before his victory in the San 
Luis Rey, Bien Bien returned to dirt for a solid third-place finish in the 
Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Juan, McCarron was content to be in fifth place early, behind 
Siebe, Afaladja, Navire and Grand Flotilla. When Eddie Delahoussaye and Grand 
Flotilla moved to the front, Bien Bien also kicked into gear, moving into 
second place. Bien Bien passed Grand Flotilla in the upper stretch. Horse 
Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien gave Chris McCarron his 16th stakes victory, which leads the meet. 
"Even when Grand Flotilla made that run, I was pretty confident," McCarron 
said. "I was confident all the way to the wire.". . . . The season ends today 
with the San Jacinto Handicap. Square Cut, winner of a minor stake last month, 
is the 5-2 morning-line favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 The disqualification of Prince Ferdinand from fourth place to last in 
Saturday's San Simeon Handicap resulted in a five-day suspension for jockey 
Chris Antley. The suspension starts Wednesday, opening day at Hollywood Park. . 
. . Lottery Winner, winless in six starts since his victory in the Goodwood 
Handicap in October, won Sunday's Bates Motel Handicap. . . . The 
stakes-winning Quintana, who ran sixth in the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont 
Stakes in 1991, was destroyed after breaking down in the seventh race. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumin Affair, beaten by a neck by Concern, is apparently the only Arkansas 
Derby starter going to Kentucky. Concern came from 15 lengths behind Saturday 
to win the 1 1/8-mile Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park and looked like he 
wouldn't have any problem with the extra furlong of the Kentucky Derby. "It's 
awfully unlikely" that Concern will run May 7 at Churchill Downs, trainer 
Richard Small said Sunday. The son of Broad Brush was already headed for 
Maryland. Small took Broad Brush to the Kentucky Derby in 1986 and he finished 
third, beaten by three lengths by Ferdinand. Small said he didn't want to 
return until he had a horse of comparable ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have a monster year with this horse," he said, citing the May 21 
Preakness at Pimlico. "Usually you have five horses going back to California 
after the Derby," Small said. "That's part of the beauty of being there (in 
Maryland). All I've got to do is put a bridle on him and lead him over." 
</P>
<P>
 Blumin Affair has won twice in eight starts, but he was second to Brocco in 
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in November and second to Smilin Singin Sam in the 
Remington Park Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran a good race," trainer Jack Van Berg, who won the 1987 Kentucky Derby 
with Alysheba, said of the Arkansas Derby. "He should be right. We're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 At Remington, Alex Solis had Blumin Affair more than a dozen lengths behind 
and made up 10 lengths in the stretch. After that race, Van Berg said Solis let 
the son of Dynaformer get too far behind. On Saturday, Blumin Affair, with 
Eddie Delahoussaye aboard, was eighth after a half-mile, but only about six 
lengths off the leader. "That was a little closer than I thought he'd be," Van 
Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ride The Rails, the favorite in the Arkansas Derby, ran an even race and 
finished fourth, beaten by about four lengths. "The Kentucky Derby is out," 
trainer Jim Bracken said. "He had them in his sights and he couldn't get 
there." He said Ride The Rails would go back to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Gash won the $65,000 New York Stallion Stakes Times Square Division by five 
lengths over Memories of Linda at Aqueduct. Fini Cassette was another three 
lengths back in third in the field of six New York-bred 3-year-old colts and 
geldings. Under jockey Robbie Davis, Gash took command early before drawing 
away in the stretch. He covered the mile in 1:35 4/5 over the fast main track. 
The Mary Eppler-trained gelded son of Distinctive Pro, sent off as the 7-5 
favorite, earned his third victory in six lifetime starts and $39,000 for owner 
Alfred G. Vanderbilt. The winner returned $4.80 and $2.80. Memories of Linda 
paid $3. There was no show wagering. In the Park Avenue Division of the New 
York Stallion Stakes, Minetonightsfirst scored a 1 1/2-length victory over Come 
On Joy, with Tensie's Pro another 3 1/4 lengths back in third in the field of 
six New York-bred 3-year-old fillies. The winner returned $4.60, $3.20 and 
$2.20. Come On Joy paid $4.40 and $2.20, and Tensie's Pro returned $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Devil May Due, ridden by Kevin Murray, won his third consecutive race at 
Sportsman's Park, an eighth-length victory in the $25,520 Intensitivo Purse.

IRVINE LOSES BIG WEST TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UC Irvine men's tennis season couldn't have had a more fitting and 
frustrating ending to their season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Anteaters fighting for the Big West Conference championship and a 
probable bid to the NCAA West Regional, junior Carlos Bustos, playing with a 
bum knee and ankle, succumbed to the pressure, losing, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2), to 
Nevada Las Vegas' Matt Rivera, and UC Irvine lost the match, 4-2, Sunday at the 
Ojai Valley Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 It was UNLV's first conference title, which the Anteaters had held for two 
years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Cruz, the Anteaters' No. 6 player, was tied in sets with UNLV's Rob 
Norton, 1-1, but his chance to win the conference title died with Bustos' loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys had a lot of pressure to win the title, and knowing that we needed 
this to reach the NCAAs just added to it," Bustos said. "I started feeling the 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 After jumping to a 4-2 lead in the second set, Bustos said he also began 
feeling his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave it my best, but I just ran out of gas," Bustos said. "Midway through 
the second set, my knee starting stiffening up. I was real flat and I couldn't 
move my feet." 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine Coach Steve Clark knew something was bothering Bustos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlos should have beaten that guy," Clark said. "Against South Alabama, he 
was in the same circumstance and drilled the guy. I don't think he was out of 
gas, but he's beaten far better players in tighter circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Bustos, however, has rarely played in matches this season, let alone close 
matches. Because of tendinitis in his left knee, he missed all but nine matches 
and in a few of those, he had to default during the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have played if this wasn't for the NCAAs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Bach, one of UC Irvine's top singles and doubles players, didn't play 
because of a sore hamstring. But this season, one injured player constituted a 
healthy team for UC Irvine. In several matches, the Anteaters were without two 
and three players. 
</P>
<P>
 In the week before Ojai, UC Irvine (13-12) lost to San Diego, San Diego State 
and Fresno State -- all teams a healthy Anteater team probably would have 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine's No. 1 player, Chris Tontz, one of the few healthy Anteaters, lost, 
7-6, 6-4, to UNLV's Roger Pettersson. The match hinged on a questionable line 
call by Pettersson. Tontz appeared to have won the first set tiebreaker with a 
passing shot on the line, but Pettersson called it out and there was no referee 
around to overrule the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would have won that set, I think I would have gone on and won the 
second," Tontz said. "That was a big momentum change." 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine's only points came from Marc Tardiff, who defeated Luke Smith, 6-2, 
6-4, at No. 2 singles, and No. 3 Julian Foxon, who beat Charles Olinger, 6-2, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine ends its season Wednesday against Pepperdine in what now appears to 
be a meaningless match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's independent singles final, UCLA freshman and former Canyon High 
player Eric Lin defeated Stanford's Billy Wright, 6-3, 6-7, 6-2.

A DIVORCE, 19TH-CENTURY AMERICAN-STYLE; BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; THE BLUESTOCKING: 
THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS FORREST DIVORCE CASE BY DAVID DELMAN ; ST. MARTIN'S 
PRESS $21.95, 287 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that divorce has become a 20th-Century rite of passage, it's hard to 
imagine an era when news of a marital split would crowd international news off 
the front pages of 11 New York newspapers, but that was the case when Edward 
Forrest and Catherine Forrest sued and countersued each other -- and for 
nothing more or less than adultery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither mayhem nor murder was involved, Edward Forrest was the 
leading American Shakespearean actor of his day, and his wife was that 
19th-Century abomination, a bluestocking, "an advanced woman" who objected to 
her husband's affairs with other women. That's all it took to make headlines 
for more than a month and to qualify as the longest divorce case ever to be 
tried before the New York State Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 When David Delman, the author of 14 novels, discovered the transcript of this 
trial, he vowed to make it the basis of his 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 Structure is provided by a young reporter named Henry Stewart, toiling for the 
irascible but brilliant editor of the New York Herald, James Gordon Bennett. 
(All characters, real and imagined, in this novel rate a minimum of two 
adjectives apiece.) Stewart is committed to his chosen profession, fair-minded 
but doggedly determined to cover every aspect of this sensational case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of his labors, he sympathizes with the brave, spirited, wronged 
Catherine Forrest, gradually coming to the conclusion that he'd be delighted to 
have an equally forward-thinking wife. Happily, he finds a candidate in the 
person of the enchanting, witty Serena Blaylock, and their burgeoning romance 
provides a pleasant counterpoint to the rancorous battles of the Forrests. 
</P>
<P>
 After a thorough perusal of the available evidence, the author has decided 
that Edward Forrest grew to hate his once-adored wife because she, like the 
loathed Macready, was British. Consumed by Anglophobia, Forrest seduced the 
actresses with whom he toured, but not apparently before assuring himself that 
they were American. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven to despair, but entirely innocent of any patriotic adultery, Catherine 
instituted a suit. Enraged at her effrontery, Edward Forrest bribed the 
household staff to perjure themselves by saying that Catherine had taken 
advantage of her husband's absences to have romantic flings of her own, 
allegations that were eventually proven to be utterly false -- but eventually 
is the key word here. 
</P>
<P>
 The vindication of Catherine Forrest consumes a great deal of time and space, 
and although she was represented by Charles O'Connor (tall, thin and aloof), 
the man who would eventually defend Jefferson Davis after the Civil War was not 
nearly as theatrical. John Van Buren ("forty and a shade"), the son of Martin 
Van Buren, was Edward Forrest's attorney, and a less vibrant figure than his 
father, who seldom makes the short list of great American Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentences are convoluted and formal, and not only when the lawyers are 
arguing. When our reporter Stewart is taking a bath and attempting to forget a 
bad path in his relationship with the delightful Serena Blaylock, he "permitted 
the big toes of both feet to break the water line" as he says, at "a decibel 
level more circumspect than the previous night's, 'Hear me, Serena, I now 
banish you utterly from my brain.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary feminists will be gratified to learn that Catherine Forrest 
ultimately won the munificent (for 1851) settlement of $3,000 per annum. 
Revealing the sum isn't actually giving away the plot.

 WALK FOR VICTIMS: Dozens of victims' rights advocates will don walking shoes 
at noon Tuesday for a stroll around the Ventura County Government Center. 
They'll walk about a mile in recognition of National Victims' Rights Week . . . 
and to raise cash for a fund that helps crime victims countywide. Last year, 
walkers raised about $4,000 to assist 9,130 people through the Victim Services 
Division of the district attorney's office. "We want to remind people that 
crime has a very devastating impact on people's lives," said Assistant Dist. 
Atty. Colleen Toy White. 
</P>
<P>
 NATURE AND NURTURE: A Los Angeles-based group wants to make sure Ventura 
County's miles of sweeping shoreline and acres of national forest aren't taken 
for granted . . . especially by children (Voices, B10). Nursery Nature Walks 
provides wilderness education programs for children, their parents, teachers 
and other nature lovers who want to escape the madding pace of urban life, if 
just for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 STUBBORN SEED: Profuse and defiantly yellow, the blooms covering Ventura 
County's rolling hills are seen by some as a harbinger of spring in Southern 
California. But to parks officials, the sight of mustard plants is anything but 
welcome (B1). . . . Officials have tried for years to get rid of the non-native 
plants using controlled burns, but the resilient plant springs right back. Some 
observers say the efforts are futile. "You can do what you want to mustard," 
naturalist Milt McAuley said. "But next year, it's going to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 MEMORABLE DAY: Volunteers in Ojai are busy planning the city's most ambitious 
Memorial Day celebration ever. The May 28 event at Nordhoff High School will 
feature a flyover of vintage aircraft, a fireworks display and a performance by 
the Shirelles, a trio of female singers whose hits -- such as "Soldier Boy" -- 
topped the charts in the '50s and '60s. . . . After a decades-long hiatus, 
Memorial Day observances were revived in Ojai three years ago. "It's really 
just growing," said organizer Barbara Ortis.

STREET SMART: SIGNAL COORDINATION WOULDN'T SOLVE LAGUNA'S TRAFFIC PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Surely someone can do a better job of coordinating the traffic lights on South 
Coast Highway through downtown Laguna Beach, from Broadway to Park Avenue. 
There are four lights involved, and the flow of traffic through them is slower 
than a snail's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this is a state highway, I assume Caltrans has jurisdiction. HELP!!! 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Turner, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic signal coordination on South Coast Highway through downtown Laguna 
Beach would not solve traffic congestion, said Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem. 
The signals on PCH are coordinated from 7 a.m. to midnight, but many factors 
hinder free-flowing traffic, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An average of 36,000 vehicles travel this route daily, which is why the 
vehicle demand frequently exceeds roadway capacity, Orem said. The constant 
flow of traffic going south on PCH is compounded by those making left turns 
from Broadway onto southbound PCH, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic signals along that portion of PCH are from 264 to 353 feet apart, 
allowing only a few cars between intersections, Orem said. Adding to the 
congestion and the slowdown are motorists attempting to parallel park, heavy 
pedestrian traffic crossing PCH in the downtown area, and motorists who become 
inattentive while sightseeing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For signal coordination to work, all or most of the congestion factors have to 
be eliminated, Orem said. This seems unlikely, but reducing the number of 
vehicles will help improve traffic flow through Laguna Beach, she said. 
Caltrans recommends that motorists car pool or use alternate routes whenever 
possible and plan errands and trips through the area for non-peak hours. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Since we are all aware of the considerable cost of our freeway system, would 
it be illogical and / or impractical to consider a method to reduce individual 
lane congestion and utilize our facilities more effectively? 
</P>
<P>
 At the minimal risk of being called "copycats," let's take a look at the 
Bayshore (101) Freeway (in the San Francisco Bay Area) diamond-lane approach. 
They make use of the diamond lanes for car-poolers only during morning and 
evening rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone may use these lanes in non-rush hours. This arrangement has been in 
effect for quite some time and seems to be highly popular with the driving, 
voting public. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Hubbell, Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy behind 24-hour high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes is that car 
pools should be given preferential treatment at all times, particularly if 
there are high levels of congestion, said Rose Orem of Caltrans. With traffic 
congestion on Orange County's various freeways lasting from 5:30 a.m. to 9 
p.m., there is little or no opportunity to open the HOV lane to mixed flow, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During non-congested periods, overall freeway speeds can be maintained at 55 
m.p.h. without additional capacity, thereby eliminating the need for opening 
the HOV lane to mixed-flow use, Orem said. Opening the lane would offer no time 
advantage to the general purpose traffic if the freeway is already flowing 
optimally, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the presence of the car-pool lane does provide an incentive to ride 
share by offering predictability of travel and time savings in the event of 
non-recurring congestion caused by incidents, construction, special events, 
heavy holiday and weekend traffic or other events, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol enforces the state's HOV lanes, and they believe 
that 24-hour operations are less confusing to the public than peak-period only, 
generally safer to operate and easier to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, but not least, Orem said, there is sufficient HOV traffic throughout the 
day to justify a 24-hour operation. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority has announced the formation of the 
Aesthetics Advisory Committee to aid its ongoing efforts to improve Orange 
County roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will advise OCTA on how to beautify streets, freeways and other 
public structures as part of an Aesthetics Master Plan for Orange County. 
Improvements include landscaping, murals / paintings, sculptures and various 
textures and patterns on bridges and walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member committee will also review project locations, proposed designs 
and funding applications. Committee members must be willing to dedicate at 
least 25 hours a year to OCTA meetings and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is seeking individuals from various disciplines and backgrounds who 
can provide an overall perspective of aesthetics issues. Local artists, 
historians, museum directors, architects, landscape architects and others who 
have demonstrated an interest in preserving the history and culture of Orange 
County are encouraged to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA Board of Directors will review individual nominations, which are due 
May 2. The board is expected to name committee members this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For information or to apply, call Ginger Cox at OCTA at (714) 560-5743.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; JUDGES SHOULD KNOW BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's workers' compensation system was once known for charging 
employers insurance premiums that were among the highest in the nation while 
giving injured workers benefits that were among the lowest. Last year, the 
Legislature instituted overdue reforms in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will not help public confidence in the system to learn now that some 
workers' compensation judges, three of them from Orange County, allegedly 
accepted free hotel rooms for themselves and free rooms and air fares to Hawaii 
for their spouses. That called into question the impartiality of those 
designated to decide disputes over how much an insurance company should pay an 
injured worker. The results turned up in a yearlong internal investigation of 
charges of corruption in the state Division of Workers' Compensation, which 
also found most allegations, including those of bribes to judges, to be 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is difficult to understand just what a state official was thinking 
of when he reported the evidence but said he would take no action to see 
whether criminal charges were warranted. Fortunately, political pressure last 
week changed the official's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The division's administrative director, Casey L. Young, said the probe showed 
that the Orange County judges appeared to have "unwittingly" violated ethics 
rules. The three allegedly accepted free hotel rooms in Hawaii, where they 
ostensibly were attending a legal seminar, paid for by a doctor whose cases 
regularly wound up in their courts. Two Los Angeles judges may have broken 
state law by taking speaking fees from groups that appear before the courts, 
the investigation found. No one was identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's initial response was merely to issue reminders of ethical standards to 
the judges and promise to recommend that regulations on taking travel expenses 
and hotel rooms be tightened. He also said he would hire an ethics "think tank" 
to help draft a more specific code of conduct. Those steps were insufficient 
and they drew deserved criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), who helped author last year's workers' 
compensation reforms, warned Young that if he did not hand over the results of 
the investigation to prosecutors to review whether criminal charges would be 
brought, he, Leonard, would do so himself. Young got the message and days later 
passed the findings to the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges should know better; free air fare and hotel rooms are not doled out 
because of concern for the public welfare. In this case, Young should have 
contacted prosecutors more quickly. Tighter ethical standards may help reform 
the workers' compensation system, but only if judges get the message.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; PARENTS GIVE HIGH MARKS TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS; FROM 
COLLEGE-LEVEL COURSES TO HOMELESS PROGRAMS, OFFICIALS ARE SEEING THAT STUDENTS' 
NEEDS ARE MET. POLL SHOWS EFFORT IS NOTICED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA MEYERS, Sheila Meyers is president of the Orange County Board of 
Education. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County schools are the best in the state, according to the parents -- 
those who know their schools more intimately than anyone. As president of the 
Orange County Board of Education, I can think of no better news to announce 
during April's Public Schools Month. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by the highly regarded Field Poll, 60% of our parents with children 
in school gave A and B grades to their public schools. When C grades are added 
to the numbers, more than three-fourths of our parents indicated their 
satisfaction with the K-12 schools their children attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised? Those of us in the business of educating our 402,000 students in 
the county are not. If you are among the thousands of visitors to our schools 
every month, you know the quality of education our students are receiving. Have 
you observed a fourth-grade class of 35 children, watching them absorbed in 
mathematical studies far beyond anything you and I learned a generation or two 
ago? Math reasoning, logic and probability have enriched instruction beyond the 
times tables and eclipsed the "invert and multiply" role learning. 
</P>
<P>
 We have more high school students in Advanced Placement classes than ever 
before, and more are passing those exams to gain college credit. More of our 
students are enrolling in college -- possibly because they found out in high 
school that they could do college-level work. For those high school students 
more work-bound than aspiring to post-secondary education careers, our 
department is working with and committed to Vital Link, a unique school-to-work 
program designed to better prepare students to fill the needs of business. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 business and professional leaders in Orange County were 
principals for a day last month in a program organized by our County Department 
of Education. Asking busy VIPs to give up a day to learn the challenges of 
being an elementary or secondary school principal is asking for a significant 
time commitment. But I wish you could have heard the comments at the debriefing 
in the Anaheim Union High School District boardroom. If any CEO had harbored 
misgivings about public education before that day, they were gone. They visited 
with students, participated in algebra/geometry/trig classes and served with 
the administrators on "yard duty," arriving by 7:15 a.m. and leaving for the 
final meeting at 4 p.m. Incidentally, the principal-for-a-day program began 
four years ago with about 60 CEOs; the growth has been phenomenal. I would 
estimate closer to 600 will participate next year. The good part is that the 
public schools will have a large number of community leaders much more aware of 
the quality of education in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Orange County's K-12 students can list their street addresses, but 
there are many children attending our classes who come from no identifiable 
address -- the homeless children of homeless parents who live from park to 
park, day to day or week to week, and they may need public education most of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an adequate education, they could be a lifetime burden on society. Our 
Project H.O.P.E. (Homeless Outreach Program for Education) includes a 
classroom-on-wheels van traveling with computers, textbooks, a credentialed 
teacher and everything else found in a local classroom, with one exception: a 
telephone with an 800 number that allows the parents and the teacher to keep in 
touch, wherever their location. 
</P>
<P>
 California's compulsory education law requires children to be in school from 
age 6 to 18 or high school graduation, and it does not exclude children who 
have no home. The Orange County Department of Education is doing its part to 
educate the next generation in this nationally cited program, and we're proud 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those students most of the public never hear about are almost 20,000 in 
our department's special programs. Many are the severely disabled and the 
hearing impaired, others fill the Juvenile Court schools at "the hall," 
community day schools, and places such as Los Pinos and Joplin, supervised by 
the probation department and taught by our credentialed teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience Project helps children from birth to age 3 prenatally exposed to 
drugs who, with their parents, have been referred by social service agencies as 
directed by the courts. Our longitudinal studies will give us enough data to 
learn the ongoing impact of the drugs on these children as they grow up. Right 
now, it is too early to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other young children enroll in the department's child care preschool 
program at our 12 sites. Add to these young children the students who school 
districts refer to us, the adolescents who have lost the right to attend 
regular high schools, then transferred to continuation high school and still 
don't fit. Many, given one more chance, ultimately graduate from Horizon High 
School, a series of storefront locations scattered throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Outdoor Science and Environmental Field Study are OCDE programs as well, 
and we opened a whole new world to more than 46,000 elementary children last 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 We're good, but not good enough. But our public schools are making measurable 
progress. It is Public Schools Month. Visit a class or two, and learn for 
yourself the high quality of education in Orange County.

NFL DRAFT; DRAFT DAY TURNS INTO DAFFY DAY; OVERVIEW: BUCS, NOT COLTS, GET 
DILFER; 49ERS FILL THEIR NEEDS, BUT THE COWBOYS APPEAR LOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The NFL's 59th draft was as large as advertised Sunday, with the big trades, 
big risks, big surprises, big falls and Big Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, defensive tackle Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson was the first overall 
pick by the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 And as expected, when Wilkinson finished his conversation with Bengal 
officials by asking if they wanted to speak to agent Leigh Steinberg, the 
Bengals hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 But other moments during the first two rounds in the seven-round draft were 
not so anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 There were six trades in the first round, two by the Rams, who handed 
franchise players to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Trent Dilfer) and San Francisco 
49ers (Bryant Young). 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Falcons made the best defensive acquisition of the day, and they 
didn't even have a first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was luckier than the Charlotte Panthers, and they didn't have any 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
 That team celebrating was the Bucs. 
</P>
<P>
 That team kicking itself was the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was more:  
</P>
<P>
 -- A team with one of the worst-rated quarterbacks in the league traded up to 
earn two picks among the top five selections . . . and did not take a 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indianapolis Colts took San Diego State running back Marshall Faulk and 
Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts while ignoring Fresno State quarterback Trent 
Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 They are apparently content to be led by Jim Harbaugh, who last year threw 
seven touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do it a different way than what they've tried to do it in the past," 
said Bill Tobin, the Colts' new general manager who drafted Harbaugh when both 
were with the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin later engaged in a nationally televised war of words with ESPN draft 
commentator Mel Kiper Jr., who was one of many "experts" criticizing Tobin's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who the hell is Mel Kiper, anyway?" Tobin said on ESPN. "Mel Kiper has no 
more credentials to do what he's doing than my neighbor, and my neighbor's a 
postman." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 49ers took their first step in regaining NFC superiority over the 
Cowboys by filling two needs with Notre Dame defensive tackle Young (seventh 
overall) and Florida State fullback William Floyd (28th overall). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cowboys, in their first draft in six years without former coach Jimmy 
Johnson, appeared lost. 
</P>
<P>
 They attempted to trade up for USC's Willie McGinest, the fourth overall pick 
by the New England Patriots. They also wanted Michigan State linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson, but the Raiders took him first. So they settled for a third-down 
pass rusher, defensive end Shante Carver of Arizona State in the 23rd overall 
selection. They followed with tackle Larry Allen of Sonoma State in the second 
round, a sleeper who will need to be developed slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot easier than recruiting," marveled new Cowboy Coach Barry 
Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bucs, with one respectable first-round pick in the last 11 years, might 
have rewritten their history. 
</P>
<P>
 They acquired Dilfer after the Colts passed on him, giving them a potential 
star to replace erratic Craig Erickson. Then they picked up Florida running 
back Erict Rhett in the second round. Both players were ranked in the top three 
in their respective positions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New York Giants made the first concession to the new rules by using 
their first round pick to take little-known wide receiver Thomas Lewis of 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis wasn't even ranked among the top 10 at his position, but Giant Coach Dan 
Reeves said it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the kickoffs being moved back to the 30-yard line, there is a premium 
now on kick returners," Reeves said. "Lewis is a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 David Palmer, the Alabama running back who projects as a two-point 
quarterback, was taken as the 40th overall pick in the second round by the 
Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Falcons, who gave up their early picks for quarterback Jeff George, 
rebounded by acquiring Pro Bowl defensive end Chris Doleman from the Minnesota 
Vikings for future draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Philadelphia Eagles also used future picks in acquiring standout San 
Francisco 49ers linebacker Bill Romanowski. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Denver Broncos, who signed receiver Anthony Miller earlier this spring, 
added receiver Mike Pritchard from the Falcons in another trade involving draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson, USC quarterback, became the happiest football player not drafted 
when the expansion Charlotte Panthers won a coin toss with the Jacksonville 
Jaguars for the No. 1 pick next year. 
</P>
<P>
 If Joe Gibbs becomes the Panthers coach as expected, it is likely he would 
want a quarterback to build around, and Johnson is expected to be the top 
prospect next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things were not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the first 13 picks were defensive players, including nine of 10 in one 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath Shuler, Tennessee quarterback, was selected as the third player overall 
by the Washington Redskins. This illustrated new Coach Norv Turner's influence, 
as general manager Charley Casserly wanted Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Ward, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback from Florida State, was not 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 While the remaining five rounds of the draft drag to a conclusion today, the 
task of getting the top picks signed begins immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson looked prepared for the approximately $14.5 million contract that 
will be sought from Bengals by Steinberg. The suit he wore to the Newport Beach 
draft party was green. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Bengals' best offer is closer to $12 million, Steinberg said he 
does not expect a holdout. "This player will not be one minute late for 
training camp," he said.

NFL DRAFT; RAIDERS OBTAIN WILLIAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM ADDRESSES NEED AT 
RUNNING BACK BY ACQUIRING A VETERAN, DRAFTS DEFENSIVE PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders raised some eyebrows Sunday when they ignored their need for a 
running back and used their first two picks in the draft to select defensive 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Raiders had already obtained their running back late Saturday 
night when they agreed in principle to a one-year deal with veteran running 
back Harvey Williams, who has spent the last three seasons with the Kansas City 
Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 With Williams in the fold, the Raiders selected Michigan State linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson with their first-round pick, the 22nd choice overall, then traded 
up in the second round to get James Folston, a defensive end/linebacker from 
Northeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy," Williams said. "This is something I've dreamed about. It 
took three years, but I'm finally in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams comes to the Raiders from the Chiefs to replace the man who rushed in 
the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Marcus Allen last season to Kansas City left the Raiders averaging 
just 89.1 yards on the ground, second lowest total in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Greg Robinson, an eighth-round draft choice, filled in admirably, 
gaining a team-leading 591 yards. But a knee injury in the Raiders' 12th game 
ended his season. 
</P>
<P>
 He revealed Sunday night that he faces a long road back from reconstructive 
surgery on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he might not be back until October, Robinson replied, "October sounds 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles sounds pretty good to Williams, who gained only 149 yards in 42 
carries last season for an average of 3.5. His longest gain was 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I could have carried the ball more in Kansas City," Williams said, 
"but I was not given a true opportunity. I was not in the game. I was not in 
the flow. What could I do? 
</P>
<P>
 "They already had Barry Word and Christian Okoye. I don't know why they even 
drafted me." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of trading places with Allen was not lost on Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of funny," he said. "But I don't look at it as an individual thing. 
Marcus is happy in Kansas City and I'm happy here.' 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the Raiders' draft choices Sunday were also happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had reportedly been interested in Mississippi defensive lineman 
Tim Bowens, but he went two slots ahead of the Raiders on the first round, 
picked up by the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders say Fredrickson, a 6-3, 242-pounder, is the man they wanted 
all along. He is the first linebacker taken in the first round by the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about having Rob Fredrickson," Coach Art Shell said. "He's a 
guy with a lot of talent. He can play just about any of the linebacker 
positions. He's a good athlete with the skills and ability to cover somebody 
out of the backfield and we're happy about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially after the Raiders put their starting middle linebacker, Joe Kelly, 
on waivers earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 That would appear to leave Greg Biekert, a second-year man out of Colorado, 
with the starting job in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if there was a chance of re-signing Kelly at a lower price, Shell said, 
"I don't think we're going in that direction. We feel very good about Greg 
Biekert." 
</P>
<P>
 Frederickson, a third-team All-American last season and a starter in every 
Michigan State game over the last two years, feels very good about getting the 
chance to put on the silver and black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can contribute right away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been reported that Fredrickson spends his spare time showing off his 
talent as an Elvis impersonator. But on Sunday he said that wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders don't care as long as he can do his Ted Hendricks impersonation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson says he grew up a Raider fan, his hero being Hendricks, the 
linebacker who became known as the Mad Stork. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson concedes the men he'll be seeing coming out of professional 
backfields are going to be far more imposing than those he saw coming out of 
collegiate backfields. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to be faster, quicker and more experienced," he said, "but I 
can adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson, speaking by phone after learning he'd been tabbed by the Raiders, 
wasn't ruling out anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could play middle linebacker, he said, "I've never played in the 
middle, but I can learn. I can adapt." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell also wasn't ruling anything out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel he has the capability of playing all three positions," Shell said. 
"He has a lot of versatility for us. . . . He's a very bright guy and we feel 
he can come in and make a contribution. But, he's not the starter, by no 
means." 
</P>
<P>
 On the second round, the Raiders worried that they would lose the opportunity 
to get Fulston, a 6-2 3/4, 242-pounder, who, the Raiders believe, can play the 
run and be an effective pass rusher despite his relatively small size for a 
defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You target all of the guys you want and they suddenly disappear off the 
board," Shell said. "It was time to move." 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Raiders moved, looking upward in the second round to get Fulston. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they tried to deal with the Dallas Cowboys. With the 26th pick in the 
second round, the Raiders talked to Dallas about the 16th selection in that 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 When those talks fell through, the Raiders worked out a deal with the 
Minnesota Vikings, who had the 23rd selection in that round. In return for 
exchanging picks, the Raiders gave Minnesota the second of their two 
fourth-round selections, the 125th pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
 With the retirement of Howie Long and the demotion of Greg Townsend to 
part-timer last season, the Raiders were anxious to add another body to the 
defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that the Raiders had traded up to get him, Fulston seemed generally 
surprised and impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" he said. "I can put on some weight if they need me to." 
</P>
<P>
 The draft will conclude with five more rounds today, the Raiders having seven 
picks spread over that span.

NFL DRAFT; RAMS COME UP WITH A GANDY; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER TRADING DOWN TWICE, 
TEAM MAKES AUBURN OFFENSIVE TACKLE 15TH SELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Season ticket sales have dropped 13% to date, but that was before Coach Chuck 
Knox announced Sunday that the Rams had selected Auburn offensive tackle Wayne 
Gandy in the first round of the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ram official said later the team has no plans to have additional ticket 
sellers on duty today at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 How 'bout those Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 They announced Wednesday without qualification, and repeated it Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday that they would select a quarterback if one remained 
available on the fifth pick in round one, but it seems they were fibbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State quarterback Trent Dilfer was available Sunday and the Rams 
withdrew. They gave their position to Indianapolis, moved back two spots and 
acquired an additional third-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said we would take a quarterback if he was there," Knox said. "That's 
correct. (But) we had a change of heart on that, to be very candid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got tied up in a deal with a player, and I don't know exactly what 
happened there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried to work a trade for Dallas wide receiver Alvin Harper. The Rams 
announced earlier in the week they had no intention of trading for Harper if 
they could pick Dilfer, but it seems they were fibbing about that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer was there, and the Rams were working overtime to get Harper although 
the Cowboys informed them they were no longer interested in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the Rams expect their fans to be fired up with Gandy when they had the 
chance to take Dilfer? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our fans would have been more disappointed had we drafted a 
quarterback and put him on the bench with the fifth pick in the draft," said 
John Shaw, Ram executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fans didn't get Dilfer or Harper. The Rams offered Harper $4.8 million, 
increased it to $5.1 million early Sunday morning and then went to $5.3 million 
and won Harper's approval on a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an agreement sometime during the middle of the third pick," said Jimmy 
Sexton, Harper's agent. "Alvin was back visiting his in-laws in Washington and 
was running back and forth to a Kinko's faxing contracts to Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 New England had the fourth pick and selected USC linebacker Willie McGinest. 
In Dallas, owner Jerry Jones dropped his head onto his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were certain conditions to the trade and once McGinest went at four 
basically the deal was aborted," Shaw said. "We still tried to trade for Harper 
at five and at seven. They weren't interested in making any deal for Harper 
once McGinest was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, however, did offer Harper to the Rams, but no longer included a 
second-round pick. Instead, Jones asked for the Rams' first-round pick and an 
additional second-round choice.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams declined, and completed the trade with Indianapolis. In Washington, 
Harper tore up his signed contract for $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay, picking sixth, pounced on Dilfer, and the Rams, who were scheduled 
to pick seventh, called Dallas again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent the kid back to Kinko's because the first contract had been ripped 
up," Sexton said. "Then I had to tell him that the deal was off; the Rams had 
made the deal with San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams got nowhere with Jones once again, and moved on to the 49ers. The 
Rams acquired second- and third-round picks in exchange for the seventh slot 
and dropped to the 15th position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams intended to pick Georgia offensive tackle Bernard Williams with the 
15th pick, but Philadelphia grabbed him with the 14th selection. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Gandy, a 6-4, 289-pound left tackle to protect quarterback Chris 
Miller. Gandy, according to the Rams, stood No. 10 overall on their draft 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a player in the mold of New Orleans' Willie Roaf," said Jim Erkenbeck, 
Ram offensive line coach. "He's not only physically ready, but mentally ready 
to play as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Rams made their selection, however, ESPN reported that there 
were questions about Gandy's back. An NFL general manager who asked not to be 
identified concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a question about his back; we didn't check it out because we weren't 
in a position to take him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams said they have no such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year they took X-rays of all spines (at the NFL combine workouts) and it 
showed a little defect," said Clarence Shields, the Ram team physician. "But 
there is no concern, no problem. He missed no time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy, who answers to the nickname "G-Man," becomes the leading candidate to 
start at left tackle. Erkenbeck said his pass-blocking ability put him well 
ahead of most players available in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy's addition indicates the Rams will probably release tackle Irv Eatman, 
starting left tackle last season and one of the team's key free agent 
acquisitions a year ago, who is due to earn $1.1 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know too much about the Rams' offense," Gandy said. "Coach Knox likes 
to run the ball and they got rid of their quarterback, if I'm reading that 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for my back, everything is fine. It was a minor thing -- something common 
in all linemen. I never had any back problem. It's just something that they 
X-rayed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams continued to fill needs in the second round with the selection of 
Memphis State wide receiver Isaac Bruce and Nebraska strong safety Toby Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams considered drafting Alabama wide receiver David Palmer, but went with 
Bruce (6-0, 178), who runs the 40 in 4.5 seconds, because he was bigger and 
faster than Palmer (5-8, 167). 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggled with that," said John Becker, Ram director of player personnel. 
"I'm a David Palmer guy. I woke up at 3:15 in the morning thinking about 
Palmer. It was a tough call." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright (5-11, 203) replaces Michael Stewart, who signed as a free agent with 
Miami, and gives the Rams an enforcer in their secondary. He's a very physical 
player," said Rod Perry, Ram defensive backs coach. "He brings us toughness; 
his temperament is along the lines of Ronnie Lott. He will deliver a blow back 
there.' 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who will have seven picks in today's final five rounds, sought depth 
for their defensive line after the defection of Tony Woods to Washington with 
the choice of Wayne State's Brad Ottis (6-3, 272) on the second-round pick 
acquired from the 49ers.

MIKE DOWNEY: NFL DRAFT; NOT A DAY FOR DRAFT DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was going to watch Sunday's NFL draft on television in Anaheim, but then the 
Rams traded it for a TV to be watched later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams kept dropping down and dropping down until I'm pretty sure their 
first pick in the draft was the last pick in the draft. I haven't seen any team 
drop so fast since UCLA in the basketball polls. Chuck Knox probably went home 
and traded Sunday night's dinner to his next-door neighbor for Monday's 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing up a passer such as Trent Dilfer was an odd thing to do. Don't they 
know how those Fresno State boys play when they come to the home of the Freedom 
Bowl? I thought Dilfer would do good things as a Ram quarterback, and never 
once flip over Jim Rome's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what can I say? It was another weird day, draft day. For example, Willie 
McGinest from USC went fourth in the entire draft. To me this is so strange, it 
belongs in the McGinest book of records. I'm sorry, but if Willie McGinest had 
a great career at USC, I missed it. He wasn't half the player Junior Seau was. 
</P>
<P>
 First pick in the draft was a big ol' Buckeye buckaroo out of Ohio State named 
Dan Wilkinson, better known to his friends as "Big Daddy." He was picked by the 
Cincinnati Bengals coach, David Shula, who knows something about having a big 
daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 The second and fifth picks in the draft were made by the Indianapolis Colts, 
who you can also expect to make top-five picks in 1995, 1996 and each draft 
through 2000. I believe that the Colts will become a good professional team 
when they move back to Baltimore and join the Canadian Football League, where 
they belong. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Tobin was outraged by similar sentiments expressed by ESPN draft "expert" 
Mel Kiper Jr., partly because Kiper, according to Tobin, "never put on a jock 
in his life." Hmmm. Neither did pro football "expert" Robert Irsay, owner of 
the Colts, who signs Tobin's checks. But, then, who are we to argue with 
someone such as Tobin who has turned Indianapolis into the NFL powerhouse it is 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts drafted Marshall Faulk, which means that's the last we'll ever hear 
of him. Marshall's next TV appearance should be shortly after the Sydney 
Olympics. A football life spent at San Diego State and in Indianapolis, as a 
matter of fact, should ensure Marshall Faulk's invisibility throughout 
eternity. Good luck, Marshall, and drop us a postcard in a couple of years to 
let us know how you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 A funny thing happened when Indianapolis made a trade with the Rams for the 
right to move up and draft Trev Alberts of Nebraska. Much snickering and 
sniping followed this move, much of it from Mel Kiper, who ran out to a Times 
Square sporting-goods outlet between rounds and bought a jockstrap, just to see 
how it feels. Trev Alberts? Why Trev Alberts? Are you sure they don't mean Marv 
Albert? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let me tell you something, draft watchers. What I know about football 
wouldn't fit into Mel Kiper's, uh, pocket. But I did see Nebraska play twice in 
person, once against UCLA and once against Florida State. And, my NFL friends, 
I am here to tell you that in each of these games, Trev Alberts was the best 
player on the field. He hit everybody but the guys who carried the chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Redskins got the quarterback of choice, Heath Shuler. I guess 
this means John Friesz won't be going up against Troy Aikman head-to-head in 
that race to the next Super Bowl, eh? The entire District of Columbia had been 
looking forward to that Friesz-Aikman matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay pilfered Dilfer. I suspect we will wince once or twice if he turns 
out to be the goods, but on the Rams' behalf, let me say that you don't need a 
super passer to hand off to Jerome Bettis 30 times a game. Then again, Dallas 
didn't become a killer until it had the running back and the passer. 
</P>
<P>
 My prediction: Dilfer goes to the Pro Bowl two years from now. Tampa Bay goes 
4-12 and 3-13, because that's what Tampa Bay does best. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco got the best human being in the draft, Bryant Young of Notre 
Dame. I say this with confidence because Bryant and I went to the same high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle took defensive lineman Sam Adams to play alongside Cortez Kennedy, in 
a continuing bid up there in Washington to construct an entire line named after 
presidents of the United States. They don't only want to sack the quarterback 
up there. They want to veto him. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was another fun Sunday on the tube. The NFL draft is my 
third-favorite thing on ESPN, after the monster truck races and the monster 
bodybuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 I particularly like the way ESPN puts its candid cameras inside those NFL "war 
rooms" without the benefit of a microphone, leading to such state-of-the-art 
observations as: "Sam Wyche just crumpled some paper and didn't look happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing I missed this year was Jimmy Johnson inside the Dallas war 
room, pretending to consult Jerry Jones. Jerry: "OK, move your mouth like 
you're asking me about Emmitt." Jimmy: "Got it. Shake your head once for yes 
and twice for no." 
</P>
<P>
 I really missed Jimmy this time. But as you know, the Fox TV network now has 
teamed up with Jimmy Johnson -- or, as I like to think of them, the Fox and the 
Hair.

DESHIELDS IS OUT OF HOSPITAL; BASEBALL: DODGER SECOND BASEMAN APPEARS TO SUFFER 
ONLY A CONCUSSION IN COLLISION WITH MONDESI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Delino DeShields, who was knocked unconscious when he slammed his head into 
the chest of Raul Mondesi on Saturday night, was released from Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center on Sunday morning and appears to have suffered nothing 
more than a moderate concussion, team physician Michael Mellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellman said DeShields, after undergoing a CAT-scan, was resting at home. He 
said there was no timetable on when DeShields could return to action, but said 
it probably would be a matter of "days, not weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has lack of memory of the event from the moment before to the moments 
after and he has a bad headache," Mellman said, "but otherwise, he's normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He woke up with a headache this morning -- he did not have one last night. If 
that's all he gets out of this, I'll be a very happy person." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, acquired in a trade last winter with the Expos for pitcher Pedro 
Martinez, was unconscious for about three minutes while he lay on the field 
during the seventh inning after chasing a short fly ball from his second-base 
position down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi made the catch despite the collision, then dropped to the ground. 
However, he remained in the game and Sunday said he was sore, but started 
against the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 On a short fly ball hit by Darrin Fletcher to about the same place on the 
field in the second inning of Sunday's game, Mondesi moved to the ball 
gingerly, and gave second baseman Jeff Treadway plenty of room to make the 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant trainer Charlie Strasser, who was out on the field attending to 
DeShields on Saturday night, said that when the second baseman regained 
consciousness he thought he was still in Florida, at spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he was flashing back to that cheek injury," Strasser said, referring to 
the broken cheekbone DeShields suffered early in spring training when he was 
struck by a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellman said that once DeShields was conscious, the first thing they checked 
was whether he had hurt his cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no evidence of that," Mellman said. "It's just a sequence of events 
that represents a collection of injuries for a very aggressive player." 
</P>
<P>
 Once DeShields regained most of his memory, Mellman said the first things he 
wanted to know were how Mondesi was and how the Dodgers did. They lost in 11 
innings, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda said there has been no thought of placing DeShields on the 
disabled list, adding he was disappointed DeShields will have to sit out when 
it appeared he was hitting his stride after a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
 "When guys come over here in big deals like that, they try too hard to show 
that it was a good deal," Lasorda said. "That's what happened to this young man 
-- he's trying too hard."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUB ROOKIE DOESN'T LET CROWD 71,329 IN DENVER BOTHER 
HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Trachsel refused to let Mile High Stadium get to him. Instead, the 
rookie right-hander for the Chicago Cubs pitched his first major league 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel, a first-round draft choice in 1992 from Long Beach State, yielded 
seven hits and the Cubs roughed up David Nied in the first inning Sunday and 
beat the Colorado Rockies, 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't intimidated by this park. You can't let it get to you," Trachsel 
said. "I didn't let it get to me and went out and pitched my game." 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel (2-1), making his seventh career start, struck out four and walked 
four before 71,329, the seventh-largest crowd in the Rockies' history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to come out in the first inning to remind him he had to throw strikes 
for us to help him," Cub Manager Tom Trebelhorn said. "After that, he pitched 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's first five batters got hits, starting with Karl Rhodes' 416-foot 
homer into the right field bleachers. The Cubs, who finished with a season-high 
16 hits, scored four runs in the first, getting a run-scoring single from 
Derrick May, an run-scoring double from Sammy Sosa and a run-scoring groundout 
from Shawon Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hearing the people behind home plate asking if I'd hit another home 
run," said Rhodes, who hit three on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a line-drive hitter who happened to get the ball up into the wind today 
and hit it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Nied (2-2) gave up eight runs and eight hits in 2 2/3 innings, his shortest 
outing of the season. He walked four and struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Galarraga drove in a run with a groundout in the bottom of the first, 
but Chicago made the score 8-1 in the third on Trachsel's RBI single, Rhodes' 
run-scoring double and Ryne Sandberg's two-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 6, Philadelphia 5 -- Andy Benes stopped his nine-game losing streak, 
Tony Gwynn tied a club record with his eighth consecutive hit and Phil Plantier 
drove in three runs with a homer and double at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Benes (1-4) won for the first time since last Sept. 1 against Florida, giving 
up five runs -- four earned -- and six hits in 7 1/3 innings. He struck out six 
and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn, who had five hits in five at-bats Saturday, was hit below the right 
knee on the first pitch by Curt Schilling (0-3). The two exchanged words and 
Schilling received a warning from plate umpire Bob Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all stemmed from last night. When I was on second base in the fourth 
inning, Ben Rivera thought I was giving signs to the hitter," Gwynn said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn said he tried to convince Rivera and catcher Darren Daulton he wasn't 
stealing signs. "I can't even read their signs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn singled in the third and fourth before hitting into a double play in the 
sixth and singling in the eighth. The eight consecutive hits tied the record 
set by Dave Winfield in 1979. Gwynn also tied a team record -- held by himself 
and Bip Roberts -- by reaching base nine consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, which held on after taking a 6-0 lead, completed its first 
three-game sweep since last Aug. 23-25 against St. Louis.

NFL DRAFT; TWO OF TOP 10 PICKS FROM L.A.; NFL DRAFT: PATRIOTS SELECT USC'S 
MCGINEST NO. 4; CARDINALS MAKE UCLA'S MILLER NO. 10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The key defensive players at USC and UCLA obviously impressed NFL scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie McGinest, the big, strong Trojan defensive end, was the fourth player 
chosen in the draft, by the New England Patriots, and Miller, the Bruins' big, 
quick junior linebacker, was picked by Arizona 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, another Southland star, wide receiver Johnny Morton of USC, also 
was drafted in the first round. Morton, picked by the Detroit Lions, was the 
21st choice. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinest and Miller said they were still in shock shortly after being selected 
in early rounds Sunday, whereas Morton thought maybe it was the happiest moment 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't expect to go so high," McGinest said. "You can't believe how 
happy I am and how exciting this is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only think that the scouts appreciated how hard I worked since the 
season ended. It made me realize that I did the right thing when I went back to 
USC for my final year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't eat last night or this morning. The suspense was just too much. 
Now, I'm hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 Patriot Coach Bill Parcells said he received numerous offers for the No. 4 
pick, but said McGinest was better than any offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have taken a bit to take us out of this spot," Parcells said. "We 
will use him as an outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie was a guy generating tremendous interest around the league. All this 
stuff comes out in the wash. We'll find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller came out a year early and it paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he said with a laugh, "it means instant riches. I didn't expect to be 
picked this high, but it sure was exciting to hear my name called." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller received the news at a private party in Hollywood held by his agents, 
Harold Daniels and Josh Luchs of Professional Sports Incorporated. The 
gathering roared its approval at the announcement. A few seconds later tears 
streamed down Miller's face as he received a big hug from his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand was Miller's UCLA teammate, wide receiver J.J. Stokes. Both are 
juniors, but while Miller opted for the draft, Stokes, who most certainly would 
have been drafted early, elected to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting," Stokes said. "And I'm happy for Jamir. But I know I made 
the right move for me. My turn will come next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas, which had the 28th pick in the first round, had hoped to get Miller, 
even sending a representative to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel especially good to have someone like Buddy Ryan (the 
Cardinals' head coach) feel that I'm that good," Miller said. "I know I'll fit 
into his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started thinking about playing pro football when I was a senior at El 
Cerrito. From then on I hoped someday to be in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also feel someone was looking after me, after those two incidents last 
year," added Miller, 20, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors for possession of a 
loaded firearm in public and for receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan has already named Miller to his starting lineup at right linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're giving Jamir the starting job. It's up to him to lose it," Ryan said. 
"We looked at him against USC last year and the whole game was a highlight 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 There will still be a USC connection for Morton, the sure-handed wide 
receiver. The Lions' coach, Wayne Fontes, was an assistant under John Robinson 
during the Trojan coach's first tenure at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA nose guard Bruce Walker, 6-foot-4 and 290, went in the second round. He 
was chosen by Philadelphia, the 37th player picked. Chuck Levy, the former 
Arizona quarterback from Lynwood High, was picked 38th by the Arizona Cardinal. 
Jason Sehorn, a USC defensive back, was taken 59th by the New York Giants and 
Vaughan Parker, a UCLA guard, was selected 64th by the San Diego Chargers.

NFL DRAFT; AFTER WHIRLWIND TRIP, HARPER STAYS IN DALLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas wide receiver Alvin Harper ran the gamut this week -- from Pittsburgh 
to Cleveland to the Rams and back to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 And a quick trip to Kinko's along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper watched the Rams' draft-day saga play out from his in-laws' home Sunday 
in Washington, D.C., making quick trips to a local copy center to fax signed 
contracts to the Cowboys, who were trying to pull off a trade for the Rams' 
fifth, and later, seventh, overall picks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This last week has been like a roller-coaster," Harper said. "One minute, 
you're ready to leave. The next minute, you're staying." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Harper, a restricted free agent, is staying in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of agent Jimmy Sexton, Harper came to terms with the Rams -- a 
three-year deal worth $5.3 million on Sunday morning. But the trade with Dallas 
fell through when New England took USC linebacker Willie McGinest, whom the 
Cowboys coveted, with the fourth overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had agreed on the money," said John Shaw, Ram executive vice president. 
"But when McGinest went on the board, the deal was aborted." 
</P>
<P>
 Another deal for Harper fell through after the Rams traded their fifth pick 
for Indianapolis' seventh. The Rams traded down for San Francisco's 15th pick, 
which they used for Auburn offensive tackle Wayne Gandy. 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, the Rams have to settle for one of Sexton's other clients -- 
Memphis State wide receiver Isaac Bruce, whom they drafted with the fifth pick 
in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it, maybe this trade wasn't meant to be," Harper said. 
"Things happen for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Jerry Jones wants to trade me next week, I will be happy to go. If he 
keeps me, I will play to the best of my abilities and try to get to another 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's draft ended a busy seven days for Harper, who began the week 
negotiating a contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday morning, Harper figured he was headed to Cleveland for the 
Browns' ninth overall draft pick. Jones nixed that deal later in the day and 
began negotiating with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexton said Wednesday that Harper was reluctant to play on the West Coast. But 
Harper changed his mind after the Rams increased their offer from $4.8 million 
to $5.3 million for three years.

BORBOA TO DEFEND SUPER-FLYWEIGHT TITLE TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fourth defense of his International Boxing Federation super-flyweight 
title, Julio Cesar Borboa says, will be strange. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight at the Forum, Borboa (21-4, 19 knockouts) will fight Jorge Luis Roman, 
the younger brother of Borboa's idol, Gilberto Roman, a two-time world champion 
who died in a car accident three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know fighting his brother, it's going to be weird, especially early on," 
Borboa said through a translator. "But a fight's a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Borboa, one of six current Mexican-born world champions, won his title in a 
surprise 12th-round knockout over Robert Quiroga in January of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman (17-9-2, 8 KOs) earned this title shot by upsetting No. 1-ranked Scotty 
Olson in a 10-round decision Feb. 19 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card, junior-lightweight Carlos (Famous) Hernandez (15-0-1, 8 KOs) 
will fight Narciso Valenzuela (35-14-2, 23 KOs) in a 10-round bout. TIM

WORLD CUP ORGANIZERS QUIETLY STAGE EARLY SALE OF REMAINING SINGLE TICKETS 
</P>

From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although U.S. World Cup soccer officials have said remaining tickets would not 
be sold before May 1, organizers began staging a four-day sale Sunday that 
apparently is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Single tickets for most Cup games went on sale by telephone at (800) 
769-1994.A maximum of 10 tickets per game can be bought by each person. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a limited number of people, including World Cup staff members, were 
informed of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically the people who got shut out on the random selection sale 
(last year) and the soccer family (who got early access)," said Alan 
Rothenberg, the organizing committee chairman and president of the United 
States Soccer Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave an internal offering, as we had done the last time, too. We felt that 
those people have been devoting their life to the cause."

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; TO SOME, EXPANSION DOESN'T ADD UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposal by FIFA President Joao Havelange of Brazil to increase the number 
of teams in the 1998 World Cup in France from 24 to 32 has met with predictably 
mixed reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, put forward more to help Havelange win reelection than for any 
practical purpose, has yet to be submitted to FIFA's executive committee for 
approval, but already is being both praised and criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, there would be eight groups of four teams in the finals, 
with the top two teams in each group advancing to the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Former French star and national team coach Michel Platini, now joint president 
of the 1998 World Cup organizing committee, is in favor of the larger field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say that we were a little bit surprised by the statement made by 
Havelange because we did not talk about it before," Platini said. "But we are 
in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this project turns into something real, this would be a good thing for us 
because we would host the biggest sports event in the last part of the 
century." 
</P>
<P>
 But Colombia's national team coach, Francisco Maturana, has blasted the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This idea might produce some economic benefits," he said, "but the game will 
not benefit if it has 32 teams instead of 24. This would make the competition 
too long for the players to endure." 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to see the logic in Maturana's argument because qualifying 
teams would still play the same number of matches -- seven if they advanced to 
the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Berti Vogts, coach of reigning world champion Germany, has pointed 
to a more serious flaw in the plan by asking where the additional eight teams 
will come from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in favor as long as the European teams do not lose out because of it," 
Vogts said. "It would have to be done proportionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways it could be fairer (because) only the top two teams would 
qualify for the second round rather than as at the moment when third-place 
teams can also go through. That is cleaner in sporting terms." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, however, is in finding 32 teams worthy of being in the 
tournament. It is difficult enough to find 24 that genuinely deserve to take 
part -- based on their strength in international competition and the quality of 
their domestic leagues. Finding 32 would be almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who disagree need only try to name the 32 teams they believe should take 
part. 
</P>

 While most of the soccer world's attention is focused on this summer's World 
Cup in the United States, there are those who are looking ahead to another 
world championship set to take place in Sweden next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. women's national team is the defending world champion, having won 
that honor in China in 1991. Now, Coach Anson Dorrance's squad is beginning the 
quest to defend its title at the second FIFA Women's World Championship in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Already this year, the U.S. women's team has competed in the first Algarve Cup 
in Portugal, where it lost, 1-0, to Norway in the championship game after 
defeating Portugal, 5-0, and Sweden, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Americans swept through a Caribbean tour, defeating 
Trinidad and Tobago, 3-1, and Canada twice, 4-1, and, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Akers-Stahl, the world's best women's player, scored three goals 
during the Caribbean tour, bringing her total for the U.S. national team to 63 
in as many international matches. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pity she's not eligible for this summer's tournament. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the most memorable stories of the 1990 World Cup in Italy was the rise 
from obscurity to worldwide fame of Sicily's Salvatore (Toto) Schillaci, whose 
wild eyes and knack for scoring clutch goals made him a media star.  
</P>
<P>
 Schillaci's six goals in Italia '90 helped Italy finish third and won him the 
golden boot as the World Cup's leading scorer. Now, his boots are going 
elsewhere.

 Schillaci has decided to leave his Italian club, Juventus, and has signed a 
two-year, $3-million contract to play for Jubilo Iwata of Shizuola in Japan's 
fast-rising J-League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is too important in Italy," Schillaci said. "I needed a change and I'd 
have been mad to refuse their offer. If I like it there, I might stay longer, 
but my dream is to finish my career with my home town club, Palermo."

 Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA general secretary, perhaps best remembered in the 
United States for playing the foil to comedian Robin Williams during last 
December's World Cup Draw in Las Vegas, will step down in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will stop being general secretary in 1998, that's definite," Blatter said. 
"By then, I will have been 16 years in the post and 23 years in FIFA. That will 
be enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter, 58, said he would like to remain active in the sport, possibly as a 
consultant. He also said the proposal for a 32-team World Cup starting in 1998 
needs more thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are already a lot of problems in staging a tournament with 24 
countries," he said. "With 32 teams, the World Cup would have difficulties from 
a logistical point of view and there would be more demands on the technical 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of the World Cup itself would not suffer with 32 teams, but it 
would impose restrictions on the number of possible organizers. There will be 
less possibilities, especially for those continents who are currently 
applauding the move." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, smaller countries incapable of staging a 32-team tournament 
can forget about playing host to the World Cup -- unless an idea being 
whispered in FIFA's corridors gains ground: The idea of two neighboring nations 
jointly playing host to the finals.

 China, tired of being in the shadow of such soccer rivals as Japan and South 
Korea, has launched its first professional league in the hope that it will 
raise the standard of the Chinese players and help the country qualify for a 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aim, according to the plan, is to enter the World Cup by the end of this 
century," said Wang Junsheng, China Football Assn. chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, 12-team league is sponsored by an American cigarette company, with 
some clubs also receiving financial support from local companies. Each team is 
allowed to sign up to five foreign players, but can only play three in a match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are reforming our soccer by moving to a market system with the aim of 
raising standards and reaching world level as soon as possible," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is by far the most popular sport in China, and Chinese television 
regularly shows English, German and Italian league games in addition to local 
matches.

 These are heady days for Silvio Berlusconi, owner and chairman of AC Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 First, his newly formed political party swept to victory in the recent Italian 
national elections, leaving Berlusconi very likely to become the next prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Milan has become the first Italian club in more than 45 years to win 
three consecutive league championships and also has reached the semifinals of 
the European Cup.

WORK, TALENT PUT OETTINGER ON EASY STREET; PREPS: BY EXPLORING ALL AVENUES, 
FOOTHILL HIGH TRACK STAR HAS MAINTAINED PLENTY OF OPTIONS IN LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 Don't think for one minute Tara Oettinger has placed all her eggs in one 
basket. In fact, she could probably use a few more baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 She's an accomplished pianist, an outstanding student (4.4 grade-point average 
on a 4.0 scale), and one of the county's finest all-around track and field 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger, a junior at Foothill High, has found the roads to success pretty 
easy, no matter where they've taken her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She definitely has her priorities straightened out," said Jerry Whitaker, 
Foothill track and field coach. "She's a pretty academic kid and is very 
bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Added the Knights' long jump coach, Les Berman: "I don't know whether it's her 
intelligence or not, but she learns awfully quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Most athletes who dominate a sport the way Oettinger does usually live and 
breathe it. Not Oettinger, who aspires to a career in pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like track a lot, but I don't know if I will do it in college," said 
Oettinger. "I don't want anything to get in the way of me becoming a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger has already made strides toward her goal, serving as a nurse's 
assistant for four hours every Sunday afternoon at Western Medical Center in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a shame for her not to compete in college, because she is just 
blossoming on the track and will only get better," Whitaker said of his star 
pupil, who has expressed an interest in staying in California to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying close to home has been a comfort Oettinger has enjoyed recently, as 
track and field has given the 5-foot-8 speedster an opportunity to travel 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger's talents helped land her a spot as a sprinter and jumper last 
summer in the Maccabia Games in Israel, where she joined current Foothill 
teammate Ethan Taub in representing the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After third-place finishes in the 100- and 200-meter races, Oettinger ran legs 
on the 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams, which finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger, the defending Century League long-jump champion and Southern 
Section finalist, also landed a then-personal best in the event, leaping 18-6 
for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ethan had done some things athletically before then," Whitaker said. "But 
that trip just did wonders for Tara's confidence. She got couple of medals and 
came back really fired up about track." 
</P>
<P>
 A training regimen of plyometrics with boxes (jumping over or upon boxes of 
various heights) and bounding has helped make the junior a legitimate contender 
for the State long jump title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really scared of the boxes at first," Oettinger said, "but it is really 
helping me get stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Her newfound strength has helped Oettinger put together an active streak of 
four consecutive weeks jumping in excess of 18 feet, including rounding up an 
Orange County Championships title, an undefeated league dual-meet season and a 
fourth-place finish in the Arcadia Invitational. The latter produced a mark of 
18-11 3/4, a personal best and the eighth-best prep mark in the nation at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for someone who just got serious about jumping last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've improved a lot with my consistency," said Oettinger, who holds the 
county's ninth-best mark. "I just listen to Les because I know it will be 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've really enjoyed working with her," said Berman, an ex-national team coach 
who also headed the Long Beach State program. "I would think before she 
graduates that she will be a 20-footer." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Gourdine of El Toro set the county's top mark with a jump of 19-9 in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prowess in the long jump is bringing her the greatest accolades this 
season, Oettinger hopes to make her mark on the track, too. 
</P>
<P>
 She has the county's best time this season in the 100 (11.9 seconds) and 200 
meters (24.8), but everybody seems to believe she can do better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tara has a fairly poor start, which tends to limit her in the 100," Whitaker 
said. "But her speed can more than make up for that in the 200." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker said Oettinger's future might lie in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it to State in the 200," she said. "But I would really have to 
get my time down."

 SASSER SURGES: A dark-horse out of the gate, Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) is 
showing surprising strength in the race for Senate Democratic leader and may 
have overtaken the early front-runner, Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). Although the 
election to succeed retiring Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
is months away, both candidates have been campaigning briskly for what is 
considered the second most powerful post in Washington. . . . Insiders describe 
Sasser's surge as a backlash against the Senate's baby boomers, with lots of 
senior lawmakers believing that Daschle, 46, is too young for the job. Sasser, 
57, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is regarded by some as more 
seasoned -- a shrewd, tough partisan. "There's a perception that Daschle would 
be eaten alive in a duel with (Senate Minority Leader) Bob Dole" (R-Kan.), said 
a Sasser backer. But Daschle, a Mitchell protege, is an energetic achiever 
whose moderate-to-liberal views, like Sasser's, are in the Democratic 
mainstream. . . . A possible plus for Sasser: He and President Clinton both 
have the same best friend in the Senate: David Pryor of Arkansas.

 SEISMIC SHIFT: As recently as two years ago, Republicans had no chance of 
winning a large batch of House seats simply because they did not field a 
candidate. In contrast, Democrats contested nearly every race. Now that picture 
is changing dramatically -- and GOP strategists are predicting that, as early 
as 1996, it could help the party seize control of the House for the first time 
in five decades. . . . Of the first 237 House districts where filings are 
complete for this year's elections, the Republicans have candidates in 233 and 
the Democrats in only 223. "This is a historic change," trumpets Rep. Bill 
Paxon (R-N.Y.), head of the House GOP campaign committee. "Republicans left 61 
seats unchallenged in 1988, 46 in 1990 and 17 in 1992." . . . Why are 
Republicans becoming more competitive? "Reapportionment has helped change the 
landscape," Paxon said. The 1990 census shifted substantially more House seats 
to the Sun Belt and suburbs, two GOP growth areas. Another factor is Voting 
Rights Act redistricting, which by lumping blacks in one district made 
neighboring districts more Republican.

 SEEKING COMMON GROUND: At a time when Louis Farrakhan's hyper-inflated 
rhetoric has heightened tensions between blacks and Jews -- the two most 
reliable members of the Democratic coalition -- one Jewish organization has 
taken a step that could help smooth troubled waters. The National Jewish 
Democratic Council, a 5,000-member group that assists Democratic campaigns at 
the grass roots, is voicing "strong opposition" to the Clinton Administration's 
policy of rejecting political asylum to thousands of Haitian refugees. The 
policy is a sore point with many African American leaders but one on which 
Jewish groups have not previously taken a position. "I find the whole idea of 
sending people back to Haiti carte blanche outrageous. It has nothing to do 
with anything this country was founded on," said Steve Gutow, the council's 
executive director. . . . Gutow said he believes that the black and Jewish 
communities "share a large common agenda in the way we vote," but he 
acknowledged that Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, has been 
disruptive. "His need to constantly berate people on the basis of religion and 
skin color is nauseating. But the two communities are much more in sync than 
some people think." PAUL HOUSTON and ROBERT SHOGAN

SHE'S THE SECRETARY GENERAL; PROFILE: LESLIE NOEL USES DIPLOMATIC SKILL AND A 
SIXTH SENSE IN THE SERVICE OF HER BOSS, NEWPORT BEACH DEVELOPER DONALD M. KOLL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The caller could be Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, golfing 
legend Jack Nicklaus -- or an office-supply salesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Noel, executive secretary for Newport Beach developer Donald M. Koll, 
never knows who will be on the line when she answers the phone. And part of her 
job is to put them at ease, whoever they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to treat the copier sales guy the same way I treat the president of 
Mexico, with respect," said Noel, 31. "They will soon forgot who I am, but they 
won't forget how they were treated by the Koll Co." 
</P>
<P>
 Her boss is chairman of a company that builds, leases and manages some of 
Orange County's top business centers and is now developing luxury golfing 
resorts and commercial sites in Mexico. That puts Noel in the very midst of the 
international real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Don Koll is so well-known, Noel said, people around the world try to 
phone him directly. A big part of her job, she said, is to refer callers with 
routine requests to staff members at lower levels -- and to do it 
diplomatically so that they do not feel that they are getting the brushoff. 
</P>
<P>
 She often advises people to write letters to Koll, she said. "He is so 
hands-on with his business, he reads all his mail." 
</P>
<P>
 She also uses tact to interrupt Koll during conferences if, for example, he is 
late for another appointment. "I will walk in and slip him a note or try to do 
it very discreetly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she has been with Koll for only a year, she confesses to having 
developed a sixth sense for her boss's work pace and style. And she has learned 
how to use her diplomatic skills with him too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will even tell him, 'Don, I made an appointment with your barber,' and he 
will say, 'Oh, do I need a haircut?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The key to success in her job, Noel said, is to stay focused on the job every 
minute and to practice self-discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Lane, the Koll Co. senior vice president who hired Noel after 
interviewing 15 candidates, says self-confidence and charm landed her the job 
even though some applicants had more secretarial experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so refreshing when I interviewed Leslie," Lane said. "There was a 
freshness and excitement. . . . It truly was a spark."

O.C. ENTERPRISE: METTLE REFINERS; MANAGEMENT: WHEN NEW OWNERS TOOK OVER FABCON, 
THEY ASKED WORKERS HOW TO TURN THE COMPANY AROUND. RESULTS WERE STARTLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're not supposed to be able to do what the team at Fabrication Concepts 
Corp. is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional wisdom is that ordinary manufacturing operations can't thrive 
in high-tech, pricey Orange County. But sheet-metal fabricator Fabrication 
Concepts, which does business as Fabcon, is entering its 17th year here and has 
no plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's story is one of a remarkable recovery brought about by fairly 
unremarkable means: The most radical management technique is to ask the 
employees routinely how they think things could be done better. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabcon was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in 1989 when brothers Bert and 
Don Ohlig acquired it as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, sales and employment have more than tripled. The company has 
bought and moved into its own 33,000-square-foot building in Irvine, and annual 
profit margins of 4% to 6% have risen from what once was a deep pool of red 
ink. All of that has happened during one of Southern California's worst and 
longest recessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohligs didn't revive Fabcon by pumping in millions of dollars or replacing 
the work force. Instead, Bert Ohlig said, they brought an antiquated 
front-office operation up to state-of-the-art standards and then let the 
production people have more say in how they did their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer system was so old and overloaded, they were getting financial 
statements six months after the fact. They were operating blind," Don Ohlig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers replaced the entire system with new computers and software -- and 
then asked the employees and managers what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the suggestions were simple. Employees in the packaging department, 
for example, asked for better lighting so they could spot flaws and improve the 
quality of the products they shipped. (Fabcon now boasts that fewer than 0.5% 
of its products are returned for quality reasons. The industry norm is 3%.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some were more complicated, such as developing a 24-hour electronic bulletin 
board that allows customers to download into Fabcon's system computer drawings 
of the parts they need. Using those drawings, Fabcon can do same-day cost 
estimates and ship finished parts in as little as three days -- cutting 
processing time by 25% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabcon is what once was called a job shop. Rather than make millions of the 
same part for one client, it specializes in small runs -- anything from a 
single prototype to 10,000 units. Most of its orders are for components used in 
computers, telecommunications equipment and industrial electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohligs' introduction to Fabcon came in the 1980s when the company, then 
called Fab Tek, started suppling a critical polished-metal reflector for some 
of the offset printing camera lights manufactured by Olec Corp., an Irvine 
graphic arts equipment business owned by the Ohlig family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their work was excellent, the best we'd seen," Bert Ohlig recalled. "They had 
a degree of precision we couldn't get anywhere else, and they were very 
cooperative and informative in dealing with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer-supplier relationship lasted for years, and the quality of Fab Tek's 
parts never varied. But the company's financial condition did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purchasing agent (at Olec) came in one day and told us that Fab Tek was 
in deep trouble," Bert Ohlig said. The sheet-metal company's founders had 
little understanding of the business end of the operation. Though its revenue 
was about $2 million for 1987, the company was hobbled by loan repayments at 
high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't enough left to buy material or make payments on the machinery," 
Don Ohlig said. Seeing an opportunity, the brothers spoke with Fab Tek's 
owners, customers and lenders. The consensus, Bert Ohlig said, "that the 
company had a lot of promise but needed some new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohligs made an offer for the company as an independent venture separate 
from Olec Corp. Their bid was accepted, and in February, 1989, they paid 
$10,000 cash and assumed more than $750,000 in liabilities to acquire Fab Tek, 
which they promptly renamed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohligs knew from the start that their expertise was in business, not 
production, so they kept most of the company's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees "trusted us and believed in us," said Administrative Manager 
Elizabeth Michaels. "Before, the employees didn't get a feeling that management 
had the right attitude. Now we all feel like part of a team." OC Enterprise:

 OWNERS REFLECT 
</P>
<P>
 How did you get started? We bought the company in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did you get financing? Most of it was borrowed through material 
suppliers, equipment companies and banks. We used our own homes as collateral 
for the bank financing. 
</P>
<P>
 What was: 
</P>
<P>
 * Your biggest challenge? Handling the growing pains. We started with 28 
employees and now have 92. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your biggest mistake? Underestimating how long it would take to implement 
change. This includes the time to understand the objectives, evaluating 
alternatives, purchasing times, training, implementation and feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 * The best advice you received? To go to the local universities for 
assistance. We did, and they provided classes for employees at our facilities. 
They also provided some interns, who helped us with marketing. One designed our 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most important lesson you learned? There are two. We learned the value 
of delegating. Running two companies makes it difficult to stay on top of 
everything that is going on. We were delighted to see the employees taking the 
bull by the horns, making decisions and following through. And we learned to 
always keep our customers' needs in mind as we were going through the changes. 
Your service must remain at the highest level even though you are preoccupied 
with other things. 
</P>
<P>
 What advice would you give to someone starting a business in this field? You 
must combine craftsmanship . . . with world-class business techniques. You 
can't run a successful business with any part of the puzzle missing.

OPENING UP FOR BUSINESS; KOREATOWN LOOKS TO OTHER ETHNICITIES FOR POST-RIOT 
PATRONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From his second-floor office in a Western Avenue mini-mall, Bong W. Kim looked 
sadly at the Koreatown businesses' half-empty parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parking lot is occupied by tenants, not customers," said Kim, president 
of Han Mi Immigration Corp., a notary public service catering to immigrants. 
"Business is almost dead now." 
</P>
<P>
 To Kim and many other Koreatown merchants, the number of parked cars signifies 
a decline in the once-thriving business district since the Los Angeles riots 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean American business owners suffered an estimated $400 million in damages 
during the riots, and Koreatown -- home to many of those businesses and a 
symbol of Korean business success -- was a particular target of the looting and 
arson that followed the not-guilty verdicts in the first Rodney G. King beating 
trial. Total riot damage was estimated at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years after the riots, damaged or destroyed buildings have been 
rebuilt or repaired in Koreatown at a faster pace than in other heavily damaged 
areas of the city (82% in Koreatown versus 50% citywide). But many of the 
refurbished buildings are empty, and many others house businesses coping with 
drastically reduced sales since the riots, according to Koreatown merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to revitalize Koreatown business have been crippled by a sluggish 
California economy, a rising crime rate in Koreatown and surrounding 
neighborhoods, a general fear of the area that developed after the civil unrest 
among previously dependable customers and even the Northridge earthquake, 
according to the area's merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dun & Bradstreet study last year of Koreatown and South-Central Los Angeles 
found that 40% of businesses damaged during the riots shut down permanently 
within six months of the riots. Major problems were the lack of insurance to 
cover damages and the inability to get loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of many of the Koreatown businesses that managed to stay open said 
revenues are down as much as 50% from pre-riot levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, 68, said he is barely surviving. After working in the immigration 
business for over 40 years, he said he decided to set up his own company seven 
years ago to help Korean immigrants with their naturalization paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The business was doing well before the riots, but it dipped 50% immediately 
after the violence, he said. Business has improved only minimally in the 
intervening two years, Kim said, estimating that he now has about 60% of the 
business that he had before the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy right now," Kim said. The business is bringing in only enough 
income for him to keep going on a month-to-month basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Los Angeles area economy generally improves, Koreatown merchants 
are confronted with another problem: crime. Although reported crime is down 
about 10% from last year, Police Department statistics show that the crime rate 
in Koreatown and neighboring communities is still relatively high compared to 
citywide averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners in the area say robberies -- averaging one a day -- and drug 
trafficking are the most prevalent problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Y. Kim, owner of Pola Cosmetics, which sells imported cosmetics, said 
he stands outside his Olympic Boulevard store each day, ready to walk customers 
-- mainly women -- to and from their cars because "it's not safe to walk during 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The violence of the riots, added to the fear of crime, caused many Korean 
Americans to move out of the Koreatown area to safer neighborhoods, according 
to business owners in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the major customer base for Koreatown merchants, but memories of the 
violent riots has made many Korean Americans who moved reluctant to come back 
into the neighborhood to shop or seek services, Koreatown merchants said. 
</P>
<P>
 Champ Chang Pyon, president of Eun Sung U.S.A. International, a distributor of 
Christian-sermon tape recordings on Western Avenue, recalled his fears as he 
watched a building across from his office burn during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more afraid to come to Koreatown to shop, especially when 
Koreatown was a target during the riot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides improved crime statistics and a stronger economy, officials of the 
Korean American Chamber of Commerce said the key to long-term business 
improvement in Koreatown is to attract customers from outside the Korean 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, a major problem in broadening the customer base has been that many 
Koreatown merchants speak little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disadvantage of depending on the Korean community was shown after the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. The large number of Korean Americans who 
suffered serious earthquake damage are not heading to Koreatown to shop as 
much, merchants said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Koreans live in Northridge, (and) they don't shop as much now," said 
H.K. Kim, owner of Manna Cake and Bakery in the same Western Avenue mini-mall 
as Bong W. Kim's shop. About 20,000 Korean Americans live in the Northridge 
area, according to Edward Chang, an assistant professor of ethnic studies at 
the University of California, Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean American Chamber of Commerce is leading the effort to broaden 
Koreatown's patronage beyond Koreans. Some restaurants in Koreatown have hired 
employees who are fluent in English to appeal to people from a variety of 
ethnic backgrounds who like Korean food, according to Harrison Kim, the 
chamber's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Other shopkeepers are adding English translations to their signs to help 
market their services to non-Koreans, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time goes on, businesses are increasingly spreading their market to the 
non-Korean market as well," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase business activity, the chamber also plans to promote Koreatown as 
a tourist attraction. Currently, most tourists who visit Koreatown are from 
South Korea. But the hope is that Koreatown will eventually attract the variety 
and volume of tourists now seen in Chinatown and Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles is also making an effort to reduce crime and improve 
housing in Koreatown through the Community Redevelopment Agency. The agency is 
working on a plan to improve residential development in Koreatown and the 
neighboring Wilshire Center area, said Cooke Sunoo, a CRA project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the residential area is more stable, then businesses are more willing to 
invest in the area," Sunoo said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, community representatives in Koreatown were some of the first 
to request and receive aid from the city council to redevelop the area, Sunoo 
said.

 Japan may be going through rough times lately with its political and economic 
turmoil, but there is some favorable news on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Word has it that Tokyo will be spared in the TriStar Pictures "Godzilla" 
remake now being developed at the Culver City-based studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the script now being written calls for two U.S. cities -- San 
Francisco and New York -- to suffer from the prehistoric lizard's rampages. 
Back in 1956, Tokyo was nearly destroyed in the original "Godzilla -- King of 
the Monsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Did the fact that TriStar parent Sony Corp. is based in Tokyo have anything to 
do with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the remake say no. Rather, they say, the film from the 
start has always been envisioned as an American Godzilla. Long Way From Amway 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a lot of hype over "multilevel" marketing, a sales approach 
that relies on word of mouth and distribution by individuals to sell products 
ranging from cleaners to, in many cases, strange health and cosmetic products. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes a "definitive guide" to multilevel marketing firms and products 
published by the Summit Group in Fort Worth. Among the products listed is a 
"Super Blue Green Algae" that is "harvested from the pristine Upper Klamath 
Lake in the Cascade mountains of south central Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
 An herbal food company in Torrance sells products to "maintain the natural 
synergistic balance" of the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, endocrine and 
immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is a Utah company selling straws to help people stop smoking, find 
quick energy and lose weight. Fine Tuning Needed

<P>
 Last week, Kidder, Peabody & Co. announced it had fired the head of its 
government bond trading unit for "phantom" trades that boosted profits by $350 
million. It also fired an interest-rate swaps trader for hiding losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A look back at Kidder's 1990 annual report reveals a statement from Chairman 
Michael A. Carpenter assuring investors that systems were being put in place to 
prevent ethical lapses at Kidder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have responded to the public's concerns about the securities industry with 
what we believe is the industry's most far-reaching program of training, 
monitoring and controls to ensure ethical management of our business," he said.

<P>
 For anyone who missed the recent "Whole Life Expo" at the Los Angeles 
Convention Center, here were a few of the entrepreneurial activities 
highlighted: 
</P>
<P>
 * A business offering "intuitive counseling phone lines" as an alternative to 
psychic hot lines that has the effect of "empowering you to take the next step 
in your growth." 
</P>
<P>
 * A presentation on "UFOs: Earth's Cosmic Watergate." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Taos, N.M., company that sells "straw bale" housing.

NEW QUESTIONS FOLLOW DEAL WITH MCDONNELL; DEFENSE: CRITICS SAY A $237-MILLION 
PENTAGON SETTLEMENT OVER THE C-17 IS UNFAIR TO TAXPAYERS. SOME SAY THE PACT WAS 
NOT REACHED LEGALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a year after the Pentagon rebuked three Air Force generals for secretly 
bailing out McDonnell Douglas Corp., new evidence is prompting questions about 
whether the firm is again receiving unusual financial assistance from the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) has charged that the Pentagon's recent 
settlement with the firm on its troubled C-17 cargo jet program was a 
"back-door bailout operation" and said the Pentagon may even lack legal 
authority to consummate the multimillion-dollar deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The company contends the agreement is proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no bailout," McDonnell spokesman Larry McCracken said. "There were 
compromises made by everyone. It is a tough settlement, but you have to 
negotiate any settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Grassley bases his charges on two key documents that show senior Pentagon 
officials agreed to pay $237 million to McDonnell, mainly to cover a claim that 
had already been ruled legally invalid only a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire settlement was branded a "lousy deal" for taxpayers by General 
Accounting Office analysts last week, but the existence of the documents raise 
added questions about whether the settlement was agreed to legally. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell, saying the government was at fault for many of the plane's 
problems, had filed $450 million in claims and was preparing to file for 
another $1.25 billion, McCracken noted. The $237-million settlement was not 
tied to any specific item or claim, according to McCracken and a Pentagon 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a reasonable settlement in the best interests of taxpayers," the 
Pentagon spokesman said. "We are making a comprehensive business settlement on 
a large group of claims." 
</P>
<P>
 The complex issue is reminiscent of the political furor that erupted in 1993 
when former Defense Secretary Les Aspin fired an Air Force general and 
reprimanded two others for their involvement in a $500-million plan to bail out 
McDonnell Douglas, which is building the C-17 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The new documents cited by Grassley were unearthed by the GAO, the 
investigative arm of Congress, only in the past two weeks in their examination 
of the huge C-17 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch, a panel of exerts 
recommended a comprehensive program to put C-17 production back on track. 
McDonnell is expected to lose $1.4 billion on the program and the plane has 
been unable to meet the Air Force's performance requirements, forcing the 
service to downgrade its specifications several times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deutch plan was announced Dec. 15. It included paying McDonnell $234 
million to settle a claim involving production of the C-17 wing and $3 million 
to settle several smaller claims, according to internal working papers of the 
Deutch panel. Grassley's staff says the documents refute the Pentagon's 
explanation that the payment was for no specific claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex saga began in July, 1993, when McDonnell Douglas claimed that 
Congress had used political pressure in the 1980s to spread some of the 
financial benefits of the C-17 program beyond California. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell claimed that the Air Force, bowing to congressional demands, leaned 
on the company to transfer production of the C-17 wing from Long Beach in 
violation of the contract. After considering various bids, McDonnell agreed to 
move the wing production to Lockheed Corp.'s plant in Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockheed experienced technical problems, a huge cost overrun and a nasty 
private dispute with McDonnell. Ultimately, McDonnell fired Lockheed as a 
subcontractor and transferred wing production back to Long Beach, but said the 
mess had cost $234 million. It blamed the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force considered McDonnell's claim for four months and concluded that 
it had no merit. The decision was made by James C. David, a contracting officer 
for the Air Force who had sole legal authority to make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 David's decision, a copy of which was provided to The Times, ruled that the 
Air Force had never forced McDonnell to move wing production to Lockheed. But 
even more important, David found that McDonnell originally claimed that the 
move would save $76.5 million, which the Air Force allowed McDonnell to keep in 
exchange for releasing the government from any future claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let them pocket $76.5 million so they couldn't later try to up the price 
on us," one Air Force critic said. "And now Deutch is going to pay them another 
$234 million on the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But McCracken, the McDonnell spokesman, said it wasn't surprising that an Air 
Force official would reject a claim against the service. He said the firm filed 
an appeal of the decision with the department's Board of Contract Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Deutch's working group, which included retired aerospace industry 
executives, senior military officers and defense officials, ruled that the wing 
claim seemed reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "After analysis and discussion, the senior level review group decided the 
government should pay 100% of the cost," according to an issue paper by the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Michele Mackin, a GAO senior evaluator, said Deutch's working group 
reached the decision "without any legal or financial analysis or audit." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress must now consider whether to allow the settlement. Four congressional 
committees, which will meet in secret, will consider a Pentagon request to 
"reprogram" existing funds to cover this year's portion of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rules of armed services and appropriations committees, the full 
Congress will never get a chance to vote on the action involving the nation's 
largest defense firm, according to Grassley's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more mounting evidence that the culture in the Defense Department and 
in the military stinks," said Grassley, a longtime Pentagon critic. "This all 
adds up to business as usual."

 Machine Tool Orders Rise: Orders for U.S.-made machine tools rose strongly in 
March, capping the best first quarter for the industry in more than a decade, 
the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology said. March orders totaled $346.80 
million, up 25.8% from $275.65 million in February and up from $332.10 million 
posted in March, 1993. "New capital spending forecasts by U.S. manufacturers 
should translate into a good 1994 for the industry," the association's report

G-7 OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC OVER GLOBAL GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finance officials from the world's Group of Seven richest industrial countries 
expressed optimism Sunday that the global economy can achieve faster growth 
this year despite a recent rise in long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chairman's statement summarizing the discussions, Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen said his colleagues believed that a variety of signs point to 
stronger growth with inflation remaining low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Collectively, we are more encouraged than we have been," Bentsen said. "And I 
must say, I was pleased to hear the optimism around the table." 
</P>
<P>
 British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, summarizing the five hours 
of discussions, said: "We thought, on the whole, things were very much better 
than they were 12 months ago. We were quite optimistic about the outlook." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said he was encouraged by comments from German officials that the 
recession in that country has bottomed out. Canadian Finance Minister Paul 
Martin told reporters that all countries believed the economic fundamentals are 
"very, very good" and should lead to strong global growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said the seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, 
Britain, Canada and Italy -- pledged to continue pursuing policies put in place 
last year but did not indicate that any nation was willing to come forward with 
any new commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had been pushing Japan and Germany to do more to stimulate 
their domestic economies, given the unexpectedly deep recessions in both 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Japanese and German officials have so far resisted doing more, 
arguing instead that they have done enough and doing more would risk reigniting 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The G-7 finance ministers and central bank presidents did have praise for the 
economic reform efforts put forward by Russia. Those commitments to restrain 
the government budget deficit and cut inflation led to a new $1.5-billion loan 
from the International Monetary Fund last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin and other Russian economic 
policy-makers briefed the G-7 Sunday on the status of Russia's reform program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said the Western nations welcomed Russia's commitments to reduce the 
budget deficit to no more than 7.5% of the total economy this year and to bring 
inflation down to a monthly rate of 7% by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on those commitments, Bentsen said the G-7 was urging the World Bank to 
accelerate new loans for Russia. He said the G-7 nations also stood ready to 
begin negotiations aimed at providing Russia with further debt relief in the 
form of a stretched out payment schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the group had "made it clear to the Russians that if they are to 
attract private capital, they must put in place a stable and attractive 
investment environment that respects private property." 
</P>
<P>
 On global growth, Bentsen said, "The bottom line was: We agreed the 
fundamentals are good, and we reiterated that inflation remains under control." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a message clearly aimed at nervous financial markets which over the 
past two months have pushed long-term interest rates up sharply out of fears 
that growth, especially in the United States, has accelerated to such an extent 
that inflationary pressures will start rising. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to come up with any new strategies to spur growth was not 
unexpected. Officials had predicted little new would come out of the talks, in 
part because Japan and Germany have been resisting calls from the Clinton 
Administration to do more to stimulate their own economies. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions among the Group of Seven countries were held in advance of 
today's start of the annual spring meetings of the 178-nation International 
Monetary Fund and its sister organization, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 While IMF economists are forecasting that the global economy in 1994 should 
turn in its best performance in five years, that is due primarily to 
unexpectedly strong growth in the United States.

GAS, ELECTRIC FIRMS TO HELP IRVINE SAVE ENERGY; UTILITIES: IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE 
MADE AT NO COST TO RATEPAYERS. MOVE IS SEEN AS AN ANSWER TO DEREGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a deal that could become typical as California's utilities are increasingly 
immersed in the competitive world of deregulation, Southern California Gas Co. 
and Southern California Edison Co. have signed an agreement with the city of 
Irvine to finance energy efficiency improvements for city facilities at no cost 
-- or risk -- to Irvine residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact goes far beyond existing utility programs that offer rebates to 
customers that invest in more efficient lighting or other energy-saving 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Irvine deal, the utilities will oversee and finance a broad range of 
measures, such as modifying cooling, lighting, ventilation and energy control 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the arrangement were explained here Sunday at a conference at the 
Aspen Institute arranged by John B. Phillips, executive director of the 
California Energy Coalition, a Laguna Beach-based group that includes city 
governments and energy-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, said Phillips, who orchestrated the Irvine deal, was "How do you 
harvest large amounts of energy efficiency, not just light bulb by light bulb?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the utilities will front $300,000 to install energy-saving 
equipment at Irvine's City Hall, which will result in lower energy costs. 
However, the city will continue to pay what its typical utility bill has been, 
with the remaining money going back to the utilities to pay for the equipment. 
In five years, the financing will be paid off and the city's utility bills will 
be permanently reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The utilities are guaranteeing that it works," Irvine Mayor Michael Ward 
said. "If it doesn't work, it doesn't cost the city of Irvine anything. If it 
works, we save money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gas Co. and Edison also agreed Sunday to negotiate a similar deal with the 
city of Santa Monica. Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo said she hopes that a deal 
can be worked out quickly to help finance energy efficiency improvements as 
part of the city's rebuilding efforts after the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 What's new here is that utilities would act as general contractors and 
financiers, instead of leaving customers to devise their own energy efficiency 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers don't have to understand energy studies in engineering to do 
this," said Warren I. Mitchell, president of Southern California Gas Co. "And 
the customer can be a city, or various industrial customers wrapped together." 
</P>
<P>
 California's utilities have been looking to expand the services they sell in 
an increasingly deregulated market. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort will be heightened for California's electric utilities if the 
state Public Utilities Commission adopts a proposal to let all California 
consumers choose their electric company by 2002. That proposal, announced 
Wednesday, could be adopted this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one big goal of the utilities in financing deals like the one with 
Irvine is to retain customers who might otherwise go shopping in the 
deregulative market for their energy needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this could also bring in new business for the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. Bridenbecker, Edison vice president of customer solutions, estimates 
that a $2-billion to $4-billion market in energy conservation services exists 
in Southern California alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison hopes to market these and other services outside its traditional 
service territory, Bridenbecker says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridenbecker says Edison is making a similar offer to Taco Bell as part of the 
attempt to keep the company from moving its Orange County corporate 
headquarters -- and 1,000 jobs -- out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The California executives were in Aspen to sign an accord with two Swedish 
mayors and their utility companies to exchange information about the results of 
the Irvine deal, as well as other energy conservation measures they will 
launch.

 Oil Imports to Top 50%, Study Finds: U.S. oil imports are poised to grow in 
1994 because of higher demand and continued declines in domestic crude oil 
production, according to a study by the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America. 
Although oil imports have exceeded 50% periodically in the past, the study 
marks the first time levels are expected to be above 50% on an annual basis. 
The study is expected to intensify industry calls for federal tax relief and 
drilling incentives, although officials say there is no hope of reversing the 
trend.

 Stock Markets Come Closer to Reality: Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission, said he will sign a memorandum of 
understanding with Chinese officials this week for the the SEC to provide 
assistance in developing Chinese stock markets.The agreement will also 
encourage the listing of Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges and encourage more 
disclosure by Chinese companies and regulatory access to them, Levitt said. 
Calling the accord a major initiative, Levitt said, "The Chinese appear to be 
very anxious to make this a fundamental part of their development program." It 
will be the first such agreement signed between the U.S. and China.

AIRLINES UNDETERRED BY VIETNAM POLITICAL SNAGS; TRAVEL: U.S. CARRIERS LAY 
GROUNDWORK FOR FLIGHTS WHILE AWAITING DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. airlines eager for business in Vietnam are finding that politics still 
hampers them, despite the end of America's 19-year economic embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States lifted sanctions against Vietnam on Feb. 3, but it has yet 
to establish diplomatic relations with its onetime enemy. The normalization of 
relations usually precedes the signing of the aviation agreements that allow 
regular passenger flights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Delta, United, Northwest and Continental are taking 
intermediate steps to establish service to Vietnam, including coordinating 
schedules and ticket sales with Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned flag carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline industry analysts say demand for flights to Vietnam has strong 
long-term potential, although they hesitate to quantify it. They say the 
country is inadequately served by existing carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply a function of the fact that new routes are going to be given out 
to Vietnam," said Candace Browning, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New 
York. "That's the reason everyone's interested." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. airlines are working to make up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines signed a letter of intent last month with Vietnam Airlines for 
joint scheduling and marketing; it expects a formal agreement this year. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines, which signed an agreement with Vietnam Airlines in February, 
1993, applied to the U.S. government for permission to fly from Los Angeles to 
Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. Northwest Airlines has asked for approval to 
fly from Detroit to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 And Continental Airlines in February renewed a request for permission to fly 
to Vietnam via Guam, its Pacific hub. 
</P>
<P>
 Freight shipments between the two countries also stand to gain. Federal 
Express Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., plans to start cargo flights this month to 
Hanoi, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States has not said when it might establish full 
diplomatic relations with Vietnam, Vietnam Airlines stands ready to negotiate 
an air services agreement, said Nguyen Duc Vinh, the company's deputy director 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline hopes to fly its own jets to the United States as early as this 
year, said Dao Manh Nhuong, deputy director general of Vietnam's civil aviation 
administration. At stake is an expected surge in air travel to Vietnam by 
business people, war veterans, tourists and Vietnamese Americans, who number 
about 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nhuong estimates Americans could account for up to 30% of airline passenger 
traffic to Vietnam by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased business may result in a boom for aircraft manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the end of sanctions hasn't brought any quick sales for Seattle-based 
Boeing Co., the U.S. aircraft maker favored by Vietnam Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Laird, Boeing's regional sales director, has made 14 trips to Hanoi 
during the past two years, positioning his company for a part in the airline's 
plan to spend $1 billion on fleet expansion by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam is an untapped aviation market with enormous potential, so there are 
a lot of people beating the doors down to talk with them," Laird said during a 
recent visit here. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects to sell 60 to 80 aircraft -- worth $3 billion to $5 
billion -- over the next 10 to 15 years, Laird said. It must compete, of 
course, with the two other makers of large passenger jets, Europe's Airbus 
Industrie consortium and St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing's years on the commercial sidelines may have hurt its prospects here, 
Laird acknowledged. But he predicted that Vietnam Airlines, which plans this 
year to expand its network to fly to France, Germany and Japan, will buy 
aircraft from more than one supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to buy 30 to 40 new aircraft by the end of the century in 
its bid to become a leading Southeast Asian regional carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the next 10 to 15 years, they could easily become the size of a Thai 
Airways, a Cathay Pacific or a Singapore Airlines," Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam Airlines owns 18 planes, 16 of which are Soviet-built Tupolevs, 
Ilushins and Yakolevs -- all at least a decade old. The airline uses Soviet 
planes only for domestic flights, and it hopes to phase them out completely by 
the end of 1995, Nhuong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam Airlines leases two Boeing 767s and five Airbus A-320s with foreign 
pilots and crews for its international flights.

 Cigarette Sales Rise for 5th Year in a Row: Sales in Japan rose by 1.1% in 
fiscal 1993 to a record 332.6 billion cigarettes, according to the Tobacco 
Institute of Japan.Takahiko Ikeda of the institute, a private national industry 
group, said the increase reflected the 1.3% growth of Japan's adult population, 
to 94 million people, that occurred during the year ended March 31. The 
government partly owns Japan Tobacco Inc., which is gradually being privatized. 
Sales of foreign cigarettes reached a record 59.7 billion cigarettes in fiscal 
1993, up 6.2% from a year earlier, Ikeda said.

HOT JOBS; SOCIAL WORK -- A CAREER FOR PRAGMATISTS WHO WANT TO SEE THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 31, Jack Light is too young to remember the 1960s, when social work was a 
popular major on college campuses. In fact, he felt slightly out of place at UC 
Berkeley in the 1980s when business and law were the main attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when Michael Milken and the other Wall Street types were on top of 
the world. Everybody wanted to be like them. Majoring in social work was out of 
favor," said Light, who has been working in his chosen field for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I originally wanted to be a psychologist but decided that the practical 
aspects of social work were a better choice for me," said Light, who works in 
the Adult Protective Services Division of the Orange County Social Services 
Agency in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being out in neighborhoods dealing with people in their actual 
environment, not in an office setting where you can't see everything that's 
affecting the person or family." 
</P>
<P>
 Light supervises a team of social workers who investigate reports of mental, 
physical and financial abuse of the elderly and disabled adults. "Our goal is 
to help the family function better. We help them obtain whatever help and 
resources that will make it possible for them to provide a healthy, safe 
environment for the person involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Light and his staff have no law-enforcement authority, they often make 
surprise visits to homes where abuse has been reported and occasionally obtain 
the abused person's permission to move him or her to a board and care home. 
</P>
<P>
 Light says his job requires a pragmatic and non-judgmental approach, for 
social workers encounter people from all economic and ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the most enriching and important aspects of our jobs," he said. 
"We have to be sensitive to the way various cultures regard the elderly and 
developmentally disabled. It helps to develop a rapport with people so they 
will trust you and come to you for help." OCCUPATION: SOCIAL WORKER 
</P>
<P>
 * Name: Jack Light, 31 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: One of the 10 fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: By 1998, the number of non-medical or psychiatric social work 
jobs in the county is projected to increase by 16.6% to 2,180 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Social workers are employed by government or nonprofit 
agencies to help children, the disabled and the elderly obtain medical 
services, day care, food, shelter and employment. They also investigate reports 
of physical, sexual, emotional or financial abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: A bachelor's degree in social work or a related field such 
as psychology. Most advanced positions require a master's degree. Both degrees 
require several hours of supervised fieldwork. The master's degree is required 
before advancing to become a licensed clinical social worker who may conduct 
individual or group therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $27,000 to $55,000 a year 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Satisfaction of helping individuals in a broad range of situations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Having to untangle red tape to get help for clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: After several years' experience, social workers may advance to 
supervisory positions. Some remain involved in administrative work, while 
others specialize in research. Some serve on the staffs of elected officials as 
policy analysts and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "Most people enter this field because they care and want to help 
others. But since it's impossible to cure all societal ills, it's important to 
develop a pragmatic outlook, or you will burn out."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: THREE VIEWS OF WHERE WALL STREET IS HEADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rallies in stock and bond markets last week suggested that the spring 
"correction" may have run its course. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates finished the week slightly lower than the week 
before, and stock prices rebounded convincingly after plunging early in the 
week to their lows of April 4 -- which was the market's worst day yet this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 So is it off to the races again? Obviously, that's one possibility. But for 
the first time since this bull market began in October, 1990, Wall Streeters 
admit that they have to consider two other scenarios: That a bona fide bear 
market is under way, or that we're in for neither bull nor bear, but instead a 
seesawing stock market in which only the savviest of traders will make real 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows are the arguments for each of the three scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 * The bull market resumes. At its lowest close of 3,598.71 last week, the Dow 
Jones industrial average was off 9.5% from its all-time high of 3,978.36 
reached on Jan. 31. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks 
bottomed last week 12.2% below its record high. 
</P>
<P>
 To the bull camp, history has been satisfied: We've had a very normal 10% to 
15% "correction" in stock prices, the kind that often interrupts bull markets 
for a time. But enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominal catalyst for stocks' selloff, of course, has been the Federal 
Reserve Board's decision to tighten credit for the first time in five years. 
The Fed has raised short-term interest rates from 3% to 3.75% so far this year, 
ostensibly to slow the economy and thus keep inflationary pressures at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 With both short- and long-term interest rates rising, it was natural that the 
stock market would convulse temporarily, the bulls say. But the crux of their 
case for a resumption of the bull market is that the Fed will succeed in 
moderating the economy's growth without having to force interest rates 
dramatically higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, we are still quite early in what I believe will be a prolonged 
slow-growth (economic) cycle," says Byron Wien, investment strategist at Morgan 
Stanley & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulls don't believe stocks are expensive relative to corporate earnings. 
So if interest rates stabilize and the economy continues to expand, albeit more 
slowly than during the last two quarters, rising profits should be the lure 
that draws buyers back to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, says Wien, is the potential for corporate profit margins to 
widen -- i.e., for companies to earn more off each $1 of sales, as business 
improves but costs are held down by tight-fisted managers leery of expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Margins, in a secular decline since the 1960s, are beginning a period of 
secular improvement -- a fact that has escaped many analysts. As a result many 
earnings estimates for 1994 and beyond will turn out to be low," Wien contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Abrams, investment strategist at Trust Co. of the West in Los Angeles, 
also is an unabashed bull. He expects one more "modest hiccup" in stock prices 
in May or June, as evidence of a slowing economy causes some investors to fear 
that a full-fledged recession is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Wall Street realizes that the economy's progress will continue, "the 
bull market will resume in earnest," Abrams says.  
</P>
<P>
 * We're in a bear market. The bear case is based primarily on one theme: The 
Fed's shift to tighter credit, after five years of relatively easy money, has 
produced a sea change in investor psychology.

 There simply won't be enough buyers of stocks and bonds going forward, the 
bears argue -- but there remain plenty of sellers. That will translate into 
higher-than-expected bond yields and a stock market that could lose another 
10%, 20% or more of its value, probably in a slow decline extending into 1995, 
many bears say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single most important fact for investors to understand is that . . . the 
Fed is no longer on your side," says Charles LaLoggia, editor of the Special 
Situation Report market letter in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 He says investors will increasingly see bank CDs and other "cash" accounts as 
a decent alternative, as the Fed's tightening lifts short-term interest rates 
above 4%. At the same time, even investors tempted by stocks will focus on 
share price-to-earnings ratios which, if no longer at record highs, could 
hardly be termed cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the bulls' case that a slow-growing economy and rising corporate 
profits will support stocks? Study history, the bears retort: Severe bear 
markets have often struck in years when the economy grew and profits boomed. 
Think of 1962, 1966 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The overriding issue for stocks and bonds at any time, say the bears, is 
whether the number of potential buyers is large enough to offset the potential 
sellers. After three years of wild global speculation in bonds, and of 
unprecedented stock mutual fund purchases by small investors, the markets are 
loaded with people who have good reason to sell if they fear that the tide has 
turned against them. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bloodshed in stocks and bonds so far this year, "people are finding 
out that they can lose money," says Dan Sullivan, editor of the Chartist 
investment newsletter in Seal Beach. And the potential buyers, he says, now 
understand there's no hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're overdue for a traditional type of bear market," Sullivan argues. If 
this one is traditional, stocks will lose more than 25% of their value before 
it's over, he says. If that's more than you can swallow, sell now, Sullivan 
advises. 
</P>
<P>
 * We're stuck in a "trading range." Some Wall Streeters can't agree fully with 
either the bull case or the bear case. This group sees the market alternately 
rallying and selling off for the rest of this year and perhaps through 1995 -- 
and, in the end, making painfully little headway. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the bull camp, the trading-range camp believes the economy will slow, and 
that any additional rise in interest rates this year won't be extreme. But like 
the bears, the analysts who expect a trading range believe that stocks have 
long been pushing the outer limits of "fair" value, relative to earnings and 
dividend yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up, and you get a stock market likely to seesaw, as the positive 
effects of rising corporate earnings are offset by the knowledge that higher 
interest rates (and probably higher inflation) will reduce the value of those 
improved earnings to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter in New York, is 
bracing his clients for a market in which meaningful gains will be elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at below-average gains for the next few years at least," he 
says. "We think returns (on the S&P 500 index) will be in single digits, and we 
could well see low single digits." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, many Wall Streeters have argued that the 1990s are a replay of 
the 1960s -- with decent economic growth, low inflation and relatively high 
price-to-earnings ratios on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 What is forgotten, however, is that all of the money made in the '60s was made 
in the first half of the decade. Then, from 1965 to '75, the market rode a 
roller-coaster that was a terrific environment for smart traders, but a 
disaster for many buy-and-hold investors. 
</P>
<P>
 If the market's advance so far this decade has already discounted much of the 
good economic news ahead, a seesaw pattern may be the best Wall Street can 
expect for many years to come. A '60s Flashback? 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wallstreeters like to compare the 1990s to the 1960s, a period of decent 
economic growth and low inflation. What's painful to note is that virtually all 
of the money made in stocks in the 1960s was made in the early part of the 
decade. The latter part of the '60s and the early part of the '70s saw stocks 
trapped in a trading range in which buy-and-hold investors saw little net price 
appreciation.

JENNY CRAIG REPORTS LOSS; 30 WEIGHT CENTERS TO CLOSE; FITNESS: THE COMPANY 
SUSTAINED A $15.3-MILLION OPERATING LOSS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AMID SIGNS THAT 
AMERICANS ARE SHUNNING DIETS AND EXERCISING LESS. 
</P>

<P>
 Jenny Craig Inc. reported a third-quarter operating loss of $15.3 million 
Friday and said it will close more than 30 company-owned Jenny Craig Weight 
Loss Centres. 
</P>
<P>
 The Del Mar-based company said the loss for the quarter ending March 31 
includes a $12.9-million pretax expense related to closing the centers. In the 
third quarter of 1993, the company had an operating profit of $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For this year's third quarter, the company reported a net loss of $8.7 million 
on revenue of $96 million, contrasted with a $10.5-million profit on revenue of 
$130.8 million in the same quarter in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the centers is part of the company's ongoing review of its cost 
structure and represents a commitment to be more efficient, said Ron Iori, a 
spokesman for Jenny Craig. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1983, it is one of the largest weight management companies in the 
world with about 800 company-owned and franchised centers in the United States, 
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jenny Craig's fortunes have been sliding for at least a year, amid signs 
that Americans are shunning diets and exercising less. In December, the company 
reported that the number of new participants enrolling in its weight loss 
programs declined by half. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is viewed on Wall Street as a possible takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, CNBC's Dan Dorfman reported that Arthur Goldberg, chief executive 
of Bally Manufacturing Corp., bought 350,000 shares of Jenny Craig for about 
$2.4 million, or $6.86 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman said those shares represent 1.3% of shares outstanding. He said 
Goldberg told him that he isn't planning to try to take over Jenny Craig and 
that Goldberg bought the shares in part because he thinks the stock's price 
might double in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig's shares closed at $7.25 on Friday in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of its stock is controlled by founders Sid and Jenny Craig.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: 'SOFT DOLLARS' RAISE CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mutual fund investors have enough to be concerned about just in the way the 
stock and bond markets have been acting of late. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's another subject that might warrant some additional attention: "soft 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 This term describes the tendency of professional money managers to use 
commissions generated from their stock and bond trading to pay for investment 
research help. The practice is widespread among mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a brokerage might agree to provide $50,000 worth of research 
reports to a mutual fund if the portfolio manager commits to sending $100,000 
worth of commission business to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Few fund groups have the time, money or personnel to do all of their own 
research, especially now that more managers are looking to invest in markets 
around the globe. Besides, a manager has to place trades anyway, so using soft 
dollars could be cheaper than shelling out $50,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet critics say the practice also extends to other goods and services beyond 
just research -- to everything from mutual fund legal fees and computer 
software to financial magazines. Even if a brokerage doesn't produce such 
items, it can still pay for them on behalf of a fund, assuming the manager 
agrees to send so much business its way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission won't allow a fund management company's 
rent, payroll and other overhead expenses to be paid for in this manner. But 
the practice is acceptable on items such as investment software that can be 
used to help run a fund, even if the management company benefits more than 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are saddled with "hidden charges, via the commission stream, which 
pay basic operating costs of business," complains critic Harold S. Bradley, a 
vice president and director of trading at Twentieth Century Mutual Funds in 
Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are paying bills they don't even know they're paying," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice raises conflict-of-interest questions. If a fund manager must 
direct so many commission dollars to a certain brokerage to get, say, a 
computerized quotation service, will he or she be able to get the fund's orders 
executed at the best price? And might such a practice tempt him or her to trade 
excessively? 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that trading costs aren't limited to the roughly 6 cents a 
share in commissions that mutual funds pay to buy or sell. They also include 
more nebulous outlays in the form of dealer spreads or a brokerage's ability to 
execute a big order at an optimal price. 
</P>
<P>
 While many agree the potential for conflict of interest exists, not everyone 
agrees sins are being committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is pretty clear that soft dollars can't be used for something that 
would be a conflict of interest," such as overhead expenses, says Stephen E. 
Cavan, senior vice president and general counsel for Massachusetts Financial 
Services in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual abuses have been rare, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event that soft dollars are used, say, to purchase investment software 
that can help a manager do a better job for the fund, then the practice may be 
justifiable, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And even when brokerage commissions help pay for non-research outlays such as 
a fund's printing bill or legal expenses, this still benefits shareholders, not 
the management company, says Cavan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Bradley counters that such payments would understate a fund's true 
expenses and its "expense ratio," making comparisons among rival portfolios 
less meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, fund trading costs in general don't show up in the expense ratio or 
in the "fee table" in the prospectus. Yet all of these costs will affect a 
fund's performance numbers. Bradley feels that the impact of soft dollar 
trading should be disclosed to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-based Investment Company Institute, the national trade 
organization for fund companies, disagrees. It argues that such information 
would not be useful to shareholders and would simply lengthen prospectuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The institute strongly believes that, if any additional disclosure 
requirements concerning brokerage practices . . . are proposed, such disclosure 
should be to fund boards," ICI General Counsel Paul Schott Stevens wrote in a 
letter to the SEC last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC is certainly aware of the potential for conflicts of interest with 
soft dollars. The agency's staff has proposed that management companies outline 
their trading practices and the impact on fund performance as footnotes in the 
prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the SEC staff has also recognized certain soft dollar benefits for mutual 
funds, such as helping them gain access to more and better research. 
</P>
<P>

 Mutual funds that hold Japanese stocks were the top fund category during the 
first quarter, helped by currency factors. Slightly more than half of the 
Japanese market's 22% gain over the 12 months through March 31 was attributable 
to the yen's rise against the dollar, says the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, 
Pa. But lest you overrate currency factors in international investing, Vanguard 
says the impact was much less in Hong Kong, Australia, Britain, France and 
Germany. In those markets, currency factors affected returns to the tune of 
only about two percentage points on average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Institute is circulating a press release on "frequently 
overlooked" mutual fund facts, Part 2 . Many of the supposed misconceptions 
were already covered in a similar release in October, but a few are worth 
mentioning, or at least repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most of the new money entering mutual funds isn't coming from certificates 
of deposit. "Contrary to frequent (but incorrect) reports, most of the people 
investing in mutual funds are not new to funds," the trade group says. 
</P>
<P>
 * A good chunk of mutual fund assets is held in long-term plans such as IRAs 
and 401(k) programs. The institute estimates that almost $450 billion of the 
industry's $2-trillion asset base is in retirement accounts. 
</P>

 For the past year, Fidelity has been waiving its 3% sales charge on nine 
international funds, with the grace period scheduled to expire May 31. But the 
Boston-based giant says it will maintain its current no-load policy 
indefinitely on five of those funds: Fidelity Canada, Diversified 
International, Europe Capital Appreciation, Japan and Worldwide. Mutual Fund 
Trading Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds buy or sell cheaply, paying an average commission of 6 cents a 
share. But that's only one type of transaction cost. The following elements are 
not disclosed to shareholders but can exert a bigger impact on performance.  
</P>
<P>
 * Dealer spreads. Every stock has both a bid and an asked price. The manager 
buys at the higher price, the asked one, and sells at the lower price, the bid. 
The difference, or spread, can be a significant cost component, especially with 
smaller, infrequently traded stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transaction-size effects. A manager who wants to buy or sell many shares in 
a hurry can move the price of a thinly traded stock. Big orders send signals 
that something may be happening with the stock, and the dealer will adjust the 
price accordingly.

EUROTUNNEL'S OVERSEER IS ALSO A PIECE OF WORK; PROFILE: SIR ALASTAIR MORTON IS 
PROUD OF THE MONUMENTAL PROJECT BUT DEFENSIVE ABOUT ITS SHORTCOMINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sir Alastair Morton will take a place in the history books as overseer of the 
long-awaited tunnel between England and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the British chairman of Eurotunnel is reluctant to boast about the 
magnitude of the achievement, balking at comparing the tunnel with other 
human-made marvels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Suez Canal, the pyramids and all that stuff," Morton says. "I wasn't 
there. I mean, I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, he adds, "It was a monumental project that wasn't particularly 
well-planned, that recovered from a poor start to succeed despite a bad 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the most flattering description of Europe's biggest, albeit 
problem-plagued, engineering work of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morton's pride is evident on the walls of his new office, where dozens of 
pictures show concepts of the so-called "Chunnel," dating back as far as 
Napoleon. The first thing Morton shows two visitors is a framed 1913 quote from 
the father of communism, Vladimir Lenin: 
</P>
<P>
 "The richest, the most civilized, and the freest countries in the world are 
now discussing, in fear and trepidation, the 'difficult' question of whether a 
tunnel can be built under the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "On all sides, at every step one comes across problems which man is quite 
capable of solving immediately, but capitalism is in the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton's eyes seem to twinkle at proving Lenin wrong. The tunnel has been 
built, and capitalism was not the problem, as the project was built with about 
$15 billion in private funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems that did crop up -- billions in cost overruns, years of 
feuding between Eurotunnel, contractors and rail car suppliers, technical 
glitches -- were never solved immediately or even very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 They have proven such an embarrassment that Morton seemed on the defensive 
during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he worries that a photographer will make him appear double-chinned. As 
the photographer steps behind Morton to admire his office's view of the River 
Thames and the Houses of Parliament, the 56-year-old former oil and financial 
executive asks: "You're taking my bald patch now, are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 After Morton acknowledges that the tunnel won't be fully operational until 
sometime next year, he tells a reporter: "Now there's your ultimate downside 
that you can put in your headline." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the tunnel's ticket prices, which are higher than fares on 
competing ferries, the chairman responds, "People who ask that question are 
pretty unintelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton claims the speed and ease of the tunnel will make it worth more to many 
travelers. "If we offer a true weather-free, turn-up-and-go, frequent 
departure, te dah de dah de dah de dum good service, why shouldn't we command a 
premium for speed?" 
</P>
<P>
 But first, the 31.4-mile Channel Tunnel between Folkestone, England, and 
Calais, France, has to open. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the tunnel is inaugurated May 6 by Queen Elizabeth II and French 
President Francois Mitterrand, it could take months before it opens to 
passenger traffic. Delays have become so frequent and so widely publicized that 
Morton won't make any more public predictions about when things can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait and see," he says repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite billions already spent, Eurotunnel will be broke around the time of 
the inauguration. Bankers refuse to put up more money unless shareholders do 
the same, and Morton soon will ask owners of the company's stock for at least 
$750 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But didn't Morton say in 1990 that he would step down rather than make 
shareholders pay more to build the tunnel? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I said, 'If we can't finish it with this money, it won't be me asking 
you for more money.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've finished it. It will open before the cash call. You might say it's 
a tight finish, but everything in Eurotunnel has been a tight finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton says his greatest accomplishment in building the tunnel was keeping all 
the involved parties together, despite countless feuds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say the chairman's often-abrasive style helped do the trick.

NEW GOLF CLUB PRODUCTS DRIVE SALES; BIG BERTHA IRONS, GRAPHITE SHAFTS CAPTURE 
GOLFERS' FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two golf club manufacturers are driving sales higher and farther with new 
products that have caught the fancy of golfers trying to improve their swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway Golf, one of Wall Street's hottest stocks since it went public a year 
ago, is devising a rationing scheme to satisfy the huge anticipated retail 
demand for its new "Big Bertha" line of irons. 
</P>
<P>
 And Aldila Inc., a manufacturer of graphite shafts for golf clubs, says it 
expects another year of 20% or so growth as golfers convert to the lighter 
weight and more accurate shafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies stand to benefit from a projected upswing in the U.S. golf 
market, which had been flat for the past couple of years because of the 
sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to sell many new premium-priced golf clubs when mid-level 
executives were getting laid off in 1990 and 1991," said Gary Barbera, 
president of Aldila. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for golf equipment is expected to surge by about 6% this year, 
easily topping last year's $1 billion, according to experts. Although the 
National Golf Foundation estimates there are 25 million golfers in the United 
States, only about half play regularly and replace equipment frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers who routinely head out to the links aren't reluctant to buy 
top-quality equipment, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway's Big Bertha irons, retail priced at a cool $170 apiece, don't go on 
sale until May, but pro shops and sporting goods stores are already clamoring 
to be on Callaway's waiting list for stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The irons are expected to be a big hit, based on the runaway success with its 
innovative Big Bertha woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it introduced those clubs four years ago, Carlsbad-based Callaway has 
seen its revenues soar with nearly triple-digit growth. The Big Bertha woods -- 
actually made of metal -- are widely perceived by golfers as having an 
innovative design that can hit the ball farther and is more forgiving to poor 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales have also gotten a boost from pro golfers like Johnny Miller and Paul 
Azinger who have endorsed the clubs. Nearly one-third of all touring pros use 
Big Bertha woods. 
</P>
<P>
 When Callaway executives spoke this week at the Raymond James Financial equity 
conference, dozens of pension fund managers and analysts waited in line for a 
chance to swing one of the Big Bertha clubs in the meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Mahoney, an analyst with Raymond James, cautions that the stock, now 
trading around $40 on the New York Stock Exchange, may be overpriced and 
subject to the whims of the golf market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Callaway's success is a testament to the golfing public's willingness to use 
whichever products they believe will improve their game," said Mahoney. He said 
Callaway could lose ground to other industry innovators who might develop a 
hot-selling golf club. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts, who have watched Callaway's stock increase by 500% since it 
went public and then split, have issued 1994 earnings estimates ranging from 
$1.45 a share to as high as $2.90 a share. In 1993, Callaway earned $1.17 per 
share on revenues of $254.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldila, based in San Diego, has experienced more modest growth of about 20% 
annually over the past few years. The company boasts it is the single biggest 
U.S. consumer of graphite, using more than even Boeing does for its jets and 
strong, lightweight airplane parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers with graphite clubs contend they outperform steel shafts by hitting 
balls greater distances with improved accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldila sells its graphite shafts to virtually all major golf club 
manufacturers, including Callaway and archrival Ping, as well as Spalding, 
Wilson, McGregor and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldila expects to become the leading supplier of golf club shafts in 1995, 
overtaking Black & Decker unit True Temper, which sold $85 million worth of 
mostly steel shafts in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graphite has blown away the competition, much like it did with tennis and 
racquetball rackets a few years ago," said Kim Carpenter, Aldila marketing vice 
president, who estimates that half of all clubs now sold are made of graphite. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldila is expected to earn about $1.20 per share in 1994 on revenues of $78.3 
million, according to Wall Street estimates. In 1993, it earned 97 cents a 
share on sales of $62.6 million.

BOFA HIRES A LEADING DERIVATIVES EXECUTIVE TO GUIDE ITS OPERATION; INVESTMENTS: 
JOSEPH BAUMAN, WHO HEADED CITIBANK'S GLOBAL GROUP, WILL LEAD VENTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 The derivatives market has gotten such fearsome publicity in the past few 
months that many institutions say they are shunning it like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bank of America is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's second-largest bank announced Friday that it has hired one of the 
nation's leading derivatives executives to run its own operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph P. Bauman, 44, head of business development at Citibank's global 
derivatives group, will become head of BofA's U.S. Financial Engineering and 
Risk Management Group and director of its global counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bauman, BofA will be getting a strong defender of the embattled business. 
He is chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Assn., the industry's 
lobbying arm. In an interview while still at Citibank, Bauman recently argued 
that derivatives are an indispensable part of a commercial bank's business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derivatives have brought back some of the traditional role banks have 
performed as a financial intermediary," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on the value of an 
underlying security, commodity or index, as stock options are based on the 
value of the underlying stock. In recent years, the derivatives market has 
spread from regulated commodities exchanges to a wide range of transactions 
fashioned by banks and investment companies to help corporate clients hedge 
risks. As hedging needs -- and technology -- have become more advanced, the 
nature of the instruments has become more complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Within the past few weeks, several derivatives users -- including Procter & 
Gamble, Gibson Greeting Cards and Mead -- have reported multimillion-dollar 
losses, the result of their hedging contracts failing to behave as expected and 
going spectacularly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to cries from Capitol Hill for better regulation of the market, if 
not an outright ban of the devices. Among the key issues raised by lawmakers 
and regulators is whether banks have overly exposed themselves to large losses 
if their customers default or the deals otherwise go sour. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA long has been an important player in derivatives, ranking among the top 
15 U.S. commercial banks in the contractual value of its transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 By that measure, the value of derivatives contracts on the bank's books was 
about $922 billion as of Dec. 31, up from $782 billion the previous year. The 
actual amount at risk from default of its partners in the transactions -- a key 
measure of a bank's exposure to reversals in the market -- dropped to $13.71 
billion from $18.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 For both years, about half the contractual figures was in foreign exchange 
contracts; BofA has traders stationed in dozens of countries around the world. 
The bank both executes transactions for clients and invests in derivatives to 
manage its own risks, executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new domestic post, Bauman replaces George Handjinicolaou, who recently 
left BofA to join the International Finance Co. of the World Bank. The global 
post is a new one. The aim of Bauman's appointment is "to further our global 
objectives in this key business area," said Gerald Doherty, director of the 
bank's Global Capital Markets Group.

IT'S A TUFT LIFE; CONEJO VALLEY DAYS OPENS WITH WHISKERS, CHILI COMPETITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shannon Cooper of Thousand Oaks stroked the faces of dozens of men Sunday 
afternoon, scrutinizing the strands of shaggy beards and waxed mustaches lined 
up before her. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old Moorpark College student joined five other Miss Thousand Oaks 
princesses in judging the Whiskeroo Contest, the precursor to Conejo Valley 
Days that honors those with the finest facial hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard, especially with the softest beard, because all of them are 
really soft," she said moments after making her choices. "I just narrowed it 
down the best I could. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them I ended up giving the same score," she confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whiskeroo Contest and an afternoon chili cook-off attracted thousands of 
people to Conejo Creek Park in Thousand Oaks on Sunday to celebrate opening day 
of the 38th annual Conejo Valley Days festival. 
</P>
<P>
 While the scent of barbecue and chili wafted through the air, dozens of men, 
including several who have not shaved in decades, vied for the ceremonial 
crowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I won softest beard, so this is really great," said Bill Reif of 
Newbury Park, who took top honors Sunday with the trim brown beard that was 
named the best of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Brian Kock, scroungiest beard; Glenn Morrison, softest 
beard; Butch Shulman, fullest beard; Steve Robinson, best mustache, and Roger 
Meade, most unique mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 The chili cook-off drew almost 60 amateur chefs out of their kitchens and into 
homemade booths to hawk such attractions as Earthquake Chili, Cup o' Death and 
Beer Tub Chili. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had spent hours preparing their special mixes of spices and sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no big secret," said Kenton Stafford of Fillmore, "just a whole lot 
of time searching for spices and powders." 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford said his so-called 7/8 Chili won the world chili championship six 
years ago. On Sunday, he dished out hundreds of portions in small, plastic cups 
to a hungry crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cooked it three hours here and I spent probably another four hours getting 
it ready at the house," he said between servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind gusts of up to 25 m.p.h. did not deter Daniel Hernandez, who drove from 
Culver City to taste as many different kinds of chili as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just working our way around," he said, clutching almost two dozen 
tickets for chili samples and waiting in a long line at Axmen Chili. "I have a 
bad stomach, so I took a bunch of Pepto-Bismol before I came." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Armao, a painter from Newbury Park, said he was just finishing a beer 
when a man gave him 40 tickets for chili tastings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably got indigestion and split," said Armao, waiting for a taste of 
Earthquake Chili. "I read about it in the newspaper. It's supposed to be really 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Goodrich of Simi Valley said her favorite recipe came from Scent of a 
Chili, which she said best blended a hickory flavor and top-quality beef. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had black beans and thick chunks of onions," she said. "You could actually 
see the ingredients." 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Cowan of the Thousand Oaks Rotary Club, which sponsored the culinary 
contest, said more than 30,000 tickets for tastings had been sold by 
mid-afternoon. The money is donated to various nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blessed with not having any rain, which would have put the cook-off 
in peril," he said. "The turnout is better than it's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days takes today and Tuesday off, then returns Wednesday with 
the Badgeroo Contest and the much-anticipated carnival. It concludes Sunday 
with a rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan confessed that not all of the chili sold at the booths is original. Each 
entrant is required to bring 2 1/2 gallons of a home recipe. After that is 
sold, however, entrants use a canned, name-brand chili provided by the Rotary 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "They supplement and add to it their own personal, individual spices and 
perhaps a little more meat," Cowan said, adding that the club went through more 
than 30 cases of canned chili Sunday.

HILLSIDE MUSTARD TOO TENACIOUS TO WEED OUT; ENVIRONMENT: LARGE SWATHS OF 
CHEESEBORO CANYON ARE OVERRUN WITH NON-NATIVE PLANT. ERADICATION PROGRAM SHOWS 
LITTLE RESULTS SO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The lush fields of yellow flowers blanketing the county's hillsides might be a 
pleasant distraction for motorists on the Ventura Freeway tired of 
contemplating the bumper in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the National Park Service, mustard is just one tough weed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since December, 1991, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area's 
fire-management team has been trying to eradicate mustard by setting fires in 
parts of Cheeseboro Canyon, where acres and acres are overrun with the 
non-native plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their efforts, the mustard just keeps coming back, practically a 
thicket of six- and seven-foot stalks, pushing aside native plants wherever it 
roams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny," one hiker said, pausing on a trail in Cheeseboro Canyon. "I 
think ever since they started prescribed burns, they've had more mustard then 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire management officer Ishmael Messer said that without the burn program, 
areas such as Cheeseboro Canyon would eventually be overtaken by mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pervasive and it's very adaptive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted that the eradication program, still in its experimental stages, 
shows little results so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visual perspective is that there's a lot of mustard out there, and that's 
true," Messer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the park service has measured some minute reductions in mustard 
plant populations and simultaneous small gains among grasses such as stipa, a 
native plant that grows in clumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The park service began its eradication efforts in late 1991 by burning a 
200-acre patch on Modelo Trail. In June, it moved to the middle of the canyon, 
burning 500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the hills about a mile back on Modelo Trail look like a pointillist's 
painting come to life, with millions of yellow dots swaying in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of this year's healthy mustard crop can actually be attributed to the 
prescribed fires. The plant initially responds well to such disturbances, 
Messer said. Seedbeds probably were full when the fire came through last year, 
and they stay safe unless the flames burn extremely hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way the fire can consume all the seedbed in the ground," Messer 
said. "The idea is to decrease it enough so that we can stop the plant from 
spreading. But it's going to take a long time for that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalist Milt McAuley, author of "Wildflowers of the Santa Monica 
Mountains," said the park service's battle against mustard is a losing one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park service will find out to their dismay that it won't work," McAuley 
said. "You can do what you want to mustard, but next year, it's going to come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited areas in Topanga State Park in which two natural fires and two 
prescribed fires failed to eradicate the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the biggest mustard patches in the park are in those burn areas," 
McAuley said. "Mustard is overwhelming us in many areas. . . . It's bad news. 
But you can't get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 43 species of mustard to be found in the region, but by far the most 
prevalent is black mustard, or Brassica nigra , which has been giving the hills 
behind the city of Ventura a yellow-capped appearance for the last two weeks. 
Although some types of mustard are native, black mustard is not. 
</P>
<P>
 The tales about mustard's California origins are almost as varied as the 
number of species. The most often told and certainly most romantic story is 
that priests, traveling with Spanish invaders in the 1760s, brought bags of 
mustard with them on a journey to Monterey. Along the way, they sprinkled 
seeds, hoping that when they returned to Mexico the following spring, the 
flowers would have bloomed and could show them the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Another story is that sailors from Mediterranean countries brought with them 
mattresses stuffed with dry vegetation from home. By the time they arrived in 
California, the mattresses were moldy and matted down. They brought them to 
shore, pulled out the old stuffing to change it and thus sowed the seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 McAuley said the version he believes is that people scattered the seeds in 
burn areas during the 1950s and '60s, hoping to rejuvenate the vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 All mustard is edible. The leaves taste sweet for about 10 seconds, then burst 
into a spicy mustard flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Brendler, with the Ventura County Farm Advisory Office, does not know 
anyone who commercially grows or harvests mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it is just viewed as a noxious weed," Brendler said. "It takes up 
space and soil nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
 One historian, Joseph Russell, writes in his book "Cattle on the Conejo" that 
early farmers in the area did harvest black mustard, planting it in the same 
field as oats. According to Russell, mustard seed crops were an important 
contribution to the area's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustard is made in Ventura County today -- in fact, the world's yearly 
production of 30 million jars of gray poupon is blended at Nabisco's Oxnard 
plant, Nabisco spokesman Mark Gutsche said. But the brown mustard seeds the 
company uses are imported from northwestern Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no connection between our mustard and those pretty yellow flowers you 
see by the roadside," Gutsche said. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were, the park service might have a market for its unwanted crop. 
Instead, it intends to continue trying to kill the vegetation, with a 700-acre 
burn planned for Cheeseboro Canyon in late May or early June. After that, 
rangers will inspect and decide when to schedule the next burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult," Messer said. "The Santa Monica Mountains have been so highly 
manipulated by human beings. It's hard for us to determine what actually does 
belong in Cheeseboro Canyon. But what we're shooting for is to bring back that 
oak savannah grassland." 
</P>
<P>
 McAuley has a suggestion for the park service on how to achieve that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they should send a bunch of people out there to make sandwiches," he 
said.

COOL REACTION; NORDHOFF HIGH'S TOUTED 'ICE' PROGRAM CALLED TOO HARD ON STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unusual class Nordhoff High School administrators have hailed as being on 
the cutting edge of educational reform is now being criticized by some students 
and parents as too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months into a course that mixes English, Spanish, art and science 
instruction, educators at the Ojai school acknowledge that many of the class's 
120 students are disenchanted and intend to return to regular classes in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of complaints from kids that they're working too hard," 
Principal Michael Maez said recently. "But we want to create a climate where 
working hard is OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students complained in interviews that they were confused because all 120 
students are sometimes taught simultaneously in one large classroom by four 
different teachers. Also confusing was the lack of predictability of what they 
would be taught from day to day, some students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard," freshman Amy Fuller said. "You understand more because you can do 
it from all different perspectives, . . . (but) sometimes it can be really 
confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said, however, that the mixing of subjects in a single class 
made school far more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just yesterday alone, we learned so much," sophomore Jennifer Kelso said the 
day after a field trip to UC Santa Barbara. "You learn more in four hours than 
two weeks in regular classes." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel Interdisciplinary Cross-cultural Educational Experience, or "ICE" 
class, was created over the last three years by four teachers who volunteered 
to bring to Nordhoff the type of class being encouraged nationwide -- one that 
connects areas of knowledge that have always been taught separately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way curriculum has been delivered forever on a high school level is a kid 
is asked to go to six or seven classes and nobody bridges those subjects," said 
Rick Mohney, the English teacher in the course. "They're taught in vacuums." 
</P>
<P>
 What the class does differently is to clearly demonstrate that subjects such 
as science and art are often linked in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent assignment taught students about atomic structure by requiring them 
to construct papier mache three-dimensional models of an element's atoms. 
</P>
<P>
 For another assignment, students traveled to Lake Casitas, where they dug 
samples of soil for science, sketched landscapes for art and wrote an essay 
about their experience with nature. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of schools in Ventura County have experimented with similar 
interdisciplinary programs, including Oxnard and Oak Park high schools, which 
both received state grants in 1992 for their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff has gone a step further. The school spent $400,000 to construct a 
special building with movable walls to allow the large class to meet as one or 
to separate into four smaller units when desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 The one enormous open room invites group projects that are the hallmark of the 
program, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the ICE class are predominantly freshmen and sophomores. But 
Nordhoff also began to offer last fall a cross-curricular course for 
11th-graders called the American Experience. It combines U. S. history and 
American literature in one three-hour class in a regular classroom. About 90 
students are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that every school district is experimenting with 
(interdisciplinary teaching) at this time," Maez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But William McComas, an education professor at USC, said he had never heard of 
a program as far-reaching as Nordhoff's. 
</P>
<P>
 "That school is beyond the cutting edge," he said. "Most interdisciplinary 
schemes that have been put forward so far involve the sciences, or history and 
science. . . . But rarely do you see schools extending so far." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the right direction, he said: "The world is an interdisciplinary 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Maez said cross-curricular programs like Nordhoff's are changing how students 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an information explosion going on," he said. "We have to focus on 
process, on skills, on teaching them how to learn, not necessarily what to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
 But that transition has been uncomfortable for some of those who are used to a 
traditional classroom. Sophomore Jaime Ortiz is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll learn more out there," Ortiz said, gesturing to the old 
classrooms beyond the ICE program's new facility. "I like it, but I don't like 
that the freshmen and sophomores are mixed." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy and fellow freshman Stephanie Warner said the mixture of subjects makes 
learning difficult. Both intend to leave the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohney said youths in the ICE program are not honors students -- many are 
average students who will not go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think somewhere along the line it's going to be easier," the teacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Art teacher Linda Taylor is among those who is convinced that the new program 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never want to go back to a traditional classroom," she said at a recent 
school board meeting. "I think this is how schools should really be." 
</P>
<P>
 But after nearly a full school year in the new program, some students and 
parents are frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Fay, a parent who worked on a district panel that evaluates new 
classes, has voiced concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "My question is, when all the smoke clears away, how will it work out?" he 
asked the school board recently. "Will the ICE program help out in college 
preparation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Amy's mother, Lisa Fuller, said she's seen a change for the worse in her 
daughter since going into the class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lack of enthusiasm. I think she would have been better off in a 
normal class because they focus on a single subject," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want to be in this (program)," she said. "We did not sign up for 
it. When school started, we decided we'd try it because no one knows about it 
and it's brand new." 
</P>
<P>
 Maez acknowledged that some students were enrolled in the course by school 
counselors because other elective courses were full. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mohney says students and parents are balking mostly because the program 
challenges students in ways that they have not been challenged before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest complaint we have had is, 'My child cannot function in your open 
environment,' " he said. "Our response was, 'That's why your kid needs to be in 
this program.' "

STREET SMART: WARNING SIGNS ARE ON THE WAY TO MAKE STOPPING EASIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm concerned about a stop sign at a Pacific Coast Highway off-ramp between 
Oxnard and Point Mugu that is creating a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign, posted at the northbound off-ramp at Hueneme Road, forces 
fast-moving cars coming off the highway to stop before turning onto Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 This creates the potential for rear-end accidents because if more than one car 
is coming down the ramp at the same time, cars in back may not be aware of the 
sign and may be unprepared to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on Hueneme Road is light, so the stop sign seems unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 John S. Broome, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic may be light, but two cars are all it takes to make a collision, so 
the stop sign will stay, says Luu Nguyen, a senior traffic engineer for the 
state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety is the No. 1 reason that a stop sign is posted at the intersection of 
the ramp and Hueneme Road, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were no sign, motorists could come cruising down the ramp and head 
onto Hueneme Road without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, drivers barreling down Hueneme would be unaware of the unfettered 
motorists about to enter their paths -- a recipe for disaster, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 As for your concern about motorists who don't see the upcoming stop sign on 
the ramp, Nguyen says Caltrans will post warning signs to alert drivers that 
the sign is ahead. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing about the intersection of Pleasant Valley and Lewis roads in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection is extremely deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 Any chance of getting the asphalt roadbed repaired? 
</P>
<P>
 Sean G. Corrigan, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are in luck. 
</P>
<P>
 A repaving of California 34, known in different spots as Lewis Road, Pleasant 
Valley Road and 5th Street is scheduled for completion by June, 1995, says 
Chuck Boyer, Caltrans maintenance chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The $357,000 project will begin in the next six months, Boyer says, and will 
stretch from Rice Avenue to Dawson Drive, an area that includes the 
intersection you are concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Caltrans workers will do minor patchwork to keep the road 
functional until the overlay is completed.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I try to be a patient driver, but the unsynchronized stop lights on Los 
Angeles Avenue in Simi Valley push me to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 On most roads, the lights are timed so that even if you have to wait through a 
long red light, it is followed by a series of green lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so on Los Angeles Avenue between Erringer and Madera roads. It's stop, 
wait, start, stop, wait, start all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Are these lights timed this way intentionally? Can something be done to 
improve the timing? 
</P>
<P>
 R. Torres, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blow a gasket, but the timing of lights on Los Angeles Avenue is about 
as good as it's going to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, most of the lights are indeed synchronized, city Traffic 
Engineer Bill Golubics says. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of study and observation have led the city to link the four signals on 
Los Angeles Avenue between Erringer Road and 1st Street so that they will turn 
green in sync, allowing traffic to flow smoothly, Golubics says. The two 
signals between 1st and Madera run on their own individual clocks, triggered by 
the amount of traffic passing through. 
</P>
<P>
 But traffic doesn't flow on well-timed lights alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Los Angeles Avenue is one of the busiest commercial strips 
in the city. Drivers pulling in and out of parking lots cause unavoidable 
congestion during shopping hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major business area," Golubics said. "There's only so much we can do." 
BERM UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's column, a Ventura reader wrote that she is worried about the 
hazard created when motorists turn left illegally from Henderson Road to enter 
the Santa Paula Freeway or Wells Road. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked if a barrier could be constructed to prevent the turns, but city and 
state officials were skeptical about whether they would be able to fund such a 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says that at the city's 
insistence, Caltrans has agreed to build a barrier at Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The barrier should be built by August, Lalani says.

ROUNDTABLE TAKES AIM AT PREJUDICE, STEREOTYPES; THOUSAND OAKS: GROUP OF WOMEN, 
WHO USE GAMES AND DISCUSSIONS TO BRING ABOUT CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING, HOPE TO GO 
BEFORE COMMUNITY FORUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The game was simple, a tried-and-true icebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 You plucked a slip of paper from a hat. You read the scrawled half-sentence. 
You wandered the room, interviewing strangers, trying to find the person whose 
paper best completed your sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 A straightforward get-to-know-you game. But this particular version had a 
nasty twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the scraps contained sweeping categories: All Arabs are. . . . All Jews 
are. . . . All New Yorkers are. . . . The other half held angry adjectives: 
Uptight. Ugly. Stingy. Nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could hope to form a politically correct sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was exactly the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 women playing the game represented many different cultures: Indian, 
Japanese, Costa Rican, Armenian, African American, Jewish and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they formed the Roundtable on Diversity, a new group dedicated to 
busting stereotypes, battling prejudices and urging understanding in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make this community better," said Elena Garate Eskey, an 
administrator at Cal Lutheran University who considers herself a blend of 
Cuban, German and Swiss heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the sentence game helped Roundtable members confront their own 
prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 After reluctantly writing derogatory sentences, the women brainstormed to come 
up with positive spins. The match "All Californians are crazy," for example, 
turned into "All Californians are free-spirited and innovative." Still a 
stereotype, of course, but a slightly more palatable one. And the exercise 
proved a valuable education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's willing to pigeonhole everyone else," Eskey said, summarizing the 
lesson. "But when it comes down to it, we're just people." 
</P>
<P>
 To spread that message, the Roundtable women hope to take their games and 
discussions into community forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they may expand their membership to include men. For now, though, 
they have decided to allow women only, "because women really are the change 
agents," Eskey said. "I don't think that's a stereotype -- women have always 
had the burden of change, all around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 This particular group of women will be busy this summer, trying to persuade 
the Thousand Oaks City Council to establish a multicultural commission with 
power to mediate disputes, investigate complaints and educate the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see (the commission) as a place where people can get a handle on changing 
ethnicity in this city," organizer Shoshana Brower said, digging into a 
breakfast of saffron rice, sushi rolls and potato kugel at a recent Roundtable 
meeting. "If there's a problem, the commissioners can jump in and help avoid or 
manage conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission is established, its first step might simply be to spread the 
word that Thousand Oaks -- despite its reputation as a homogeneous bedroom 
community -- has grown increasingly diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent census found that Latinos account for fully one-tenth of the 
city's population. The 1990 survey also noted small but growing Asian and black 
communities, which together make up nearly 6% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 And diversity in Thousand Oaks goes way beyond the census figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Students representing 33 countries, and 30 distinct languages, study side by 
side in the Conejo Valley Unified School District. A Japanese junior may confer 
with a Peruvian senior while a Guatemalan classmate reviews algebra nearby. A 
Mayan tutor may help a Taiwanese immigrant learn English while Mexican students 
pore over a beginning grammar text. 
</P>
<P>
 "To all those people who think of us (in Thousand Oaks) as absolutely negating 
diversity, I say, come with me for a day," said Claudia Spelman, director of 
pupil services. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the district, high school students have formed their own 
mini-roundtables, gathering immigrants from various countries to discuss 
discrimination and alienation. Sometimes, they ask students born in the United 
States to participate as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite some outreach efforts, "we're like outsiders," said Gabriel 
Vazquez, 18, a Westlake High senior who emigrated from Mexico two years ago and 
plans to attend Cal State Northridge in the fall. "They don't always talk to 
us, and that's why I feel so sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' schools have largely avoided the racial strife that has sparked 
fights on some campuses elsewhere in the county, including Ventura and Oxnard. 
Yet three Westlake High students were recently injured in a fight that pitted 
white football players against an Asian student allegedly backed by 
out-of-towners. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the city as a whole, Roundtable members see no cause for complacency. 
</P>
<P>
 They point first to a burst of hate crimes in Thousand Oaks over the summer. 
In the most widely publicized case, vandals three times spray-painted swastikas 
and racial epithets on the home of the Rev. Kenneth Bushnell, a black 
Seventh-day Adventist minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Those incidents mirrored a flurry of anti-Semitic graffiti on Conejo Valley 
synagogues in late 1990 and early 1991. Temple Adat Elohim was among the 
hardest hit, as an arsonist set fire to the school building several weeks after 
religious slurs were spray-painted on the synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent episodes, police have this year investigated several attacks 
described as racially motivated. And hate literature has been found stuffed in 
boxes at local drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the problems in Thousand Oaks, consistently ranked one of the 
nation's safest mid-sized cities, seem minor compared to the violence that 
daily rattles Los Angeles. Because the city has enjoyed relative harmony, some 
question the need for a multicultural commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen absolutely almost zero ethnic tension in this city in my years as 
a resident and council member," said Alex Fiore, who will retire this fall 
after 30 years on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not Los Angeles or Chicago or New York," he said. "This is Thousand 
Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Elois Zeanah, who has been working with the Roundtable since early 
March, considers Thousand Oaks ripe for some sort of multicultural commission. 
"We're trying to get in at the front end, rather than waiting for (racism) to 
become a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the closest model would be Oxnard's Commission on Community 
Relations, which monitors and investigates discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the commission has evolved into a general clearinghouse to 
help people cut through red tape at City Hall. But the group does focus 
especially on those who "feel they don't have a chance to be heard because 
they're from a minority," said Paula Reach, a member of the Oxnard panel for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than intervention, many Thousand Oaks Roundtable members are 
interested in education -- both for immigrant newcomers and for 30-year 
residents who may be bewildered by the multitude of languages they hear around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 By introducing residents to their new neighbors, and by holding forums or 
writing pamphlets to explain cultural differences, Roundtable members hope to 
ease the transition on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she spoke perfect English, Anita Bapat could have used some support 
when she arrived from India 4 1/2 years ago. She found her neighbors friendly 
and welcoming, but couldn't get used to some of their customs -- like shaking 
hands and even hugging at every meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised to behave more circumspectly, Bapat considered Americans brash and 
forward. Her neighbors pegged her as aloof and rude. Bapat would like to see 
such misunderstandings averted through some kind of outreach and education 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The multicultural commission should serve as an "ambassador of goodwill," 
Roundtable member Karen Livesay agreed. She would also like to use the panel as 
a platform to educate people about diversity within each distinct ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 A local management consultant, Livesay laughs when people seem to see her 
blond hair and fair skin as belying a Latino heritage. In reality, she grew up 
speaking Spanish, eating tortillas with nearly every meal and celebrating her 
Costa Rican heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It amuses me but also bothers me," Livesay said. "It shows that we haven't 
done a good enough job of making people aware of our heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 Roundtable members recognize that some Thousand Oaks residents -- proud of 
their relatively homogeneous community -- might resent a multicultural 
commission designed to highlight diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the economic distress around the world, people are a little less 
accepting these days, and they always need a scapegoat," said Spelman, the 
school administrator. "But that makes the committee's work very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Livesay agreed: "Though it may not be comfortable, change will take us in a 
better direction. We've got so much opportunity to be a model community. Why 
not push the envelope of our internationalism and go beyond what we may appear 
to be?" Thousand Oaks Population by Race White: 94,333 Hispanic: 9,871 Mexican:

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SOAP STARS PLAY VOLLEYBALL IN BENEFIT 
MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Susie Wich, the fact that "The Young and the Restless" actor Peter 
Bergman's celebrity volleyball team went down to three consecutive defeats at 
the hands of a California Lutheran University student volleyball team wasn't 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the volleyball itself wasn't important at all. What was important for 
the 21-year-old psychology major was her ability to see her all-time favorite 
daytime soap opera star in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch the show every chance I get," Wich said. "Sometimes that means 
catching the show between classes and sometimes even during classes. I think he 
is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Bergman in playing in the benefit contest Sunday were daytime 
television stars from such shows as "The Bold and the Beautiful," "Santa 
Barbara" and "Days of Our Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors faced a combined student team made up of the university's women's 
volleyball players and a coeducational intramural squad. The celebrities lost 
all three games played before a crowd of 150 people in the campus gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was held to benefit the Santa Susana Repertory Company, a Thousand 
Oaks-based professional theatrical organization that is preparing to open the 
city's Civic Arts Plaza in September with a production of "The Man From La 
Mancha," according to Lane Davies, the company's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Also benefiting from the volleyball match was the university's drama 
department, which will soon start an apprenticeship program with the theatrical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman, who plays the character Jack on the long-running soap, said he was 
glad to come out for the game in support of the theater company and Cal 
Lutheran drama students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a longtime friend of Lane's and, when called and asked if I could 
participate, I didn't hesitate to say yes," Bergman said before the start of 
the match. "Even if we lose, we're still going to have fun out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Bergman was another actor, Shemar Moore, who plays Malcolm Winters on 
"The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for a great cause," Moore said. "I think it's really important to 
support local theater. I'm happy to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 For Michael Arndt, chairman of the drama department, the event represented 
what he hopes will be the start of an enduring relationship with the repertory 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited because this will give our students a chance to work with 
professional actors," Arndt said. "This will help their growth as actors 
tremendously." J. E. MITCHELL

 A huge field where the Simi Valley Days carnival is celebrated could be the 
site of hundreds of residences and dozens of commercial buildings if the City 
Council approves a change in the city's General Plan today. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is the first step toward eventual development of the 67-acre vacant 
lot at Madera Road and Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Four developers plan to build a post office, about 150 houses, 280 apartments 
and several commercial buildings. But no specific plans have yet been 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval today would allow the developers to move beyond their conceptual 
plans. Construction could not begin until the council approved specific 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A giant project including commercial buildings, apartments, townhouses and 
single-family houses was first proposed for the site a decade ago, Mayor Greg 
Stratton said. But it never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Little League had to move out of there 14 years ago because they thought 
something was going to be built right away," Stratton said. "Nothing ever got 
built, and the owner has since sold portions of the property. Now it's just a 
question of not making the new owners go through another layer of paperwork to 
get their project built." 
</P>
<P>
 Council approval would alter the General Plan only slightly and the area's 
zoning would remain the same, City Planner Jim Lightfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said it would very likely take at least a year, probably longer, 
before anything is built. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope it doesn't take another 14 years," he said. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER EARTHQUAKE STUDY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $72,000 contract to study whether the ground under homes in eastern Simi 
Valley is particularly unstable during earthquakes will be considered tonight 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 homeowners requested the study last month.They claimed that the city 
was endangering the lives of residents by allowing reconstruction of 
earthquake-damaged homes in areas where the ground shifted and cracked during 
the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which is already under way by the state Division of Mines and 
Geology, is expected to be finished in early June, Mayor Greg Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency will repay the city for the cost of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study is going to tell us if there's a problem," Stratton said. "The big 
question on people's minds right now is whether or not to rebuild. We can't 
stop them if they want to start now, but we hope they can wait for the study to 
be done so they can be sure there's not a problem." SCOTT HADLY

 The Simi Valley City Council will consider tonight a contract with a local 
company that would service the Police Department's communication system, 
including all department radios. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris Communications, which has been taking care of the system since 1988, 
almost lost the contract last month after Motorola Communications & Electronics 
underbid the firm by $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council eventually rejected Motorola's bid of $124,689 after learning 
that the company could take up to five days to make repairs in an emergency. 
The city reopened the bidding, and Harris Communications undercut Motorola's 
last offer by about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' $122,612 contract would run from May to April, 1996. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SCHOOL TRANSFERS MIGHT BE LIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning in the fall, Ventura parents may send their children to any public 
school in the district, regardless of where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a policy that will be considered by the Ventura Unified School District 
board Tuesday, parents may move their children only to schools that are not 
already full with children from the surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the district's 23 schools are expected to have room next year 
only for students who live within their attendance boundaries, said Arlene 
Miro, director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to deny anybody into a school . . . if there is room after 
the neighborhood kids come into the school," Miro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed policy will also allow the district to limit transfers that 
threaten to upset the racial balance at a school. For instance, if a high 
number of white students are asking to leave a particular school, the district 
may deny the requests if it decides that the transfers would cause too great a 
change in the ratio of whites to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A new state law that took effect at the beginning of this year requires all 
school districts to establish policies allowing transfers between schools. But 
the law allows districts to limit transfers to prevent crowding and to maintain 
racial or ethnic balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents in the Ventura district are already able to send their children to 
schools outside their neighborhoods, but only if the parent can show a 
compelling reason for the transfer, such as if the new school offers an 
academic course not available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The new school choice policy would allow parents to request such a transfer 
without having to give a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Ventura school board approves the policy Tuesday, parents will be able 
by the end of this month to begin applying for transfers for the next school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications will be available at all schools in the district, Miro said. MAIA 
DAVIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Smoky skies over the top of Mt. Pinos in Los Padres National Forest this week 
are not cause for alarm but signal the beginning of a large prescribed burn, U. 
S. Forest Service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is planning to torch 150 acres of brush in a densely vegetated 
500-acre portion of the forest on Mt. Pinos, where whitethorn brush has become 
so dense that it is impenetrable by deer. 
</P>
<P>
 If weather, wind and humidity conditions are right, helicopters Tuesday will 
drip a flaming gel over the area, district ranger Mark Bethke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the helicopters, we can be very exact where we put the fire and we can 
very easily control the areas we're burning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burning in the spring minimizes the chance that the fire would get out of 
control, he said. "but we have extra crews there in the event that something 
like that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Burning off the brush will also encourage new growth of plants that are better 
for the about 500 mule deer that browse in the area and provide better habitat 
for other wildlife. Smoke may be visible in the area for many days. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER RAMP REDESIGN PACT 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council tonight will consider one of the first steps in 
redesigning the Victoria Avenue exit ramp from the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will be asked to approve a contract with an Orange County firm to 
refine the state Department of Transportation's preliminary design plans for 
the interchange and recommend the best design for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has received $4.5 million in federal funding for revamping 
the interchange, all of those funds must go toward actual construction of the 
ramp. The city itself will pay for the $350,000 design contract and the 
remainder of the estimated project cost of $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he was happy to have the money to start on the project. 
"It's exciting to see it go forward," he said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; VOLUNTEERS TO CLEAN MASONIC CEMETERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deteriorating cemetery in Oxnard will receive a much-needed overhaul this 
summer when local Masonic lodges and girls' auxiliary chapters join forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by reports about the neglected Hueneme Masonic Cemetery, Job's 
Daughters bethels in Ventura County have volunteered as many as 50 teen-age 
girls to clear out trash and overgrown vegetation there. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Masons will do the heavy work, lifting fallen gravestones in the 
century-old three-acre site near Pleasant Valley and Etting roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, we'll get it back to where it should be," said Steve Cooley, 
an adviser with the Job's Daughters Bethel in Thousand Oaks. "We're going to do 
as much as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery, started in 1898 by some of Oxnard's founders, has fallen into 
disrepair after years of disuse and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation responsible for its upkeep, the Hueneme Masonic Cemetery 
Assn., has run out of money for maintenance and instead uses its dwindling 
funds to pay state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups have tentatively set July 30 for the cleanup effort and hope to 
draw from five Job's Daughters groups in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is made up of girls, ages 11 to 21, who have relatives in the 
Masons. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

ORANGE IN A BIND OVER JAIL'S LIKELY EXPANSION; CRIME: 'THREE STRIKES' LAWS AND 
OVERCROWDED COUNTY FACILITIES MAY FORCE THEO LACY'S GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way the politicians here see it, this city has become a virtual prisoner 
of the times. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in a political season of "three strikes and you're out," locked in a 
county whose jails are now bursting at the seams, Orange officials see little 
hope of freeing the city from the burden of housing hundreds of new and more 
dangerous prisoners at the county's Theo Lacy Branch Jail on The City Drive in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented introduction of 48 maximum security inmates last week to the 
jail -- a dramatic escalation from its 1959 beginnings as a minimum security 
facility -- may be just the first trickle, the city fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, the county is expected to release an environmental 
impact report that may clear the way for the near doubling of the current 
inmate population limit of 1,326, as proposed. City officials in Orange suspect 
that the report may allow the county to build 600 new cells at Theo Lacy, 
accommodating up to 1,200 more inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Signals about Theo Lacy's future role as a home for dangerous criminals have 
been plentiful for years now, but they became reality last week when Orange 
city officials were informed that the Sheriff's Department -- for the first 
time -- was transferring the maximum security inmates to Theo Lacy because of 
continuing overcrowding problems in the main jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the roof when I heard about it," said Orange resident Bill 
Leming, part of a citizens committee that has opposed previous expansions at 
Theo Lacy. "That place is a cancer growing on the community. We've got to cut 
it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange officials worry that yet another expansion would kill off much-needed 
investment in The City Shopping Center, across the street from the jail, and 
possibly endanger its other neighbors -- including residential areas, the 
Orangewood Children's Home and UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are rather reluctant to shop and work in an area where there is a 
jail," said Orange Councilwoman Joanne Coontz. "The city is losing retail 
possibilities out there. All we are getting is the shaft." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has fought unsuccessfully to stop the Theo Lacy expansion in the 
courts, but even as local leaders regroup to plot future strategy, a sense of 
grim resignation seems to have set in. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange officials blame the county for their predicament, criticizing it for 
failing to provide a long-term solution to its prison overcrowding -- an acute 
problem since 1987. They are particularly bitter about a 1990 promise that they 
say Sheriff Brad Gates broke, which was supposed to cap Theo Lacy's population 
and bar maximum security prisoners there. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent Orange council meeting, council members fired barb after barb at 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are upset about is that the sheriff has no regard for the citizens of 
Orange," Mayor Gene Beyer said last week. "But this is par for the course for 
the sheriff. He does what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates could not be reached for comment, but Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. 
Dan Martini said that the sheriff never broke any promises to Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they understand Orange's fuming response to plans for 
enlarging the nine-acre facility, but contend they have few, if any options. 
Because of crushing demand for county jail space, if more prisoners were not 
placed in Theo Lacy, they would have to be released early, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has been constrained by a cap at its main jail in Santa Ana as a 
result of a 1978 federal lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union 
in response to overcrowding. The situation has become so severe that Gates in 
1991 was ordered to spend 30 days in jail for contempt of court because of his 
early release of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence was later overturned, but the county has still not made any major 
inroads in its decade-long struggle to find a site for a new jail. And in the 
meantime, the Sheriff's Department continues to issue early releases to more 
prisoners each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of overcrowded conditions in 1993, the county was forced to release 
10,141 prisoners before their sentences were finished, Martini said. More than 
a third of those were freed with one-fifth of their sentence left to serve, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 batch of early releases included 183 males convicted of assault with 
a deadly weapon, 181 burglars and 74 men jailed for lewd acts with children, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department found that 840 of the 1993 early-release prisoners 
committed crimes during a time in which they originally were sentenced to be in 
jail, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff's back is against the wall on the overcrowding issue," Martini 
said. "The fear is someone is going to be released early and commit a heinous 
crime. That would be hard to live with." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner, a former Orange City Council member, 
also concedes the county has few alternatives in coping with its bulging 
prisoner population. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just tremendous pressures on the Orange County jail system," 
Steiner said. "People are sending a clear message with 'three strikes, you're 
out,' which is they want more jails, but not in their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 While he argues that other cities should share in housing prisoners, Steiner 
offers little encouragement to Orange residents hoping to see Theo Lacy's 
expansion curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm being pulled in a lot of different directions," he said. "I'm only one of 
five board members." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange would seem to possess neither the funds nor the fortitude to block the 
proposed expansion in the courts. The city is still stinging from a costly 
two-year legal tangle with the county to prevent a previous hike in jail 
population. The court battle ended in defeat for the city in 1993 and cost an 
estimated $300,000 in legal expenses in a time of service cutbacks and staff 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's nothing we can do about it, but it doesn't mean we are happy," 
Coontz said. "We need to play hardball to the best of our ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's best chance for a satisfactory resolution may rest with City Manager 
David F. Dixon, who has only been on the job for two months. The council 
recently appointed Dixon the city's chief representative in brokering a 
favorable deal for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 While remaining tight-lipped about his upcoming negotiations, Dixon did say he 
plans to meet with county officials and tour Theo Lacy this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, Orange officials are hoping that Dixon can use Theo Lacy as leverage 
to unchain the city from its current obligation to pay for the relocation of 
the county's animal control facility, which is adjacent to the Theo Lacy 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current agreements, Orange is supposed to shoulder the moving costs, 
estimated at several million dollars. The city wants to extend Metropolitan Way 
and it has agreed to relocate the county's animal control facility, located 
nearby, in order to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animal shelter is a nice, interesting issue to have out there on the 
table," said Dixon, who would not elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of negotiations may also ride on the strength of the assumption 
that a jail facility jeopardizes the neighboring community. While few contest 
the thought that living near a prison is undesirable, there is debate over 
whether jails actually pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The area around Theo Lacy has the second highest crime rate in Orange, 
according to police. But police say it's not the jail fueling crime, but rather 
the high volume of people passing through the local shopping centers, medical 
facilities and office complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real problem is public perception," said Orange Police Chief John 
Robertson, who believes the county should solve its prison overcrowding problem 
elsewhere. "People believe because there is a jail there, it creates crime. And 
that's just not accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 And county officials point out that Theo Lacy has been re-equipped to imprison 
more dangerous criminals. In recent months, the facility has been fortified 
with double fencing, additional razor wire and a state-of-the art security 
fencing system on its perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That jail is secure," Martini said. He added that there has only been one 
escape since 1993, and that came before the new security measures were 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Pat Goldsmith, who lives less than a mile from the prison, doesn't 
believe the place is safe. Three years ago, a Theo Lacy escapee jumped the 
fence to her back yard. Goldsmith immediately dialed 911, and the escapee was 
quickly apprehended by police. 
</P>
<P>
 But the incident has left her adamantly opposed to bringing additional -- and 
more dangerous -- criminals to the facility, and she is planning to launch a 
petition drive to show Gates the strength of the community's opposition to the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way in heaven you can tell me that prison is totally secure," 
Goldsmith said. "We are sitting here in a residential area, so close. I think 
the sheriff is nuts."

TABLETOP WARS; ANCIENT ASIAN BOARD GAME FINDS NEW ENTHUSIASTS

<P>
 Like Chinese nobles who waged tabletop war and Japanese Samurai who battled 
for control of smooth slate stones centuries ago, a new wave of Ba Duk board 
warriors seized territory Sunday in the very heart of a suburban shopping 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Well after dawn the sounds of skirmish filled the sunny quarters of the newly 
opened Korean Ba Duk academy edging the Macadam of the Western shopping center 
at Garden Grove Boulevard. Polished pebbles clicked softly against cherrywood 
cups. The battle cry of warriors soared to polite murmurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yong Kwan Ju, 52, a former fish wholesaler turned master of the academy, 
surveyed the victories and wreckage of war like a proud general inspecting the 
troops. Just a month ago he opened his Ba Duk academy to teach "lessons in 
life" along with the rudiments of the ancient Asian board game. Sunday almost 
70 players from all over Southern California gathered in the academy for a 
weekend of board warfare and the promise of trophies and a $500 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1942, Life magazine used the game of Ba Duk -- or Go as it is known in the 
United States -- to explain Japan's war strategy. In 1994, tournament player 
and family practice physician Steven Joe uses the game to explain an approach 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches patience. It's possible to be too impatient and aggressive too 
early and that could lead to downfall. You also learn foresight -- the more you 
can analyze ahead the more likely you are to succeed," said Joe, 32, who 
juggles his Anaheim Hills practice so that he can come to the academy for play 
at least twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules of the game -- played with 180 stones on one side, 181 on the other 
-- are deceptively simple, but the strategies are so complex that most 
practiced Ba Duk players can easily best computers at the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Matches are waged on a thick wooden board crosshatched with lines intersecting 
at 361 points. The stones -- which are whacked against the board with the force 
of a poker player slamming down a full house -- move only once unless captured. 
Two competing players vie to surround their opponent's stones and seize 
territory. It's a process that usually takes an hour, but in some legendary 
competitions has lasted for days. When a player commands as much territory as 
possible, the game ends, with victory going to the competitor with the most 
spoils. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians believe the game originated in China before 2,000 BC, and legend is 
that an emperor created the game as a mental exercise for his slow-thinking 
son. Another explanation credits the evolution of the game to ancient 
astrological forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the whitewashed walls of the Korean Ba Duk academy, the airy rooms are 
slowly being decorated with delicate calligraphy. The writings express lessons 
of the game that have endured as values for nobles and Buddhist monks, Japanese 
Samurai and Korean military commanders, corporate raiders and computer hacks 
indulging in games of Ba Duk over the global Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jae Myong, a retired librarian from UC Irvine who grew up in Korea, donated 
the drawing that spells out the characters: "A good fighter doesn't end a match 
in anger." 
</P>
<P>
 "No anger," Myong explained, "means no emotion. Always have a good attitude. 
This is the right way to play. . . . This is very much like the way of living. 
These are the ethics to be followed." Myong learned the game when he was in his 
thirties, carefully studying books and game strategies. Gradually he mastered 
the lessons, learning that in tabletop warfare all strategies must be balanced: 
aggression with caution, greed with patience, harmony with hunger for power. 
After all, one point can win the game as decisively as a hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week Myong plays the game at one of the two Ba Duk clubs in 
Garden Grove, gazing thoughtfully at the mint-shaped pieces while younger men 
gather to watch his swift, deliberate moves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rankings of the game, Myong falls among the more seasoned amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's Ba Duk tournament was sponsored by the American Go Circuit 
Tournament and Lloyd Eric Cotsen, a Los Angeles businessman who is such a 
hard-core fan that he said he often plays 2 a.m. matches against Internet 
computer opponents as far away as Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotsen runs the Princeton Review Education Testing service but manages to 
sandwich time for the game into his work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday afternoon he answered his telephone with the greeting, "Can I kill 
him?" Then he politely added: "Can you call me back? I'm in the middle of my Go 
lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last five years Cotsen has donated prize money for Southern California 
tournaments to promote the game and -- more important -- train new challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to provide a forum to play at my strength," said Cotsen. 
"There aren't a lot of people playing at my level. My goal is to promote it to 
bring more people. I don't want to get too spiritual but I can apply strategies 
of the game to my business. My problem is I become too micro-focused on 
original battles and I lose the game. So I've got to shift back and not get 
obsessed with the small kill. I've got to see the bigger picture." 
</P>
<P>
 But yesterday Cotsen's big picture was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quiet storefront in the shopping center, weekend warriors quietly trained 
for Ba Duk battle. The edgy click of slate stones signaled they were ready for 
more.

DECISION ON TOLLWAY PROJECT WAS COVERED UP, FERGUSON SAYS; ROADS: LEGISLATOR 
SAYS OFFICIALS MASKED PLANS TO MAKE SEGMENT OF NEWPORT COAST DRIVE PART OF 
TOLLWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gil Ferguson doesn't normally buy into conspiracy theories. He scoffs at the 
idea that Roosevelt let the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor; he doesn't believe 
anyone but Oswald killed Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days the Republican assemblyman from Newport Beach is talking as if 
an orchestrated cover-up is taking place right in the heart of his tony coastal 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson argues that Orange County officials and the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency schemed in the early 1990s to camouflage an 
important decision from the public -- that a 1 1/2-mile segment of Newport 
Coast Drive, which has helped siphon congestion off Coast Highway in Corona del 
Mar, would ultimately become part of the San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 He fears the resulting 50-cent toll on the stretch will push many motorists 
back onto the Coast Highway and its adjacent residential streets, renewing the 
monumental traffic jams that plagued Corona del Mar before Newport Coast Drive 
was opened in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue of taking a segment of public road and charging a toll on it has 
never had a public hearing of any sort," Ferguson complains. "All that ever 
appeared in the 14,000 pages of environmental documents was a map showing four 
dots, which if you look at the bottom showed that they were going to be toll 
booths." 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by angry residents who feel they weren't kept properly informed, the 
conservative lawmaker has introduced legislation designed to stop the toll 
booths. But last week the bill suffered the legislative equivalent of a 
lynching, and it's given little hope when the Assembly Transportation Committee 
reconsiders the measure Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Ferguson and the rest are talking ominously of lawsuits and 
pushing Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren to step in. Lungren's office, which received 
more than 500 letters from angry residents, has agreed to issue an opinion on 
the legality of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the hubbub, officials with the county and tollway agency have been 
left scratching their heads. After scads of hearings and countless public 
forums on the much-debated tollway, they can't imagine how anyone could 
complain about being ill-informed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they suggest the Newport Coast Drive toll booths didn't become big 
news because other issues -- most notably the tollway's effect on the 
California gnatcatcher and the environment in general -- captured the lion's 
share of media and public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to go back and rewrite history," said Mike Stockstill, a 
tollway agency spokesman. "Instead of realizing it's a huge project and this 
one just got past them, they have taken the attitude that we've tried to pull 
one over on them. There's no evidence to support that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill said the agency cannot simply remove the toll booths and spread the 
extra cost to other parts of the highway, largely because plans have been 
cemented by the financial prospectus used to market more than $1 billion in 
bonds sold to finance the project. In addition, there's the matter of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you cut the toll from the Newport end, what happens to the guys at the 
other end of the road?" Stockstill said. "They'll be screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as traffic, Stockstill and other tollway agency officials insist their 
plans will actually end up helping Corona del Mar. Traffic projections show 
that the tollway, which will run 15 miles from San Juan Capistrano to Newport 
Beach when completed in 1997, should divert 16,000 cars each day from Coast 
Highway and other streets winding through the trendy seaside neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But many aren't buying that. "I think we again will be inundated with 
traffic," lamented Luvena Hayton, transportation chairwoman of the Corona del 
Mar Chamber of Commerce and owner of a Coast Highway clothing boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy is nothing new for Newport Coast Drive. The thoroughfare was first 
proposed by the Irvine Co. as a bargaining chip to win approval to develop its 
9,400-acre coastal property south of Newport Beach. In exchange for Newport 
Beach's blessing, the Irvine Co. agreed to scale down its ambitious project and 
help finance the $67-million road, which snakes for six miles from Coast 
Highway up into the hills, to MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Coast Drive was designed not only to service the plush tracts of 
homes, apartments, hotels and two 18-hole golf courses making up the 
development, but also to divert traffic from South County cities, like Laguna 
Beach and Dana Point, away from Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "That road is near and dear to the hearts of the people of Newport Beach," 
said Councilman Phil Sansone. "Now they feel like they've fought for over 20 
years and, without a specific public notice, it's being taken away from them 
and they're requiring a toll." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other partisans in the battle, Sansone talks in cloak-and-dagger terms 
about the tollway agency and county. At the very best, he said, tollway 
boosters failed miserably to inform the general public about the particulars of 
the project. Most residents, he said, thought Newport Coast Drive would 
essentially serve as a free frontage road to the tollway. (County highway 
officials say that would be impossible because of the terrain). 
</P>
<P>
 "The tollway's environmental impact report is as big as three telephone 
books," Sansone grumbled. "The average citizen wouldn't know where to begin, 
and they'd figure it only relates to environmental matters, not to major 
changes in policy." 
</P>
<P>
 He also points to a provision, written into state law when the Legislature 
authorized the tollway agency to build a pay-to-use highway, that it only be 
built parallel to other public thoroughfares. Sansone contends the tollway, 
aside from taking over what is currently a free road, completely obliterates 
that premise of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest thing to an alternative route is the planned extension of Newport 
Coast Drive that would allow northbound traffic to turn left at Bonita Canyon 
Drive, funnel onto a planned extension of Ford Road and then hang a right onto 
MacArthur Boulevard. "It sure as hell isn't parallel," complained Sansone. 
"It's a Z-pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 Sansone, who took over Newport Beach's seat on the tollway agency after the 
controversy erupted late in 1992, initially proposed that the toll booths be 
moved so motorists could ride free on the tollway to Ford Road, thus 
eliminating a need for the Newport Coast Drive extension. That idea was shot 
down by the agency, citing the binding provisions of the bond-sale prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
 That prospectus -- and the bond sale itself -- is a particularly sore point 
for Sansone and others. He sees it as a Catch-22. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman contends he tried to organize a public hearing in Newport Beach 
on the toll booth matter in February, 1993, but the effort was rebuffed by 
tollway officials because they didn't want to stir up any controversy with the 
bond sale looming. But after the bonds were sold, he argues, agency officials 
used them as the excuse to stifle debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill insists there was no conscious effort to evade concerns in Newport 
Beach. Rather, the agency was simply overrun with last-minute work to prepare 
for the bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the last three or four weeks before the sale," Stockstill said. 
"There was only one thing that mattered -- making the bond sale happen -- and 
100% of everyone's effort was going into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as opponents raise the specter of skulduggery, Stockstill points to 
documents he suggests deflate any conspiracy theories. Among them are the 
transcript of a November, 1990, informational hearing in Laguna Beach during 
which a tollway official explained how Newport Coast Drive would be absorbed 
into the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 Another piece of evidence is a letter sent that same month by Lawrence 
Shapiro, an official with the Spyglass Hill Community Assn., complaining about 
the toll booths. Copies of the letter were sent to all the Newport Beach 
council members -- including Sansone. Moreover, the final environmental report 
on the tollway included a response from the agency to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's somebody, a real live citizen, who went through and found out about 
the toll," Stockstill said. "He told every member of his city council," but the 
warning was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the association sent a widely circulated letter 
complaining about tollway proponents using Shapiro's letter. They maintained 
that Shapiro was the only one who knew about the toll booths and, when no reply 
came from the agency, he assumed the tolls were being eliminated and let the 
matter drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the shadow of a doubt, the toll for Newport Coast Drive was 
intentionally kept from the public," the chamber's Hayton contends. "I think it 
was an effort to delude the public." Taking the High or Low Road 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists will have to pay a 50-cent toll to drive on a segment of Newport 
Coast Drive if it becomes part of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor. Newport Beach Assemblyman Gil Ferguson says this will push motorists 
back to already congested East Coast Highway in Corona del Mar. County and 
corridor agency officials say the incorporation has been planned all along.

SHOOTING AT PALLADIUM BRINGS CALLS FOR UNIFORMED OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fatal shooting of a man outside the Hollywood Palladium prompted calls 
Sunday for a change in city regulations to allow private auditoriums to hire 
uniformed police officers to perform security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer called to the scene early Sunday shot the 
unidentified man after he allegedly threatened a couple there with a nail gun, 
then pointed it at the policeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, both the Palladium's president and the head of a community 
association -- long critical of Palladium policies -- called for the presence 
of off-duty police when the facility is open. 
</P>
<P>
 Palladium executive Alan Shuman and Joe Shea of the Ivar Hill Community Assn. 
said they would go together to City Hall this week to lobby for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, only public facilities such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
are allowed to pay police to patrol in uniform during their events. Off-duty 
officers may be hired by private firms, but they must appear in plainclothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities released few details of Sunday's incident, which occurred at 2:15 
a.m. as the man with the cartridge-powered nail gun apparently was waiting for, 
then confronted a man and woman leaving the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, identified only as C. Bustamante, shot the man in the stomach 
after he refused an order to drop the weapon and aimed it at Bustamante, a 
police spokesman said. The identity of the man, who was pronounced dead shortly 
thereafter, was being withheld Sunday pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after a dispute between Palladium management and community 
residents, the Los Angeles City Council imposed an early curfew around the 
Palladium, but later agreed to lift it on condition that the auditorium hire 
additional private security. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman said Sunday that the security has helped, and that there have been only 
two violent incidents in the immediate vicinity of the auditorium in the last 
10 months. But he said regular police patrols -- for which he is willing to pay 
-- would be even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner activist Shea, who held a news conference Sunday to call for 
increased security, said he recognized that crime is a societal problem beyond 
the control of the Palladium. There were two other shootings Saturday night in 
Hollywood alone, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shea complained that the auditorium changed private security firms this 
weekend, and said the new security was not as good. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman, who joined in the news conference, said there was little security 
officers could do about the man shot by police because he was not a Palladium 
patron, but had been waiting outside -- apparently for the couple to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a domestic dispute," Shuman said, "All this happened in 30 to 40 
seconds. . . . We changed security units because this unit was more used to 
handling adult events. . . . But I want to hire uniformed police officers to 
patrol both inside and outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman and Shea quickly agreed to go to City Hall to confer with the area's 
council member, Jackie Goldberg, and seek her support for changing the rules on 
hiring regular police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said he had complained to police earlier in the evening about having been 
beaten over the head by several gang members on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and his neighbors are fed up with Hollywood's crime problems, but 
want to work with the Palladium's management and do not favor shutting the 
auditorium down as long as adequate security can be implemented.

 One of the latest fund-raising fads to hit the California charity circuit is 
the sale of specialized license plates that benefit everything from wilderness 
conservation to arts education. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to show Yosemite National Park you care? For 50 bucks, buy a license 
plate depicting the snowy peaks and azure skies that have made the park famous. 
Proceeds go to the preservation-minded Yosemite Fund, after the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles takes its cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to give children's causes a hand? Then purchase a California Kids' Plate 
from the Children's Advocacy Institute, which enables you to use symbols on 
your license plate for the first time, as in "ILA" or "*GAZER." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you believe culture has taken a beating in the Golden State, shell out 
$20 for a California Arts Council plate, so that the fine arts get a financial 
boost while the back of your car gets to show off the palm trees and beautiful 
sunsets we pretend to experience every evening on this end of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the 1.25 million personalized license plates sprinkled throughout 
California have been issued by the DMV. But now, a handful of nonprofit 
organizations -- which still require DMV approval of their specialty plate 
designs -- are hoping to cash in on the same individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of residents have already bitten, like the man who loves YOSEMIT, 
the Bruin who H8S SC and the clever folks who profess to be NON+D, a SELF*TR, 
or an ACEOFS. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a declaration of individual identity," says Brenda Bright, an 
anthropology professor at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., who 
studies car-customizing. "There is . . . this profusion of ways (for people) to 
mark their identities as unique and significant. The car and especially the 
license plate in L.A. is a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Jay M. Steren of Malibu, UCLA Class of '62, the new style of plate is a 
way to push college boosterism to another level. His special UCLA plate, 
emblazoned with a little gold Bruin and the university's initials embossed in 
blue letters on the side, urges his alma mater to LMN8SC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, no one would talk to me, and now everyone reacts," Steren, 54, says 
of the motorists he watches in his rear-view mirror or the drivers who flash 
signals at him as they whiz past his Infiniti Q45. "In some cases it's a 
thumbs-up, in some cases thumbs-down and in some cases a single digit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "So far no one's thrown eggs at me, but I haven't driven by SC, either." 
</P>
<P>
 To launch their fund-raising drives, the various organizations had to win 
approval from the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Each charity must collect 5,000 applications before its plates can go into 
production at the Folsom prison near Sacramento. Within the past year, four 
groups have qualified, with a fifth -- a veterans association -- on the verge 
of surpassing the 5,000 mark. Four more organizations, from a land conservancy 
in Lake Tahoe to a state firefighters foundation, have also been given the 
green light to advertise special plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a fraction of the $33 million generated annually by traditional vanity 
tags -- which have been around for 20 years -- will be a boon to these 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yosemite Fund has so far raked in $200,000 from the sale of 15,000 plates. 
"This will be the park's greatest ongoing source of private revenue," predicts 
Keith Schiller, the Bay Area attorney who spearheaded the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most interesting of the new offerings are the California Kids' 
Plates, which allow the use of symbols -- hearts, hands, "plus" signs and stars 
-- and are due to hit the streets this fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "We think the star is very L.A.," says Geraldine O'Connor, a spokeswoman for 
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier, (D-Burlingame), who sponsored the Kids' Plates 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll get no argument from Arlette!, an actress, singer and dancer who lives 
in Lancaster. (Yes, it's her legal name.) 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A.'s the place. I have to be here," says Arlette!, whose specialty license 
plate will pine "OOH2BA*". 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Blythe of Orange leaped at the chance to inscribe a heart on her plate, 
but for an entirely different reason than other applicants, who have declared 
their love for K9S, QPONS, even TUPWR. 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe's only child, Holly, underwent a heart transplant in November, 1990, 
when she was less than 6 months old. Now the girl is healthy and active, so in 
a tribute to her daughter's resilience and courage, Blythe signed up for a 
"NEWKID" tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get that plate. I wanted that plate badly," says Blythe, 34. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was the greatest thing. I want people to know that I have a 
little girl here who had a heart transplant"

VENDING MACHINES DISPENSE CDS FOR $13.99 IN THE SLOT

 Buying the latest compact disc is as easy as ordering a soft taco in Castaic 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think this sounds crazy, you should see how it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who frequent the Del Taco at the truck stop off Lake Hughes Road 
already have gotten a glimpse of the latest in music marketing: a huge vending 
machine that has flashing lights and speakers and is packed with four dozen 
competitively priced compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who can't get to record stores can get to us," said Adam Lilling, a 
marketing supervisor for Universal City-based Vending Intelligence Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the company, which is co-owned by Miles Copeland, founder of I.R.S. 
Records and the manager of pop giant Sting, has set up more than 60 machines 
throughout Southern California, with at least 40 more scheduled to be in 
operation by the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, the vending machines have strategically been 
placed at local grocery stores and on college campuses, including Cal State 
Northridge and Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Folger, president and co-owner of Vending Intelligence, said his company 
is trying to capture the Generation X and baby-boomer market, noting that as 
consumers age, their interest in music wanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're 18 years old, a trip to the record store may be a social event -- 
you go in and browse," Folger said. "But if you're between 25 and 35, you may 
not have time for this anymore. Life's priorities change . . . if you're going 
to buy music it has got to be easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter CD vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can hear a 30-second sample of any CD displayed on the front of the 
machine by simply pressing a button. Cash, ATM or credit cards may be used for 
a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections, which range from Bonnie Raitt and Janet Jackson to Nirvana and 
Pearl Jam, vary depending on the location. Prices are competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing in our machine is above $13.99," Lilling said. 
</P>
<P>
 That means truckers rolling through Castaic on Thursday could buy the 
"Philadelphia" soundtrack from the vending machine inside Del Taco for about $4 
less than it costs to purchase the same CD at the record store inside the 
Valencia Town Center shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnie Shinder, who owns the Del Taco in Castaic, said he is happy with the 
machine in his restaurant despite its failure to meet great expectations in 
sales. Retailers such as Shinder are paid a site fee by the vending company, 
which varies depending on sales. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Shinder said his restaurant is the only Del Taco in Los Angeles County 
to install one of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as a convenience to the customers," Shinder said. "It's one more 
reason to come to Del Taco. Everybody at least looks at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how successful the marketing venture has been is difficult to gauge. 
Folger declined to disclose sales figures or profits. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, however, quick to cite the company's success in attracting retailers 
such as Pavilions, Hughes and Alpha Beta, and said plans are under way to 
install the machines, which cost $15,000 each, throughout a major drugstore 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The machines have also been shipped to France, England, Israel, Japan and 
Mexico, where they are being tested for future consumer use, Folger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet expansion both at home and abroad faces some significant obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our No. 1 problem is that they just don't know what it (the machine) is," 
Folger said. "People have never seen them before." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, back at Del Taco, a customer skeptically glanced at the music machine 
as he stood in line to order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't figure out what it is," he said. "Maybe it's a jukebox." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who milled around the machine outside the bookstore at Cal State 
Northridge acknowledged that the prices are low, but they complained that it 
lacked selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would listen to the CDs in the machine, but they're not the ones I would go 
out and buy," said Mayola Delgado, 23, a broadcast major. "It needs more 
variety." 
</P>
<P>
 Another student, Juan Carlos Quinteros, 19, said he would be reluctant to 
purchase a CD from a machine, 
</P>
<P>
 "If it came out damaged, then what would you do?" Quinteros asked. "It would 
just be too much of a pain."

DEAR STREET SMART: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know we have many laws and too many regulations governing driving, 
insurance, smog and so on. But we do not have one to protect us from noisy 
cars, trucks and motorcycles. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 George Rotaru 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are laws on the books restricting how loud cars and trucks and 
motorcycles can be. The problem, according to California Highway Patrol Officer 
Tito Gomez, is that the law can be difficult to enforce except in the most 
deafening cases. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Vehicle Code, a passenger car at highway speeds 
must not exceed a noise level of 82 decibels and a motorcycle must be below 86 
decibels. For big trucks traveling faster than 35 m.p.h., noise cannot exceed 
90 decibels. (Eighty-two decibels, incidentally, is the sound of, well, a car 
going at highway speed.) 
</P>
<P>
 But what does all that mean? 
</P>
<P>
 The decibel system is used to measure sound. A sound measured at 30 decibels 
is 10 times as loud as one measured at 20 decibels. Our threshold of hearing 
begins around 10 decibels and uncomfortably loud noises, such as a military jet 
taking off, log in at about 120 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem faced by officers trying to enforce noise laws is that a lot 
depends on perception. For instance, a noise at 6 a.m., when there are few 
other sounds, might be perceived as louder than the same noise at 2 p.m., when 
the clamor of daily life is in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since establishing a decibel level is difficult, officers often will stop a 
loud vehicle, typically a motorcycle, and check the muffler. It's easier to 
write a ticket for someone illegally modifying or removing a muffler than to 
catch them for violating noise statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing about a problem that I've never seen addressed in any forum: the 
atrocious driving habits of so many Los Angeles police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen police cars run red lights, turn without signaling, make illegal 
turns and cut off other drivers -- and never because they were chasing anybody. 
How can we expect ordinary citizens to obey the law, let alone abide by minimal 
standards of courtesy and decency, if the laws are ignored by those sworn to 
enforce them? Do these officers think they're above the law? Perhaps they all 
should be required to take an annual refresher course on traffic safety. A few 
hints from Miss Manners wouldn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you shed some light on this, Street Smart? 
</P>
<P>
 Norra Macready

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 This is a topic that stirs the spleen in more motorists than just you. 
Unfortunately, the light we can shed on the subject isn't too bright. 
</P>
<P>
 What is certain is that all police officer candidates must indeed prove their 
driving skills if they want to qualify for the force. "Part of the training 
that we're given in the academy . . . is driver's training," says Officer Lorie 
Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The training involves several different types of scenarios, such as emergency 
driving. Once out of the academy, officers continue to receive periodic 
in-service training behind the wheel. As to how such courses are applied on the 
road is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 It irks me that every time my car registration comes due, I pay it, yet there 
are many thousands of cars on the road that are not registered. I have 
calculated that there are 500,000-plus cars on the road that are unregistered, 
meaning millions of dollars are not being collected that the state can use to 
repair roads, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like the DMV is doing little or nothing to correct this. If the DMV 
cannot do its job and more help is needed, I am looking for a job and have a 
few ideas that will clear up this mess within a year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations on your mathematical prowess -- your calculations aren't far 
from the mark, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly how many cars in California are 
unregistered, "because, well, they're unregistered," says Bill Madison, DMV 
spokesman. The guesstimate is 1% to 2% of total registered vehicles (26 
million) in California, or about 250,000 to 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Translate this into lost revenue, with average registration and licensing fees 
of $138 per vehicle, and "you're looking easily at a little over $35 million to 
$70 million," Madison says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's a huge chunk of change, but the DMV does not have resources it can 
devote exclusively to catching scofflaws, and relies heavily on the California 
Highway Patrol and local law enforcement agencies to help out. The department 
also calls on the services of the state Franchise Tax Board, which can go so 
far as to garnish the wages of people who ignore repeated reminders to renew 
their registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 As for your offer to help, it would no doubt be appreciated, but it would 
probably have to be on a volunteer basis, given the DMV's limited budget. 
</P>

FINDING ANOTHER KIND OF UNDERSTANDING; HEALTH: MEMBERS OF A VAN NUYS SUPPORT 
GROUP FOR LESBIANS WITH LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESSES SHARE THEIR COMPLEX 
STRUGGLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christine Anne Wolfe is a lesbian with a wide network of friends and 
professional associates, both gay and straight. When she learned four years ago 
that she had Hodgkin's disease, a severe form of cancer, she counted on them 
for support. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were certain aspects of the disease and its emotional impact that 
even her closest friends could not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a falling out about something with a friend," said Christine, 33, 
who uses a cane to help her walk, "it might take six months to patch it up. But 
I might not have six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither might the other women who were meeting, as they do every Friday 
morning, in a spare conference room in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, 31, who asked that her last name not be used, has scleroderma, a 
degenerative tissue disease. "My girlfriend left and I was swamped with the 
changes in my body," she said. "After a while, your friends and your family max 
out, they can't take it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, friends inadvertently make them feel worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love it when you open up to someone," Kim said, "and they try to make 
you feel better by saying, 'Well, tomorrow you could get hit by a bus.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The women laughed. They had all been there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That 'get hit by a bus' line gets old, real fast," said Sally Verdon, 49, who 
has had a mastectomy for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," Kim said, looking at the other women in the room, "I think the 
only people in my life I can talk to about my illness are in this group." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lesbians With Life-Threatening Diseases support group, sponsored by the L. 
A. Shanti nonprofit service organization, has been meeting for just over a 
year. Its members are few but devoted. And although there are dozens of support 
groups in Los Angeles dealing with issues of women, lesbians and fatal illness, 
these women don't feel they fit into them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the name of the group suggests, it has specific requirements for 
membership. The women involved are the first to laugh about how exclusive they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to feel you can go somewhere and talk where you have something in 
common with the others," said Rebecca, a group member, in a telephone 
interview. She has metastatic melanoma and was too sick to attend the meeting. 
"You don't have to worry about what some other woman might think of you, about 
coming out. 
</P>
<P>
 "On top of dealing with cancer, I didn't want to deal with all these other 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the women, including the outspoken Sally, did try other illness 
groups. "I noticed that when I disclosed that I was a lesbian, some of the 
other women looked like they had swallowed their faces," Sally said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out in the parking lot some of them were pointing at me and talking. I don't 
know if they had never seen a lesbian before, or what their problem was." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally, a Van Nuys resident who formerly worked as a barber before getting 
sick, is not known for treading lightly when she detects homophobia. But to 
avoid disrupting the group, she left it. 
</P>
<P>
 "These women had enough to deal with," she said. "I didn't want to make them 
feel uncomfortable. It wasn't fair." 
</P>
<P>
 As important as the Friday-morning sessions are to these women, the support 
group had a hard time getting off the ground. "We first tried it in 1990," said 
Jeannie, a Shanti volunteer who is one of the group's two facilitators. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea came from a Shanti official after a discussion about lesbian health 
problems at a conference. For example, it was pointed out that because lesbians 
usually do not bear children and therefore do not produce breast milk, they are 
at a higher risk for getting breast cancer than heterosexual women. 
</P>
<P>
 Word about the new group was spread through Lesbian News and other 
publications and the first meetings were held in a conference room at Midway 
Hospital in Los Angeles. But at most, only one or two women showed up for the 
evening meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are plenty of women out there who could benefit from the 
group," Jeannie said, "but it was a constant battle to get them to come. I 
think women are a little bit more closeted than gay men. There were worries 
about confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said that a spirit of independence among lesbians probably also 
contributed to low turnouts. "Just like everyone else, most lesbians came here 
from other parts of the country," she said. "Where they were, there might not 
have been support groups for lesbians or much of a lesbian community. They 
learned to rely on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 That first group disbanded after a few meetings, but the regulars, Sally and 
Christine, persisted in their requests that Shanti try again. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the group was reconvened in the Valley, this time for morning 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, these women are sicker," Jeannie said, "and they aren't well enough 
to work anyway, so they can meet in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 With Kim and Rebecca eventually joining, the core group was formed. Other 
women attended from time to time, but none became regulars. One woman who was 
attending regularly was told that she was no longer welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had falsely represented that she was sick to get into the group," Jeannie 
said. "A friend of hers told us the truth after she had been coming for a 
while. I think the woman needed the attention, she wanted a social group. 
</P>
<P>
 "But these women don't meet to socialize. It's to share strength and 
experiences and hope." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a second facilitator at the meetings: Lynn Andreoli Woods, 41, who 
trained to be a Shanti volunteer last year because she wanted to do AIDS 
volunteer work, Shanti's primary mission. But because Lynn is a night student 
at Cal State Northridge and available mornings, Shanti officials asked her to 
help with the lesbian group instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn is the only straight person who attends the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worried a bit about what they might think about having a straight woman 
there," she said, "but when you are dealing with the real issues, the 
passionate issues of life, it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sexual orientation was not mentioned at the first few meetings Lynn 
attended. But then she met up with Sally at the gay pride parade in West 
Hollywood and Sally asked her, "Is your lover here with you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn was taken aback. "I just didn't feel free enough to say, 'Bill is picking 
me up,' " she said. "There I was at an open expression of gay rights and I was 
in this reverse situation. I was having trouble with the pronoun. It was 
ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 She came out to the group shortly thereafter. "They had no trouble with it at 
all," Lynn said. "I guess some straight women might feel uncomfortable at the 
meetings -- there is a lot of randy humor sometimes -- but it's a gift to be in 
the presence of that much courage and humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca's weakened condition is one of the more serious topics of discussion 
at the meeting. "It has bought out the possibility that we might lose someone 
in the group," Sally said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I joined the group, because I had already relapsed once, I thought I 
would be the most likely one to go first," said Christine, who found out that 
she was sick on the same day she received her doctorate in clinical psychology 
at USC. "When Rebecca joined, I realized it might not be me." 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you feel about the fact that you might not be the forerunner?" Jeannie 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine's hands fidgeted nervously as she thought for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew her odds when she came here," she said. "It made me think about myself 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine was clearly relieved when the conversation turned to romance. Like 
doting mothers, the older women in the group quizzed Kim about a blind date she 
had on vacation in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had dinner with a Mountie," Kim said with a laugh. "It was just dinner, it 
was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim had also recently heard from her old girlfriend. "Maybe she wants to get 
back together, but I just don't think I can take it, physically, any more," she 
said. Her disease increasingly saps her energy and makes movement painful. "The 
emotional stuff is so hard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exhausting," Sally agreed. She, too, lost a lover during the time she 
was ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think this group is really advice to the lovelorn," Kim said, and 
the women launched into a discussion about people who don't understand that 
when they are feeling well, they still seek romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine offered: "My ex once said about me, " 'One day she tells you she's 
dying, the next day she tells you she's in love.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Like we're supposed to ride off into the sunset and that's it," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And never date again," Christine added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim shook her head and sighed. "It's been three years now, up and down," she 
said. "No wonder my friends have maxed out." 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll probably outlive them all," Sally said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow," Kim said with a smile, "they'll probably get hit by a bus."

REPAIR NEEDS STILL PLAGUE 2 HIGH SCHOOLS; FACILITIES: OFFICIALS DESPERATELY 
SEEK WAYS TO RENOVATE THE AGING CAMPUSES. BURBANK VOTERS RECENTLY REJECTED A 
BOND MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Burbank High School opened its doors, Warren G. Harding was in the White 
House and Irving Berlin's hit tune "April Showers" was on everybody's radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1922 and the 110 students who attended the new senior high at 3rd 
Street and Burbank Boulevard had to travel to the edge of town to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nearly 2,000 students go to BHS, and the school, with its peeling paint 
and leaky roof, is in the heart of the community that grew up around it. 
</P>
<P>
 And after the failure of a $100-million bond issue earlier this month, the old 
high school is also at the center of an increasingly urgent debate in this city 
over what to do about its aging public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just a brick-and-mortar problem. A close look at Burbank High makes 
it clear that poor conditions there in particular are hurting the quality of 
education. Some classrooms seem dangerously dark. Forty-year-old fluorescent 
ceiling fixtures make it hard to read in the dim, yellow haze. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's hot, there is little air conditioning and what there is isn't 
reliable. When it's cold, the heat can't be trusted either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wear my coat all day long," said library technician Lynn Golnick. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, power failures occur regularly, as do stopped-up toilets 
and locker-room shower drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising taxes to get the funds needed to fix such things isn't a popular idea. 
The proposed bond issue -- Burbank's first since 1952 -- would have cost most 
residents less than $50 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure on the April 12 ballot had passed, the district also would have 
received about $23 million from the city's Redevelopment Agency and about $15 
million from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $100 million of the total would have gone into the two senior high 
schools, Burbank and Burroughs: about $56 million to tear down Burbank High and 
rebuild it, and $49 million to renovate Burroughs, built in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 The two schools are in equally sad shape, said Board President Elena Hubbell. 
"But if I had to pick one that best exemplifies problems throughout the 
district, it would be Burbank." A few months ago, the district hired Ali A. 
Kiafar, a 41-year-old architect who also has a doctorate in urban planning from 
USC, to tackle those problems. As assistant superintendent for planning 
development and facilities, he is paid $83,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Kiafar's first chores will be deciding which repairs must be made at 
Burbank High this summer to keep the old school open another year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, he already knows that about $20,000 will go into fixing the 
leaky roof. But things like painting the school -- which hasn't been done for a 
decade now -- is out of the question. So is replacing rotten wooden door and 
window frames. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't do cosmetic things in a situation like this," Kiafar said, shaking 
his head. "There are major, major problems with the physical plant. Wiring, 
plumbing, heating, sewers, all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district will eventually have to sell bonds to build a new high 
school, Hubbell said. It may try again as early as November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've looked at every type of funding available and we just have no choice," 
said Hubbell. "The money isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the board plans to hold a town-hall-type meeting next month to give 
other residents another chance to air their suggestions. The meeting is 
tentatively scheduled for May 14 at Burroughs High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The same struggle to repair or replace aging schools is going on in other 
communities throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the problem can be traced to California's landmark Proposition 13. 
Since the 1978 property-tax cut, school districts have had to rely on bond 
sales to help make up the revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 But those bond issues often fail. This year alone, voters in at least five 
communities in addition to Burbank have rejected them, according to the 
California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason why is no mystery to Burbank resident Elizabeth Michael, a 
37-year-old former political campaign consultant now running for Congress and 
an outspoken opponent of the recent ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an anti-tax tide in this country that won't quit," she said. Burbank 
school officials "can put this on the ballot every year for the next 10 years 
and it won't pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael added that although she agrees that Burbank High needs work, "I'm not 
convinced of the urgency of those improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 How serious are conditions at the old high school? 
</P>
<P>
 On a tour of the campus last week, Kiafar and David Gott, director of 
facilities planning, pointed out several areas they are most concerned about. 
Gott has worked at Burbank High for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of well-meaning attempts have been made over nearly three-quarters of 
a century to expand and modernize Burbank High. But in the process, it has 
grown like Topsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several additions of different sizes and shapes have been tacked onto both 
ends of the original building. The result is a long string of buildings spread 
over several blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now so far from one end of the school to the other, Gott said, that 
students have to run to make it in the six minutes they have between classes. 
</P>
<P>
 A student with a science class at the north end of campus one period and 
industrial arts the next at the far south end "can't possibly get there dodging 
1,700 other kids," he said. There are no elevators in the original three-story 
building or other facilities for handicapped students. The old concrete stairs 
are narrow and steep. A wheelchair would never make it through the cave-like 
doorway of the girls' restroom on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The school library isn't air-conditioned, nor are most of its 63 classrooms, 
many of which also face west. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably half of the 20-foot-high windows in those classrooms have been 
painted shut, according to Gott. Outside, 1950s-era metal louvers over the 
windows intended to keep out the heat and glare are stiff with rust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident there are days when the temperature in some of these rooms hits 
115 or 120 degrees," Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dank first-floor storeroom, the smell still lingers from a family of 
stray cats that crawled in below it through a rotten window screen earlier this 
year and made a home for a while.

 The high school's ancient electrical system is inadequate "to say the least," 
said Kiafar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some areas have just one circuit breaker for every three classrooms. Teachers 
try to avoid blowing fuses by warning each other when their students will be 
using computers or when they plan to show movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The plumbing system, which frequently backs up, isn't any better, Gott said. 
Many of the school's underground sewer lines, as well as water and gas pipes, 
date back to the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 A large, heated outdoor pool, built in 1931, looks pretty good from the 
water's edge. But one level down, in a room next to the pool where the filter 
equipment sits, Gott points to a deteriorating concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, steel bars were added to reinforce the wall. Just on the 
other side is the pool. "We're checking it every day now for leaks," Gott said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SESSION TO EXAMINE ZONING CODE CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will hold a study session at 6:30 tonight to discuss a 
proposed overhaul of the city's zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is open to the public, but unlike regular meetings of the council, 
the study session does not include a forum for public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments will be received at a public hearing later this year, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Pierce, an associate planner on the city's staff, said the proposed 
overhaul would be of zoning regulations dating back to 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance code has become difficult to understand and contradictory," 
Pierce said. "In addition, it contains many out-of-date provisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The session will be held in Room B-8 at City Hall, 2000 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the proposed new zoning ordinance is available for public viewing in 
the city clerk's office at City Hall and at the city's Central Library, 7111

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL 'OFFICE HOURS' GET MIXED RECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers and students at University High School are working to fine-tune an 
unusual class schedule that has been criticized by some parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the schedule is twice-weekly "office hours," in which 
students meet with instructors individually or in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Some district officials have hailed the office hours as an innovative way of 
bringing students and teachers together in a personal setting to further 
discuss classroom lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Many University High teachers also support the hours because they allow 
instructors to focus extra attention on students who need help. Teachers spend 
about two hours a week seeing students during the "office hours." 
</P>
<P>
 But the program has also faced some problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District Board of Education this month received a 
survey that found a substantial number of University High seniors and juniors 
do not regularly take advantage of the office hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have also complained that schedule is too loose and that some students 
who do not use the office hours simply leave campus. 
</P>
<P>
 University High recently rescheduled office hours. They now occur in the 
mid-morning rather than at the beginning and end of the school day, said junior 
Luke Fenchel, 16, a member of a steering committee looking into the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have also closed some exits to the campus and posted 
administrators at other exits to prevent students from leaving during office 
hours, Fenchel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The steering committee will continue to look into the issue over the next few 
weeks. Eventually, it will report back to the school board with ideas for 
improving the program. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea is to bring guest speakers and college recruiters onto campus during 
office hours so that students who are not meeting with teachers will have more 
to do, Fenchel said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Margie Wakeham said she sees much merit in the office 
hours concept and hopes any problem with the program can be worked out. SHELBY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; LEAGUE FOR KIDS COVERS ALL THE BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this baseball league, it doesn't matter if the players strike out, miss a 
catch, or if the team wins or loses -- and no player ever sits out innings on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis is on having fun as well as learning how to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is a positive attitude," said Mike Cavenee, who has coached with 
the city-organized P-Nut baseball league for the past five years. "We don't 
argue with the umpire, and we play the kids in as many positions as we can, 
because no kid ever learned how to play baseball standing out in the field 
watching the grass grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you won't see kids hanging their heads when they go off the field if they 
lose a game," said Cavenee, who coaches two P-Nut teams. "They're having fun, 
and that's all that counts." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is open to boys and girls ages 5 to 14. Rick Gomez, a coach and 
the city's parks and recreation commissioner, said it offers an alternative to 
other organized leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance for kids who aren't stars to play a full game and have a good 
time at it. When someone strikes out, everyone says, 'Nice try,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gomez's view, the P-Nut league offers a lighter side to the competitiveness 
of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 When the season opens May 9, teams play games against each other until late 
July, when the competitive part of the season starts and elimination 
tournaments are held. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the league has its place -- that's why it's real popular," Gomez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has been around for more than 25 years, and this year about 1,000 
youths are participating. There are 60 teams; each usually has three volunteer 
coaches and a number of parents who pitch in to help. 
</P>
<P>
 For the players, once they play, many come back year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my favorite sport," said a precocious Jimmy Eichmann, 8, who is entering 
his third year in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a real good player, because I've been practicing a lot," he said 
matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy, who is on the Pirates teams, also said he's learned that winning isn't 
everything: "I just do my best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavenee said the lessons learned on the ball field are not all about how to 
play the game. The players learn to be part of a team and to have pride and 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents agreed that the league offers their children an opportunity to achieve 
-- without the cutthroat competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this league. It's not real hard-core as far as winning," said Dave 
See, whose 6-year-old son, Bradley, is on the Pirates. "There's a team spirit, 
and it's important to get the kids to play as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 David Eichmann, Jimmy's father, agreed that "they don't put any pressure on 
the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because they do promote that it's just for fun." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LAW WOULD PROTECT FISH IN CITY LAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can catch it, but you can't keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the lake-fishing rule under a city ordinance introduced last 
week.The law, which would become effective by early June, would require fishing 
enthusiasts to throw back anything they catch in lakes within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved the ordinance at its first reading, 
after the city staff urged passage. Staff representatives, in a memo, said that 
stocks of fish are declining in city lakes, which are no longer routinely 
restocked by the state. The staff said that the catch-and-throw-back law would 
also protect public health in case lakes ever became contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 No one -- fishing enthusiast or otherwise -- protested the proposed new law. 
The change would not affect fishing off the city's Municipal Pier. All 
legal-size fish caught there may still be kept. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SENIORS TO ASK CITY TO BACK OCTA SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senior Citizens Committee will ask the City Council to send a resolution 
to the county to support the popular Dial-A-Ride van service, which is used 
mostly by older people. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee member Stanley Bieza explained that many seniors will not qualify 
for the federally mandated ACCESS service that is to replace Dial-A-Ride.Though 
not disabled, the elderly people still may find it hard to use the regular bus 
service, especially if they are carrying shopping bags or other loads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority will consider a plan in May to 
phase out Dial-A-Ride. The county is required by the federal Americans With 
Disabilities Act to provide public transportation to the disabled, and the high 
cost of the ACCESS program makes it necessary to cut back on other services, 
OCTA has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bieza said some people may not see themselves as qualified to use a van for 
the disabled. "There's lots of people who are just getting old," he said. 
"They're willing to use Dial-A-Ride, but they don't want to use charity." 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has held public meetings throughout the county to gather opinions about 
the changes and will make a presentation May 9 to the county Planning 
Commission. The 9 a.m. meeting will be at 10 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CLINTON JOINS BUSH IN HONORING ELI HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the few things former President George Bush and President Bill Clinton 
apparently agree on is the value of the Eli Home. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization, dedicated to preventing child abuse, was named the 
338th Point of Light by Bush three years ago and now is set to receive a 
Presidential Citation from Clinton for outstanding community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to me," said Lorri Galloway, executive director and co-founder 
of the home. "To be recognized by two presidents in a row seems phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway and a handful of the home's 225 volunteers will travel to Washington 
in early May to pick up the latest award. The Anaheim organization was one of 
only 40 groups and individuals selected for the honor from a nationwide field 
of 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 11 years, the Eli Home has helped more than 8,000 parents and children 
with its counseling and other support services. In 1993 alone, the home treated 
1,025 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization offers emergency shelter, counseling and therapy to mothers 
and children who have suffered emotional, physical or sexual abuse. The group, 
which has an annual budget of $250,000, receives no state or federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest strength is our volunteers," Galloway said. "We do the work of 
organizations that have 10 times the budget we do because of the quality of our 
volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime volunteer is Daphne Sizemore of Tustin, who has been serving at 
the home since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the warmth of being able to give," Sizemore said. "We truly have put 
our hearts into making it work, and it hasn't been easy. It's very exciting to 
get this recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to treatment, the home also tries to emphasize child abuse 
prevention. Child abuse affects one in four youngsters in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "By focusing on prevention, you are really making a much stronger contribution 
to social change," Galloway said. "If you aren't dealing with prevention, you 
aren't doing anything but putting a Band-Aid on the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway said the Eli Home will open another facility in Anaheim Hills within 
three months. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; GRANT TO HELP PAY FOR SYSTEMS UPGRADE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will receive a $120,000 state grant to help pay for the cost of 
improving the lighting and air conditioning systems at City Hall and the police 
and fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will come from the $304 million that the state has received so far 
from a fund created by oil companies to pay back overcharges to U.S. consumers 
from 1973 to 1981, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state legislature recently approved the grant through the efforts of 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 "I can think of no better use for these funds than to upgrade or replace 
outdated, energy-wasteful systems," Umberg said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will cover the cost of a new and more energy-efficient lighting and 
air conditioning system that will save the city about $35,000 a year, city 
administrative analyst George A. Skelton said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL DRESS CODE, GRADE POLICY STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District's Board of Education has completed a first 
reading of new districtwide policies that address everything from dress codes 
to combatting campus drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 Review of the document, "Board Policy Series 5000," went relatively smoothly 
at last week's meeting.But trustees differed over a section stating that a 
student with 10 unexcused absences may be given a failing grade in a class. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Martin Jacobson argued that 10 unexcused absences should 
automatically cause the student to receive a failing grade. Board members 
Robert H. Viviano and Bill Lewis countered that teachers should have discretion 
in failing a student. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the new policies would permit school officials to ban certain 
types of clothing if officials suspect the apparel is gang-related. Also, the 
policy supports the school's right to conduct unannounced searches with 
specially trained dogs to sniff out drugs and other illegal substances on 
school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to review and adopt the document at its Thursday 
meeting. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY, SWIM TEAM AT IMPASSE OVER FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City negotiators have reached an impasse with the Nadadores swim team about 
use of a city-owned swimming complex. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff will ask the City Council today to give it direction after the team 
and the city failed to reach agreement on a 10-year lease for use of the swim 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city report, the two sides have reached a stalemate on whether 
the city should pay for maintaining the Olympic-size swimming and diving 
stadium -- at a cost of about $2.65 million over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's proposal would allow the Nadadores to lease the complex for $1 per 
year and the swim team would become responsible for utility costs and pool 
maintenance expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease would allow the team complete control of the pool complex for eight 
months out of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would take over the pools for public swim programs during the four 
summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 But after extensive negotiations on April 12, representatives from the 
Nadadores said the team couldn't afford to pay the $265,000 annual cost to run 
the stadium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating an internationally competitive swim team costs about $500,000 
annually, team officials have told the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the Nadadores proposal called for a 10-year agreement with 
cancellation options during years three and six. 
</P>
<P>
 The team would continue paying $1,200 monthly rent on the swim complex and the 
city would keep paying for pool maintenance and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sponsorship of the Mission Viejo Co. for almost 20 years, the 
Nadadores operated an internationally recognized program out of the swimming 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the developer scheduled to leave the city by 1995, the Mission 
Viejo Co. gave notice two years ago that it would drop its support of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with three other recreation facilities, the swim complex was traded to 
the city for an office building. Last year, the city paid to subsidize pool 
expenses as the Nadadores used the complex. 
</P>

L.A. SCENE THE CITY THEN AND NOW

<P>
 Over the years, the crags above Chatsworth Reservoir have been home to some of 
Southern California's wildest and craziest guys. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of a religious cult and eight of his followers died there in a 
dynamite blast set off by two jealous husbands. Later, Charles Manson slept 
there, taken in by some of the remaining members. The beauty of the 
three-mile-long canyon, its rosy sandstone formations honeycombed with caves, 
attracted a religious cult known as WKFL Fountain of the World -- Wisdom, 
Knowledge, Faith and Love -- that built a monastery on the site in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 The colony of 53 adults and children was led by Krishna Venta, a former 
Berkeley boilermaker who changed his name from Francis Pencovic -- an assumed 
identity, he said. Instead, he claimed, he was brought into existence directly 
by God, without human parents, in a Himalayan valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may as well say it, I am Christ," Venta announced in 1949 upon returning 
from a trip to Europe. That he was without a visible bellybutton might have 
clinched the matter for some -- but evidently not for Pope Pius XII, who Venta 
said refused to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The same year, after the performance of a Christmas Passion play, his 
followers -- still in their costumes of cotton robes and bare feet -- decided 
they would no longer wear shoes, or cut their hair, or dress in anything but 
long robes until the world was at peace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The core values of Venta's faith were simple: universal love and equality, 
study and knowledge, and tolerance. He also taught that smoking is good for 
health, and mankind came to Earth in 12 rocket ships powered by cosmic energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise of Venta's philosophy was contained in a chant: "Love one. Love ye 
one another. Love all. Serve ye one another." 
</P>
<P>
 The followers who echoed this refrain came to be regarded as angels of mercy. 
They were volunteer firefighters who went as far as Bakersfield to battle 
flames. They aided earthquake and flood victims, helped out in homes when there 
was illness. When a plane crashed in the canyon, they helped carry out the 
dead. They maintained a food bank for the homeless and over the years the 
commune became a shelter for battered women and a rehabilitation center for 
alcoholics and drug addicts. A Times article dated March 28, 1953, called the 
group "a disaster aid order" whose "gowns have been flecked by burning cinders 
of many fires." 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County fire department didn't see it that way. In 1956, a fire 
captain refused to let any group members help fight fires farther than 200 
yards from their monastery, even though other volunteers were called in to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought their long robes and bare feet were dangerous in fires. Even after 
cult members bought their own firefighting clothes, boots and equipment, 
firefighters were ordered to turn off the sirens when firetrucks left the 
station so sect members would not be alerted to a fire and follow the engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Venta other had other troubles with the authorities, including charges of 
writing bad checks and non-payment of child support. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the group's good deeds ended Dec. 10, 1958, when Brother Peter 
(Elzibah) Kamenoff and Brother Ralph (Jeroham) Muller, who believed that their 
leader was having sex with their wives, set off a bomb with 20 sticks of 
dynamite, killing Venta, themselves and six others. Venta had recently thrown 
Kamenoff and Muller out of the order for disloyalty. They left a two-hour 
tape-recording explaining their reasons, along with notes asking for 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion could be heard more than 20 miles away. The fire it touched off 
burned more than 150 acres. Surviving followers voiced the belief that, like 
Christ, Venta would rise from the dead. A few remained at the monastery; the 
rest moved to Alaska to join Venta's widow, Mother Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, the few cult members remaining in the canyon fed and sheltered a 
homeless Charles Manson for three days. He had dropped in for a little 
spiritual renewal before moving over the hill, to the Spahn Movie Ranch in 
Chatsworth and to mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon's notoriety resurfaced in 1974 when American Indian Movement 
activists Richard Mohawk and Paul Skyhorse, living on the group's property, 
were acquitted of murdering a cabdriver and stuffing his body down a drainpipe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, several members joined the Rev. Jim Jones' Peoples Temple and 
later died with 912 others in mass murder-suicides in Guyana in 1978. Other 
members went back to ordinary lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In property tax records, WKFL Fountain of the World is still listed as the 
owner of the Box Canyon monastery, even though it is also listed as being 
defunct. However, the buildings are leased to a private resident and property 
taxes are paid by Phil Shiver, a longtime canyon activist and resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Venta, who called himself "The Voice," said he could help his followers gain 
knowledge on their journey of 4,304,272,100 years to the spiritual realm. His 
mortal self is buried at Valhalla Memorial Park in North Hollywood. CECILIA

WIND PLAGUES EARTH DAY EVENTS; ACTIVITIES: RAIN WASN'T A PROBLEM, BUT CROWDS AT 
CELEBRATIONS IN TOPANGA AND MALIBU ARE KEPT DOWN BY THE GUSTS.

 The forecast rain didn't dampen Earth Day activities in the San Fernando 
Valley, but gusty winds blew many event-goers away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind's been awful," said Stephanie Cooper, 45, of Calabasas, who brought 
her children to the celebration at Malibu Bluffs Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrible and awful because it blows away all the schmutz. It's kind of a 
trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the expected 2,000 people showed up at the joint 
Calabasas-Malibu event that featured dancers, a tree-planting ceremony, 
environmental booths, Native American exhibits and several contests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu Gym sponsored a park cleanup contest where six teams competed for 
an hour to determine who could pick up the most garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Rand, who moved to Malibu two months ago, joined the competition and the 
day's events to "get a little tan and make friends." Although she had to settle 
for wind-chapped lips instead of a tan, Rand was confident her team would win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never in my life gotten so excited about finding garbage," Rand said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Kouba, 11, joined the contest late, but was determined to help her 
team win one of several prizes awarded by area merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 students from kindergarten through the 12th grade competed in the 
park's art contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Topanga, two dozen volunteers from the Great Los Angeles Clean Up retrieved 
a couch, a checkbook, several tires, fenders and a muffler from Topanga Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was joking that we almost got enough to put a whole car together," said 
Woody Hastings, who organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings said he nearly canceled the cleanup because he thought it would rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers filled 30 bags of trash from a half-mile stretch of the creek, 
one of the last free-flowing creeks in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing bright yellow rubber gloves, boots and a hat, Gretel Shanley waded 
through the creek for nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I care about Topanga and I care about Los Angeles," said the 30-year Topanga 
resident. "This is what we need that matters to this community."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; SANITATION AGENCY, CITY REACH ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two years of conflict with the County Sanitation Districts of Orange 
County concerning the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the city and 
the special agency have resolved their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved a specific plan for the sanitation 
agency's 108-acre site at 10844 Ellis Ave.It defines the rights and 
responsibilities of the two agencies for development of the property, said 
Andrew Perea, city planning services manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the end of a long conflict between the two agencies," Perea said of 
the adopted plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had contended that the sanitation agency was subject to Fountain 
Valley zoning laws, said Perea, while the sanitation agency maintained that the 
sewage treatment facility was exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "State law clearly exempts them from building codes for waste-water treatment 
facilities but not from the zoning ordinances," Perea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John Collins called the agreement between the two agencies a win-win 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We avoided a costly litigation process and both sides got what they wanted," 
said Collins, who is a member of the Sanitation Districts board of directors 
and chairman for District 2, which includes Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, who negotiated the agreement between the city and the sanitation 
agency, said that with the specific plan the city has created a mechanism as 
well as parameters within which the district will build. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the city will have review and approval authority over such 
buildings as administrative offices, laboratories and warehouses. The 
sanitation agency will maintain control of waste-water treatment facilities, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved rezoning the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation agency's plant has been in Fountain Valley since the 1950s. In 
1989, the agency created a 30-year plan for development into the year 2020.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten Tustin High School students have been accepted into UC Irvine's program 
for high school scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, all juniors, will take up to two courses at UCI each quarter in 
addition to their high school classes, said Pete Kellner, a counselor at Tustin 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 By attending the university program, the students will enter college with some 
of their requirements completed, Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are Lakesha Cash, Geoffrey Ching, Kenneth Clark, Krista 
Hollinger, Daniel Hunter-Holly, Eugenia Lai, Noah Margolis, Martin Nakatsu, 
Scott Polston and Eimi Tomimatsu. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellner said the students were selected based on grade-point average, PSAT/SAT 
test scores and recommendations from their counselors. They pay tuition for 
their classes at the same rate as other UCI students, he said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CLASS TEACHES YOUTHS BABY-SITTING SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every month about 30 youths register for a baby-sitting class at a local 
hospital to improve their understanding of child safety and development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes kids feel very equipped," said instructor Anne Faust, a childbirth 
educator at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents feel good because they know when they send their kids off to 
baby-sit, their children are responsible and prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Faust, 29, teaches the class once a month. Registration costs $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellianne Heckathorn, a 13-year-old from Lake Forest, said she took the class 
because she thought it would help in her search for baby-sitting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people wanted people who knew stuff about baby-sitting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heckathorn said class instructors taught her to change diapers and perform 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student, 12-year-old Stephanie Martin, also of Lake Forest, agrees 
that completing the class should help her find work. "I thought it would be 
better if I had a certificate to show people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has learned how to negotiate the price for her services with parents and 
to care for children of different ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the students in the baby-sitting class are between the ages of 11 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 They learn first aid, as well as lifting, holding, burping and putting diapers 
on infants. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also given safety advice such as not opening the door to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust said she strongly encourages students to take a more assertive approach 
when negotiating their fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids kind of get shortchanged sometimes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The going rates for baby-sitting run between $2 and $3 per hour, Faust said. 
However, some students command between $5 and $10 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in an area that is a little more affluent than others, and parents are 
willing to pay that for good care," Faust said. MARY LOU PICKEL

NONPROFIT GROUPS CAN APPLY FOR FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday is the deadline for local nonprofit organizations to apply for funding 
from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 About $8,000 remains to be awarded from the $50,000 the city sets aside each 
year to help charitable groups provide service to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations do not have to be based in Mission Viejo, but their programs 
must benefit city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding applications are reviewed quarterly and requests are approved 
according to a set of criteria, which includes how many Mission Viejo residents 
use the program and whether the needs the program serves are available to local 
residents elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients in recent years have used city funding to help support homes for 
teen-age mothers, services for senior citizens and music outreach programs for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds can also be awarded to groups organizing special civic events and 
cultural arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups interested in applying for community service funds can pick up an 
application at City Hall, 26522 La Alameda. For more information, call the 
Community Service Department at (714) 348-2061.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: SURPRISE 20TH BIRTHDAY BASH PLANNED -- FOR A CAT CALLED 
MANNIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mannix will be honored on his 20th birthday, on May 1, with a surprise party 
at his Agoura home. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be cats, dogs, bunnies and people in attendance to help celebrate 
the longevity of this black, longhaired Siamese and Maine coon cat who was 
retrieved by the Wirth family in Santa Monica, where he was thrown from a 
moving car when he was about three months old. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannix did well as a member of the Wirth clan, which includes Sandi Wirth, her 
25-year-old son Miles, and a couple of dogs, cats and some rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 By the age of 11, Mannix became a star with the lead animal role in a little 
art film called "Lillith's Summer." 
</P>
<P>
 What got him the part, according to Sandi Wirth, a small-animal trainer, was 
Mannix's natural but well-cultivated, deep-throated growl, which has been heard 
in many films and television programs, including a onetime appearance with 
Peter Jennings on the ABC evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 Wirth, until she started working with Mannix, had been almost exclusively a 
dog trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogs love to learn. They get all puffed up and proud about their 
accomplishments, so one day I asked myself, 'Why should dogs have all the fun?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Now any fool knows that you don't teach a cat tricks. A cat's only occupation 
is training its master to respond to cat commands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wirth didn't know that, so she started teaching Mannix some basic tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You work with a cat's own behavior, so when he would pounce on the paper I 
was reading, instead of shooing him off, I would say, 'Good cat,' and give him 
a pet. Pretty soon, he would do it on command," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, every time she would see a cat do something on television, she would 
teach it to Mannix, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that in the years since then, he has learned more than 100 tricks, 
which she calls behaviors, and that her success with Mannix led her to work 
with other cats in a group situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, she has run something called a College for Cats. 
</P>
<P>
 You heard it here first, folks. 
</P>
<P>
 A College for Cats. 
</P>
<P>
 She usually holds one 10-week session in the fall and one in the spring, but 
this spring's session was canceled by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall session will be held at the Voyager Hotel in Van Nuys and costs $175 
for anyone who believes that cats will do anything you tell them to. 
</P>
<P>
 Wirth says she can, working with the owner, teach almost any cat to do a 
number of behaviors, such as a "high-five," bat the glasses off, jump up or get 
down from a counter or roll over. She says the hardest command for most cats to 
learn is "stay." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if your cat is headed for the movies or you just want to 
give it something to do. It doesn't matter if your cat learns two or 100 
behaviors," Wirth said. "What is important is that the owner and pet have fun 
and spend time together." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the 10-week sessions, Wirth throws a graduation party at which 
all the cats wear caps and gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cat college, Wirth still runs training classes for dogs and 
their masters. In her current set of classes, she is teaching the humans and 
canines a dance to music from "A Chorus Line." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't interest Mannix, who hasn't been told that he's having a surprise 
party, but he can tell from all the excitement that something is up. 
</P>
<P>
 Wirth says that she is going to allow Mannix to wear his new Australian bush 
hat to the festivities and that there will be kitty treats all around. Summer 
Community Activities 
</P>
<P>
 Are Booming in Calabasas 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Johnson, the city of Calabasas' director of community services, is a 
former rock musician and Army chaplain's assistant who holds a degree in 
recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also the toast of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 During his initial year in the city post, beginning in January, 1993, he and 
his staff were able to offer about 30 different activities, whereas this 
summer, there will be about 200, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He says much of the credit goes to his staff, the City Council and the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, says Karyn Foley, the new mayor of Calabasas, but Greg's the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone loves this guy. He is just a great gift to the community," Foley 
said. "He's open to suggestion. He's organized and he has good ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 The summer program, which Johnson expects to draw between 2,500 and 3,500 
participants, includes several camps and a full range of programs for everyone 
from toddlers to adults. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the activities are not restricted to Calabasas residents but that the 
brochure for the summer program only goes to those in the area, so that is who 
usually signs up. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says several factors have contributed to the expanded activities, 
including support from the council and community. But he said one of the 
biggest boosts was the recent acquisition of the Calabasas Tennis and Swim 
Club, a previously privately owned property that had fallen into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently bought the land and structures, which include the 
championship tennis facility and Olympic-sized swimming pool overlooking 
Calabasas Lake, for about $1.8 million, which was discounted to $1.67 million 
for payment made in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has been pleased with his initial accomplishment in getting the 
original 30 activities organized within a month of when he signed on in 
December, 1992, and says he is now in a state of something approaching shock at 
the popularity of the program he has put together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like riding on the back of a gorilla," he said, laughing. "The program 
is going off in all directions and keeps gathering strength as it goes."

'MAYBERRY' TURNS TO MAYHEM IN EL SEGUNDO'S CITY ELECTIONS; POLITICS: THE 
TRANQUIL COMMUNITY'S SMALL-TOWN CHARM AGAIN SUFFERS AS TEMPERS FLARED DURING 
COUNCIL CAMPAIGNS.

 Residents in tiny, insulated El Segundo affectionately refer to the city as 
"Mayberry," and often praise the town for its tranquil streets and small-town 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then come the elections. Every two years, rival political camps square off 
over City Council seats. Signs are pilfered, accusations fly, aspersions are 
cast and "Mayberry" transforms to mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's horrible," said Wendy Wallace, owner of Wendy's Place, a gathering spot 
in downtown El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace placed a sign in her cafe's window recently chiding a resident who 
took out a political ad in the local newspaper. The ad suggested that incumbent 
Alan West, whose daughter was stabbed and strangled in February, might be 
reelected out of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to walk in here and put a 'for sale' sign in the window," she said. 
Something that personal and painful should not be part of politics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the tame elections in many South Bay cities, El Segundo's politics are 
often down-and-dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 During a candidates' forum several weeks ago, City Councilman Michael Robbins 
sat in the front row of the audience and held up a sign reading "LIAR" when 
incumbent J.B. Wise spoke, many who attended the forum said. Robbins was not 
available for comment. At the same forum, Wise called one of the other 
candidates a "son of a bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Cable Advisory Committee convened an emergency meeting and 
voted to edit potentially slanderous comments from another candidates' forum 
before it aired on the local cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am as thoroughly disgusted as I've ever been," said Wise, a 
third-generation resident who, along with West, lost in last week's election to 
two political newcomers. "For the first time in my life, after that forum, El 
Segundo didn't feel like it was home." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 15,000 residents live in a Midwestern-style community that is both 
"Mayberry," a cozy, small town where children still play hide-and-seek in their 
neighbors' yards -- and the self-proclaimed "Aerospace Capitol of the World," 
where some of the world's most sophisticated high-tech machinery is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attribute the often mean-spirited politicking to a heightened concern for 
El Segundo's future. The city has been hit hard by the decline in the aerospace 
industry, and candidates debated how to fill the city's many empty buildings. 
Others say it's just good old, small-town politics, where personality conflicts 
play as big a role in elections as policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Liam B. Weston, 29, said raucous political fights are in his blood. The newly 
elected councilman's mother campaigned for an El Segundo council candidate 
shortly after his birth in a similarly rough election. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election neared, residents flooded the local newspaper with letters, 
wielding accusations and chiding candidates. When the letters were rejected for 
being too long, some took out ads and crammed pointed words into small boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's politically active residents often can be divided into two camps -- 
those who enthusiastically support new business and those who do not. Council 
members and candidates often deny an affiliation to a particular camp and 
maintain that the viewpoints are not mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Waag Friedkin, who knocked on residents' doors as she campaigned for a 
council seat, said El Segundo is "cliquish." She said she was frequently asked 
how long she has lived in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be an El Segundoan you have to have practically lived your whole life 
here," Friedkin said. Because she has resided in the city 23 years, Friedkin 
said she believes she passed the test: She won a seat on the council.

GEORGE RAMOS: CAMPUS CONFLICT: STUDENTS GIVEN LESSONS IN STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's one of the oldest games around on a college campus, the one between 
protesting students who want change and administrators who won't rush headlong 
into anything. 
</P>
<P>
 As a onetime campus "militant," I can tell you students take the game very 
seriously. We hated it when the administration pulled a fast one or 
outmaneuvered us. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that the administration, from the president on down, really doesn't 
enjoy dealing with demanding students who think their cause is the most 
righteous in the universe. But I bet the top brass occasionally takes a measure 
of satisfaction when it outflanks the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 It shows them who's really in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest chapter in this struggle took place the other day at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The political climate at SC isn't to be confused with that of hated rival UCLA 
-- or UC Berkeley for that matter. But the revitalized interest by Latino 
students in social issues -- sparked in part by the death last year of farm 
workers leader Cesar Chavez -- has found its way to SC, where 14% of the 13,500 
undergraduates are Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 A student group, La Raza Political Action Committee, staged a noontime rally 
at the Tommy Trojan statue to press its demand, made back in October, that the 
administration rename a patch of grass on campus in honor of Chavez. The 
students think he is deserving of such a tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 The hitch is, that parcel is currently called E.F. Hutton and Company Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the students want an outdoor Latino-themed mural. They ask that it be on 
a wall that overlooks the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 SC's vice president for student affairs, James Dennis, listened to the 
students, but what they asked for was too much. He countered with proposals 
that the kids reject. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis says Hutton Park won't be renamed. "It would be illegal and 
inappropriate," he says, explaining that it's unfair to donors to name 
buildings or parks after them only to remove their name later. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private institution, SC isn't about to reject the generosity of 
well-heeled companies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the school will honor Chavez with a plaque, but its location hasn't 
been determined yet. Also, Dennis says a Latino-theme mural will be painted 
inside the Topping Student Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that SC's responses are part of a series of initiatives it is 
undertaking to strengthen its ties to L.A.'s Latino community. Among other 
things, the school will offer a Chicano studies major this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiatives have broad support, including from SC's governing board of 
trustees. In a jab at La Raza, one influential Latino trustee, Dr. Edward 
Zapanta, is quoted in a school press release as supporting the school's 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the Chicano students are upset. They scream foul, arguing that SC's 
responses are inadequate, and accuse administrators of trying to take credit 
for things the kids proposed in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's blatant tokenism," says Daniel Ruiz, a freshman who is majoring in 
political science. "USC sits in the middle of one of the dynamic cities in the 
world where more than 40% of the population is Latino. It's somewhat scared 
because the dynamics are changing (in Los Angeles) and it's afraid of losing 
the funds from traditional corporate types." 
</P>
<P>
 The students say they're going to continue their fight for Chavez Park, an 
outdoor mural and a school-sanctioned boycott of table grapes. But they aren't 
saying what they'll do if they don't get their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis, who is leaving SC in July after 27 years to become a college president 
in the Midwest, says he doesn't know how the controversy will be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As protest rallies go, SC's last Thursday was sedate. It wasn't as dramatic as 
the hunger strike last year at UCLA over demands for a Chicano studies 
department or the protests that have attracted thousands of marchers at UC 
Santa Barbara over that school's refusal to hire Chicano scholar Rodolfo Acuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students were attracted by the rally's music, while others rushed off to 
study for final exams. Two in the back of the crowd had signs that said, 
"Chavez was not a Trojan." 
</P>
<P>
 The rally drew about 175 Chicano students and supporters. Several speakers 
blasted the administration for dissin' Latino history and culture, sometimes 
using four-letter words to emphasize their arguments. One rap group raised a 
few eyebrows when its members bellowed, "We got the rage to pump a 12-gauge!" 
</P>
<P>
 But while the kids were raising hell, the game was being played out. Very 
quietly, a campus public relations man sought out reporters who came to the 
rally to give them press releases to promote the school's Latino initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, SC's administrators are winning the game.

TV FANTASY CAN GO TOO FAR; ROBERT DONAHUE, PRINCIPAL, LAS COLINAS SCHOOL, 
CAMARILLO

<P>
 I first heard about the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" from a student who was 
sent to my office for playing inappropriately on the playground. He and a group 
of second-grade boys had created their own version of the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 It is my understanding that the game they invented involved setting a trap 
with the ultimate aim of breaking someone's neck. The boys placed sand on the 
monkey bar rungs in hopes of causing the enemy to lose his grip and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids chose sides, the good guys and the bad guys, and they assumed the 
names of the characters on the show.  
</P>
<P>
 As I was talking to this student, who said he watched the show every day, it 
became obvious to me that he did not have any concept of what was real and what 
was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids usually don't develop the ability to think abstractly until the third 
grade. First- and second-graders don't have the ability to separate real 
characters from fantasy situations. That's why I think these kinds of shows are 
so destructive to a child's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking to this student, I decided to watch the show to see what it was 
all about. And, I can understand why it's so popular. It's quick-moving. The 
karate kicks and flips, which are routinely part of the show, appeal to 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to believe that the show's writers have some social conscience 
and would think about the effect they are having on children. And, I also 
wonder about the people at the Fox TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is bad enough, but the network airs commercials for "The Wonder 
Years," whose characters routinely call each other "butt-head." And they 
promote "Married With Children," which portrays the father as a boob with a 
wife and kids who have no respect for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In school, we work on building kindness and respect. These shows run counter 
to everything we do.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything we try to do in the classroom comes apart on the playground, when 
the kids start mimicking what they see on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 I think parents have a responsibility to watch what their kids are viewing and 
talk to them. I'd recommend that they shut the television off. I don't think 
kids need to see this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 We all talk about consistency. No wonder the kids are confused. They are 
getting all these mixed messages.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WHAT I'VE LEARNED

<P>
By ESA-PEKKA SALONEN, After a meteoric rise in the music world as a conducting 
wunderkind, Esa-Pekka Salonen landed here in 1992 to head the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. Earlier this month, Salonen, 35, discussed some of the things he 
has learned in his first two years in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As my second season as music director of the L . A . Philharmonic comes to a 
close, I thought it might be a good idea to do some retroactive thinking. I 
have learned a lot about mainly two things . The first thing is the 
much-publicized multicultural society which I knew of theoretically but not in 
practical terms. Now, I realize that this multicultural society is one of the 
most exciting things I can imagine, and at the same time it is also one of the 
most complex, difficult issues in the history of civilization. As head of a 
large arts organization I think that we need to react to the reality around 
ourselves and not do the usual arts organization thing -- i.e., forget about 
the outside world. This is a constant source of stimulation, but also 
headaches. This is one of the most interesting things that has happened to me. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing that is completely new for me is to lead an orchestra that 
does not have 95% government support for the arts. I grew up in Finland and my 
first years as a professional conductor I spent in Sweden where the arts enjoy 
the full support of the government. Then I came here and I realized that things 
were different. After a while, though, I realized that things weren't that 
different . We have to rely on the support of the government in the United 
States, in a sense, since most of the gifts given to nonprofit organizations 
are tax deductible and in the end the government pays for the arts.  
</P>
<P>
 In a way the American system is more honest because as long as there's a large 
enough group of people who want to keep the Phil alive, we'll have the 
Philharmonic. It's somehow fair play that if we manage to produce concerts and 
events that reach enough people we are in business and if we don't we're out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel greatly encouraged after these two years. There is indeed a future for 
classical music in Southern California. There's always been, but I didn't know 
it.

 Cindy has always struggled with her weight. She experiments with the latest 
diets and different weight loss programs -- but to no avail.Her weight 
fluctuates and she has become extremely sensitive about her body. One day, 
while crossing the university campus, she runs into a former male classmate 
from Iran who greets her enthusiastically. "Cindy, you look good. You gained 
weight!" Cindy is crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to how it appeared, the young man was praising her appearance. In 
many cultures, thinness is not a characteristic to be admired. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle East, a beautiful woman is amply proportioned. In Farsi, the 
Persian language, they call it "kopoly," or "topoly." Wide hips signify that 
women can produce children. Thus they are considered appealing and good 
candidates for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Correspondingly, in Indian poetry beautiful women have been referred to as 
having the graceful walk of an elephant. And in the mid- to late-19th Century, 
plumpness was even fashionable in the United States. Women competed over their 
weight gains because they believed that fat promoted health and beauty.

<P>
 Day after day, quietly working behind the scenes and away from the headlines, 
a small army of police and religious and community leaders have been searching 
for ways to end gang violence in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Have the anti-gang efforts been successful? It depends on who you talk to. The 
experts have their theories and community leaders are optimistic, but the 
police still don't see an end to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, there are more than 1,100 gangs and 157,000 gang members in Los 
Angeles County, according to Sgt. Wes McBride of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. And, although deaths due to gang violence declined 
slightly in 1993 from 1992, they are up slightly so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gang violence is cyclical," says Malcolm Klein, professor of sociology at 
USC. "It starts coming down when the gang members themselves really get 
concerned that it's getting out of control. It has more to do with the internal 
dynamics of the gang than anything else." That theory, however, is not likely 
to dissuade community leaders intent on getting kids off the streets and away 
from drugs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Testimony, Louis Negrete, chairman of Hope in Youth, talks about 
his program, which brought together an unprecedented coalition of religious 
leaders determined to break the cycle of violence in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The key appears to be strengthening family, school and religious ties. Even 
the LAPD has gotten into the act with a program called Jeopardy, which 
identifies high-risk youth and gets them and their families into counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has been highly successful in the (San Fernando) Valley in 
averting the tragedy of young people becoming lost in the vortex of gang 
violence and everything that goes along with it," says Deputy Chief Mark 
Kroeker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the community at large is very supportive of the department's efforts 
in prevention and enforcement," Kroeker says. "They know the reality of the 
situation, when their child, or brother, or grandson, is involved in violence. 
There's a lot of sadness in these homes." Despite the continuing violence and 
sadness, community leaders do see hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's definitely gotten better from the standpoint that there is at 
least a conscious attempt and awareness that the violence must stop," says 
Khalid Shah, director of Stop the Violence, Increase the Peace Foundation, 
which was one of the groups that helped arrange a much publicized truce two 
years ago between rival L.A. gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when you'd see two kids stare each other down," says Shah, 
whose group works directly with gang members and takes actors and entertainers 
into the schools to teach youngsters self-respect and violence prevention. "Now 
they greet each other."  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Leonard Jackson, associate minister of the First African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in South-Central, agrees. "The situation is improving. "As far 
as we can see, the truce is holding. We are working with gang members, trying 
to economically empower them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need jobs, they need to feel they are a part of society," Jackson says. 
"They need to be heard."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT CURBING VIOLENCE; 'THOSE AFFECTED BY GANGS MUST BE PART OF 
SOLUTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Negrete is chairman of Hope in Youth, a coalition of nine major 
religious denominations in the Los Angeles area that was formed to curb gang 
activity. Negrete is also a Chicano Studies professor at Cal State L.A.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 The goal of Hope in Youth is to recreate democracy in L.A. First of all by 
knitting families together, reknitting a relationship between parents and 
children. And then establishing relationships between families in a 
neighborhood or a block and then bringing that group of families together with 
other groups, most of the time through their churches or congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 A month before the riots we announced our campaign to put together our project 
and that came from thousands of meetings with families who are deeply concerned 
over gang-related deaths that were increasing every year and are now projected 
to be at least 1,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 We connect parents who want more control over their own families and 
neighborhoods. We bring those families together to reduce gang violence. And we 
do it by building alternatives to a gang lifestyle. And so we try to figure 
out, on the basis of our conversations with these families, what could be done 
to empower them to rebuild their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Our strategy consists of 160 family outreach teams made up of three 
professional workers, a youth worker, a parent educator and a school parent 
organizer. We now have 30 teams in the neighborhoods and we will have 50 in 
May. And when fully funded Hope in Youth will have a staff of 480 -- ranging in 
age from 22 to 65 -- and 8,000 trained congregational leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 The 8,000 trained volunteers are critical to the success of the program. What 
they have been doing is interviewing residents, local business leaders, service 
providers, church people and government workers to get to know them better, 
establish relationships with them and begin to introduce them to each other. 
We've already held over 12,000 of these one-on-one interviews.  
</P>
<P>
 The interviewee is identified by name and address and what their major 
concerns are. The next phase will be to form groups of these people to begin to 
attack those problems that most affect the quality of life in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that I think has changed is that we have provided some hope. 
We have discovered that there are institutions that still work in the community 
and some of them are the churches and the synagogues, which are the most viable 
institutions in each community. 
</P>
<P>
 Our organizing principles are that, first, the people who are affected by 
problems must be part of the solution and, second, that the decisions must be 
made at the lowest possible level. That's why it's important for us to connect 
families with each other. We have an iron rule -- never do for others what they 
can do for themselves. So we're not service providers -- we're enablers toward 
empowerment.  
</P>
<P>
 We believe in a mix of people from different income levels, races, religions 
and backgrounds. And we have a firm belief in politics. Not just traditional 
electoral politics but a belief that people need to participate in decisions in 
their community, because we are convinced that the violence we see in society 
occurs when people can no longer participate in the public process of thinking 
and acting together.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the things we've discovered in the last couple of years is that there 
are some entrenched enemies in the bureaucracies of the city and the county who 
work very hard day and night to block community empowerment. And we have to 
very careful with these bureaucrats who try to pit us against other deserving 
entities in the city and county that need public funds. And at the same time we 
have to be careful because they will squelch any efforts on our part to obtain 
funding. They'll sit on those funds unless we keep the pressure on.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the other things we've discovered was that we got very strong public 
support from law enforcement. Sheriff Sherman Block, the LAPD chief of police, 
Willie Williams and City Atty. Jimmy Hahn and D.A. Gil Garcetti are all our 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
 We collaborate with law enforcement because we believe in strong law 
enforcement in the community and that people are concerned about their safety.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the things we've encountered is that some people expect dramatic, 
immediate results; like we get funded and then -- boom! -- in six to seven 
months something dramatic happens to reduce violence. Ours is a five-year 
strategy. We can't do what LAPD and the county government and the state haven't 
been able to do overnight. But we think that we have a strategy in place so 
that after five years there will be a difference. But we're beginning to see 
incremental differences in people. For example, people tell us this is the 
first time that anybody's ever knocked on their door to ask what they think 
about politics in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 In a democracy, power to participate as equals in decision-making does not 
come as a gift, it comes from people determined to organize, to train, to 
struggle for justice and peace.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; JURY'S 
AWARD TO RODNEY KING: FAIR OR NOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, a jury awarded Rodney G. King $3.8 million in compensatory 
damages for the beating he sustained at the hands of Los Angeles police 
officers more than three years ago. The jury will next decide whether to award 
King punitive damages. Was the award fair or too much or too little? According 
to the people we talked with, Southern Californians are divided.  
</P>
<P>

 LARRY ZARIAN 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I have two feelings about the jury award. First, Rodney King did not deserve 
the punishment. It's not up to law enforcement officers to decide someone's 
punishment, even if that person is driving 100 or 200 miles an hour, and even 
if they are drunk or on drugs. As long as they are not about to kill anyone, 
their punishment is for the courts to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, should he receive $3.8 million? I say absolutely not. I 
don't think you should ever put a price on a crime. In our system, when a 
person does something wrong -- and that includes a policeman -- he should go to 
jail.  
</P>
<P>
 I can see paying for King's medical expenses and loss of work. But $3.8 
million is absurd. Punishing the officers was enough. 
</P>

<P>
 I think the award was pretty decent. It could have been better but I think 
there was also a chance Rodney King could have gotten zero. 
</P>
<P>
 As for collecting damages from individual officers, I think his attorneys are 
pushing for that. I personally feel he's gotten a good deal. But punitive 
damages could be a deterrent when police know they could be sued. If he does 
get damages from them I think the individuals should pay it themselves and not 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a lot of officers out there that night but many weren't involved in 
the beating. I only videotaped the part where Rodney King was already hogtied 
down on the ground. I didn't see the beating itself or hear anyone call him (a 
racial slur). I just heard the officers laughing while he was on the ground. 
Many people there that night have never gotten a chance to testify.

<P>
 It's really hard for anyone to assess the trauma and pain Rodney King 
suffered, so I feel the jury award was probably reasonable. Our community 
realizes Rodney King didn't cause the riots (in 1992).  
</P>
<P>
 Some people in our community may feel the jury award was unfair. Merchants and 
others who suffered losses when their stores were burned and looted have never 
had compensation.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the individual officers, it would be reasonable for them to take 
responsibility for their actions by paying damages, but how much can they 
afford to lose?

<P>
 I have no sympathy for the way the LAPD handled King, but the dollar amount 
given him by the jury was ridiculous. I realize most of it goes to attorneys, 
but we must remember King started it . It's not as if you and I were walking 
down the street and they assaulted us. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial to see if individual officers should pay damages is also ridiculous. 
I certainly don't support the officers -- I agree they acted wrong -- but I 
think they should be fired and denied benefits, and Rodney King shouldn't be a 
beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 I do believe King deserves medical expenses, because the thing was just 
brutal, but $3.8 million is ridiculous. If Rodney King lives to be 105 he could 
never earn that. And that is coming out of our taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Should the city pay for the individuals? Management is supposed to back up its 
employees if something happens while they are doing their jobs. But in this 
case they were going way beyond that. On the other hand, if management (the 
city and LAPD) is aware something is going on, and endorses it by doing 
nothing, this implies approval. When that's the case, management, not the 
officers, should pay.

</P>

</P>
<P>
 The judgment is yet another case in which a jury has validated the charge that 
law enforcement was out of control. This type of payment, taken out of our tax 
money, should have a deterrent effect, but it hasn't yet.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials continue to write checks without looking behind them to ask 
why, or to create a system of police accountability. I believe the solution is 
an independent prosecutor and a civilian review board with the power to 
investigate and bring charges against officers.  
</P>

 SWEET ALICE HARRIS

<P>
 To whip that young man Rodney King like he was whipped is not the job of an 
officer -- so sure the award is fair. Even if the jury had given more, Rodney 
King would have deserved it, and so would anyone who was whipped that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual officers should also pay for doing wrong. They are not the only 
police who treat people like that. I've been living in Watts for 45 years, and 
I've seen so much injustice. I've seen officers beat young men something 
terrible. But when we tried to tell people nobody believed us.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why it was a blessing from God that Rodney King's beating was 
videotaped and shown. And if officers know they themselves have to pay, I think 
they're going to stop doing that kind of thing so much.  
</P>
<P>
 Young people today don't take what we used to take. And the reason a lot of 
them have so much meanness inside is because of the way they've been treated, 
or seen their brothers and even their mothers get beaten up by police. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Former private investigator for King and author of "Lying Eyes," a book about 
the beating aftermath.

</P>
<P>
 I don't think the award was fair. The amount doesn't address some of the 
long-term considerations Rodney King is facing. For example, he will need to 
hire security people for the next several years because of the many death 
threats against him. In addition, his future medical bills could be quite high. 
The verdict said to city officials: "There's something wrong here and we don't 
want to see it again." 
</P>
<P>
 I was a police officer for 20 years, including 12 years with the LAPD. I 
believe excessive-force judgments against individual officers are a good way to 
put police on notice. But that's only if the officers pay from their own 
pockets. If the city pays, then what lesson will they have learned?

LET'S BRING SUPERMAN BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE NORBERG, Stephanie Norberg, 17, is a senior at San Marino High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He leaps tall buildings with a single bound, is faster than a speeding bullet 
and is more powerful than a locomotive. All impressive, awe-inspiring feats by 
the super-hero once upon a time are now passe. No one seems to bother with the 
classic vision of a hero anymore. Some people even laugh at the ideals they 
represented: purity of purpose, virtue and the desire to do good. Instead, we 
look to the great dollar sign, the symbol of success and the true measure of 
the heroic figure in our modern society. Is this the concept of the hero these 
days? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask a little kid who his heroes are and most likely he'll reel off some names 
of sports figures or entertainers. Ask him why they're his heroes and he'll 
probably say they're "cool" because they're very visible. He's seen them on 
television. They make a lot of money. They wear "cool" clothes. They're 
talented. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly not because they exhibit altruistic qualities and such. And 
these "heroes" are not reserved for the very young. Many adults crave the 
stardom of the rich and famous and that's probably because our society has 
become so oriented toward material gain. They think what you have makes you 
what you are or the more you have, the more you become. By our adulation, we 
feed their egos so they become richer and more self-absorbed than ever. It is a 
vicious cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to Superman? He was great in the old days. His wealth lay in 
his supernatural powers; he had a regular job and a troubled love life. He 
tried hard to be human. He was fun and he made his fans happy. Those were the 
simple times, when putting a criminal behind bars made everyone feel satisfied. 
You just had to perform a good deed with a little flair and you were admired. 
Now such purity seems corny. Poor Superman is dated. His appeal has suffered 
the blows of the kryptonite of society. He just isn't cool enough anymore. Oh, 
there are still some individuals around who maintain that they admire people 
who perform selfless acts: those who risk their lives to save others or 
sacrifice for strangers as some did during World War II by harboring those 
escaping tyranny. Sometimes it's even closer to home: They admire a parent or a 
sibling.  
</P>
<P>
 Once in awhile, they even mention respect. That's a quality that seems to be 
dying right along with Superman. Some of the most popular heroes these days 
have a smart mouth and gain popularity because they make derogatory or 
inflammatory statements in public. They are excused because of their status or 
their entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
 What would it take to bring Superman back? The 1950s? A new mentality? 
Censorship of the media? Many people feel it's a lost cause. We should just 
keep things on a personal level, have our heroes in private, corny or not. 
Maybe Superman can become a basketball player and live in Beverly Hills. That 
alone would greatly multiply his following. He could always develop an Austrian 
accent, a space between his front teeth and . . . he'd be back!

 "The interesting thing about the Nature Center is it used to be a dump. When I 
was in first grade and second grade I took classes here.It's fun to go around 
and learn about animals and plants. They tell you the names of plants and their

 The Newport Environmental Nature Center is like a walk through California: It 
represents all 12 of the state's native plant communities -- including a 
desert, a redwood forest, a pine forest, oak woodland, Catalina Island flora 
and a valley grassland where wildflowers are now blooming. There are walking 
trails and a recycling stream and pond. The Nature Center was started 22 years 
ago by a group of science teachers with community help and student volunteers. 
It functions as an outdoor classroom for 8,000 students each year. It also 
offers adult tours, places to picnic and a summer science nature camp.

 It is located on 2 1/2 acres in Newport Beach. For information and directions,

ARAFAT AND ZHIRINOVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We do take exception to the second to last paragraph in an article by Tyler 
Marshall (April 14). In a report from Strasbourg dealing with a speech by PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, he mentions Russian ultranationalist Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky was also present at the parliamentary assembly of the Council of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 He writes: "Despite what might appear to be shared anti-Jewish sentiments, the 
two (Arafat and Zhirinovsky) seemed to have little interest in each other." 
</P>
<P>
 This is very misleading. Yasser Arafat is not anti-Jewish. The group of people 
Arafat objects to are the Zionists who have taken Palestinian land by armed 
aggression since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, on the other hand, is a right-wing Russian reported to have made 
anti-Jewish or anti-Semitic remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Zhirinovsky should not be put in the same category.

TURKEY'S AID TO IRAQI KURDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your coverage of the helicopter tragedy in northern Iraq (April 15) fails to 
show Turkey's essential role in Operation Provide Comfort. Not only does Turkey 
permit Allied forces to use Turkish air bases, but the Turkish military is 
actively taking part in this humanitarian operation.  
</P>
<P>
 Turkey's humanitarian help to the Kurdish population in northern Iraq is not 
limited to its part in this operation. Turkey is helping Iraqi Kurds by 
providing food aid and even electric power. Turkey recently furnished $15 
million to the Iraqi Kurds to manage their daily economic needs. The terrorist 
PKK organization recently sabotaged the power lines in northern Iraq to prevent 
Iraqi Kurds from using the electricity provided by Turkey, showing once again 
that this terror organization's activities are not only a threat to the Turkish 
citizens living in this border areas but to the well-being of Iraqi Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 The map attached to the story also is flawed in the sense that it designates 
some provinces of Turkey as "areas of Kurdish majority," as if Kurdish citizens 
of Turkey do not belong to the population as a whole.  
</P>
<P>
 The April 17 Column Left makes a substantial blunder as well by comparing the 
situation of the Kurdish populations in Turkey and Iraq. Turkey is governed by 
a democratic parliamentary system, and Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin know 
they are unique and different from the Kurds living in the neighboring 
countries, which are ruled by theocracies or one-party systems. All Turkish 
citizens, regardless of ethnic background, have the right to participate 
actively in Turkey's multi-party system. In the last local elections, Turkish 
citizens of Kurdish origin cast their votes among the 14 parties that 
participated in the election and ignored boycott calls from the PKK 
organization. The participation rate in the election was more than 92%. The 
Democratic Labor Party, which stated open sympathy with the PKK in the past, 
opted to withdraw from the election, evidently to avoid a total electoral 
defeat. Your reporter fails to understand Turkey's problem is not with its 
ethnic Kurdish population, but with a terrorist organization, which is based 
and financed from abroad.

SECURITY IN EGYPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Upsurge in Militant Attacks Worries Foreigners in Egypt," by Kim Murphy, 
World Report, March 29: 
</P>
<P>
 There exists a clear contradiction between the headline and the atmosphere 
your correspondent tries to depict and the actual quotes reported, which 
indicate that Egypt is a friendly country and that "few foreigners are 
panicking." Murphy quotes an American businessman as saying "I feel safer (in 
Egypt) than I would in Harlem or Miami Beach," and the president of the 
American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt as saying that he is not prepared to say 
that the security situation is unsafe since the number of foreigners killed in 
Egypt (in almost two years) does not amount to one bad day in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only normal that adequate security measures be taken. But the situation 
is under control and the latest terrorist activities are manifestations of 
desperation by the terrorists who, unable to accomplish their criminal goals, 
are resorting to indiscriminate attacks. This reality has been recognized by 
the tourists who continue to flow after a period of hesitancy, and the 
businessmen and foreign visitors who have never stopped visiting Egypt and who 
continue business as usual.  
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, I will mention that Tim Wirth of the State Department visited 
Egypt recently and came back totally satisfied that preparations for the 
International Conference on Population are going ahead in an excellent 
atmosphere. He was quoted as confirming the very good security situation. In 
fact, the last preparatory meeting is taking place in New York, and no 
representative of any country or of the United Nations expressed any concern, 
contrary to the assertion contained in the article.

THE NOT-SO-MIGHTY (BUT VITAL) L.A. RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The announcement last week that the Los Angeles River, a trash-strewn, 
graffiti-blighted concrete channel, is listed among the nation's most important 
but vulnerable waterways at first may seem like the stuff of a late-night 
comedy monologue. But the condition of the L.A. River is no joke. And the 
parallels between it and the mighty Mississippi and Missouri rivers, also on 
the list, are clear and ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of local conservationists, the Washington-based American Rivers 
organization included the Los Angeles River on its list of 30 endangered or 
threatened rivers. The 58-mile-long waterway runs from the San Gabriel 
Mountains into the Pacific at Long Beach Harbor. Much of the riverbed is sealed 
in concrete, and between South Gate and Long Beach high walls flank it to 
protect downstream residents against floods. A river in name only through dense 
urban neighborhoods, the Los Angeles is most often used, illegally, as a 
garbage dump and as impromptu shelter for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't afraid about being laughed at," Kevin Coyle, president of American 
Rivers, said of his group's decision to include the river on its annual list. 
"There's a chance that a lot of the Los Angeles River can be restored to its 
natural state." 
</P>
<P>
 Restoration can mean far more than just cleaning up one of Los Angeles' most 
glaring eyesores. It could provide much-needed recreational and open space. 
Nearly every plan drawn for use of the river and adjacent land in recent years 
involves creation of greenbelts along the banks.  
</P>
<P>
 Restoration can also appreciably supplement this region's scarce natural water 
supply during dry years. Flood control officials originally paved the riverbed 
to divert storm runoff and protect the region against flooding. But the system 
of storm drains and flood control channels is so efficient that only 15% of 
rainfall in the river's watershed is conserved. That's a far lower percentage 
than in areas with aggressive conservation programs in place, among them places 
with far more rainfall than here. 
</P>
<P>
 However, instead of un-paving the river (as many urge), restoring its 
watershed and encouraging its recreational use, we seem headed in the opposite 
direction. County and federal officials are poised to build even higher 
concrete walls along the river -- at a cost of $346 million -- to protect 
against flood damage predicted to occur in a worst-case regional flood. 
Construction could begin as soon as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet last summer's disastrous Midwestern floods argue strongly for less 
concrete here, not more. Levees along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, 
although designed to accommodate heavy runoff, broke under the strain of 
enormous volumes of fast-moving water, inundating homes, farms, entire towns. 
This summer, instead of mixing more cement, we here in Los Angeles would be 
wise to heed the lessons of last summer.

DAWN OF A NEW ERA FOR SOUTH AFRICANS; THIS WEEK'S ALL-RACE VOTING CLIMAXES 
CENTURIES OF BLACK HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa, like the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, was forged violently in a 
crucible of colonialism, racism and greed. Generations later, the political 
landscape still bears these birth scars. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's historic election for voters of all races won't end old hatreds or 
eliminate deep-seated fears, but it will put the country on the path toward 
democracy and, perhaps, racial equality. 
</P>
<P>
 White settlers arrived early in this extraordinarily rich part of Africa. The 
first, the Dutch, landed on the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. These Afrikaners 
took "free" farmland -- 6,000 acres at a time -- and brought in African and 
Malaysian slaves to till the soil. In the process, they displaced the black 
people who had lived there for ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The British gained control in 1795, establishing a more moderate brand of 
colonialism. Although they abolished slavery, they still enjoyed white 
privileges, imported Indian indentured servants and refused to enfranchise 
blacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Black South Africa did not submit willingly. The African National Congress led 
protests against racial restrictions from its founding in 1912, but the 
hard-handed restrictions only worsened. When the Afrikaners' National Party 
came to political power in 1948, it codified white domination by creating 
apartheid, a legal system of racial classification and separation that 
determined where blacks could be born, live, attend school, work and be buried, 
in addition to decreeing whom they could not marry. South African police 
brutally enforced this cradle-to-grave system of racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, a peaceful demonstration against apartheid turned deadly after police 
shot at unarmed protesters, killing at least 67; the infamous Sharpeville 
Massacre led the government to ban the ANC. But that only led to violence by 
anti-apartheid activists who had been forced underground. In 1964, Nelson 
Mandela and other prominent ANC leaders were charged with sabotage and 
imprisoned for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Students then took the lead in fighting apartheid. In Soweto and other 
townships they boycotted classes to protest the government's insistence that 
they learn the Afrikaans language. In 1976, police fired repeatedly on peaceful 
student protesters. At least 575 died. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal and external pressures against apartheid finally had an effect in 
1989, when a new president with a brighter vision took office. President 
Frederik W. de Klerk deserves credit for freeing Mandela and other political 
prisoners, lifting the ban against the ANC and other black political parties, 
repealing the apartheid laws and starting negotiations on a new constitution. 
Mandela, with whom De Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, deserves 
credit for his highly principled and unyielding role in advancing democracy. 
The culmination of their work will occur Tuesday when three days of voting 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, a majority-ruled South Africa could capitalize on new 
commercial opportunities to become an economic leader on the continent. Nothing 
is a given in a nation with huge political divides and pervasive poverty. But 
as the balloting begins, at last there are bright hopes and great expectations.

SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING, WE'RE NO. 1; CALIFORNIA'S DOMINANCE OF THE FEDERAL 
SCIENCE ESTABLISHMENT OFFERS A LESSON FOR HARD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians often gripe about a perceived East Coast bias in the national 
news media, in Washington government circles, in national arts organizations, 
in television prime-time programming. Whether or not those complaints are 
warranted, the same certainly cannot be said about science, technology and 
medicine. Californians fairly dominate the Washington science Establishment, 
and therein lies an important lesson for the future of this economically 
struggling region. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president of the National Academy of Sciences, the influential 
quasi-official organization that advises government on scientific, engineering 
and medical issues, is Bruce M. Alberts. He was a professor of biochemistry and 
biophysics at UC San Francisco. The new administrator of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration is Daniel S. Goldin, formerly vice 
president and general manager of the TRW Space & Technology Group in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on: At the White House, the associate director for science in 
the Office of Science and Technology Policy is M. R. C. Greenwood, a biologist 
who was dean of graduate studies at UC Davis. Dr. Harold E. Varmus, a 
virologist who was a professor at UC San Francisco, is director of the nation's 
main financial backer of basic research, the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the academy of sciences, 
is Dr. Kenneth I. Shine, a cardiologist and physiologist who is immediate past 
dean and provost for medical sciences at the UCLA School of Medicine. Francisco 
J. Ayala, a biologist at UC Irvine, is the new president of the American Assn. 
for the Advancement of Science, the nation's largest scientific organization. 
And the association's influential journal, Science, is edited by Daniel E. 
Koshland Jr., a biochemist who taught at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 We mention all this not out of regional parochialism. Rather the message is 
that, for all its national and self-made image as a land of movie fantasy, 
escape and golden surfers, California has a strong intellectual tradition, 
particularly in the sciences. Institutions like Caltech, Stanford and the UC 
system, as well as major defense and space contractors like TRW, long have been 
the source of national leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 All benefited from Cold War spending on science and technology, and all have 
suffered financially with its end. But as we plot the post-Cold War era for the 
new California we must not neglect this important resource.

LERNER ON WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "There's Plenty of Hypocrisy, but Whitewater Is Not the Key," 
by Michael Lerner, Commentary, April 18: 
</P>
<P>
 As one who thinks "deeply about politics," I agree that people are 
"self-interested" and "selfish" both politically and personally. I do not 
believe, however, that Americans have a "collective fantasy that our 
politicians must be morally better than we are." We only want them to be as 
good as they say they are. When the President called Hillary the person of "the 
highest moral character" he has ever known, it makes one wonder what kind of 
company he has been keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding those at a town hall meeting who asked the President, "Why should we 
trust you?" The lack of trust was not, as Lerner has suggested, because the 
Clintons have not fought for their principles. It was because the Clintons have 
not found their principles.

 * The prolix piece by Lerner was, as Macbeth would have put it "full of sound 
and fury, signifying nothing." His sterile phrase "the politics of meaning" 
certainly has a seductive literary ring to it, but his piece is typically 
liberal, denouncing "economic, political and social institutions" en masse, 
without recognizing that, while there are some such institutions fostering 
"selfishness and cynicism," the vast majority of them function in this country 
to generate the standard of living, the stability, the technology, and the 
charity, that the U.S. (and Lerner) enjoys. But he refuses to acknowledge this 
because it does not square with his political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 His is the very hypocrisy that he denounces, but fails to acknowledges in 
himself, or the fellow political travelers that he cites and supports.

 * OK, let me see if I got this straight. It was 12 years of Reagan and Bush 
that caused a malfunction in the Clintons' moral compass and we all need the 
government, via a big dose of the "politics of meaning" to relocate our moral 
North Pole. I think Michael has a tough sell.

 * Re Garrison Keillor's column, April 15: 
</P>
<P>
 How dare Keillor begin my day with wit and common sense. How dare he defend a 
President who had no courtship, let alone a honeymoon, with the new media ethic 
which says "no privacy for anyone, no compassion for anyone, no innocence even 
when proven not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 God bless this man who is brave enough to defend a young vibrant man who keeps 
his smile, humor, intelligence and a head of steam, despite the meanness of 
more than Yuppies. This President is a target for anyone who has no knowledge 
of history and who contain the whitest blind hatred I've seen since Pearl 
Harbor. Amen, Garrison. Maybe you can replace "William Satire and George 
Won't."

 * Your editorial "Can't They Get It Straight?" (April 13) was applauded by my 
family as well as acquaintances for its straight forwardness. Running our 
government is not just another "deal." We have to be able to believe what the 
White House spokespeople state from the President on down the line. It just is 
not happening. The credibility is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry folks, the full-page support tactic "We Interrupt This Newspaper to Give 
You the Facts!" of April 14 from private citizens is not impressive. Americans 
have the right to question the President and First Lady when story after story 
have to be corrected after the facts come out. We don't quite believe the 
thought process of politics of Arkansas is not being practiced in Washington.

 * Recently, with the stock market falling, President Clinton has been sending 
economic advisers around to talk shows and editorial boards to tell Americans 
that Wall Street is still "sound." 
</P>
<P>
 I think President Clinton can keep his advisers at the White House. All he 
needs to do to inspire confidence is to tell everyone that "Hillary is back in 
the market."

from teapots, and it shows.

 * Why is it that when there's a Republican in the White Huse the Democrats 
waste time and energy digging up dirt on them, and when a Democrat is in the 
White House, the Republicans play the same dirt-throwing game? 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be more productive it the opposing party spent their time and 
energy coming up with ways to help the elected party make this country a better 
place to live?

'THREE STRIKES' AND A BALK: BENEFICIAL STATUTORY CLINKER; LAW: THE NEW STATUTE 
STARTS THE COUNT ON FELONIES NOW, NOT RETROACTIVELY. IF IT'S A LEGISLATIVE 
ERROR, IT'S FAIR; LEAVE IT AS IS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a batter stepping up to the plate. The pitcher winds up and throws. 
The umpire says nothing. Then comes the second pitch and the third. Silence. 
Only after the sixth pitch does the umpire yell, "You're out!" The outraged 
batter demands an explanation. "The first, fourth and sixth pitches were 
strikes," says the umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the way baseball is played. Thanks to a little-noticed clause in 
the "three strikes and you're out" measure enacted by the Legislature, that's 
not the way sentencing should be conducted in California either. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinker is in the definition of what constitutes "prior felony 
convictions" that will count as strikes to boost the penalty of second or third 
offenses. Section 667 (d)(1) of the new measure provides: 
</P>
<P>
 "The determination of whether a prior conviction is a prior felony conviction 
for purposes of ("three strikes") shall be made upon the date of that prior 
conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the person convicted of a felony will learn at his or her 
sentencing whether that conviction counts as strike one (or two). 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective application of "three strikes" will be a welcome reprieve for 
California's economy. The fiscal impact of the law will be more gradual since 
it won't require the massive buildup of prisons that would have been necessary 
if the measure were immediately applied to felonies committed before its 
enactment. 
</P>
<P>
 The deterrent impact the measure was designed to achieve will be better served 
by prospective application. If defendants are told at their first conviction 
that it will have drastic future consequences even after they've served their 
sentence -- doubling the sentence for their second offense and producing a life 
sentence for their third -- the second and third offense may be less likely to 
ever occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some will claim that the "clinker clause" was unintended, a 
drafting error. They will assert that the intent of the Legislature was to lock 
up more felons longer, immediately. They will look in vain, however, for any 
language in the measure that suggests it was intended to apply retroactively to 
convictions occurring before the law was enacted. And the courts ordinarily 
hold that extrinsic evidence of legislative intent is irrelevant when the 
language used is unambiguous. There is nothing ambiguous about the requirement 
that a determination of whether a conviction can be used to enhance subsequent 
sentences "shall be made upon the date of that prior conviction." To read it 
any other way requires that different words be substituted for the words used 
by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts have occasionally been willing to rewrite legislation where literal 
application of the language used would produce an absurd or stupid result that 
never could have been intended by rational legislators. But that principle has 
no application here. Prospective application is an entirely rational and useful 
tool to serve the deterrent purpose of the law. Retroactive application would 
be absurd and stupid, not least for the total disruption of our judicial and 
correctional systems.  
</P>
<P>
 One final principle of statutory construction might have relevance here. It is 
expressed in the Latin maxim, Lex ignorantium, beneficium curiae -- a 
thoughtless law benefits the judge. While it is never expressed in judicial 
opinions, the compelling logic of this maxim finds frequent application. If 
language used by the Legislature is so careless that it's apparent no one even 
read it before voting for it, then it will be construed in a manner that suits 
the judiciary. Which is as it should be. Where else can we turn when statutory 
clinkers are foisted on us by legislators more adept at political sloganeering 
than clear statements of legal principles? 
</P>
<P>
 Immediate application of "three strikes" to prior felonies will require all 
judicial resources to be reallocated to the trial of criminal cases. If that's 
what the legislators really intended, they still have the last word. They need 
only amend the legislation to express their intent clearly. Before exercising 
this power, though, they might consider that the rules for sentencing felons 
should be at least as fair as the rules in baseball -- that each strike is 
called before anyone is declared out.

PERSPECTIVE ON RICHARD M. NIXON; A MAJOR LEADER, A DOUBLE STANDARD; NIXON'S 
PROFOUND ACHIEVEMENT, FOR WHICH HE SHOULD BE CELEBRATED, WAS BREAKING THE BACK 
OF THE COLD WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer, a former national correspondent, is a Times 
contributing editor. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The man seemed to me so awkward, even insecure. We did a box-step as he 
welcomed me into his office and I wondered if he was one of those who felt that 
a proper distance from others would prevent catching the common cold. He was 
friendly enough, speaking about his daughter, whom I knew, and mentioning 
surfing in California, which neither of us really cared about.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the preliminary chitchat was not his thing, and so we soon settled 
into an intense discussion, for almost three hours, about what ails the world. 
Suddenly, Richard M. Nixon was brilliant and in every way self-assured. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1984, 10 years after he was hounded out of office, but boy, could he 
hold forth. Pick a spot anywhere on the map, from Beirut to Kansas City, and he 
knew the players, the issues and the likely result. Even more obvious, if 
surprising to his critics, was how consistently reasonable and moderate he was. 
He had been around the block more than a few times, and whatever venom might 
have once been suggested, say in his earliest campaigns, was long gone.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, there will be no shortage of people to praise Nixon, but I 
have long had a soft spot for the man, thinking him attacked more for quirks of 
personality than for errors of policy. Indeed, the occasion of our visit was an 
article I had written for The Times suggesting that a revisionist view of the 
Nixon presidency was overdue.  
</P>
<P>
 He wrote, thanking me for the article -- which he termed "very objective," 
despite the harsh quotes from critics -- and agreed to my request for an 
interview. I had wanted to talk with him because, in forced retirement, he had 
re-emerged as a force for sanity and peace in the midst of a degenerating Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 He had written a book called "The Real Peace," which defended his policy of 
detente with the Soviet Union and urged caution on the Reagan Administration, 
which was developing the potentially destabilizing nuclear-shield notion of 
"Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon clearly recognized the danger in this approach. As I reported, the 
former President "urged the United States and the Soviet Union to share 
research on 'Star Wars' missile systems because otherwise, such defensive 
systems could fuel fears that they might be used as a 'shield' for a nuclear 
first strike." It did not bother him that this was also the Soviet position at 
the time. But then again, being soft on communism was not an easy charge to 
level against this onetime ally of Sen. Joseph McCarthy.  
</P>
<P>
 Say what you will, Nixon was also a statesman who knew that in the end there 
was no recourse but diplomacy, since there was no such thing as winnable 
nuclear war.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to recall the nuclear-war-fighting climate of the early 1980s to 
understand why I wanted to cheer when he said, speaking of nuclear warheads, 
"When you have 10,000 of these damn things, there is no defense." Not everyone, 
President Reagan included, seemed to grasp that. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Nixon looked good not only to me but to George McGovern, his 
Democratic opponent in the 1972 campaign who had as much right to hold a grudge 
as anyone. But McGovern was always a serious person, and as he told me then: 
"In dealing with the two majorcommunist powers, Nixon probably had a better 
record then any President since World War II." Nixon, added McGovern, "Put us 
on the course to practical working relationships with both the Russians and 
Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the back-channel negotiations, Henry Kissinger is often given the 
credit for the historic opening to China. But the record is quite clear that 
the courageous proposal to acknowledge that the true government of China was in 
Beijing and not Taipei was Nixon's. He advanced this course in an article in 
Foreign Policy magazine in 1967, before he had ever met the man who would end 
up as his top gun on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Little noticed for all the reporting on the voluminous documents released from 
the Nixon archives, which overwhelmingly stress indications of personal 
instability and highlight profanity, is the fact that they prove that Nixon and 
not Kissinger ran foreign policy. It was Nixon who decided to be the first U.S. 
President to visit Jerusalem, and it was Nixon who first treated Arab leaders 
as more than caricatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was a true visionary along the lines of Woodrow Wilson. But instead of 
projecting a messianic role for this country, Nixon understood the "limits of 
power" of the United States in the emerging multipolar world; he detailed this 
notion in his "Nixon Doctrine" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he made his mistakes. Some, like extending the Vietnam War to Cambodia, 
extracted a horrible human price. But it was neither Nixon nor the Republicans 
who started that war, and it was Nixon who ended it. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate revealed a mentality all too willing to sabotage the spirit of 
democracy, but no more so than Lyndon Johnson's persistent lying about Vietnam 
or Ronald Reagan's stonewalling on Iran-Contra. Every modern President has used 
the claim of national security to stay in office, democracy be damned.  
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was subjected to a double standard, being judged much more harshly 
because he was, by virtue of personality, the anti-Teflon President, with every 
bit of the normal dirty grease of government sticking to the media perception 
of his essential soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Face it: Reporters, including many Republican ones, never liked Nixon. He was 
inaccessible, quirky, devious and in most of his mannerisms light years away 
from the breezy style and the prevalent, if not always genuine, bonhomie of our 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Awkward he may have been, but I believe in the end he was at peace with 
himself. And so should we be in acknowledging one of the major leaders of our 
time, remembering the bold achievements and putting into perspective his 
contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Be charitable, not as an act of kindness, but in the interest of accuracy. 
Nixon had his failings, and we in the media made much of them. But remember 
that Franklin Delano Roosevelt betrayed European Jewry all the way to the 
crematories and that Lyndon Johnson dropped more explosives on Vietnam in 
immoral spite than were targeted against the Germans in a war that made perfect 
moral sense.  
</P>
<P>
 But they were both important Presidents because of the other things they did, 
like getting us out of the Depression and acknowledging civil rights. No less 
an achievement was Nixon's in breaking the back of the Cold War. We may owe our 
lives to it.

O.C. ART REVIEW; WORKS GIVE VIEW INTO VIETNAMESE AMERICAN PSYCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans finally came to grips with that profound, self-inflicted wound 
called the Vietnam War. It was a nasty, immoral mess, but we can now stand 
before Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial, know our soldiers fought bravely, 
weep and try to heal ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhibition at Cal State Fullerton reminds us that another legacy of that 
conflict took the form of tens of thousands of Vietnamese immigrants who, 
utterly displaced, came here hoping to piece together decent lives. It started 
nearly 20 years ago. Now they are Americans, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has the largest Vietnamese population anywhere outside their 
homeland. Close to 100,000 Vietnamese live in enclaves from Westminster to 
Anaheim. The largest, nicknamed "Little Saigon," has more than 1,000 Vietnamese 
and Chinese businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton pays praiseworthy attention to this phenomenon in "A New 
Generation: Vietnamese American Contemporary Art." Organized in tandem by 
curators Trang Nguyen and Farid Hassan, it includes the work of 10 artists and 
comes with a slender catalogue. The essay was written by Chor Swang Ngin, who 
ponders the question of assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
 A scan of the work suggests that these artists are culturally assimilated. 
Work is driven by a raw energy and a sense of chaos that comes from styles 
ranging from Abstract Expressionism through installation and performance. The 
ensemble puts one in mind of the work of Jon Borofsky. So, fine. Since that's 
all good American stuff, the artists must all be assimilated, so everything's 
OK and we can all go home. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we can't. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to get a wrong answer is to ask a wrong question. For one thing, 
Western art styles were practiced in South Vietnam, so that is not mentally new 
to the work. In modern times, all artists have been in the business of being 
unassimilated. All artists become self-elected outsiders by their choice of 
profession. If they are social critics, it's not because they set out to act 
that role, it's because they are just being themselves, which is rare to the 
point of being taboo in most cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 We may be able to tell something about the collective state of the immigrant 
Vietnamese psyche from this work, but if we can, it's because common experience 
has been uncommonly absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some artists seem to emphasize the Vietnamese experience. Dong Phan makes 
ripped and weathered abstract collages out of what might be the debris of a 
wrecked town after a bombing. The work bears a generic resemblance to art made 
by Italian Alberto Burri and others who lived through the devastation of World 
War II. Toi Hoang and Viet Nguyen pursue similar themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Man Bui's installation "No Near" is made of fabric and wood and calls to mind 
parachutes, bogs and blood. It feels like a cultural reaction but becomes 
unsettlingly intimate in photographs where the artist seems to accuse himself 
of being intolerant, cynical and hypocritical. It's said that one result of 
terror can be a feeling of guilt on the part of the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 All this work is individualized by embodying the humanity of mixed emotions. 
There is a lyrical quality of hope to Ann Phong's Expressionist paintings that 
belies imagery of boats, bombs and swamps. Darlene Nguyen-Ely fashions 
miniature assemblages of wrecked shrines. Their mournfulness is made all the 
more poignant by poetic restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists seem to address the American experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Chi Le makes racks of little series paintings about daily life here with its 
cars, bikes and fast-food emporiums. They have some of the folk-art feel of 
Mexican ex-votos and some of the same resigned humor. Their collective title 
(slightly bowdlerized for a family newspaper) is "Same Bull, Different Day." 
Thai Bui waxes philosophical and a bit ironic in neo-primitive sculpture 
incorporating tattered books. "Tool for a Newcomer" is in the form of an ax 
with an English dictionary for a blade. Thy Nguyen's installation is called 
"Progeny." It consists of a rocking mechanism, projected slides and anatomical 
wall drawings depicting human internal organs and genitalia. It could as easily 
have been inspired by private obsession as by social conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographer Han V. Nguyen takes a posture of anthropological detachment in 
his "Ancestor Series." Images are made up of archive-style montages covering 
everything from the skeletons of ancient hominids to works of master art. A 
particularly mordant image shows a display case including models and death 
masks of peoples of many races. It's called "Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 Most crimes are essentially similar, they say, but all murders are different. 
It's true that the violence of Vietnam was singular, as was that of the 
Holocaust or Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
 All, however, leave a dark residue of haunted minds. At that level the terror 
universalizes itself. Whether the demons of the individual mind were placed 
there by warring nations or rotten parents, they require the same courage in 
the coping. Here it is done with uncommon frankness, grace and fortitude.

ART REVIEW; LACMA'S SPANISH SCULPTURE: A SMALL GEM OF A SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention Renaissance and Baroque sculpture in Europe, and you're likely first 
to think of Italy, then perhaps of some other region of the central continent, 
such as France or Germany. The Iberian Peninsula probably won't come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will sculpture made of painted wood. Because Italian Renaissance and 
Baroque artists wanted their work to resonate off the vaunted traditions of 
Greek and Roman antiquity, bronze and marble were their preferred mediums. 
Sculpture of painted wood seems vaguely medieval, an artifact of that supposed 
"dark age" of irrational superstition that had followed the catastrophic 
decline of glorious antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
 For this and other reasons, the painted wood (and occasionally terra-cotta) 
reliefs and free-standing figures in the exhibition "Spanish Polychrome 
Sculpture (1500-1800) in United States Collections" will likely be new to most 
museum visitors. If it registers at all, painted Spanish sculpture of the 16th 
through the 18th Century might come to mind as a prominent prototype for 
colonial devotional sculpture in the Caribbean, the Americas and the 
Philippines, where Spain had far-flung outposts. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented exhibition of 37 sculptures, which was organized by the 
Spanish Institute in New York and currently may be seen at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, is a small gem. Three centuries are a lot to cover with 
just three dozen objects, while many individual sculptures were originally 
meant to be seen as part of large and complex altarpieces. Still, the 
provocative show offers a solid overview of this rarely considered art. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost never does this religious sculpture awe with authoritative power. 
Authority is simply assumed in doctrinal art, for these are effigies of holy 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, even the bloodiest of what can be a very bloody art, such as 
intensely veristic depictions of a tortured Christ, seems designed to perform 
an elaborate seduction. The use of paint to achieve highly realistic human 
flesh, of glass eyes whose reflectiveness seems moist, of dazzlingly decorative 
estofado -- a laborious technique in which incised gilding catches flickering 
candlelight, pumping up the theatrical magic -- all conspire to create an 
empathetic pathway for a viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 This is sculpture conceived as a doorway, opening away from the physical and 
onto a metaphysical world, and partaking of both. Spain's Catholic Church knew 
that you catch more believers with honey, and the artists in their service laid 
it on with often astonishing skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, as in an exquisite rendition of a martyred 18-year-old -- St. 
Stanislaus Kostka, the first Jesuit to be beatified -- the artist would 
juxtapose a serenely idealized figure with tempestuous, dramatic drapery. Hints 
of the elaborate excitement of the saintly story swirl around the fixed compass 
of a coolly unruffled figure, like an echo of a thrilling hurricane around a 
storm's calm eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Another standard device, found in more than half the objects at LACMA, is the 
brilliant, seemingly simple technique of carving the figure's mouth in a 
slightly open position. These sculptural men and women seem to register an 
eternal sigh -- a silent exhalation whose aura of longing is tinged with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 The slightly opened mouth is also a unique stylistic convention remarkable for 
its subtle effectiveness. It signals a figure about to speak, but of course 
unable to. In the face of holy mystery these beatific saints are pointedly 
rendered as speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish polychrome sculpture is radically different from Italian bronze and 
marble sculpture of the period, but not just for mundane reasons of material. 
Spaniards may not have had marble quarries or a tradition of bronze sculpture 
to mine, but neither explains the distinctive tenor of their painted sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, an acute consciousness of progress and modernity was paramount: 
Artistic allusions to classical antiquity were meant to celebrate a cultural 
origin, but their sharp departure from medieval convention also meant to show 
how far civilization had come since Greece and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spain, by contrast, the manifold realities of the present were instead a 
launching pad to communion with eternal mysteries. Medieval conventions were 
not jettisoned or wholly transformed by artists, as much as added on to newer 
Renaissance and Baroque forms; the unusual cumulative style meant to be 
perpetually alluring. From our postmodern vantage point today, this artistic 
strategy has much to tell us. 
</P>
<P>
 A few pieces did not travel to California from the East. And unfortunately 
missing from all venues were any works from the New York-based Hispanic Society 
of America, home to the largest and most significant collection of this 
material in the country, but which has a firm policy against making loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several worthwhile additions exclusive to the presentation in Los 
Angeles make up for the loss. Most notable are two wood sculptures, one of St. 
Mark (circa 1560) wrapped in wildly energetic drapery, the other a grave and 
imposing life-size figure of the obscure St. Gines de la Jara. Believed to have 
been carved in 1692 by Jose Caro, the latter is a gilded eye-dazzler acquired 
awhile back by the J. Paul Getty Museum and now making its public debut after 
extensive conservation work. The St. Mark -- dramatic and very Italianate in 
its tornado of Mannerist style -- is by Alonso Berruguete, perhaps the most 
influential sculptor in Renaissance Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 LACMA has added eight liturgical vestments and textiles from its own 
collection, in order to provide a bit of context. Some, such as a tapestry 
fragment embroidered with dragons juxtaposed to a carved relief panel from a 
choir stall, are remarkably similar not only in general style and mood but in 
specific design. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show also offers LACMA a chance to highlight a small, astonishingly 
beautiful painted terra-cotta figure that has been in its collection since 
1978. Barely a foot tall, and clad in a Cistercian monk's habit whose exquisite 
modeling yields a stunning monumentality that belies its modest size, the 
figure of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, head tossed back and arms outstretched, 
seems poised to lift off its little pedestal and ascend into the ether. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, in a nutshell, suggests what is so distinctive about Spanish 
Renaissance and Baroque sculpture. "Come with me," these figures beckon. You're 
inclined to want to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 * LACMA, 5905 Wilshire Blvd., (213) 857-6000, through June 26. Closed Mondays

MUSIC REVIEW; PACIFIC CHORALE OFFERS UNFORGIVING FRENCH PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific Chorale, under the direction of John Alexander, presented a 
vocally unforgiving program of 19th- and 20th-Century French devotional music 
Saturday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. The chorale rose 
stunningly to many of the challenges but could not conquer them all. 
</P>
<P>
 The choir's greatest strength on this occasion lay in its eminent control 
during a cappella passages. Through finely drawn, ever-balanced dissonances, 
the group conveyed a sense of deeply felt spirituality in Messiaen's 
unaccompanied "O Sacrum Convivium." Similarly, sections of Poulenc's "Stabat 
Mater" that leave the chorus completely exposed emerged with telling 
thoughtfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, "O quam tristis" received a simple and moving reading. The opening 
polyphony to "Fac, ut ar deat cor meum" ("Make my heart burn so") also unwound 
evocatively, apparently freed by the absence of the Pacific Symphony's 
partnership, even in a score so rarely competitive as this. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Psalm 47 -- as set by Florent Schmitt for soprano, chorus, 
orchestra and organ -- elevates the instrumentalists to equal, sometimes 
predominant participants alongside their vocal cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The work proceeds in waves of loudly dramatic climaxes, full of much "shouting 
to God," with everything from tuba to tambourine, and fraught with impediments 
to choral clarity. Simultaneously beset by demands of register, choral tone 
quality did not survive some of these energetic assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Soloist Benita Valente held her own valiantly, however, from her relatively 
quiet entrance to her dynamic exclamations over full forces, all in feverish 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Valente's reliable soprano further complemented the chorus in her solos for 
the "Stabat Mater," where she was attentive to musical nuance, if not always 
theatrically believable. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert had begun with "Cantique de Jean Racine," by Faure, in a seamless, 
flowing performance that built to heroic proportions with the aid of a 
stylishly astute orchestration by USC professor James Hopkins.

JAZZ REVIEW; QUINTERO SETS HIGH STANDARD WITH CROSS-CULTURAL SOUND; THE 
COLOMBIAN-BORN GUITARIST MOVES EASILY AMONG GENRES WHILE FUSING STYLES RANGING 
FROM BOLEROS TO CHA-CHAS TO FUNK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California is home to a large cadre of expatriateSouth and Central 
American musicians who are forming new, cross-cultural hybrids by combining the 
sounds of their homelands with American jazz and pop. One of the best of this 
lot is guitarist Juan Carlos Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintero's first set Saturday at Randell's showed the Colombian-born 
musician's willingness to fuse styles ranging from boleros and cha-chas to funk 
and straight-ahead jazz. If this sounds like a soup with too many ingredients, 
think again. Quintero has a knack for moving easily among these genres, often 
in the course of a single song. 
</P>
<P>
 The unifying component to Quintero's music is percussion, not just from the 
drummer Tiki Passilas and percussionist angel Figueroa, but from bassist Eddie 
Resto, keyboardist Joe Rotundi and Quintero himself. 
</P>
<P>
 At different times during the set, Resto and Passilas would put their 
instruments down and join Figueroa in a circle around the guitarist, coaxing 
rhythms from cowbells and various shakers while Quintero strung electric lines 
across the percussive swell. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintero himself often played in a percussive manner, striking clipped, 
rhythmic chords to set the music's pace. He did just that in introducing the 
theme from Marcel Camus' 1959 film "Black Orpheus," a piece written by Antonio 
Carlos Jobim. This technique set the mood for all that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 An exchange of ringing bells and bird whistles greeted Quintero's "Siempre," 
while Figueroa added chatter from his congas and an African talking drum he 
kept slung over his shoulder. Quintero and Rotundi entered with rhythmic bursts 
before Resto's improvisation on his skinny, electric Ampeg "Baby" bass, an 
upright instrument that resembles a double bass after several months of 
dieting. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintero's "Medellin" explored an appropriately melancholy mood with the 
guitarist's plaintive, flamenco-inspired play. From there it was on to "A 
Noche," a bolero that found the guitarist using sustained, sliding tones that 
whined and cried, while Rotundi supplied spare, acoustic piano-toned 
accompaniment from his synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most revealing of Quintero's approach was his arrangement of Horace Silver's 
"Song for My Father," which opened on a cha-cha riff before turning to a 
two-beat, Latin rhythm and later, in the middle of Quintero's improvisation, to 
a strong jazz walk. 
</P>
<P>
 To complicate matters further, the guitarist strung together a series of 
Asian-inspired chords, of the sort heard in Japanese koto music, over the walk 
before returning to the cha-cha pace. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this sounds a bit complicated, it wasn't. The transitions were 
seamless, due largely to drummer Passilas ' ease in shifting gears. 
Appropriately enough, Passilas was given solo space during "Song for My Father" 
and he filled his effort with a timbale-like attack that he decorated with 
cross-handed cymbal crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintero will return to the county in June to play the San Juan Capistrano 
Regional Library's Multicultural Performing and Visual Arts Series.

JAZZ REVIEW; SAX PLAYER SHOWS WHY HE SHINES IN GERMANY; KARL DENSON OF LAKE 
FOREST PERFORMS HARD-CORNERING, QUIRKY ORIGINALS THAT SHOWCASE HIS WRITING AND 
PLAYING TALENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karl Denson is one of the fast-rising young stars of the saxophone -- but only 
in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Forest resident, who won the John Coltrane Festival's Young Artist 
Award in 1992, has a pair of fine albums out in Germany on the Minor Music 
label. A third, set for release later this year, includes the distinguished 
rhythm section of drummer Jack DeJohnette and bassist Dave Holland. Denson 
tours Germany on a regular basis, and will return there later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night at System M, Denson showed why the Europeans are so bullish on 
his music as he wound his way through a set of quirky, hard-cornering originals 
that showcased his writing as well as his playing talents. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall effect was one of incredulity: Why isn't this man touring this 
country's major clubs? Why hasn't one of the major U.S. jazz labels signed him? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because it's hard to get comfortable with Denson's music. Though 
accessible, his tunes have more faces than Rubik's cube, swinging hard here, 
progressing in considered fashion there and always full of breaks, jumps and 
tempo shifts. Just when you think you've got a handle on one of his numbers, 
the piece, like a chameleon, changes colors. 
</P>
<P>
 After warming up his quintet with the standard "Dear Old Stockholm," Denson 
moved his band into "Honey Lemon Tea" (many of his tunes and all his albums 
carry titles with food references) that had bassist Benjamin May and pianist 
Christian Jacob sounding a unison rhythm line as solid as a heartbeat. Then May 
took the lead, plucking a melodic line on his upright until Denson, on tenor, 
stated a brief anthem in tandem with Ron Stout's fluegelhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From there the band jumped into a walking rhythm that supported Christian's 
winding, McCoy Tyner-influenced improvisation. Next, Denson took the solo 
spotlight, spewing flurries of notes that danced around a series of low-end 
honks, before a call-and-response session with Stout, now on trumpet, that 
brought the tune to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Round About" was an up-tempo workout peppered with sudden breaks of 
silence. Stout used the set-up for one of his best trumpet solos, singing on 
the high tones in the style of the late Lee Morgan, while adding some tricks 
from Freddie Hubbard's bag for good measure. Despite these references, Stout is 
very much his own man. His playing not only gave glimpses into the history of 
his instrument, but its future as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Denson worked his way back into the tune alone, with the rhythm section laying 
out. His tenor presentation was dense, yet sprightly, and decorated with 
calypso touches. The band again jumped in behind him and Denson took off, 
blustering and squealing without a loss of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dinosaurs" also featured dramatic breaks, as well as two-note exclamations 
from the horns that served as touchstones as the piece progressed. "Sue's a 
Butterfly," with Denson on alto, opened as a ballad, before metamorphosing into 
a mid-tempo exercise with a strong dynamic build. 
</P>
<P>
 Denson closed the set with Wayne Shorter's "Armageddon," a serious piece that 
he spiced with a Latin tempo. The tones from his bent-neck soprano (a horn that 
looks much like a miniature alto) had a glossy, clean character, and the 
saxophonist bobbed and swayed as he skated through his improvisation. Drummer 
Thomas White, always comfortable with the changing face of Denson's music, 
exchanged crisp, playful lines with the band before the number was brought to a 
tight, triumphant close. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the first set, Denson showed a childlike innocence in his playing. 
Though he's no happy-face musician, his work does have a playful, joyous 
quality, that is at once teasing and inviting. During more raucous passages, he 
showed he's absorbed the lessons of John Coltrane, but his sound is less deadly 
serious and more celebratory, a direction that leaves listeners feeling buoyant 
and amused. 
</P>
<P>
 Denson returns to System M on Saturday with his groove-oriented acid band, The 
Grey Boy All Stars. That group also has recorded in Europe in a session that 
included guest trombonist Fred Wesley from the J.B. (James Brown) horn section. 
Maybe this more commercially oriented ensemble will gain Denson the respect 
here in his homeland that he has overseas.

 MacDowell's Weekend: There was double good news for Andie MacDowell, one of 
the stars of the newly released "Bad Girls," who found herself featured in the 
weekend's two top box-office attractions. Twentieth Century Fox's film about 
the adventures of four women of the West was in the No. 1 spot during the 
weekend with $5 million in ticket sales, according to early industry estimates. 
Gramercy Pictures' "Four Weddings and a Funeral," in which MacDowell is 
featured with Hugh Grant, was in second place with $4.7 million. In third was a 
newcomer from director Matty Rich, Buena Vista's "The Inkwell," with $2.5 
million. In fourth: Universal's "The Paper," with $2.4 million. TriStar's "Cops 
& Robbersons" tied with Disney's "D2 The Mighty Ducks" for fifth with $2.3 
million. Overall, it was a slow weekend.

 The Quest for Johnny: Get ready to see a lot of Johnny Quest, that 
globe-trotting 12-year-old. Turner Broadcasting announced a series of projects 
featuring the kid-adventurer, his scientist dad and his best pal, all based on 
the original animated "Adventures of Johnny Quest" series. A live-action 
feature film is scheduled to begin production next year. Also slated for next 
year, an animated movie to premiere on TNT as well as an animated TV series, 
both to be produced by Hanna-Barbera. "The Adventures of Johnny Quest" first 
ran as a cartoon on ABC in 1964 and continued over the years on various 
networks. It was also adapted into a comic book.

 Response to Kushnick Suit: Robert Miller, vice president and publisher of 
Hyperion, said there is "no basis" for Helen Gorman Kushnick's lawsuit over her 
depiction in its book, "The Late Shift," on the machinations of the late-night 
television talk shows. "The facts in the book were appropriately researched and 
found to be fully supported," Miller said in a statement issued by Hyperion, a 
division of Disney Book Publishing. Kushnick, Jay Leno's former manager who 
briefly served as executive producer of "The Tonight Show," claimed in a 
lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court that the book by New York 
Times television reporter Bill Carter portrays her as "mentally unfit and 
incompetent" and cites eight statements that Kushnick claims are "false and 
defamatory."

 Roseanne-Free Week? Lonnie Lardner, entertainment reporter for KTTV-TV Channel

believes is a series of attempts by Arnold to manipulate the media. Lardner's 
ire was raised last week by Arnold's filing and subsequent withdrawal of a 
divorce proceeding against her husband, Tom. "Good Day L.A.'s" viewers are 
backing Lardner's stand, an overwhelming majority agreeing with the 
Roseanne-free week in a non-scientific poll. STAGE

 Phantom of Vegas: Michael Crawford, who won acclaim as the masked man in 
"Phantom of the Opera," will soon be on the Las Vegas stage. He'll star in 
"EFX!", a $30-million production to start next fall at the MGM Grand Hotel. The 
title takes its name from movie industry shorthand for "special effects." 
Crawford will play "The Effects Master" and appear as Merlin the wizard, P. T. 
Barnum, Harry Houdini and H. G. Wells. ART

 Photo Auction Gets Surprise: A Man Ray photograph of a woman's face and a 
carved African mask sold for $354,500 in a Christie's auction house sale that 
set records for him and some of the century's other major photographers. The 
1926 picture "Black and White" sold for nearly twice the pre-sale estimate of 
up to $180,000, and beat Man Ray's previous record of $222,500 for his 
triptych, "Yesterday, Tomorrow, Today." Records also were set for Edward 
Weston, Lewis Hine, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson at last week's sale, 
Christie's auction house in New York said. QUICK TAKES

 Frank Sinatra, who collapsed onstage last month, canceled a performance at 
Radio City Music Hall Friday just moments before his show was to begin. The 
78-year-old singer was suffering from an upper respiratory congestion and had 
been advised by his physician not to perform. . . . Comedian Ellen DeGeneres is 
joining the ranks of comics Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Reiser -- she's writing a 
book, due out in the fall of 1995 from Bantam Books. "I hope to follow in the 
tradition of Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway and Jackie Collins," she said. BETH

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CHASERS' HITS THE ROAD FOR NAVAL COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Chasers" combines raucous humor and unflagging zest with considerable wit and 
sophistication as Yeoman Second-Class Eddie Devane (William McNamara), at the 
Charleston, S.C., naval base, finds himself assigned to Chief Petty Officer 
Rock Reilly (Tom Berenger) to drive to the marine brig at Camp Lejeune, N.C., 
and transport a prisoner back to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough-guy, by-the-book Reilly, as gravel-voiced as George C. Scott's Gen. 
Patton, sizes up the cocky Eddie as a "poster boy for petty crime" -- little 
does he know just how well Devane has done for himself in the Navy Supply and 
Inventory Control. As mismatched as they are, they're both floored when their 
prisoner, a seaman second-class, turns out to be beautiful and sexy Toni 
Johnson (Erika Eleniak). The return trip turns out to be a rip-roaring comic 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Dennis Hopper has the anarchic spirit to make "Chasers" pay off, and 
writers Joe Batteer, John Rice and Dan Gilroy have provided him with a smart 
script, a deft mix of slapstick, sharp repartee and sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 What's shrewdest about the picture is that it waits till we get involved with 
this trio thoroughly before Toni's explanation of the inevitable extenuating 
circumstances of her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars are really winning -- even McNamara's Eddie, crook that he is -- and 
Hopper has lined up Gary Busey, Crispin Glover, Dean Stockwell, Frederic 
Forrest and Marilu Henner plus himself for nifty cameos. There's a lot of 
screwball humor in "Chasers"' classically amoral plot, yet adding to the film's 
freshness is that visually it's an affectionate running commentary on the 
amusing tackiness of roadside Americana. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for strong language and a scene of sexuality. Times 
guidelines: That scene of sexuality is quite steamy, plus there's considerable 
nudity; adult themes.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; DANCE; TRIUMPHANT VISIONS OF BALANCHINE FROM MIAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miami City Ballet is only 8 years old and it can't match the stylistic sheen 
or casting-in-depth of San Francisco Ballet and other seasoned regional 
companies. But, whatever their individual talents, nearly all the dancers in 
the 37-member ensemble share a common attack: distinctively incisive, emotional 
and energetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the ballet is a masterwork by the late George Balanchine or a novelty 
by the company's resident choreographer, the young Peruvian Jimmy Gamonet de 
los Heros, Miami City Ballet approaches it as a series of highly specific 
effects timed and projected for maximum surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic director Edward Villella used to dance like this and, in two programs 
over the weekend at the Wiltern Theatre, he transformed an unforgettable 
personal style into an unbeatable company strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Apollo," "The Four Temperaments," and "Rubies," the best of Villella's 
principals danced as if Balanchine choreographed especially for them -- and as 
if each ballet had nothing in common with any other. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot virtuoso of the company, Franklin Gamero, found an edge of wildness in 
Apollo that definitely needed taming by his fleet, supple Terpsichore, Maribel 
Modrono. In the central duet of "The Four T's," Modrono joined Marin Boieru for 
a twisty, jazzy playoff only slightly less memorable than their electric 
pairing in "Rubies." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Ann Isaacks danced the secondary (showgirl) role in "Rubies" with 
flamboyant star power, then banked her fires for a commanding performance of 
the "Temperament" finale. And, in the same ballet, rubber-legged Christopher 
Roman executed the rigors of the Phlegmatic solo brilliantly as a kind of 
eccentric improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 If Miami modernism triumphed on Friday and Saturday, the company's classicism 
proved less distinguished. In Balanchine's "Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux," Gamero 
looked technically uneven opposite Maribel Modrono's twin sister Mabel -- 
charming in other roles, but hectic and forced here. Spotty corps unisons and 
the tense lead performances of Marjorie Hardwick and Douglas Gawriljuk also 
weakened Gamonet de los Heros' "Divertimento Espanol."  
</P>
<P>
 This adaptation of Marius Petipa's "Paquita" leaves some of the original 
choreography intact, but introduces changes of speed and corps geometry, along 
with revising many of the women's solos -- sometimes to different music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By depicting an Andes wedding in the style of an Imperial Russian 
divertissement, Gamonet de los Heros' "Danzalta" also represented a tribute to 
the 19th Century -- though, toward the end, a Bejart influence suddenly emerged 
in a sequence juxtaposing the near-naked Gawriljuk with eight figures in 
imposing ceremonial costumes. The grand-scale spectacle of the engagement, 
"Danzalta" featured tiers of life-sized cloth figures designed by Carlos 
Arditti and a splashy commissioned score by Gordon Lowry Harrell. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gamonet de los Heros' biggest success here turned out to be the duet 
"Nous Sommes," an essay in slush-pump gymnastic rapture that Gamero and Mabel 
Modrono executed with devastating dignity and control. 
</P>
<P>
 Strongly led by Hardwick and Gawriljuk, his unfinished "D Symphonies" proved 
more original, using computer technology to bypass normal movement logic and 
create unexpected, "inhuman" virtuosity. With the dancers trying to look like 
figures in a video game, the ballet featured an abundance of clipped, 
deliberately arbitrary limb-effects: legs and arms abruptly shooting out, then 
snapping to a new position -- to canned Baroque music, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, overamplified audiotapes accompanied all the works on view, 
generating an inhuman technological overload even when resolutely old-fashioned 
balletic values held the stage.

COUNTERPUNCH: OK, SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA J. EVERS-MANLY, Sandra J. Evers-Manly is a resident of Los Angeles 
(in particular, a part of the area termed South-Central Los Angeles) and 
president of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood Branch of the NAACP. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Fox show "South Central" is the latest attempt to show one side of a 
particular Los Angeles community -- and not a very happy side. Unfortunately, 
many watching will believe this is the only side. But the picture is far bigger 
than just another show featuring African Americans. Because there are so few 
truly diverse images of people of color on television, many were, and for me 
are, really looking forward to the standard that "South Central" has the 
opportunity to set. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, the show will have a chance to go beyond the standard formula 
sitcom. "South Central" has merit but it shouldn't offend the community it 
seeks to mirror even if it's only "one side." A constant balance will make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, "South Central" deserves a chance, but so do the community voices that 
cry out in frustration over the impact that some of the troubling, recurring 
images of poverty and violence carry ("Drama of 'South Central' Stirs Debate," 
Calendar, April 12). True, this "South Central" is just one story of lives 
occurring in the " 'hood." But because the public perception about people of 
color is so deeply embedded, any new "old" stereotypical image is cause for 
concern. Television is a powerful medium and it shapes (distorts) the 
viewpoints of individuals around the globe. When the media fail to show a 
balanced look at any particular subject, the view becomes skewed and out of 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is far bigger! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There really isn't much in the way of diverse images of African Americans, and 
other people of color, in the mass media. Many talented African American actors 
in television are mired in an abundance of sitcoms. "South Central," with its 
dramatic intent, is viewed as a change that was long in its arrival. I hope it 
evolves into a powerful vehicle that will help balance the negative image so 
often shown of South-Central Los Angeles and African Americans in general. 
Certainly the role of the store owner in the show strongly does that. Not to 
mention that the show has one of the best casts on the tube. I also understand 
that one show alone cannot carry the entire cultural burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the mass media (be it print, television or film) have made short 
work of the images of African Americans, and other people of color, in the 
supposed quest for reality, a great story or just for entertainment value. I am 
constantly appalled by the lack of consciousness displayed by film and 
television executives, who have (I thought) some responsibility to the citizens 
they seek to entertain. This is the picture that needs to be in focus. 
</P>
<P>
 I read Greg Braxton's Calendar article and many other commentaries and 
articles in reference to the "community" being outraged over "South Central" 
and rarely do they say anything in regard to other culturally demeaning shows 
such as "Martin" and "Def Comedy Jam." Perhaps the articles and commentaries 
should be focused on why these voices are speaking out, why they have such 
concerns about these issues, why they haven't been given a platform to have 
meaningful dialogue -- why such concerns exist over our images, which for 
African Americans and other people of color is not a new phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, many in the community are just as eager to speak out on positive 
television shows, such as "Roc," that balance our images and are socially 
responsible. However, articles and commentaries concerning the positive are few 
and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our images always seem to be decided upon, judged and court-martialed by an 
unknown system our community is not supposed to question. The community rarely 
has a say on the distorted, one-dimensional images that repeatedly find their 
way into the public consciousness. When they do, the media tend to take honest 
feedback and make it controversial instead of finding the "root cause" of one's 
frustration. This is the picture we must focus on and change immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger picture asks why, with all the surrounding talent, haven't the 
networks put together more great dramatic series featuring African Americans, 
Asian Americans, Latinos or Native Americans? (The bigger picture reminds me of 
a study that revealed that African Americans watch more television than any 
other ethnic group.) The bigger picture prods me to state that no one should be 
left out of the panoramic view! Just think of all the new, fresh, different, 
culturally rich shows that could be developed in a matter of weeks, if the 
commitment was there. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to be quoted this time next year praising the new crop of shows, 
or films, because (finally) diversity and drama are walking hand-in-hand 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the community (silently in Hollywood) are struggling to make sure this 
happens, even through voices of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture could sure use a new angle.

COUNTERPUNCH: TEEN CAN'T COMPREHEND KURT COBAIN'S SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 A lot of people do not realize how much of a role model Kurt Cobain played in 
the lives of so many young teens. His outstanding lyrics, which he tried so 
desperately to write from his heart, express pain, anger and hate from his 
childhood memories. These honest, humble lyrics immediately built a bond 
between him and his many fans alike ("In Seattle, a Mood of Teen Dispirit," 
April 12, Calendar). He expressed his feelings in a way his fans wish they 
could have, but never knew how. His realistic lyrics bring young teens to grip 
with their own reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cobain's reality was missing something he rarely wrote about, 
something his fans lacked also. This was love. Cobain tried earnestly to find 
love somewhere, but his childhood memories and agonizing pain of stardom kept a 
distance between him and love. In his last attempts to find love and happiness, 
Cobain gave up and committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 If a rich, powerful, singer-songwriter, father, idol and role model could not 
find happiness, what will make his fans believe in themselves so that they, 
unlike Cobain, can? Times Pop Music Critic Robert Hilburn says Cobain is a 
spokesman  
</P>
<P>
 for this generation. 
</P>
<P>
 True, but I, and a few other sources, say watch this "spokesman" lead many 
dysfunctional teens into eternal misery-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more after Cobain's death, I begin to see the potential he had to 
find happiness. It is the potential to want it. Cobain wanted the best for his 
wife and daughter, he wanted the best for himself. Money did not give him that. 
Being a star did not give him that. Drugs did not give him that. Suicide did 
not give him that. He turned everywhere for help. Unfortunately he made all the 
wrong turns. "Please," we wanted to say, "don't give up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard part is that my folks just don't understand what he meant to me," 
said one fan at Cobain's memorial, according to Hilburn. A lot of people do not 
understand. Even after many young, devoted fans follow in Cobain's footsteps, 
many of us still will not be able to comprehend the reason why.

COUNTERPUNCH: KFI PUT RATINGS AHEAD OF RESPONSIBILITY

 Re: "Germany Deports 2 Neo-Nazi KFI-Radio Guests" (Calendar, April 15): 
</P>
<P>
 KFI program director David Hall professed surprise that the German government 
would bar John Metzger, a notorious American neo-Nazi, from accompanying one of 
his talk-show hosts to Germany. "We don't know Mr. Metzger," he said. "Except 
for this one project we really don't have anything to do with him. I guess 
there's a lot about him that we really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Such faux naivete speaks volumes about radio's elevation of ratings over 
responsibility. Did KFI really not know who it was dealing with when it 
underwrote Metzger's air fare to Germany and Poland? John Metzger and his 
father, Tom, have long been active in a variety of white supremacist 
organizations, including the White Aryan Resistance, the Ku Klux Klan and the 
White Student Union. Both Metzgers were found legally liable for inciting 
neo-Nazi skinheads to beat to death an Ethiopian immigrant in Portland in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Did the station think it was appropriate to mark Holocaust remembrance week by 
providing an avowed anti-Semite with an opportunity to broadcast his incendiary 
ravings from Dachau and Auschwitz? 
</P>
<P>
 Propriety and responsibility seem to mean little in a world in which hate 
produces maximum market share. During ratings sweeps periods, many television 
and radio talk-show hosts feign self-righteousness as they interview bigots of 
every stripe. Rare is the Warren Olney or Joel Roberts, hosts who have clearly 
done their homework and who examine issues of race and religion with care and 
thought. Too many hosts simply offer couches and platforms for media-savvy 
extremists who promote divisiveness. Media and bigot feed off each other and 
each is satisfied: The bigot magnifies his significance, and the radio station 
manufactures controversy. The result is pollution on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies that radio stations have every right to offer alternative and 
even noxious views. However, surely a modicum of preparation is called for 
before giving air time to an extremist. If KFI was unaware of Metzger's views 
and propensities, what purpose was there in having him broadcast from 
concentration camps? If KFI was aware of those views, was the point simply to 
exploit the Holocaust for ratings? 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to believe that Bill Handel, the morning personality who was 
to broadcast with Metzger, imagined Metzger would have an epiphany and abandon 
his bigotry in Auschwitz. It is a pipe dream to think that Metzger sought 
anything other than an opportunity to capitalize on his notoriety. In offering 
Metzger a respectable forum, KFI would have simply provided him the attention 
and the audience he craves. 
</P>
<P>
 And in showcasing a bigot, KFI and Bill Handel would have paid a price. They 
still may have. Dirt sticks.

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; CONDUCTOR BALTER GUESTS WITH LONG BEACH SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the absence of music director JoAnn Falletta, it was left to guest 
conductor Alan Balter, director of the Akron and Memphis symphonies, to do what 
he could with an unfamiliar orchestra (the Long Beach Symphony) and a 
super-familiar program (Beethoven and Tchaikovsky) Saturday night in Terrace 
Theater at the Long Beach Convention Center. The effort seemed valiant. 
</P>
<P>
 But to expect miracles in such well-traveled repertory from musicians just 
getting to know each other is perhaps unwise. At any rate, the results of the 
Balter-Long Beach collaboration were of the merely solid rather than inspired 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't get any help from the soloist on hand, either. When one listener 
saw the piano being plugged in for Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto, he wanted to 
run for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who cares about subtlety, proportion, touch and tone color, the 
amplification made this performance dicey from the start, and the 30-year-old 
soloist, Russian pianist Leonid Kuzmin, in a fast, blunt, occasionally muddled 
and apparently unthinking reading, took care of the rest. Balter's 
accompaniment was nothing special. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, the conductor had led the world premiere of Martin Herman's 
engaging "The Fractal Bow," a work employing algorithms "to express," says the 
composer, "the deeply resonating beauty and dynamism in chaos in musical 
terms." Yet the formidable math behind the composition results in a thoroughly 
interesting soundscape, a chugging, shifting, phasing-in-and-out type of music 
that shows the good sense of keeping its materials simple even while its 
processes aren't. Balter and orchestra gave it an energetic send-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Energetic, too, was Balter's reading of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, 
certainly not an especially magical or distinctive outing for the score, but 
easy of gait, reasonably detailed, polished and, ultimately, effective. TIMOTHY

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; L.A. DANCE THEATRE GIVES TWO PREMIERES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Widely regarded as one of the brilliant choreographers of his generation, 
Donald Byrd has created works for companies such as the Alvin Ailey American 
Dance Theater as well as his own New York-based troupe. So it was something of 
a coup for Lula Washington's Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre to 
commission and get a work from Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, "The Communion," which received its premiere Saturday in Thorne 
Hall at Occidental College in Eagle Rock, pays happy, overt and prolonged 
homage to Washington as teacher, leader and nurturer -- in short, as matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially seated on a kind of throne, Washington was observed by four alert, 
attentive dancers -- her daughter, Tamica Washington, and Atalya Bates, Maisha 
Brown and Jennifer Newman. Her sharp-edged, emblematic moves, set against a 
pulsing score by Byrd's regular collaborator, Mio Morales, established the 
vocabulary which was explored and incrementally developed by the four women. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the work, Byrd had the four move in tight synchronicity, 
sustaining and multiplying images of swelling force through use of an 
irrefutable movement logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the company members required more frequent rest spots than do 
his own accomplished dancers, and so the piece -- despite some lovely images of 
Washington cradling three of the dancers one by one -- grew episodic and blurry 
by the end. The final solos, too, looked geared mostly for garnering audience 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Also receiving its premiere was Washington's "Jookin," an eight-part theater 
suite of social dances in which the overwrought emotive duties assigned to 
Tamica often grated against the sensitive excepts about loneliness and search 
read by actress Dianne McCannon from works by Terry McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the program was " '93: The Year of Technology," a 20-minute segment 
from Washington's previously reviewed "Circle of Dance." CHRIS PASLES

ALBUM REVIEW; A WALK ON THE DARK SIDE (****); JOHNNY CASH; "AMERICAN

 It's been ages since anyone of Cash's stature bared himself so completely -- 
and successfully -- as the Man in Black does on his first album for Rick 
Rubin's record label.With just his own unmistakably craggy voice and 
acoustic-guitar accompaniment, Cash has collected 13 songs that peer into the 
dark corners of the American soul. In that respect, it's akin to Clint 
Eastwood's "Unforgiven," both in its valedictory, folklore-rich tone and in its 
wealth of characters who embody good and evil in varying proportions. A 
milestone work for this legendary singer. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; HOUSE OF BLUES OPENING BASH WORTH WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Help Ever. Hurt Never." 
</P>
<P>
 The words, visible on every video monitor at the House of Blues during its 
private opening bash on Friday, are the motto of the new Sunset Strip 
nightclub.While the club's employees made a laudable attempt to be helpful, the 
hourlong wait in line outside certainly hurt a few Hollywood egos. 
</P>
<P>
 But the party -- the first in a series of invitation-only inaugural events 
before it opens to the public on Sunday with Isaac Hayes headlining -- was 
worth the wait. Despite the crush of people vying for the hottest ticket in 
town, the event made the recent lineup of Oscar night parties seem stodgy in 
comparison.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside, guests repeatedly uttered the same sentiment: "I don't feel like I'm 
in L.A." Some decided the spacious, blues-themed room -- with a collection of 
"outsider" and blues-based art as impressive as the lineup of upcoming acts -- 
has the look and feel of a New Orleans venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Richards, k.d. lang, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt and Snoop Doggy Dogg were 
among the 1,000 folks in the second-level restaurant and the jam-packed dance 
floor rocking out to the evening's highlight -- a 15-song set by club investors 
Aerosmith. The stage, which is decorated with numerous religious icons (when 
they move it's not an act of God, but of an ingenious hydraulic system), is 
easily visible from nearly every nook and cranny, and the sound system is 
first-rate. To paraphrase one of Aerosmith's highly audible lyrics, House of 
Blues is clearly not the same old song and dance. HEIDI SIEGMUND

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; NKOTB CAN'T HIDE BEHIND AN ACRONYM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No Kidding: On The Block. The chopping block, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the recently acronymed ex-teen-idol group NKOTB finds itself 
these days -- abandoned to its critics now that the little girls have grown up 
and moved on.The quintet's latest album dropped off the Top 200 chart almost 
instantly, and once-slavish Top 40 programmers are denying they ever knew the 
New Kids. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, at the Palace on Friday -- where the R&B vocalizers were backed by a 
six-piece band and three dancers -- there was the same screaming near-hysteria 
among what faithful remain, albeit at a different pitch. Average age at a New 
Kids show six years ago: 12. Average now: 18. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, you could almost root along with the predominantly female full house 
for a fair shake for the lads. Quite unlike six years ago, the hip-hop 
choreography is actually grown-up-level good , and cute guys warbling in 
creditable falsettos never go out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dancing got slacker as the set went along, and Donnie Wahlberg's 
ridiculous macho-man raps kept interfering with whatever tentative charm his 
fellows' balladry might offer. The set included just over half-a-dozen numbers 
-- all from the new album, save for a perfunctory oldies medley -- padded to an 
hour with a lot of self-congratulatory chitchat (none of it acknowledging the 
absence of missing Kid Jonathan Knight, due to a horse-riding accident). 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; KIDJO'S DELIVERY MAKES DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelique Kidjo counts on emotional delivery to overcome the communication gap 
that comes from singing to an American audience in several African languages. 
The Benin-born, Paris-based singer's two 45-minute sets at LunaPark on Saturday 
proved the wisdom of that course.Kidjo's vibrant stage personality was abetted 
by a cosmopolitan musical mix that looks to the international dance floor as a 
meeting ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Her five-piece band revolved around the drums-percussion duo of David Fall and 
Jaco Largent -- too much so in the early going, when the rhythms overwhelmed 
everything except Alain Bonnin's keyboards. Rushed tempos also hurt some early 
songs, but Kidjo always seemed to have an answer -- be it choreographed dance 
routines with her two backing singers or enthusiastically received sing-along 
segments. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound and performance began to jell during "Ekoleya," which blends a 
gospel chord progression with an almost hip-hop bridge. Fittingly, the 
breakthrough came on an old African song, "Malaika," where Kidjo's supple voice 
got its first real opportunity to soar and the audience chanted the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 When she followed with "Batonga's" syncopated funk grooves topped by Bonnin's 
Arabic keyboard melody, the night and the audience belonged to Kidjo. DON 
SNOWDEN

THEATER REVIEWS; NOSOTROS' 'CHICKEN' A COURTROOM PLAY ABOUT INDIGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If "L.A. Law" could broadcast an episode about bull semen, why can't Nosotros 
Theatre stage a courtroom drama about flatulence? Perhaps this is the 
motivation behind "The Chicken Mole Trial," Bob Herrera's definitive 
exploration of indigestion caused by Mexican food. 
</P>
<P>
 A weeping Chamelia Rodriguez (Julia Vera) is suing Gorda Gomez (Ruth Ortiz), 
claiming that her former best friend sabotaged her marriage and stole her 
husband.Who else would have slipped a dreaded Mexican laxative into the Chicken 
mole, hospitalizing 235 wedding guests with "Montezuma's Revenge"? 
</P>
<P>
 Expert prosecution witnesses include Dr. Osmo Oswald (Jerry Hyde), "the 
foremost authority on flatulence" and author of "A Movement in Time." Healer 
Chacha La Bruja (Chi Chi Navarro) also testifies for the prosecution, but after 
she enters a trance and curses the opposing attorney (Melissa Licker) with 
"Thunder Thighs . . . feel the sagging of your butt!" our sympathies are with 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Vera's burlesque direction, the 15-actor ensemble labors mightily to 
create a Rabelaisian farce; in the end, the pressure to generate laughter only 
backfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chicken Mole Trial" is a sitcom in search of a television outlet, but 
airing such sexist, misogynistic, infantile and obscene material could 
necessitate a sequel in a real court. Consumers might sue for defamation of 
artistic license. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Chicken Mole Trial," Nosotros Theatre, 1314 N. Wilton Place, Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends May 1. $10-$8 (213) 465-4167. 
Running time: 2 hours.

JAGLOM'S 'BABYFEVER' LOOKS AT REAL LIFE; MOVIES: THE DIRECTOR CO-WROTE THE FILM 
WITH HIS WIFE, WHO ALSO STARS IN THE FILM AS AN ANGST- FILLED WOMAN WHO HEARS 
HER BIOLOGICAL CLOCK TICKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To set the record straight: Henry Jaglom's first name is not short for 
"Henrietta." 
</P>
<P>
 People could be forgiven for thinking Jaglom is a woman, however, based on his 
most high-profile films, 1990's "Eating," which rather painfully examined 
women's private neuroses about food, and his current "Babyfever," which 
explores the issues surrounding thirtysomething women's dreaded ticking 
biological clocks. Even the smaller film he made in between, 1992's 
"Venice/Venice," focused on the way movies affect women's expectations of 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Eating" and "Babyfever" consist largely of women speaking directly to 
the camera, often about their own real-life experiences  
</P>
<P>
 "I listen to women," says Jaglom, 51, in an interview at the Sunset Boulevard 
offices of his production and distribution firm, the Rainbow Film Co. "Women's 
lives are not really represented on screen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '80s, he says, many men in Hollywood were skeptical when he told 
them he was making a film about women and food. And in fact, he doesn't know of 
any men who went to see "Eating" without women, and says that many of the men 
who did see it dismissed it as "women sitting around and complaining." But the 
film garnered critical praise and a cult following, and did nearly $8 million 
at the box office (it cost less than $1 million to make). 
</P>
<P>
 "Babyfever," which opened in Los Angeles on April 13 and will open nationally 
May 6, the Friday of Mother's Day weekend, will appeal to men as well as women, 
Jaglom believes, since many men, especially baby boomers, have strong feelings 
about their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been in touch with my feelings," Jaglom says. "Even as a kid I 
cared more about what was going on inside me than football and business and 
money and war and all the things that men use to divert themselves from their 
internal emotions. My natural friendships started developing with women." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally trained as an actor, Jaglom began his behind-the-camera career as 
an editorial consultant on Dennis Hopper's 1969 classic, "Easy Rider." Since 
then, he has written and directed 10 films, many of which he has starred in as 
well. He distributes and finances his films independently, and thinks of 
himself as "the luckiest man in Hollywood" because he has complete creative 
control over his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaglom co-wrote "Babyfever" with his wife, actress Victoria Foyt, who also 
stars in the film as Gena, an Angst- filled woman who hears her biological 
clock ticking. The film's story line revolves around a baby shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Foyt had already given birth to the couple's daughter when the film was 
made, both she and Jaglom had experienced baby fever themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a couple of years feeling very insecure every time a woman would 
stroll by with a nice stroller and a beautiful baby," said Foyt, who is 32. 
Jaglom, meanwhile, says he heard his "psychological clock" ticking. Both were 
searching for the right person. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1990, Jaglom received one of the postcards Foyt had sent out 
to promote her performance in a play. He threw it out, then searched through 
his trash can, found it and called her, without really knowing why. "It was 
meant to be," says Foyt. "We both knew instantly that it was right." They were 
married in October 1991, and their first daughter, Sabrina, was born a month 
later.  
</P>
<P>
 Though "Babyfever" taps into a wide range of women's opinions about having 
children, it offers no definite conclusions. "Since I'm a man, I don't really 
presume to know the answer," Jaglom says. "It (the film) opens up the issue. 
There's a terrible tendency to put it all off." 
</P>
<P>
 The film opened the issue for the cast so effectively that it caused an 
outbreak of real-life baby fever on the set. Two of the actresses in the film, 
Frances Fisher and Tracy Brooks Swope, have already given birth, and a third, 
Denise Osso, is expecting. All three became pregnant after shooting the film, 
as did Foyt again; she is expecting a boy in June. Jaglom now has two films in 
post-production, neither of which, atypically, focuses on women's issues. "A 
House in the Hamptons," which will be released next winter, is about a New York 
theatrical family, and "Lucky Ducks," a sequel to his 1980 "Sitting Ducks," is 
a comedy about what men want. 
</P>
<P>
 But after them, Jaglom is planning two films centered on women, although he 
says he's not concerned about being typecast. "That's a nice type," Jaglom 
says. "I make films about women and their issues -- that's half the population. 
They're really films about human behavior."

TV REVIEWS; 'GETTING OUT' GETS INTO MOTHER, DAUGHTER STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Getting Out" (as in getting out of prison) stretches the dramatic parameters 
of the network movie with a tough psychological portrait of a female ex-con and 
her relationship with a mother from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca De Mornay, with a desperate and yearning country twang, plays a 
tough/vulnerable Georgia woman full of mistrust after emerging from eight years 
behind bars for theft and murder. Ellen Burstyn, framed by wire-rim glasses 
that give her face a cold, metallic impersonality, is the young woman's 
chilling mom, denying her forgiveness for her old hooking days. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Korty draws a complex and rich portrait from De Mornay, whose 
character is fighting to stay clean and gain custody of a son she gave birth to 
in jail. She's pursuing honest work (washing dishes and teaching knitting) and 
even has kicked out her old lounge lizard of a pimp (the feral Robert Knepper). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This second "ABC Premiere Showcase" (which debuted last month with the much 
more accessible "Yarn Princess") deserves credit for refreshingly tossing 
dramatic convention to the wind with this tale of moral squalor. It is based on 
Marsha Norman's earliest play, "Getting Out," which was inspired by her 
teaching work in Kentucky facilities. (The play was originally staged here at 
the Mark Taper in 1978, before Norman went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for " 
'night, Mother"). 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's to be expected that a movie has its own distinctions and will 
not mirror a theatrical experience, there is one crucial difference in this 
case. The teleplay by Eugene Corr and Ruth Shapiro shortchanges the complete 
arc of the play -- that is, the parolee's on-stage interior dialogues that 
dramatize the woman's incorrigible youth and tell us how she got to be bad in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie only hints at the character's childhood with a few flashbacks and 
emphasizes the woman's life after jail, but not what got her there. Thus, the 
movie is less penetrating than the play but still compelling as TV. 
</P>
<P>

TV REVIEWS; 'SPRINGROLL' RECALLS VIETNAM VIA FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one can understand the culture of a country without experiencing its food. 
That's the premise of "Anatomy of a Springroll," a most unusual and appealingly 
quirky documentary about a 37-year-old Vietnamese man's reflections on his 
youth and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 An ethnic Chinese, Paul Kwan fled war-torn Vietnam at 18. He eventually 
settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he became an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kwan's most profound recollections of Saigon aren't of hardship and 
strife. Instead, he rapturously recalls the culinary delights that helped 
define his home city -- sweet rice with coconut shreds, fresh chili, spicy rice 
noodle soup with fish and shrimp paste, pate sandwiches . . . and, most of all, 
springrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese have been at war for 1,000 years -- invaded by the Chinese, 
colonized by the French and bombed by the Americans," says Kwan, who serves as 
the film's narrator. "And what have they produced? Fabulous food. . . . 
Americans have 200 years of freedom and high technology and what have they 
produced? The Big Mac!" 
</P>
<P>
 For Kwan, food is the most accurate and enjoyable means of connecting with his 
ethnic roots. When we see his septuagenarian mother intensely preparing a 
Vietnamese feast in her California kitchen, it's not work but a form of 
cultural and artistic expression. After Kwan tries his hand at making 
springrolls, she checks each one to make sure they've been rolled correctly. 
"Too loose," she says of one springroll that didn't make the grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour documentary reaches a revealing climax when Kwan returns to 
Saigon for the first time. Many of the neighborhood landmarks from his 
childhood -- the soy sauce factory, the coffee roasting business and the opium 
den -- are long gone. But more significantly, the sounds of sizzling woks and 
the sights of bustling marketplaces remain intact. The many mouthwatering shots 
of Vietnamese cuisine in this film are sure to stir those more adventurous 
palates. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed and written by Kwan and longtime creative partner Arnold Iger, 
"Anatomy of a Springroll" tells its story in a variety of imaginative ways. A 
Vietnamese folk tale about a cook who is enslaved by a voracious emperor is 
told through traditional puppets; a dream sequence is illustrated via 
animation, and a hilarious segment imagining the possibilities should the Kwan 
springroll recipe be parlayed into a fast-food business is reminiscent of 
Laurie Anderson's multimedia work. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; UNSAVORY DEBUT FOR CANDY'S 'HOSTAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether John Candy ever might have gone on to develop a directorial style will 
never be known. What is known is that "Hostage for a Day" -- a TV movie that 
marked his directing debut, completed before his death -- wasn't a promising 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 It hews closer to the cheap laughs of Candy's worst movie vehicles than the 
knowing ones of his great "SCTV" days, despite his having brought several 
fellow Second City alumni in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The titular "Hostage" here is George Wendt, as a lovable lug who wakes up on 
his 41st birthday married to a cheating, money-grubbing, shrewish spouse 
("Saturday Night Live"/"SCTV" vet Robin Duke) and pathetically indebted to her 
bullying father (John Vernon). Terminally harried, he gets out his old coonskin 
cap and flashes back, figuratively and literally, to his bucolic childhood when 
he dreamed of heading to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 A chance meeting with his pre-adolescent sweetheart (Christopher Templeton) 
gives him the impetus to realize that dream. His escape plan: to feign being 
held hostage by Russian terrorists. The wacky catch: He really does end up a 
hostage of Russian terrorists. This lowest-common-denominator slapstick doesn't 
play out any more cleverly than it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Passingly, Wendt and his newly rediscovered love manage some sweet moments, 
and any feature that features a disabled woman as a romantic lead without 
making a messy plot point out of it deserves a good mention.  
</P>
<P>
 But mostly the movie goes for the mustiest, most exaggerated and misogynistic 
laughs, giving us bumbling law enforcement, dastardly Russians (one of which is 
a bearded Candy, in a cameo) and gold-digger wives as guffaw fodder. This is 
two hours of comedy held hostage, best avoided by Candy fans who want to savor 
their memories.

TV REVIEWS; DENNIS MILLER FINDS HIMSELF IN HBO SLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Miller joked about recently returning from a two-week stay at "the 
Federal Talk Show Host Rehabilitation Program," but in fact he looked fresher, 
better-groomed and more relaxed on his new HBO show, which debuted Friday 
night, than he did on his syndicated talk show that tanked two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, he's working in a format that's not only a better showcase for 
his talents -- which include heavy irony and the glittering verbal riff -- but 
also is better suited for his intelligence and that of the viewer. Gone are the 
visibly groping efforts to connect with couch-side celebrities and the furtive, 
sweaty panic that made it seem as though his cue cards ran on a dual track with 
his jagged Nielsens. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on Friday night he joked about doing his irresponsible best to blur the 
lines between news and entertainment, which is what everyone else is doing. But 
he offered a refreshingly new direction out of the dreary fatuousness of 
entertainment talk shows: He takes an important topic and, as far as his guest 
interview is concerned, treats it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence in America was his subject Friday, and in his discussion with Sen. 
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who appeared on a TV monitor, Miller showed himself a 
skilled interviewer. He posed good, concise questions, listened well, and 
unlike Bill Maher, who hosts "Politically Incorrect" on Comedy Central, he 
didn't bird-dog every response to try to flush out a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was that an important topic was illuminated as best as it could be 
under the circumstances, Bradley came off spontaneous and informative -- if 
senatorially circumspect -- and Miller was able to deliver an appropriate sense 
of gravity without plunging the program into hand-wringing lament. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller seems to have grown in confidence and, free of the more conventional 
late-night star wars, a half-hour is just the right playing weight. Although 
issues may be a bit short-changed, we're spared the lethal dose of some of 
Miller's enduringly obnoxious traits -- his grinding sarcasm, his punkish 
vulgarity, his snide drone and his weird laugh that seems to issue from the 
hollow center of a mechanical clown.

LAW OFFICERS PLANNING SECURITY FOR NIXON RITES; PREPARATIONS: QUESTION REMAINS 
AS TO WHICH HEADS OF STATE WILL ATTEND. MOURNERS VISIT YORBA LINDA SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the world's attention began to turn toward this placid suburban community, 
mourners and Secret Service agents alike descended Sunday on the grounds of the 
site where Richard Nixon was born 81 years ago, and where he will be buried 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials met throughout the day to plan security for a 
funeral that will draw the President of the United States, the four living 
former chief executives and a galaxy of international representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the biggest questions remained unanswered, even amid the buzz of 
anticipation: Who will attend the invitation-only funeral set for Wednesday at 
the library that bears Nixon's name? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's chief of protocol, Gayle Anderson, said officials have 
confirmed that Russia, Japan and China will all be represented at the Wednesday 
burial in Yorba Linda, and attendance by heads of state or government from any 
or all those nations now appears likely, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Japan's new premier be there to mourn the first passing of a U.S. 
President in two decades? Which of the dignitaries from the political 
establishment that once shunned him will make it to Orange County? And what of 
the "co-conspirators" in the scandal that forced Nixon's resignation in 1974? 
No one seems certain, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no official word on that, as we speak," Anderson said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said the State Department's Office of Protocol would not have a 
guest list until today at the earliest. "Our diplomatic note (to foreign 
governments) only went out late yesterday and, this being Sunday, we're not 
hearing anything back. By tomorrow we should have a better idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Army issued orders for dawn-to-dusk cannon salutes every 30 
minutes beginning today, climaxing with a 50-gun salvo after the former 
President's casket has been lowered. And local church leaders mourned Nixon on 
Sunday as a man who, despite the indelible stain of Watergate on his record, 
was deserving of plaudits. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials stepped up their preparations for the event and the 
worldwide attention that it will bring to Yorba Linda, a quiet community of 
57,000 people that is more accustomed to hosting equestrian events than 
gatherings of international leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be planeloads of people coming for this funeral," said one 
official helping to plan the event. "This is going to be bigger than anyone is 
expecting. The list of people who want to be here just keeps on growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on all the attention suddenly focused on Orange County, Supervisor 
William G. Steiner said: "It's pretty unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County florists were struggling to keep up with the demand for sympathy 
bouquets, while posh hotels reported a run on rooms and were scheduling 
additional staff to cope with the expected flood of guests coming for the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had calls as early as Friday night," said Jim Luce, director of marketing 
for the Anaheim Marriott, adding that one group reserved 10 suites. The 
Marriott in Fullerton is nearly sold out for tonight and Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we are completely sold out for Tuesday, because that's when 
everyone wants to come in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While hospitality is always the order of the day, Luce said hotel staffers 
will be on alert to follow proper protocol and security measures for visiting 
VIPS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to make sure the proper respect is paid at all times (and) the 
desired type of room is supplied," he said, adding that special dietary needs 
are also addressed. "The chief concern, however, when you're dealing with heads 
of state, is security." 
</P>
<P>
 Some hoteliers were unruffled by the prospect of a flood of prominent guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as dignitaries are concerned, we have all kinds of people staying here 
on a daily basis, so no special arrangements are being made," said Raeann Blue, 
manager of Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. "We make sure all our guests get 
the best service." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district includes Yorba Linda, said: 
"I think without question the eyes of the world will be focused on Orange 
County. It's quite a substantial effort, extending hospitality across the 
country and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace was closed Sunday, and will 
remain so until Tuesday afternoon when Nixon's body will lie in state, crowds 
lined up outside to sign a visitors log and put their best wishes on pages of 
an album that is to be presented to the Nixon family. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have done since Friday, mourners dropped dozens of bouquets of flowers 
outside the library's glass front doors. Several candles were also lit in the 
former President's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 At another end of the library grounds, workmen hammered nails into a long 
platform that will hold the casket during Wednesday's funeral. Two huge sets of 
portable bleachers, each with enough room to seat 600 guests, have been erected 
just outside Nixon's boyhood home, where the ceremony is to be held. And 
workers have draped canvas along the back border of the grounds to block the 
view from the adjacent bike path and equestrian trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horse trails are even closed, and in our city that's a big deal," said 
Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley. 
</P>
<P>
 While City Hall will remain open, municipal officials are planning to close 
much of their major thoroughfare -- Yorba Linda Boulevard -- for the funeral, 
and many stores will probably close for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll shut down the city, effectively," said Kiley, who has spent much of the 
last two days fielding calls from reporters as far away as China. "Everyone is 
going to be here. It's so monumental, what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials and Secret Service agents with walkie-talkies combed the 
grounds Sunday, conferring about logistics and seating arrangements, security 
and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, many of them students from USC and UCLA, rushed into hastily 
called meetings to hear how they would be needed in the next few days. Those 
helping organize the funeral were ushered in and out of the library all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Herschensohn, a onetime staff assistant to Nixon and former television 
commentator, caused a brief stir when he arrived at the library early Sunday 
afternoon and was spotted by onlookers. Several people asked to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the parking lot was filled with television trucks and satellite 
dishes, as national networks jockeyed to secure the best place for their news 
anchors. Each of the major networks is planning to broadcast live from the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I need to know is, can I get Brokaw on site, or is he going to have to be 
off-site?" one NBC producer asked. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one without special credentials could get inside the library, 
thousands gathered outside for a glimpse of a makeshift memorial that grew 
larger by the hour at the library's main doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouquets and baskets of daisies and roses, sunflowers and daffodils were 
strewn among cards, letters, candles, American flags, balloons and even a 
miniature wooden replica of Nixon's boyhood home. At the center of the memorial 
was a color photo of a smiling Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people dream of making a difference," one note read. "You made a 
difference, Richard and Pat. May you rest in peace together forever. . . . We 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Michael Ward of the 3rd Air Wing at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
left a letter he had written to the Nixon family, telling them that his 
squadron will be flying the "missing-man formation as a special thanks to your 
father" at the base's air show on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Strain of Anaheim, with her husband and 12-year-old daughter, dabbed her 
eyes with a tissue as she stood outside the library. She had written Nixon 
several years ago after touring the library, and he had sent a compassionate 
note back to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good man who loved his country, his wife and children," she said. 
"I come here today bringing a broken heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Church leaders offered similar sentiments at Sunday services, while several 
also spoke emotionally about their personal observations of the man who held a 
unique place in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a good friend of Richard Nixon's," the Rev. Robert H. Schuller told his 
"Hour of Power" congregation at the Crystal Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller recounted his role in helping persuade Nixon to end his self-imposed 
exile at his home in San Clemente and to make his first post-Watergate public 
appearance at the funeral of onetime Democratic rival Humbert Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon served as a focal point for Schuller's sermon on motivation, empowerment 
and achievement. The former President, he said, exemplified all three traits. 
</P>
<P>
 For many parishioners, forgiveness appeared a theme of the day in assessing 
Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon was a good man. He had faults like everyone else, but he was a good 
man," said Crystal Cathedral parishioner Betty Dorman, 67, of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Yorba Linda Friends Church, where Nixon's parents once worshiped, 
87-year-old Frank Marshburn recalled that his own father was the doctor who 
helped deliver Nixon. He never knew Nixon well, Marshburn said, but "all I know 
now is what I read, and I think he was a good President."

IRVINE CONSULTANT A GUIDE IN VIETNAM BUSINESS MAZE; COMMERCE: SINCE COUNTRY 
OPENED ITS MARKETS, GEORGE DANG HAS FOUND HIS VALUE TO ENTREPRENEURS HAS 
SOARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the sweltering heat and surging crowds of this weekend's Vietnamerica Expo 
'94, David Tran searched almost in vain to buy American-made construction 
products for his building materials distribution company in Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, whose supplies now come from other Asian countries and Europe, 
complained that there were only a few U.S. manufacturers of builders' materials 
at the exhibition, the first to exclusively showcase U.S. companies in Vietnam 
since Communists took control of the nation in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go to California soon," he said to George Dang, an Irvine business 
consultant attending the expo, "and you have to take me to those companies. 
American products last longer and I must have them to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Dang, president of Alca International Co., smiled. "The first place I'll take 
you is a Home Depot," he said. "There you'll see many products and brand names 
in one place, and decide which you like the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Dang is one of hundreds of Vietnamese American business consultants whose 
value to aspiring entrepreneurs in Vietnam and throughout the world soared 
several years ago when Vietnam began to open its markets to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Go-betweens like Dang represent international clients who cannot speak 
Vietnamese and are unfamiliar with Vietnamese business practices, but are eager 
to enter the lucrative and expanding market in Vietnam, worth an estimated $9 
billion in trade and investment opportunities for international companies, 
according to the United States-Vietnam Trade Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, Dang is linking up with Vietnamese businessmen like Tran who 
are not well-versed in the English language or the ways of international 
business, and are seeking help dealing with foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I could be this valuable to Vietnamese entrepreneurs and 
businessmen outside Vietnam so soon but I'm glad I'm needed," he said. "Doing 
business in Vietnam right now is a bewildering maze, and I can be a guide." 
</P>
<P>
 Dang already has connected Tran with one U.S. company since President Clinton 
lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam in February. Tran is now the exclusive 
Vietnam distributor for engine oil and other lubricant products of New 
York-based Superlube Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang last year introduced Tran to Tay Chok Chuan, whose Singapore-based 
company specializes in waterproofing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chuan and Tran signed a joint venture contract that calls for Tran 
to provide the supplies for Chuan to waterproof buildings being built in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was to get these two to marry each other," Dang said over dinner with 
his clients in Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are waiting for our children to come up," Chuan said, laughing. Their 
"children" include a 12-story office building in Hanoi and a shopping center in 
Ho Chi Minh City. Both are scheduled to be finished by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang, 38, who fled Saigon for the United States by boat with his parents and 
eight siblings as the South Vietnamese capital fell in 1975, has remained 
fluent in his native language. He also has continued to follow its customs, 
which keeps him familiar with protocol in dealing with Vietnamese government 
officials and business professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Married with four children ranging in age from 6 to 10, Dang graduated from 
Coastline Community College in 1979 after majoring in international business. 
He worked in the fields of computer programming and real estate before founding 
Alca in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted my own international business company because I enjoy traveling and 
meeting people of different ethnic backgrounds," he said. Dang, who earns about 
$70,000 annually, now has about 40 clients worldwide. Most are involved in 
construction and were acquired through referrals or trade organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 As international trade becomes more common in Vietnam, Dang sees his role as 
only getting larger. "There will always be cultural gaps between different 
countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For non-Vietnamese entrepreneurs like Chuan, consultants like Dang can help 
overcome hurdles that may exist in a once-isolated nation trying to catch up 
with the industrial world. They face indecisive government officials, 
ever-changing business laws and laborers who aren't accustomed to competitive 
work ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Vietnamese workers work 10 minutes and take a break to smoke for 10 
minutes," Chuan said. "Dang explained to me that's the mentality of a people 
having been trapped in a time warp." 
</P>
<P>
 Dang said laborers in Vietnam are learning quickly from foreign employers that 
they must be efficient to keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workers know this is a good opportunity for a better life," Dang said. 
"How can they improve if they don't get the chance? So they're changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dang said life in Vietnam has rapidly changed for the better since 1990, when 
he first returned to his birthplace to scout business opportunities. Dang said 
he now travels from Irvine to Vietnam at least twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more fashionable clothing stores here now because people are more 
affluent now," Dang said. "But you have to remember there are still plenty of 
poor people who need help. They need jobs. I feel good when I know I'm helping 
to bring jobs here."

RIGHTIST GETS LANDSLIDE WIN IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right-wing politician Armando Calderon Sol won a landslide victory Sunday over 
a leftist coalition of former guerrillas to take the presidency and conclude El 
Salvador's first postwar elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting meant as a test of the country's troubled efforts to rebuild after 
12 years of civil war, Calderon Sol of the ruling Nationalist Republican 
Alliance, or Arena, was defeating leftist legislator Ruben Zamora by a 2-1 
margin. The election was a runoff required when Calderon Sol fell just shy of 
an absolute majority in voting on March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena militants burst into celebration late Sunday, driving their cars through 
the streets of the capital, waving red, white and blue banners and singing 
their anthem, which pledges to make El Salvador "the tomb where the reds will 
end up." 
</P>
<P>
 The elections pitted bitter enemies from the civil war against each other and 
exposed the lingering hatreds that continue to polarize this country two years 
after U.N.-brokered accords brought a fragile peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our great challenge now is to consolidate the peace and to ensure the 
stability and governability of the country," Calderon Sol said in claiming 
victory at a nighttime news conference held in San Salvador's El Presidente 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes earlier, Zamora, flanked by the former commanders of the guerrilla 
front, conceded defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have widely confirmed that we are the alternative force indispensable to 
making this country truly governable," Zamora said. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 80% of the vote counted, Calderon Sol had 68%, with Zamora 
trailing at 32%, the official Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1980s, the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front, or FMLN, fought a series of U.S.-backed governments until exhaustion and 
the end of the Cold War forced the two sides to agree to peace and an array of 
judicial and political reforms, many of which are still incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections marked the FMLN's first foray into civilian politics, after 
years of ridiculing and boycotting voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this election, a new chapter is being opened in the history of El 
Salvador, a history marked by injustice, marginalization and much blood, a 
history that must be changed," Msgr. Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary archbishop 
of San Salvador, said in his weekly homily. 
</P>
<P>
 The March election was plagued by allegations of fraud and serious 
irregularities that prevented more than 100,000 people from voting, according 
to a newly revised estimate by U.N. election monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials made the runoff somewhat easier by establishing a larger number of 
voting stations. Still, basic flaws -- such as names omitted from registries -- 
remained and have led to calls for a complete overhaul of an electoral system 
that seems weighted against the uneducated and in favor of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 The FMLN complained that the irregularities cheated it out of several 
municipal and legislative posts; Arena won control of the National Assembly and 
most of the country's mayoral offices. The lingering anger raises questions 
about future stability because some on the left say that if Calderon Sol does 
not work with them, they will respond with strikes and unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have a constant and permanent dialogue with all sectors and with the 
FMLN, now more than ever since they . . . have won political space," Calderon 
Sol said after his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, tension between the two sides was evident moments before Calderon Sol 
cast his vote. As Arena militants chanted their traditional slogan, 
"Fatherland, yes! Communism, no!" FMLN supporters responded by shouting the 
name of Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero, whose 1980 assassination was 
ordered by the late founder of Arena, Roberto D'Aubuisson, according to a U.N. 
report on war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol is said to represent a more hard-line faction of Arena than the 
man he will replace, President Alfredo Cristiani, who is barred from running 
for reelection. Arena sources said Calderon Sol will probably turn away from 
the technocrats Cristiani favored and instead choose a number of party 
militants to join the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will have a lot of political debts to pay off," a European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol has pledged to continue Cristiani's free-market economic 
policies, placing emphasis on the lucrative privatization of public utilities, 
while paying closer attention to long-neglected social areas such as health and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena's multimillion-dollar campaign was sophisticated and offered stability. 
Calderon Sol and his associates, ignoring their own violent history, portrayed 
the left as Communist terrorists who were exclusively responsible for the war's 
death and destruction and who are incapable of governing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora and the left also have to share the blame for their electoral defeat. 
Divided and disorganized, they overestimated their support in some areas and 
failed to calculate the level of resentment against them in other areas.

 A massive car bomb exploded Sunday near African National Congress offices in 
downtown Johannesburg, leaving at least nine people dead and about 100 injured 
two days before this tense nation goes to the polls in its first free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion, the worst terrorist attack of the campaign, echoed across the 
country's commercial hub about 9:50 on a bright and sunny morning. Within 
moments, charred and dismembered bodies lay on the debris-strewn pavement, and 
survivors' screams filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful blast, which left an eight-foot-wide crater, flipped a burning 
car on its roof and mangled four others. More than a dozen stores and shops 
were gutted, and windows were shattered for several blocks. Smoke billowed from 
burning buildings, and water poured from burst mains. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said up to 200 pounds of explosives had been packed in or under a beige 
Audi that was parked on a corner. "Without any doubt, this is the biggest bomb 
that ever went off in Johannesburg," said Col. Steve Senekal, the police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was the end of the world," said a still-shaking Stephen Murugan, 
48, manager of a bar in the 90-room Diplomat Hotel, across the intersection 
from the blast. Every window in the 10-story building was broken. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll of dead and injured rose throughout the day as firefighters, police 
officers and civil defense teams searched nearby offices and apartments. 
Because it was Sunday, the streets had been relatively quiet and most of the 
shops were shuttered. Police said no warning was given. 
</P>
<P>
 No one claimed responsibility, but speculation immediately focused on 
far-right-wing whites, the only significant political force that remains 
outside the democratic process. Heavily armed white-supremacist groups have 
repeatedly vowed to wreck the first elections in which the nation's black 
majority will vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were unable to confirm witnesses' reports that at least one 
white man was seen running from the Audi shortly before the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 White hate groups have been blamed for more than 50 bomb blasts of power 
pylons and campaign offices in and around rural farming towns since December. 
No one has been killed, but frustrated right-wing leaders warned last week that 
they would intensify their attacks to win a self-ruled, all-white homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Wim Booysie, an expert on the right-wing whites, said that only a few of the 
country's 200 or so extremist groups are capable of assembling a sophisticated 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first semblance of IRA-type guys at work," he said, referring to 
Irish Republican Army bombings in England and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was clearly aimed at civilians," he added. "But they wanted to send a 
message. If they could do it on a slow Sunday morning, obviously they can do it 
tomorrow," when the downtown streets are packed with shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jakkie Cilliers, head of the independent Institute for Defense Policy, said 
police are likely to clamp down on suspected right-wing terror groups. "We can 
expect more sabotage and bombings, but I think they will be too late to make a 
difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Political and religious leaders sought to reassure the public that the 
elections will proceed as planned to end white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting will begin Tuesday in hospitals, prisons, homes for the elderly and 
other places where special polls are required. The vast majority of the 22.7 
million eligible voters, including up to 18 million first-time black voters, 
will cast ballots Wednesday and Thursday for a new National Assembly and nine 
regional legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC leader Nelson Mandela, who is expected to be the nation's first black 
president, appealed for calm Sunday in his last rally of the campaign. 
Ironically, Mandela once headed an ANC guerrilla army that used car bombs and 
other terrorist tactics in its battle against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those killed in Sunday's blast was Susan Keane, an ANC official who was 
a candidate for the provincial assembly in the Johannesburg-Pretoria region. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb exploded at the corner of Bree and Von Wielligh streets, about 
halfway between the national and regional offices of the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 But police said the ANC wasn't necessarily the target because the blast was 
also near a police barracks, a military recruiting station and headquarters of 
the radical black Pan-Africanist Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC officials said the bomb was intended to frighten voters, and the 
international community, about the future of democracy here. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo Sexwale, who is the ANC's candidate for provincial premier, warned the 
bombers that they are "fighting against too many people." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have launched a war against a whole nation," he said at a news conference 
in the ANC regional office, a block from the site of the blast. Windows were 
shattered on almost every floor. Several windows were also broken at Shell 
House, the ANC national headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the White House issued a statement condemning the attack as a 
"cowardly effort at intimidation" but expressing confidence that it "cannot and 
will not deter the overwhelming majority of South Africans who will vote in the 
country's first non-racial election." 
</P>
<P>
 At the bomb site Sunday, bystanders and survivors, including one shirtless man 
wearing bloody pants and bandages around his head, mingled behind lengthy 
police barricades of razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic light hung askew, and a reinforced concrete balcony had a hole 
punched through it. Smashed bananas, apples and grapes were strewn from street 
stalls, and a woman picked among them to salvage what she could. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores selling radios, furniture, cosmetics and other goods were in ruins. So 
was the Loving Escort Agency and a casino. A pair of shoes lay near a pool of 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's madness," said Raman Mancha, 57, owner of the heavily damaged Plintor 
Food Market.

NEWS ANALYSIS; NIXON'S FALL OPENED 'GATE' ON SCANDAL AND SCRUTINY; POLITICS: 
WATERGATE AFFAIR HAS ECHOED FOR 20 YEARS. ITS WHISPER IS HEARD IN THE 
QUESTIONING OF MRS. CLINTON. 
</P>

<P>
 With his passion for history, Richard Nixon undoubtedly would have appreciated 
the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of the former President's life, Hillary Rodham Clinton sat in 
the State Dining Room at the White House, fielding the most intimate and 
pointed questions any First Lady had ever faced from reporters. Twenty years 
ago, she had come to Washington as a young law school graduate to work on the 
House Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against Nixon. Now she was 
dodging rocks from the landslide that those proceedings, and the Watergate 
scandal that precipitated them, had set off in U.S. politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Many events in Nixon's rise affected the climate of contemporary politics -- 
from his trumpeting of the Silent Majority, the distant predecessor of 
Clinton's forgotten middle class, to his elevation of crime, civil rights and 
other "wedge" issues that split the New Deal Democratic coalition along racial 
and class lines. But nothing Nixon did influenced American politics more than 
the manner of his fall. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as any other single event, Watergate has shaped the rules and rhythms 
of modern political life. The scandal that destroyed Nixon's presidency stands 
as a transitional event -- from an insular, clubby and even secretive political 
process to a system that is more open and decentralized but chaotic, cynical 
and vitriolic. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate changed the way the public and the press view politicians; it 
influenced the way candidates raise money, the way Congress conducts its 
business and the level of disclosure about private lives that is demanded of 
public figures, such as Hillary Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most directly, it institutionalized the use of scandal as a weapon in 
the ongoing ideological and partisan wars over policy. After Nixon's fall, the 
pursuit and promotion of scandal has become a routine tool that political 
parties use to weaken their opponents and derail their policy agenda. From 
Jimmy Carter's Peanutgate (the probe of whether peanut warehouse funds were 
diverted to campaign coffers) to Whitewater, every President since Nixon has 
been confronted with at least one major scandal that threatened to erode his 
political support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in a sense the founding of this new form of politics," said Cornell 
University professor of government Martin Shefter, co-author of "Politics by 
Other Means," a book examining the role of scandal in the struggle between the 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these developments is rooted in Watergate alone. In many instances, 
Watergate compounded trends already set in motion by the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Americans, Watergate confirmed Vietnam's lesson about the danger of 
concentrated executive branch power. In the "cover-up," "stonewalling" and 
deception of the scandal, the governmental "credibility gap" that first opened 
around body counts and the Tet offensive hardened into a permanent feature of 
political life. In the same way that victory over the Depression and Hitler's 
Germany symbolized government's potential for an earlier generation, Watergate 
and Vietnam stand as the enduring touchstones for a generation profoundly 
disillusioned with government. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling conducted by the University of Michigan shows that the growth of 
distrust in government began before Watergate. Race riots and the anguish over 
Vietnam triggered a substantial drop from 1964 to 1968 in the percentage of 
Americans who said government could be trusted to do what's right most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watergate accelerated and locked in the trend. Between Nixon's reelection 
in 1972 and his resignation in 1974, the percentage of Americans in the 
Michigan surveys who trusted government most of the time dropped from 48% to 
34%. Since then, trust in government has only rarely peaked above its Watergate 
depths: In the 1992 survey, just 26% said they trusted government to do what's 
right most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as revealing as the poll numbers is the repeated use of "gate" as a way 
of naming political scandals in Watergate's wake. As Michael Schudson observed 
in his recent book, "Watergate in American Memory," the list includes Billygate 
(involving President Jimmy Carter's eccentric brother, Billy), Koreagate 
(involving the Korean CIA's effort to buy influence in Congress), Debategate 
(involving charges that Ronald Reagan Administration officials swiped one of 
Walter F. Mondale's debate books in 1984), Irangate (one of many names applied 
to the Iran-Contra affair) and Whitewatergate today. 
</P>
<P>
 This linguistic reflex bears a subtle but powerful message: By linking almost 
all subsequent scandals to Watergate, it suggests that they "are all a piece of 
the same cloth, a continuing story of dishonesty and corruption that manifests 
itself with slightly different details," Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the word "dome" wasn't routinely appended onto the political 
scandals that followed the Teapot Dome affair, which involved the lease of oil 
fields that had been set aside for Navy reserves in the 1920s. Mellman notes 
that at that point, scandals were seen as individual, not systemic, failures. 
</P>
<P>
 The repeated use of "gate" today captures the reversal of that view. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people now see is a system that is fundamentally corrupt and corrupts 
people independent of their personal integrity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That perception has directly affected the way the press covers government and 
political figures. Investigative reporting and muckraking had a long tradition 
before Watergate; but the press's role in publicizing the scandal and felling 
Nixon engendered "the renewal, reinvigoration and remythologization of 
muckraking," Schudson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate, following Vietnam, deepened the media's conviction that government 
was lying as often as not -- and a reporter's highest calling was to expose 
those lies. At the same time, the widespread argument that Watergate derived 
from character flaws in Nixon himself widened press scrutiny of candidates' 
character -- measured in everything from their personal finances to their sex 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased investigation and debunking that followed Watergate have given 
Americans probably more information than ever before about their leaders and 
their decisions -- though Schudson observes that the press has inflated its 
role in exposing Watergate and subsequent scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the climate of skepticism encouraged by press investigations of 
government deceit and incompetence has had the collateral effect of deepening 
public doubts about Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 That stands as another historical irony: The liberals who worked so hard to 
bring down Nixon through Watergate -- including, in their own small ways, Bill 
and Hillary Clinton -- have struggled ever since to sell an activist government 
agenda in the atmosphere of distrust that the scandal left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more ironic, the solutions liberals advanced for the dangers of Watergate 
have further complicated the process of building a political and legislative 
consensus for new government initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the Watergate-inspired campaign finance reforms of 1974, which imposed 
strict contribution limits on donations to candidates for Congress and the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 That reform fundamentally changed national politics. No longer could a 
candidate amass huge sums from a relatively small number of large donors, the 
way Nixon did in his 1972 reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while the reform reduced the impact of any single donor, it paradoxically 
increased the overall importance of fund raising by forcing candidates to lay 
siege to an ever larger number of contributors to fund the rising costs of 
campaigns. As a result, the number of interest groups each member of Congress 
must avoid crossing has probably expanded -- complicating the process of 
passing complex and controversial legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 With the election of the huge Democratic class of 1974 -- which included Gary 
Hart, Paul E. Tsongas and Timothy E. Wirth -- Congress next democratized its 
internal procedures, overturning the seniority system and expanding the number 
of subcommittees in the name of increasing "openness" in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the campaign-finance reform laws, these initiatives carried the price of 
decentralizing and diluting power. The internal reforms reinforced the 
centrifugal force of the campaign-finance laws by weakening the congressional 
leadership's capacity to reward and punish individual lawmakers who wouldn't 
follow the party line. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony to the effect of these new fund-raising and internal congressional 
rules comes in the excruciatingly slow progress of health care reform on 
Capitol Hill -- despite the unified support of the President and the leaders of 
the Democratic majorities in both houses. The post-Watergate reforms traded 
"more openness for more paralysis," Mellman said. "The pre-1970s Congress would 
have had a much easier time getting health care passed than this Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1974 Watergate election cast a long shadow over the Democratic Party, 
launching the careers of suburban reformers such as Hart and Tsongas who would 
articulate the "neo-liberal" challenge to party orthodoxy in the 1980s and help 
clear the ground for Clinton's nomination and election. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Watergate left a world in which scandal has become a routine aspect 
of Washington life. Watergate created a legitimate constitutional crisis. But 
it also represented as much a means as an end for many critics opposed to 
Nixon's policies in Vietnam and at home, many historians agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its legal merits, Nixon's fall taught the political lesson that 
scandal is perhaps the most effective weapon a President's opponents can 
marshal against him. Over the last 20 years, Democrats have most eagerly 
applied that lesson. Now, in a final irony, they are watching with horror as 
the political weapons forged in Watergate are turned against a Democratic 
President.

SERBS BEGIN A PULLBACK AT GORAZDE; BOSNIA: U.N. TROOPS PATROL THE ENCLAVE AS 
GUNMEN WHO HAD BATTERED THE CITY RETREAT IN THE FACE OF A NATO ULTIMATUM. THE 
REBELS BLOW UP A WATER PLANT ON THEIR WAY OUT.

<P>
 U.N. troops arrived in shattered Gorazde on Sunday to patrol the Muslim 
enclave after Bosnian Serb rebels made a grudging retreat, leaving a trail of 
destruction in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
 As they withdrew their weapons from the so-called "safe haven," the Serbian 
gunmen torched overrun villages and blew up the water plant on which the 
enclave's 65,000 residents depend. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the U.N. Protection Force gave contradictory reports on the 
degree of Serbian compliance with a NATO order that the rebels retreat 1.9 
miles from the center of town and cease the assault that inflicted 3,000 
casualties in little more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.N. aide said Serbian infantrymen were trying to hold at least two 
positions within the exclusion zone and that fighting continued around such key 
facilities as the Pobjeda munitions works. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of the U.N. forces in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, said that 
there were too few U.N. troops in Gorazde to verify full compliance with the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization order. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose also confirmed that the rebels blew up the city water plant Sunday, and 
that some heavy artillery fire continued well after the 2:01 a.m. deadline for 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like U.N. special representative Yasushi Akashi, the civilian chief at mission 
headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, Rose has sought to prevent the peacekeeping 
force from being dragged militarily into the Balkans conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not have to bomb our way to peace," Rose said in resisting NATO calls 
for attacks on Serbian positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of some NATO countries, however, have concluded that evenhandedness 
is getting nowhere with the Serbs, who have conquered 70% of Bosnia in a war 
that has left 200,000 dead or missing and nearly half the population displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fierce Serbian artillery assault on Gorazde was, for many political 
leaders, too savage and calculated to be ignored. Most of the dead and wounded 
were women, children and men too old to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's ultimatum, issued Friday, demanded an immediate cease-fire, the troop 
and artillery pullback and unimpeded access for U.N. and humanitarian 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian forces have violated all the conditions. But Akashi has refused to 
authorize punitive air strikes, instead renegotiating some terms of the 
ultimatum with Serbian rebel leaders and their patrons in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO call for freedom of movement for U.N. and aid workers was redefined 
to be "normal conditions," one aide to Rose disclosed. The Serbs interpret that 
to mean they can demand prior clearances for each vehicle and person passing 
through rebel-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The first medical evacuations from Gorazde were delayed at least two hours 
when Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic ordered the U.N. helicopters 
transporting patients to Sarajevo to stop in the Serb-held town of Sokolac so 
his gunmen could inspect them. 
</P>
<P>
 No patients were detained, but an official with the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees and a pool of foreign journalists were scratched from 
the flight lists at the Serbs' insistence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs also delayed the arrival of a U.N. convoy of food and medical 
supplies -- critical humanitarian aid that the Serbs had denied the city's 
desperate residents for months. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid convoy -- 14 Russian trucks carrying 89 tons of wheat flour, food 
parcels, medicine and other supplies -- arrived in Gorazde late Sunday night 
after being blocked for much of the day at a checkpoint on the border between 
Serbia and Serb-controlled Bosnian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs said they held up the convoy because they did not have authorization 
to let it pass from Bosnian Serb authorities, even though the rebels' 
leadership had pledged to U.N. officials that the trucks would be allowed 
through. Another 10-truck convoy is expected to leave Belgrade for Gorazde 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimatum is dead, completely and absolutely," one disillusioned aid 
official declared as he waited for the wounded to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Those evacuated described Gorazde as relatively calm after day-break Sunday, 
with small-arms and sniper fire continuing but a marked drop in the number of 
mortar and artillery rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose painted a considerably less dire picture of the scene in Gorazde, as 
relayed to him by U.N. officers inspecting cease-fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citizens of Gorazde are out walking in the streets for the first time in 
three weeks," Rose told reporters. "It's obviously an enormous relief for them 
that (U.N. troops) have arrived, giving them some assurance that the NATO 
ultimatum is being complied with." 
</P>
<P>
 The British general indicated that aerial reconnaissance photos show the Serbs 
packing up and moving out toward the 12-mile perimeter of the weapons exclusion 
zone proclaimed around Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO gave the Serbs until early Wednesday to pull out all heavy weapons from 
that zone or risk provoking air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said the movement of heavy weaponry would be closely monitored and 
additional steps taken as necessary to prevent new attacks on Gorazde, which 
was targeted after NATO threats forced the Serbs to move their artillery away 
from Sarajevo in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't say we trust them at all after what has happened," Rose said of the 
Serbs, speaking to reporters outside his sandbagged residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose described the Gorazde offensive as "a disastrous strategic error" that 
inflicted a humanitarian crisis for little tactical gain, and said he hoped the 
rebels had decided to "abandon this warmongering policy and head down the path 
of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government supporters, however, worry that NATO's failure to use force 
against the Serbs besieging Gorazde will simply encourage the rebels to press 
their campaign for territory in some area of Bosnia-Herzegovina where the 
United Nations is less vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also concern that the U.N. troops deployed to Gorazde would in 
effect provide a human shield for the Serbs, further deterring air strikes.

CAN REQUIRED PORCHES PROD PEOPLE INTO NEIGHBORLINESS?; CITIES: SAN LUIS OBISPO 
CONSIDERS AN UNUSUAL STEP IN THE NAME OF 'SOCIAL ECOLOGY.' MANY WON'T TAKE IT 
SITTING DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There are streets here where the porches are deep, the shade is cool and the 
spring flowers billow thick as clouds, where old men doze over the Sunday paper 
and children build castles out of sheets and sagging wicker lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the suburbs of the last 10 years, largely populated by 
fleeing Angelenos, where certain houses have "a double garage door and a blank 
wall (as) the only presentation to the street," says Glen Matteson, associate 
city planner. "They have a very different feel from the city's traditional 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so a lot has happened between the late 1800s, when much of Old Town was 
built, and the last decade or so -- things like drive-by shootings, air 
conditioners, television sets and auto exhaust, factors that, when taken 
together, can make a person go inside on a summer night instead of watching the 
dusk and chatting with the neighbors. Who are the neighbors, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 But although porches throughout the country have largely shriveled up like 
unnecessary body parts beset by evolution, they could make a comeback here. A 
City Council committee has perplexed this Central Coast town by recommending 
that nearly every new house built in San Luis Obispo have a front porch. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale: "Such design features are effective ways to build neighborhoods 
and to improve the social ecology of the city," says the stuffily titled 
General Plan Land Use Element, Environmental Quality Task Force Draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is social ecology, and what's wrong with San Luis Obispo's? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Schmidt -- architect, task force member and porch proponent -- rues 
the day the term was ever committed to print. "I've taken so much flak for 
that," he said. To some in town, the idea smacks of social engineering, the 
forcing of utopian views on a small city in a struggling state. But to Schmidt, 
social ecology is simply "the feeling that it's not good for a community to 
wall people off from one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents of this working-class version of Santa Barbara -- located about 
200 miles, three hours and half a tank of gas from Los Angeles and San 
Francisco -- contend that there's nothing much wrong with the social ecology as 
it stands. 
</P>
<P>
 People live in this town of about 43,000 largely because they want to, and 
interact regularly because they can. Families stroll the streets at night, car 
doors are generally left unlocked, Cal Poly students congregate on steps for a 
sunset six-pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt and his committee want it to stay that way; porches are their 
hoped-for guarantee that this slow-growth haven -- among the most strident such 
cities in California -- does not go the way of Irvine or Northridge, Las Vegas 
or Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Front porches, entries that are planned to make it easy for people to run 
into each other, may be clumsy mechanisms," he says. "We thought they were 
worthwhile things to try." 
</P>
<P>
 But the very idea of compulsory porches brings sniggers to some City Hall 
offices and makes home builder Stanley Bell splutter about "radicals" 
"influencing, no, warping" the planning process. "It's a zealot's approach to 
growth control," he insists, yet another development hurdle in an already 
over-regulated city. 
</P>
<P>
 Other opponents view the porch proposal -- three scant lines in a ponderous 
95-page document -- as a mere tangent to the important work at hand: figuring 
out if and how San Luis Obispo will grow. And on top of that, where's the 
practicality?

 "When . . . you're dictating homes have front porches that in theory all of us 
must sit on every evening and chat with each other," says Charlie Fruit, vice 
president of Commerce Bank, "you're starting to manipulate people's behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Matteson and Schmidt give the proposal a 50-50 chance, but noted architecture 
critic Witold Rybczynski, author of an essay on porches titled "As American as 
Blue Jeans and Sweat Shirts," doesn't hold out much hope for the porches of San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 He does, however, understand what some people pine for since the passing of 
porch society sometime after World War II: "If you drive around the suburbs, 
for instance, you'll see very often people sitting in their garages," says 
Rybczynski, a professor of urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania. "It's 
very sad. It shows you they want to sit out and look at the street, but that's 
the only place where they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Porches are a peculiarly American invention, Rybczynski argues, created to 
tame the wilderness of a continent-sized frontier, to mediate between peril 
outside and safety within. The most famous, he says, was George Washington's, a 
structure tacked onto Mt. Vernon in 1772. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would argue differently: What about the porch where Atticus Finch 
explained injustice to daughter Scout in "To Kill a Mockingbird," or the one 
where Andy Griffith gazed, forever perplexed, at Deputy Barney Fife? What about 
Tara? 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no official stoop statistics, it is estimated that about 
half of all homes in San Luis Obispo have some sort of porch, from voluptuous 
verandas clad in fish-scale shingles to wrought iron afterthoughts barely big 
enough for a good-night kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 There are stately porches lined in flower pots, where the rattan armchairs 
match and dried-flower wreaths adorn heavy front doors. Their shabby neighbors 
often sport flaking paint, fleets of Big Wheels and full dinette sets and look 
out upon pickups parked on the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the scene on Buchon Street -- a mile or so strip of the city's 
grandest galleries, located near the center of Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best porch," says 19-year-old Donovan, a film student at Cal 
Poly. "I love my porch. I can kick back and smoke cigarettes out here. You can 
watch cars and people go by." 
</P>
<P>
 Goateed Donovan, with his hand-rolled smokes and Bad Religion T-shirt, tends 
to lounge for at least an hour a day on the faded pink easy chairs formerly of 
his grandmother's living room. San Luis Obispo's social ecology does not weigh 
heavily on his mind: "I don't think there's anything wrong with this place," he 
says. "Try going to Oakland." 
</P>
<P>
 Six blocks south, teacher Marti Warde is a touch more analytical, as she 
shivers in the evening chill and tends her snapdragons. "My porch was my 
introduction to the neighbors," she says. "I enjoy them all. . . . What makes 
me stay in this neighborhood is the friends I've made." The 600 block of Buchon 
is so special, she insists, that it has its own social ecology, one "I haven't 
seen anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristi Logan -- owner of the Cossett House, circa 1914 -- begs to differ. She 
used to live in the smallest house in the 800 block of Buchon, a tiny white 
number with slate-blue trim, visible from the Cossett House's dignified porch 
with its iron bench and adobe pot of impatiens. Her block is so special that 
"if we had to move, we wanted to stay here." And so she did. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan and daughter Kylie, 22 months, spend at least half an hour a day on the 
porch watching passersby and enjoying the fickle Central Coast climate: a 
little fog, a little wind, a lot of sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are realizing this is a very nice place to raise kids," she says. 
"They'll take a cut in pay in exchange for the lifestyle. There's not a lot of 
jobs, there's not a lot of opportunities for making your millions." 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, a lot of porches. And there may be many more, once the 
City Council votes on a new land use element for the general plan. Hearings on 
the latest recommendations are scheduled to begin Tuesday, complete with porch 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a good idea," says Steve Parker, 22, as he paints a table in the 
Buchon Street dusk. On his porch, of course. "I have this idea that houses with 
porches, they make everyone focus on their neighbors. Here it's like the old 
times. Down south, everyone's in their back yards. . . . They're scared of 
everyone else."

REGIME HUNG BY THREAD, YELTSIN SAYS OF REVOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin, in a detailed new account Sunday of the violent 
uprising against him last October, says he met with paralysis and face-to-face 
insubordination among army officers and elite combat troops before they finally 
moved to recapture the Russian White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lawful government hung by a thread, but the army did not feel able to 
defend it -- some soldiers . . . didn't feel like fighting," Yeltsin writes in 
his memoirs, excerpts of which appeared in Newsweek and the Sunday Times of 
London. The 63-year-old president describes the showdown with his foes in 
Parliament as "the bleakest days of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's version makes it clear that army resistance to his orders went much 
further than officially acknowledged at the time. It also portrays a leader 
tactically and psychologically unprepared for the violent showdown that he in 
fact provoked by illegally dissolving Parliament two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The memoirs -- to be published next week under different titles in the United 
States, Britain and Russia -- is certain to revive bitter debate here over who 
caused the 147 deaths in two days of fighting that ended Oct. 4 with a hesitant 
tank assault on the rebel-held Parliament building. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with rebel leaders out of jail under an amnesty and engaged again in 
anti-government activism, the book raises the question of whether Yeltsin can 
count on the army to save him again. Among those depicted as weak and wavering 
figures is Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, who is still army commander and defense 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin admits being seized by self-doubt during the October violence and by 
depression afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my life I was tortured by the thought -- had I done the 
right thing? Was there another option? Russia was drowning in lawlessness. And 
here I was, the first popularly elected president, breaking the law -- albeit a 
bad law, a cumbersome law that was pushing the country to the brink of 
collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described insomniac, Yeltsin said he often awoke at 2 or 3 a.m. to work 
on the memoirs, which are being published by Times Book/Random House and Belka 
Publishing Co. under the title "The Struggle for Russia." A British edition, 
"The View From the Kremlin," will be published by Harper Collins. The Russian 
edition is titled "Notes of the President." 
</P>
<P>
 The book takes up where "Against the Grain," Yeltsin's first autobiography, 
left off, with his comeback from disgrace as a maverick Communist to get 
elected to Parliament in 1990. It covers his election as president of Russia a 
year later and offers new details of how he escaped arrest to lead resistance 
to the failed August, 1991, coup by hard-line Soviet Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the excerpted versions, Yeltsin offers no hint about whether he is 
terminally ill, as it is often rumored here. 
</P>
<P>
 But he predicts "more cataclysms . . . new fighters, fanatics and leaders, 
with or without epaulets" as Russia withdraws from its totalitarian past. He 
says neo-fascist leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's strong showing in 
parliamentary elections last December shows Russia is ripe for "a mad leader." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of rising nationalist sentiment in Russia, Yeltsin exudes admiration 
for former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the U.S. political 
system, especially the way George Bush and Bill Clinton cooperated after the 
1992 campaign. "In our country, they would have remained mortal enemies," he 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin discloses that he decided to dissolve Russia's unruly, reactionary 
Parliament after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, visiting Russia in July, made 
it clear that Western leaders would tolerate such an unconstitutional act. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Yeltsin admits, "we were not ready to fight. There was no battle 
plan." He hoped that isolating the White House and ignoring the rebels would 
force them to surrender, but "we were tragically mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 After armed rebels attacked the mayor's office and the state television 
studios Oct. 3, Yeltsin got Grachev's promise to bring army troops into Moscow, 
and he was incensed to learn later that they had stopped outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to bring my combat generals out of their state of stress and 
paralysis" that night, he writes. "Not even one regiment could be found to come 
to Moscow and defend the city. It was a dismal picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin offers striking new details of his decisive post-midnight meeting at 
the Defense Ministry. The generals were grim and devoid of ideas, he writes, 
until an obscure, timid captain from the presidential security team was called 
in to outline a plan to assault the White House with 10 tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "With an actual battle plan before them, the generals came alive," Yeltsin 
recalls. It was 3 a.m. Division commanders said the tanks could be in place by 
dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Grachev intervened, asking Yeltsin if he was giving specific orders to 
use tanks in Moscow. Rebuked by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin for his 
doubts, Grachev "mumbled in a hurt voice," Yeltsin writes. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 a.m., Yeltsin says, he encountered new resistance, this time from the 
elite Alpha and Vympel units that were assigned key roles in the assault. 
Yeltsin describes the scene: 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty of them were waiting for me; they all rose to greet me. . . . I looked 
at them one by one; almost all of them lowered their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I barked: 'Are you prepared to fulfill the president's orders?' There was 
only silence -- a terrible, inexplicable silence. Nobody uttered a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited for a minute; still nobody uttered a word. I finally growled: 'Then 
I'll put it another way: Are you refusing to obey the president's order?' 
Again, silence. I turned on my heel and strode toward the door, calling out 
that the order must be obeyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin says both units still refused to take part and "dug their heels in" 
500 yards from the White House. Only when a sniper killed one of their officers 
did Alpha swing into action. "That single shot was the turning point," the 
president writes.

COLUMN ONE; BUYING TIME FOR CANDIDATES; AS THE CAMPAIGNS HEAT UP, SO DO THE 
AIRWAVES. THAT'S WHEN STRATEGISTS PLOT TO GAIN THE BEST EXPOSURE FOR THEIR 
CLIENTS. THE KEY CAN BE FIGURING OUT WHETHER 'JEOPARDY!' OR 'OPRAH' HAS MORE 
VOTER CLOUT. 
</P>

<P>
 Sheri Sadler Wolf spends her days wrestling with tough political questions. 
Questions like: Do people who watch "Married . . . With Children" vote? The 
other day, Wolf -- the media director at Target Enterprises, a Hollywood firm 
that buys advertising for political campaigns -- let a salesman try to convince 
her that they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an untapped resource in the 18-to-49 (year-olds)," the TV ad 
salesman said, referring to the age group that tends to watch the sometimes 
crude Fox comedy. Hopeful that Wolf would buy time on his station, he continued 
in vain: "18-to-49s are generally undecided voters. They are the kind of guys 
you should be going after with 'Married . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolf knew better. She knew that her primary targets -- likely voters -- 
tend to be 35 and older. "For the dollars I can spend right now, do I have the 
flexibility to go anywhere except after my 35-plussers?" she asked, shaking her 
head. "Talk to me about 'Cops' and 'America's Most Wanted.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next six weeks, until the June 7 primary, TV viewers will be 
bombarded by an increasing number of campaign messages. Although these ads may 
seem a cacophonous jumble, in fact each one is strategically placed to reach a 
specific group of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why media buyers such as Wolf, who usually toil in obscurity, are 
crucial to a candidate's success. And that is why the closer the election, the 
more our democratic process may be reduced to closed-door debates about 
whether, dollar for dollar, "60 Minutes" or "Jeopardy!" is a better political 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
 John Riedl, general sales manager at KABC-TV Channel 7 in Los Angeles, says 
that depending on their budgets, campaigns consider two distinct strategies: 
"Buy 'Home Improvement,' 'Roseanne,' 'Murphy Brown,' 'Seinfeld.' Big ratings, 
one shot, pay a lot of money. (Or) get out of prime time and go into other 
(times of the day) that don't give you as big a rating and don't cost as much. 
'Oprah.' 'Eyewitness News.' 'Wheel of Fortune.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The latter approach -- commonly called "buying tonnage" -- can definitely 
work, said Jim Margolis, former media adviser to state Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown's gubernatorial campaign. After all, he said, "People watching 'Wheel' 
and 'Jeopardy!' aren't just bubbas out there. They're everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in the media buying game couldn't be much higher. In a state as 
large as California, broadcast advertisements -- both on television and radio 
-- are as close as most voters will get to their candidates. Campaigns pay 
dearly to connect with the electorate: sometimes more than $1,000 for every 
second of air time. To advertise when voters aren't watching is to risk defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollars that you spend on television are astounding. If you're wasting 
your money, you're just giving away votes," said Margolis, whose Washington 
firm resigned from Brown's campaign in March. "So do I want to go and buy a 
show like 'Love Connection'? . . . These are some of the most critical 
decisions that (a campaign) makes." 
</P>
<P>
 Making a smart media buy is not as simple as looking at the latest Nielsen 
ratings. For example, one might expect "Saturday Night Live" to skew to a 
younger, non-voting audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wrong," said Robert Nelson, an Orange County political consultant who 
specializes in media strategy. "It's all these old guys like me who still think 
they're 22 years old. Highly educated target voters -- a damn good deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Simpsons," by contrast, is a very popular show, but pity the candidate 
who advertises there, many experts say. The reason: A significant chunk of 
viewers are children 2 to 11 -- future voters, maybe, but not the people a 
campaign needs to reach in this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Media consultants base their decisions on focus groups and demographic 
research, ratings studies and pricing data. For helping to reach the right 
voters, they earn commissions that can run as high as 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 In California that can be a lot of money. The candidates for governor already 
have spent more than $3 million buying ad time. Rep. Michael Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara) alone has spent more than $2 million to air his reasons for 
wanting to unseat U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Between now and the general 
election in November, statewide candidates will spend tens of millions of 
dollars to go on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not necessarily a partisan profession. Many media buyers learned their 
craft not in the political trenches but buying spots for more conventional 
products, from soft drinks to soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's new campaign manager, Clint Reilly, has hired a former Coca-Cola ad 
buyer to execute the Democratic front-runner's media strategy. And some buyers 
admit that, although it's nice when their own political leanings match those of 
a client, ideological agreement is not essential to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like other political consultants, media experts quickly become 
identified with one party or the other. David Bienstock, who owns Target 
Enterprises, only works for Republican candidates. Among his clients this year: 
Gov. Pete Wilson, Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and George W. Bush, who is seeking the 
Texas governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't assume I'm just a hired gun who makes his commission win or lose," 
Bienstock says. "I want to win." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the work can seem tedious, especially when compared to creating a 
commercial. While ad producers yell "Action!", media strategists debate the 
subtle advantages of airing an ad "inside" a program instead of at the end. 
They ponder "pod-positioning" (where, within a block of ads, a spot appears) 
and "heavy click time" (the moments when most viewers reach for their remote 
controls). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not sexy -- you've got to sit around in rooms (staring at) computer 
printouts," said Nelson, the Orange County consultant who has advised several 
California initiative campaigns. "But the biggest opportunity to make a 
difference in the campaign is there, because that's where you spend all the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Kay of Advanced Media Service Inc. says the most fundamental premise 
for media strategists is: "Use a rifle instead of a shotgun." 
</P>
<P>
 Long before an ad is aired, a campaign must decide precisely which voters it 
needs to reach. Just as it is worthless to reach people who don't vote, many 
experts believe it is folly to try to change people's minds. The better the 
advertising is targeted, the more successfully it zeros in on voters who are 
likely to be receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, the Target Enterprises media director, offers an obvious example from 
the Wilson account. Although declining to discuss Wilson's overall media 
strategy, she says there is one block of programming she won't even consider 
buying: a political talk show on Sacramento's KCRA-TV that is hosted by 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (a Democrat who has often butted heads with the 
Republican governor). 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, the Orange County consultant, offers another example. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are a hostile bombastic older male (candidate), you probably shouldn't 
spend a lot of your time buying 'Murphy Brown' TV commercials," he said. 
"You'll be paying to advertise to a group of people who whenever they see you 
will remember how much they dislike you." 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is everything, says Jean Brooks, senior vice president at Western 
International Media, which is buying ad time for Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi's gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do any good to reach someone in January, 1994, if they don't care 
about who they're going to be voting for," Brooks said. "If you reach someone 
five times in January and one time the day before Election Day, that one time 
is probably money better spent." 
</P>
<P>
 The best timetable, of course, is to start early and repeat often. But most 
campaigns cannot afford such extravagance, even with the most aggressive fund 
raising. Margolis recalls that when he worked for Brown, he would attend 
fund-raisers to let donors know just how expensive ads can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say, 'One 30-second ad, just in L.A., one time, can cost more than 
$30,000,' " he said, recalling how he would hold up a schedule to show how 
often Brown needed to be on the air. "I'd say, 'I need people here to buy one 
"Good Morning America" spot. You can buy it on June 1. It will be your spot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Budget-conscious candidates try to "pulse" their media on and off throughout 
the campaign, while keeping a reserve of cash to finance a big push at the end. 
Then they must decide where, exactly, to make that final assault -- on 
television, radio or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The two broadcast media work differently, depending where in California they 
are used. In Los Angeles, for example, where commute times tend to be longer, 
many media gurus say radio is a wise choice. Here, a campaign may well reach as 
many women voters on a "light" radio station as on a top-rated TV show like 
"Northern Exposure" -- but for a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most statewide campaigns end up on television, where the visual images 
are believed to "burn in" better, so as to resonate in voters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple math dictates that the cheaper the time period, the more often a 
campaign can afford to repeat an ad. And given the immense competition for a 
voter's attention, the frequency is important. Media experts agree that on 
average, a voter needs to see a spot at least four times before its message 
sinks in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's cable, the ability to channel surf, VCRs -- all that stuff makes it 
harder for us to get through without getting whacked," said Margolis. "Right in 
the middle of the ad, maybe (a voter) just got a ham sandwich, the kid started 
screaming, the phone rang." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal: to rise above the distractions (not the least of which are other ads 
-- for commercial products as well as other candidates) and to achieve 
"top-of-mind awareness." It is no small feat, said Hank Sheinkopf, to do all 
that without alienating the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics is not something that everybody needs. You need a car or something 
to drink. But you don't need what we have to sell," said Sheinkopf, a New 
York-based media consultant who has advised many California campaigns. "We go 
into (voters') living rooms. We're not invited. They invited Mike Wallace and 
the team into their living rooms, not us. That's why repetition is key." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several weeks, buyers will work overtime placing ads, making 
sure what they've bought gets delivered and keeping a close eye on the 
competition. Strategists will haggle with broadcasters over the so-called 
"political protection period" (the 45-day countdown to the primary election 
that began Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
 During this window, federal law requires stations to charge federal candidates 
their lowest rates. (Most stations extend the courtesy to statewide and local 
candidates as well). Moreover, stations must try to provide rival candidates 
with equal access to the rating points they desire. And here's where the 
quibbling begins: when the most popular shows sell out, arguments inevitably 
ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said (to a TV station), 'Look, it is not equivalent to offer us 
'America's Most Wanted' when you sold 'Primetime Live' to (our rival)," 
Margolis said. "One has trailer park residents who aren't ever going to vote 
and the other has high-information voters. Maybe (the station) is giving us the 
same number of bodies, but they're not the same bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 As the candidates scramble, as the strategists bicker, one thing is certain. 
"The closer you get to June, you're going to see seven stations brought to you 
by the political arena," warns Riedl of KABC-TV. "You're going to see so many 
political spots, you're going to say, 'Enough already!' " Buying Time 
</P>
<P>
 Once they decide which voters to target, political media buyers seek to 
acquire two things for their clients: reach and frequency. Reach is how many 
people see a campaign ad. Frequency is how many times they see it. And 
especially in a state as big as California, where television spots are as close 
as many voters get to their candidates, winning requires both. So, what to buy? 
Below, a few tips. 
</P>
<P>
 60 MINUTES 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $32,000 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the best shows for reaching lots of people in one hit. 
Ratings are high among adults, both men and women. Moreover, viewers who tune 
in to magazine shows and other news programs tend to be educated and 
well-informed -- the kind of people who pay attention early, get involved and 
vote. The downside: expense. 
</P>
<P>
 MURPHY BROWN 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $16,000 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers believe that "Murphy Brown," with its liberal-minded heroine, tends to 
attract Democrats and women. If a candidate wants to reach Republican men, they 
say, he or she would get a bigger bang for the buck buying "Monday Night 
Football." 
</P>
<P>
 OPRAH 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $2,400 
</P>
<P>
 Buying daytime programming is shrewd if a candidate wants to court older 
viewers, especially women. Many candidates want to do just that, since older 
people are more likely to vote than younger ones. Some candidates will craft 
ads specifically to air during the day -- perhaps stressing issues that are 
important to seniors citizens. Or they may run 60-second spots, which are 
prohibitively expensive at other times of day. 
</P>
<P>
 JEOPARDY 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $4,000 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled between local news shows and prime time, a program like this is 
considered a great bargain. Sure, its draws only half the rating points of "60 
Minutes" -- but at one-eighth the cost. Media experts believe a viewer must see 
a campaign spot four times before its message "burns in," creating so-called 
"top-of-mind awareness." This show, like "Wheel of Fortune," makes repetition 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SIMPSONS 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $23,000 
</P>
<P>
 Despite great ratings, this show's high price makes it unpopular with 
political ad buyers. Viewers tend to be younger, meaning they are less likely 
to vote. Since the goal is not to persuade people to vote, but to reach those 
who always vote and win them over, programs like this -- or "Beverly Hills 
90210" -- are often seen as a waste of money. But late in the campaign, when 
the airwaves get crowded, ads may well show up here. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Prices are estimates for one 30-second ad, airing one time in the Los 
Angeles market.

DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT LONGTIME GOP STRONGHOLD; POLITICS: WITH REAPPORTIONMENT 
AND NOLAN IN PRISON, GLENDALE-BASED ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEEMS UP FOR GRABS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Democrat in the Glendale-based 43rd District state Assembly seat? Most years 
the idea of a breach in that Republican bastion would seem laughably quixotic, 
if not delusional. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before reapportionment, before Bill Clinton and before veteran 
GOP incumbent Pat Nolan went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Democrats are daring to hope that a 33-year-old former prosecutor, 
endorsed by several law enforcement groups, can wrest the 43rd District out of 
Republican hands with a platform that is tough on crime but moderate on 
hot-button social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also are drawing comfort from the recent disclosure that a 
front-running Republican, Municipal Judge James Rogan, is supported by the 
Allied Business PAC, a group noted for its ultraconservative, Christian 
fundamentalist agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps identify Rogan with fringe views," said one Democratic Party 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation worries some local GOP leaders as their party enters a confusing 
series of elections in the 43rd District this year to pick Nolan's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when Democrats wouldn't even file to run in this district," 
said Glendale City Councilman Larry Zarian, a local Republican leader and Rogan 
backer. "But the old way of winning is over. Now we have to work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 State Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) predicted recently that there is a 
good chance the Democratic Party would target the seat for party funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats are excited about our prospects in that district," said Katz, who 
represents an adjoining district. "I think we have a good shot in November of 
taking this seat." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 3 voters will go to the polls to pick a successor to Nolan, who was 
forced to resign after pleading guilty Feb. 18 to a political racketeering 
charge. He is now serving a 33-month sentence in a federal prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
 If no one gets a majority in that election, the top vote-getters from each 
party will face each other in a June 28 special election. The winner of this 
set of elections will fill out the remainder of Nolan's term, which expires 
Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate, regular election cycle, the candidates will campaign in a June 
7 primary and a Nov. 8 runoff for the two-year Assembly term that begins Dec. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Republican hegemony was taken for granted in the quiet suburban 
cities of Glendale and Burbank, the cornerstones of the 43rd District. But the 
43rd District -- the bailiwick that produced Nolan, Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich and U. S. Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale) -- isn't 
what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1990 reapportionment plan, the district gained the Silver Lake and 
Los Feliz neighborhoods from the city of Los Angeles -- additions that eroded 
the GOP's historic registration advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the greater propensity of Republicans to vote, the district, with a 
registration that is now 43.3% Democratic and 42% GOP (as opposed to 47% 
Republican, 41% Democratic before reapportionment) is still considered 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the GOP's grip on the 43rd District has slipped. In 1992, Clinton carried 
the newly reconstituted 43rd District -- and even took the Glendale portion of 
it, where 2 out of 5 of its voters reside. That same year, Democratic 
senatorial candidates Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein also beat their GOP 
opponents in the district and the entrenched Moorhead won with only 49% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43rd District, as Democratic political strategist Parke Skelton is fond of 
saying, is not Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is now a swing district," Skelton maintains, pointing to the fact that 
the Glendale and Burbank areas are increasingly populated by young renters, 
Latinos and Asians, who are more fertile ground for Democrats than the 
home-owning Anglos of yore. 
</P>
<P>
 If these developments were not disconcerting enough to area Republicans, 
Nolan's surprise guilty plea suddenly left them without their beloved 
standard-bearer and frantically casting about for his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, into this rapidly evolving political situation has stepped 
Democratic candidate Adam Schiff, 33, a Harvard Law School graduate who has 
been walking precincts since December when he quit his job as an assistant U. 
S. attorney to become a full-time candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, and his political handler, Skelton, believe 43rd District voters are 
anxious about crime, embarrassed by Nolan's involvement in the current wave of 
scandals in Sacramento and fed up with the divisive brand of partisanship 
practiced by their former assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are right, then a fresh-faced prosecutor like Schiff, armed with a 
pledge that he will seek bipartisan solutions to the state's problems, may go 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Skelton also sees parallels between this year's 43rd District race -- 
especially if Rogan is the GOP candidate -- and the 1992 Assembly matchup 
between Venice attorney Debra Bowen, now the area's Democratic assemblywoman, 
and Redondo Beach mayor Brad Parton. 
</P>
<P>
 Parton's ties to Christian fundamentalists helped alienate some voters and put 
Bowen over the top, contends Skelton, who ran Bowen's campaign and now sees a 
chance to resurrect some of its themes if Rogan, also backed by 
fundamentalists, is the GOP candidate in the 43rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 But others doubt that there's a Republican crisis brewing in Glendale and 
Burbank. One of these is Steve Frank, former chairman of the California 
Republican Assembly, the state GOP's conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats are whistling past the graveyard on this one," Frank said. 
"This seat is ours to lose, and we will lose it if we go to sleep -- but I 
don't see that happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the GOP candidates are engaged in costly and bruising infighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Republicans in the special election are Rogan, 36, who has the 
support of many Nolan partisans, and Los Angeles Community College District 
Trustee Julia Wu, 56, a Silver Lake resident who beat incumbent Marguerite 
Archie-Hudson in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A third major GOP candidate is Peter Repovich, 36, a Los Angeles Police 
Department community relations officer. But Repovich, who has raised more than 
$350,000 for his campaign, has opted to skip the special election with an eye 
toward concentrating his resources on the regular election. His war chest so 
far is the largest among the Republican contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich and Wu have teamed up in their attacks on Rogan, accusing him of 
being a Johnny-come-lately to the Republican Party. After being a Democratic 
Party activist for years, Rogan joined the GOP in 1988 and two years later was 
appointed to the bench by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan's conversion has been labeled opportunistic by Repovich and Wu. "He 
changed parties so he could get a judgeship," Wu has charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan denies it. "I got tired of being the odd man out in the Democratic 
Party, and the Republicans were welcoming me with open arms," he said. 
"Besides, I joined the party when (1988 Democratic presidential nominee) 
Michael Dukakis was 17 points ahead in the polls against George Bush. I hardly 
call that opportunistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan also proudly points to his support from the Allied Business PAC as a 
sign that the integrity of his philosophy and credentials has gotten the stamp 
of approval from rock-solid conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan opposes abortion rights, opposes most gun control measures -- including 
bans on so-called assault rifles -- supports a voucher program to help families 
pay for private school tuition, wants to see the National Guard patrolling the 
U. S.-Mexico border to deter illegal entry and urges the abolition of conjugal 
visits and other privileges for prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wu and Repovich support legalized abortion, although Wu says she would 
not support tax funding of abortions for the poor. Like Rogan, Wu and Repovich 
are opposed to limits on assault-weapon ownership, but unlike Rogan, they would 
support legislation -- now being pushed by Assemblyman Katz -- to make it a 
felony to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime and illegal immigration, the three are virtually indistinguishable 
hard-liners who call for beefing up patrols along the border, ending welfare 
benefits to illegal immigrants and meting out tougher treatment to violent 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 While calling for longer prison sentences, Wu is reluctant to spend more money 
on new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not be building modern prisons for prisoners when we don't even 
have modern classrooms," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own crime spiel, Repovich, the police officer, adds a dig at Rogan. "We 
should lock 'em up and get rid of the soft, double-talking judges," he said 
recently. "We pick them up, but it's the judges who let them go." 
</P>
<P>
 Such campaign talk gives Skelton reason to hope that the Republican nominee -- 
whomever it might be -- will be weakened by intraparty squabbling. "I'm for as 
much democracy for the Republicans as possible," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Schiff, who faces weaker primary opposition, is focusing his 
attention on the regular election. Skelton said he sees no advantage in being 
an incumbent for only a few months and that Schiff should concentrate on Rogan, 
who Skelton expects to be the GOP nominee in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a frightening development that all this extremist money is 
coming into the district," Schiff said last week after it was reported that 
Allied Business PAC is backing Rogan's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAC and its principals -- four Republican millionaires, including savings 
and loan heir Robert Ahmanson and state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) -- have 
given $9,500 to Rogan's campaign so far, but are prepared to give much more if 
needed, a spokesperson for the group said last Thursday. In 1992 alone, the 
group gave $2.2 million to Republican candidates and conservative causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, who ran in 1991 in a special election to fill the Hollywood-based seat 
vacated by retiring Assemblyman Mike Roos, is pro-abortion rights and would use 
tax dollars to fund abortions for the needy; he supports banning assault 
weapons, and opposes a voucher system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the views of Mr. Rogan and the Allied Business PAC are way out of 
step with this community," Schiff said.

MANY TEEN-AGERS FACING HARDER LIVES, STUDY FINDS; RESEARCH: CONDITIONS HAVE 
IMPROVED FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN BUT OFTEN ARE GETTING WORSE FOR THE NATION'S 
ADOLESCENTS. MORE ARE DYING FROM VIOLENCE, AND ARREST RATES FOR JUVENILES HAVE 
JUMPED 50%. 
</P>

<P>
 The battle to improve the lot of America's 63.6 million children produced 
significant progress in recent years among infants and young adolescents, but 
teen-agers were caught in a worsening web of violence, pregnancy and failure to 
quickly complete high school, a study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 While infant mortality, poverty and the death rates dropped among children 
ages 1 to 14, the number of teen-agers arrested for violent crimes jumped 50% 
between 1985 and 1991, teen-agers' deaths from violence rose 13%, and the 
proportion of births to single teen-age mothers increased 20%, according to the 
study, which used government data between 1985 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids from the time they are newborn until their early teens seem to be doing 
fairly well," said Douglas W. Nelson, executive director of the foundation, 
which will release the study today. "It is when they begin to make the 
transition to adulthood that the lack of opportunity and hope translates into 
bad outcomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring how shifts in the economy have vastly reduced job opportunities 
for low-skilled workers, Nelson said: "There are kids growing up in communities 
where they don't see any future. Then, they make terrible mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers fared particularly badly in California, where hopelessness and an 
ample supply of guns combined to produce a powder keg. Arrest rates for 
juvenile violent crimes skyrocketed 60% between 1985 and 1991, giving 
California the fourth-worst ranking for juvenile crime in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the proportion of California teen-agers graduating from high 
school in four years dropped to 62% in 1991 from 67% in 1985. During that time, 
the percentage of children born to single teen-age mothers in the Golden State 
rose by a quarter -- with 49,000 babies born into such households in 1991, 
accounting for 8% of all births here. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a slow, painful way, we are dragging California's children down," said 
Lois Salisbury, executive director of Children Now, a California child-policy 
and advocacy group. The state went from spending 121% of the national average 
per pupil in grades kindergarten to 12 in the 1970s to just 86% of the national 
norm in the 1990s, Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare -- a program where 70% of the recipients are children -- was cut also, 
Salisbury said, adding, "The little canaries are singing in the mine shafts 
very loudly." 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the Washington-based foundation, which funds programs to help 
disadvantaged children, found that a quarter of those under the age of 6 live 
in poverty, with 58% of these in female-headed households. Three-quarter 
million children live without complete plumbing or kitchen facilities, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said nearly 4 million youngsters, 6.2% of the children in the 
country, are growing up in "severely distressed neighborhoods" -- places where 
more than half of the households are poor, nearly a quarter of 16- to 
19-year-olds have dropped out of high school, and almost 60% of men worked less 
than half the previous year, said William P. O'Hare, coordinator of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the children in such neighborhoods were African American or 
Latino, the study said, although those groups account for just one-fourth of 
the children in the country. Among California's children, one in 20 lived in 
distressed neighborhoods, one in six had no health insurance and more than a 
third lived in overcrowded housing, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are kids in these neighborhoods who turn out great, but in terms of 
life's chances, these neighborhoods lower your odds of a successful transition 
into adulthood," O'Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a point at which disinvestment, institutional erosion, service 
deterioration and demoralization create a negative momentum that is simply too 
strong for many individuals and families to overcome," concluded the 
foundation's report, which proposed empowerment zones with tax breaks to combat 
pockets of poverty -- zones that will be established in some communities later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Infant mortality rates in 1991 declined by 16% -- to 8.9 per 1,000 births -- 
down from 10.6 per 1,000 births in 1985. Advances in neonatal medical care, 
prenatal care and improved public education efforts produced the turnaround, 
the study said, although infant mortality rates among African Americans 
remained more than twice those of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Death rates for children between 1 and 14 improved by 9%, dropping to 30.7 
per 100,000 from the 1985 rate of 33.8, mostly because of improved auto safety 
and accident prevention measures. In 1991, 15,693 children aged 1 to 14 died. 
Again, however, the death rate for African American children was almost twice 
that of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single teen-agers accounted for an increasing portion of all births, 9% in 
1991 contrasted with 7.5% six years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juvenile arrests rates for violent crimes -- homicide, forcible rape, 
robbery and aggravated assault -- increased to 457 per 100,000 people in 1991, 
up from 305 in 1985. The rate more than doubled in six states. 
</P>
<P>
 * The violent death rate among those aged 15 to 19 -- reflecting deaths from 
homicide, suicide or accidents -- increased 13% to 71.1 per 100,000 in 1991, 
from 62.8 in 1985. While teen-age deaths from accidents dropped 15%, deaths due 
to homicide doubled. Every two hours, a child dies of a gunshot wound, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
 * While 20% of American children lived below the poverty line in 1991, that 
was a slight improvement from the 1985 figure of 20.8%. But it still was much 
worse than in 1969, when 13.8% of children lived in poverty.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE SAVVY AND FOLLIES OF A MAN OF PARADOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only time I interviewed Richard Nixon, one-on-one, press secretary Ron 
Ziegler pointed to my tape recorder as we approached the Oval Office and 
warned, "He'll go right up the wall if he sees that." 
</P>
<P>
 Being young and not willing to risk a scene with the leader of the free world, 
I quickly stashed the recorder in Ziegler's office. A few years later, of 
course, I and everybody else learned that Nixon himself secretly had been 
recording all his conversations in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd witnessed an example of what former Nixon aide John D. Ehrlichman has 
called the "strange collection of paradoxes" of this complex man, a native 
Californian who walked on the beach in wingtip shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon would go to the beach at San Clemente for a vacation and spend several 
hours each day working. As a grunt reporter assisting UPI's two White House 
correspondents, I found the President's daily drill both admirable and 
annoying. It was annoying because the seemingly endless meetings with Cabinet 
secretaries, the photo-ops and his penchant for mingling with local citizens 
cut into a reporter's beach time. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast could not have been greater covering Ronald Reagan many years 
later in Santa Barbara. Reagan wanted little to do with his staff and 
absolutely no contact with reporters, except for the annual summer party at a 
neutral site. Work merely interfered with this President's main agenda, which 
was to ride horses, chop wood and, perhaps, toss snakes from his ranch pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Nixon, Reagan knew how to relax and appreciated its value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nervous Nixon saw enemies everywhere. And initially in his presidency, he 
perceived one to be Gov. Reagan, who had fought him for the Republican 
nomination in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, I casually mentioned Reagan's name to Nixon as he walked me to 
the door after my interview. The President froze, as if he were a cat suddenly 
sensing an intruder. His ears were alert for information, but he scarcely 
spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was scared to death Reagan would run in '72," recalls Ken Khachigian, a 
Nixon speech writer. Reagan did not, of course, and the two became good 
political friends. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, after Reagan had won the nomination, Nixon occasionally slipped him 
advice. But Nixon realized that public knowledge of these efforts only would 
hurt Reagan. So he devised a clandestine delivery system. His aide would pass 
an envelope to Khachigian in a bar and Khachigian would transfer it to Reagan 
confidant Mike Deaver. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old man would give him big picture advice, like 'Here's what should come 
out of the debate,' " says Khachigian, who also became a Reagan speech writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon always had respected Reagan's political talents, but as Watergate 
erupted he also came to admire his fidelity. "Reagan never turned his back on 
him, which was a loyalty Nixon appreciated," says former Rep. Patrick J. 
Hillings, who succeeded Nixon in the House and was a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
 This appreciation of loyalty brings us back to paradox. No men were more loyal 
or closer to Nixon over the years than two fellow Californians: Robert H. 
Finch, his HEW secretary, and Herbert G. Klein, the White House communications 
director. Yet, after finally winning the presidency, the "new Nixon" diminished 
their influence and allowed relative newcomers H. R. Haldeman and Ehrlichman -- 
among others -- to push them around. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as we know, the results were disastrous for Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon had a big impact on California politics simply by launching so many 
careers: Finch, elected lieutenant governor; former Reps. Hillings, John H. 
Rousselot, Bob Wilson; political consultants Khachigian, Stu Spencer . . . and 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon gave Wilson his first political job -- as an advance man in his failed 
1962 gubernatorial campaign. In fact, Wilson was out in the car waiting to 
drive the defeated candidate home as Nixon bitterly was holding his infamous 
"last press conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Nixon offered Wilson a much bigger job -- then talked him 
out of taking it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon confided that he was planning to run for President in 1968 and asked 
Wilson to join him in New York as a top political aide, organizing his 
schedule. Wilson mentioned he'd also been thinking about running for something, 
the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked me right in the eye," Wilson recalls. " 'What kind of a district? 
What's the registration? Can you win it?' 'I think I can.' He smiled and said, 
'You want to do this don't you?' 'I think so.' 'Then you'd better. Otherwise, 
you'll spend the rest of your life kicking yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson took Nixon's advice. This was fortunate for the future governor. But it 
was unfortunate for the next President. Nixon could have used more common sense 
advice in the Oval Office -- advice such as "junk that recording machine."

FRONT BRINGS WIND, SNOW; WAVE BREAKS CRUISE SHIP WINDOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>

<P>
 A brief but energetic cold front blew through Southern California on Sunday, 
leaving up to a half-foot of snow on local mountains and injuring 15 people 
when a wave broke a window on a Catalina cruise vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm forced cancellation of the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in rural San 
Bernardino County, sending visitors at the open-air event running for their 
cars to get away from the wind, rain and pea-sized hail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The storm was obviously very vigorous, but not very large as far as area 
covered," said John Henderson, a meteorologist for the National Weather 
Service. "We had very strong winds but we didn't get a lot of precipitation." 
</P>
<P>
 The gusts, reported at speeds of up to 50 m.p.h., kicked up 6-to-12-foot 
swells in the Catalina Channel, where a vessel operated by the Catalina Cruises 
company lost a port side window about 25 minutes out of Long Beach shortly 
after 2 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue boats met the cruise ship as it returned to Long Beach Harbor, where 
paramedics treated three passengers for neck and back injuries before taking 
them and 12 others to St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach. The 12 were 
treated for minor injuries, including cuts from flying glass. All were 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 A Long Beach Fire Department official said there were several hundred 
passengers on the ship, which has a capacity of 700.

 "They were in pretty rough seas out there and they were hit by a big wave that 
broke a window," said Petty Officer Billy Williams of the U.S. Coast Guard. 
"People out there know the weather's bad but that never stopped anybody from 
getting in a boat and going out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Carter, spokeswoman for St. Mary Medical Center, said some of those 
treated complained of back and neck pains. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them have symptoms of anxiety, so they're being counseled by our 
social worker," she said. "They're just upset by the incident."

 High seas tossed ashore a California seal pup that perched atop a parked car 
near Santa Monica beach until animal control officers could capture it and send 
it to Sea World for medical treatment, according to lifeguard Lt. Ira Gruber. 
</P>
<P>
 The same storm was expected to bring heavy rains to the Midwest by midweek. 
Another cold front was expected to move through Southern California tonight or 
Tuesday morning, dropping a tenth of an inch of rain on coastal areas and up to 
a quarter-inch of precipitation in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend precipitation was too slight to be measured at Los Angeles 
International Airport, but weather spotters called in reports of two inches of 
snow at Big Bear, three inches at Idyllwild and six inches at Tehachapi.

JAPAN LAWMAKERS ELECT HATA PRIME MINISTER; POLITICS: NEW LEADER EARLIER WARNED 
NATION OF INDIRECT TAX INCREASES EXCEEDING PLANNED INCOME TAX REDUCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Former Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, 58, a self-described "coordinator" whose 
lack of enemies made him the only candidate acceptable to the myriad parties of 
Japan's coalition, was elected prime minister today by the lower house of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 With 274 votes, Hata won by a margin of 23 votes, against 207 for Yohei Kono, 
president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party who, like Hata, once 
bolted the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
 Communist Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa got 15 votes, and six other votes were 
invalid. Seven lawmakers were absent and two seats are vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite haggling within the "rainbow" coalition during both the last three 
months under former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and a 14-day 
post-resignation power and policy struggle, Hata polled 12 more votes than 
Hosokawa received last Aug. 6 when the first coalition since 1948 was voted 
into power. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Hata warned taxpayers that future increases in indirect taxes will 
exceed planned reductions in income taxes, ultimately raising the overall tax 
burden in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the Nihon Keizai newspaper, Hata said new revenue sources 
are needed to cope with the aging of Japan's society, in which more retirees 
will have to be supported by a smaller work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a $57-billion decrease in income and residential taxes, enacted in 
March and due to be extended, a larger overall tax burden is inevitable, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing deficits in the budget to fund the income tax cuts would be 
dangerous, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata's remarks, which put a priority on budget-balancing, contrasted with 
requests from Clinton Administration officials, who have been prodding Japan to 
cut income taxes as an economic stimulus to promote imports. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other interviews, Hata promised to reduce government regulations "to 
help open markets and create new industries." 
</P>
<P>
 Hata also said that now is not the time to revise laws to enable Japan to 
implement any sanctions imposed against North Korea. The U.N. Security Council 
has threatened such action to punish the Stalinist state for impeding 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Ministry officials earlier said that amendments of existing laws would 
be necessary to halt the flow of at least $600 million a year in remittances 
from Japan to North Korea -- an action that U.S. Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry said last week would be "one of the most important elements of sanctions" 
against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The new prime minister was to form a new Cabinet today. Its first task will be 
to launch parliamentary deliberations on the 1994 budget that is already three 
months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The deliberations, however, won't begin until May 9. A chain of national 
holidays -- what the Japanese call "Golden Week" -- begins Friday and ends May 
5. Most businesses plan to shut down on the non-holiday days of May 2 and 6 to 
give employees 10 days off in a row, including the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 10-point platform that coalition party deputies hammered out Friday 
after seven days of bitter debate, Hata will face a major challenge in dealing 
with a split that pits his own Renewal Party, Hosokawa's Japan New Party and 
the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party against the Socialists, former Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura's New Party Harbinger and the 
middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Takemura said his 15-member group would vote for Hata for prime 
minister, he warned that his party will not automatically vote for bills that 
the Cabinet submits to Parliament. The party boycotted negotiations on the new 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of June, the new prime minister must enact the budget, win an 
agreement on a major overhaul of Japan's tax system and come up with a sweeping 
economic program to fulfill a promise to the United States to substantially 
reduce Japan's $141-billion global trade surplus, including a $60-billion 
imbalance with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata said Sunday that he would present the economic program, as scheduled, to 
President Clinton when they meet in Naples, Italy, at a July summit of seven 
major industrialized nations.

170 MASSACRED IN RWANDA HOSPITAL AS TALKS FAIL, FIGHTING CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 170 patients and staff, helpless in a southern Rwandan hospital, were 
killed Sunday in the latest massacre in that central African country's civil 
war, an international medical aid group said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors with the international relief group Doctors Without Borders reported 
the killing from Butare, in southern Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the most vicious single incident in this current wave of 
violence. It was a direct attack on civilians in what is usually a neutral 
place," said Anne-Marie Huby, a spokeswoman for the organization in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports of the massacre came as Rwandan rebels and government forces 
exchanged heavy mortar and gunfire in the capital. In neighboring Tanzania, 
efforts to mediate an end to more than two weeks of bloodletting failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fighting has been exceptionally heavy today," U.N. spokesman Abdul Kabia 
said in the capital, Kigali. "The fire is very, very heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kabia, interviewed by telephone, said government representatives to the peace 
talks did not show up when the United Nations sent a plane Saturday to bring 
them to Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officers in Kigali told the United Nations on Sunday that they were 
unable to contact officials in Gitarama, the town southwest of the capital 
where the government fled the fighting two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, where the talks were to be held, 
Tanzanian Foreign Ministry official Kassim Mwawado said: "There will be no 
talks for sure. The Rwandan Patriotic Front representative has just left." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi had invited Rwanda's government and the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front for talks on ending the carnage that has killed an 
estimated 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Two million people have fled their homes, and thousands more are barricaded in 
buildings in desperate efforts to escape the bloodletting, which began a day 
after the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi died in a mysterious plane crash 
April 6 in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. relief agencies have pulled their staff out of the country to escape the 
slaughter, leaving the International Committee of the Red Cross and a handful 
of other private aid organizations to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Doctors Without Borders spokeswoman Huby said the group is pulling 
its staff out of southern Rwanda, where the hospital massacre occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Butare lies about 15 miles from the frontier with Burundi, and thousands of 
refugees fleeing Rwanda's civil war have been trapped because the border is 
closed.

ONE GALAPAGOS TURTLE COLONY SAFE, BUT MORE ARE THREATENED IN BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters battling a blaze on the largest of the Galapagos Islands said 
Sunday they can save 40 rare giant turtles in a colony about one mile away from 
the flames but are uncertain about the fate of thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think (the turtles) are in danger; we have the fire under control in 
that area, and if necessary we are ready to move them out," a Civil Defense 
official said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But the colony is only one of several threatened by the fire that broke out 13 
days ago for unknown reasons and has burned an estimated 15,000 acres of land 
on Isabela Island. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 10,000 turtles on the island, some of which weigh up to 400 
pounds, and officials fear that many will die because it could take at least a 
month to extinguish the blaze unless there is rain. 
</P>
<P>
 An official said if the fire continues heading in the same direction, they 
will have a "large tragedy" in their hands because there are too many turtles 
to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to save the turtles were also jeopardized by a lack of coordination 
between firefighters and local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A Civil Defense spokesman said the fire would have been contained last week 
had both sides been able to agree on a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 A photographer at the scene said there were also instances of local residents 
hindering, instead of helping, firemen extinguish the blaze.

AFTER ATTACKS, CHRISTIANS FEEL THREATENED IN PAKISTAN; ASIA: LEADERS OF 
RELIGIOUS MINORITY DENOUNCE GOVERNMENT IN MUSLIM NATION FOR FAILING TO REPEAL 
BLASPHEMY LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pakistan's small Christian minority has been plunged into fear and uncertainty 
by the shooting ambush of three members charged with defaming Islam and by the 
government's reluctance to repeal a law punishing anti-Muslim blasphemy with 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Christians are afraid. There's a great sense of insecurity," Bishop 
Samuel Azariah of the United Church of Pakistan said in a weekend telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Azariah and fellow Protestant and Roman Catholic prelates led 
thousands of Christians on a march through Lahore to demand that the government 
of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto nullify a law mandating capital punishment for 
anyone "who defiles the sacred name of the holy prophet Mohammed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the port city of Karachi, a similar demonstration staged by an estimated 
3,000 Christians was tear-gassed by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the government doesn't react, there will be other protests," 
Azariah said. "Christians are afraid, but they also want to register their 
protest and their concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Pakistan's Christians, who estimate their flock at about 3 million 
of Pakistan's 125 million people, say the anti-blasphemy law in the officially 
Muslim country is being used to persecute Christians or settle personal scores. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government does not take action by Saturday, Christians will stage 
hunger strikes, work stoppages or other protests, said Azariah, whose church 
represents an amalgamation of Protestant denominations including Anglicans, 
Methodists and Scottish Presbyterians. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns arose April 5, when gunmen attacked three Christians, accused of 
scrawling anti-Muslim slogans on mosque walls, as they left a Lahore court. 
</P>
<P>
 Manzoor Masih, 40, was killed. One co-defendant was shot half a dozen times in 
the stomach but is in no danger because no vital organs were struck, Azariah 
said. The third, an illiterate boy of 13, was shot in the wrist and hand. 
</P>
<P>
 From Bhutto on down, Pakistani authorities have kept mute about the attack, 
Azariah charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "No official condemnation has been stated at either the national or the 
provincial level," the bishop said. "Neither Mrs. Bhutto, nor the president nor 
the (provincial) chief minister has condemned the act, and that disturbs us 
further." 
</P>
<P>
 When no arrests followed the ambush, which took place in broad daylight before 
witnesses, Azariah said the Christians decided to stage the marches. 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty for blasphemy, made mandatory in 1991 under Pakistan's 
previous government, has never been applied, although Azariah said there have 
been at least three cases in which those accused of the crime were killed or 
died in suspicious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim, a Christian schoolteacher, was stabbed to death after a rumor 
spread that he had spoken an insulting word against Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto espouses a tolerant and liberal interpretation of Islam. Before coming 
to power in October, she talked about doing away with legislation that enacts 
Muslim religious norms into law. In Islamabad, there have been rumors of 
impending changes in the blasphemy law, including an amendment ordering 10 
years' imprisonment for anyone making false accusations and a softer penalty 
for people who may have insulted Islam's founder unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a country whose very reason for creation was the Muslim faith and where 
Christians are legally deemed a separate electorate, the issue is politically 
dangerous. Journalist Khaled Ahmed, who has followed the controversy for the 
Pakistani publication Friday Times, believes Bhutto has gotten cold feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a deep cleavage in Pakistan," he said. "The opposition will probably 
join up with the (Muslim) clergy on this. The government is scared. They now 
say they will not amend the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, as the Christians prepared for their marches, the provincial 
assembly in Lahore unanimously passed a resolution calling on the national 
government to preserve the death penalty for blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent decision by the Lahore high court may signal more trouble for 
Pakistan's Christians, Ahmed said. It ruled that the anti-blasphemy law in fact 
embraces all prophets, not just Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean prosecuting people as blasphemers if they spread the Old 
Testament stories that David was an adulterer or Noah a drunkard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fear there may be more litigation against the Christian community," Ahmed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of solidarity with the Christian minority, representatives of 
secular organizations, including the Pakistani Human Rights Commission, the 
Women's Action Forum, War Against Rape and the Committee for Justice and Peace, 
took part in the funeral procession for Masih. 
</P>
<P>
 Azariah also said authorities in Lahore seemed to be taking steps to limit 
interfaith tensions. Muslim activists planned a demonstration today, but a ban 
was published Saturday on the display of posters and banners at the site, he 
said.

AMERICAN ALBUM: THE ABRIDGMENT OF MADISON COUNTY, N.C.; FOR FOUR DECADES, THE 
PONDER CLAN RULED THE REGION AS A VIRTUAL FIEFDOM. BUT A RECENT VOTER 
REVOLUTION HAS THE 'DICTATORSHIP' IN STEADY DECLINE.

<P>
 Forget the covered bridges, languorous adultery and mellow Iowa of James 
Robert Waller's bestseller, "The Bridges of Madison County." 
</P>
<P>
 This Madison County, near the Great Smoky Mountains in western North Carolina, 
is a place of ear-popping drives and breathtaking views of forested peaks 
carpeted with wild laurel thickets. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a hardscrabble place where people struggle over what little level 
or arable ground there is, eking out a subsistence on the steep slopes, river 
banks and denuded hilltops called "balds." 
</P>
<P>
 "No covered bridges," said Hugh Koontz, editor of the weekly News Record. "We 
got a good number of washed-out bridges." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, the county seat, was described in an old "Ripley's Believe It or 
Not" as "the town that cannot grow." Hemmed in by a mountainside and the French 
Broad River, locals say it is "a block wide, a mile long, sky high and hell 
deep." 
</P>
<P>
 In many hollows here, politics falls somewhere between a blood sport and war 
because election outcomes are directly tied to government benefits and 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 For four decades, the source of precious public jobs and the state-funded 
roads to get to them was a family named Ponder, whose colorful clan ruled 
Madison County as a virtual fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Overturning 104 years of Republican rule in 1950, they created a boutique 
bastion of Democratic machine politics that rivaled any in U.S. history -- 
including Daley's Chicago and Tweed's Tammany -- one where hard-fought precinct 
tallies often were determined by litigation or at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had battle after battle, and we won them," said 74-year-old patriarch Zeno 
Ponder, who exercised power through the county Democratic Party, "not because 
we were ruthless, but because we were right." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeno, whose pencil-thin mustache led newspapers to compare him to an old-time 
riverboat gambler, had a simple philosophy for delivering government goods and 
services: "If the people didn't have it, and it was available, we had to get it 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Democracy is taken seriously here, said his brother, E.Y. Ponder, who is 83. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good form of government," said the former sheriff, who in 32 years in 
office never carried a gun, wore a uniform or drove a marked patrol car. "If a 
man doesn't take part in his process, he's got nothing to be bellyaching 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in its history, the county was dubbed "the kingdom of Madison." After 
the Ponders' victory, the county of 17,000 people came to resemble a medieval 
monarchy -- complete with Zeno as the ruler, E.Y. as his vizier and a third 
brother who served as Marshall's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 A multitude of Ponder princes from the next generation controlled the county 
boards of education, election, tax assessment and alcoholic-beverage control. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, allegations of strong-arm methods, from the polls to the 
courthouse, provoked a substantial amount of Zeno-phobia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst damn dictatorship you'd ever seen," said Joseph B. Huff, 75, 
a local attorney and dissident Democrat. "If you weren't one of the faithful, 
you didn't get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Wilma Dykeman wrote in her book, "The French Broad," that 
this area of Appalachia offered a "confusion of contrasts: rugged scenery 
inhabited by ragged people, riches of folklore made picturesque by poverty of 
cash, isolated mountain coves existing next door to crowded cultural Meccas, 
sturdy independence of spirit flourishing in a generation of welfarism." 
</P>
<P>
 Dykeman's description still fits Madison County, where a recent study counted 
half the people as "working poor." These days, the county's glossy tourist 
literature prefers to extol skiing, hiking on the Appalachian Trail, golf, 
vacation homes, fishing and fabled fiddlers. There's no mention of the Ponders 
or an infamous 1863 massacre that left the county with an uncomfortable 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's had a bad rap ever since the 'Bloody Madison' days of the Civil 
War," said Glenn Goodrich, who operates a whitewater rafting outfit on the 
French Broad and directs the Chamber of Commerce's tourism promotions. "I would 
like to change that image. We have beautiful scenery and great recreation." 
</P>
<P>
 But when North Carolinians think of Madison County -- despite such efforts to 
transform its image -- they think of the Ponders. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a revolution against the "Pondercrats" was launched by a coalition of 
Republicans and insurgent Democrats in the late 1980s, the dynasty has been in 
steady decline. Recent spring rains have been heavy, flooding Marshall's Main 
Street, and some here say they believe that the political tide may also be 
running against the Ponders. 
</P>
<P>
 Their last hurrah could come May 3, when the lone family member still holding 
countywide elective office faces a strong test to hang onto control of the 
school board, Madison's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Chairman Bobby Ponder faces three challengers, including the current 
Democratic Party chairman -- a job long held by Uncle Zeno -- in the county's 
first nonpartisan contest. 
</P>
<P>
 While a defeat at the polls could "put a stamp" on the Ponder era, Huff said, 
Zeno and E.Y. will probably continue to exert behind-the-scenes influence in 
Madison County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a long time for the dead trees to fall," Huff said.

MANDELA URGES RECONCILIATION AS HE ENDS HISTORIC CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela, reaching another milestone in his four years of freedom, 
wrapped up his party's historic election campaign here Sunday by urging 100,000 
of the cheering faithful to help him usher in a new era of racial equality and 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old leader of the African National Congress, an almost certain 
winner in South Africa's first all-race elections this week, told the crowd 
gathered on a sports field under a hot sun that the real work will not begin 
until after the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we must work together for our country," Mandela said, pausing frequently 
in an hourlong speech as his words in English were translated into Zulu. "The 
enemy of peace is also poverty, illiteracy and hopelessness. And this 
Wednesday, we can start the process of rebuilding." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign officially concluded Sunday, as required by law. The voting 
begins Tuesday with balloting among "special voters" in hospitals and 
retirement homes, and the rest of the country goes to the polls Wednesday and 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela spoke here just a few hours after a car bomb exploded near ANC 
headquarters in downtown Johannesburg, killing nine and injuring scores. He 
told the crowd that he planned to meet with President Frederik W. de Klerk 
later Sunday to discuss the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mandela, who went to jail for waging guerrilla war against the white-run 
security forces, already sounded more like the country's president than the 
liberation leader he has been for nearly four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged his supporters to remain calm and allow police to properly 
investigate the bombing, which officials believe may have been the work of 
right-wing whites who are boycotting the elections and demanding a separate 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't concentrate on the violent activities of those who want to disrupt 
these elections," he said. "Leave the task of dealing with law and order with 
the security forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in the regional power base of Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha 
Freedom Party, Mandela also lamented Saturday's killing of three ANC supporters 
as they tried to put up posters and distribute campaign literature in Ulundi, 
the capital of KwaZulu, the Zulu homeland that Buthelezi controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths suggested that despite Buthelezi's decision to end his boycott of 
the elections, more Inkatha-ANC clashes are probably inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela said he had telephoned Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Ulundi's 
police commissioner to express his concern, and he promised that "we are going 
to take the strongest action to avoid a repetition." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make it clear that we are not going to be deterred from getting 
our freedom," Mandela added. "To those who would try to destabilize this 
process, I say nothing they will do can prevent April 27th from being a 
historic day in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after his release from 27 years in prison in 1990, Mandela had told a 
huge ANC crowd at the same sports field in Durban to "throw your pangas 
(machetes) into the sea." But his appeals for an end to the killing have gone 
unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 14,500 people have died in political violence in South Africa since the 
ANC was legalized in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls suggest that the ANC can win about 50% of Natal province, 
compared to 19% for Buthelezi's Inkatha. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Inkatha's support is confined largely to the province, one of 
nine in the country, and polls indicate that De Klerk's National Party is 
likely to place second to the ANC nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi campaigned in Soweto on Sunday, where he drew more than 10,000 
supporters for his last major rally. He predicted that South Africans would 
turn out in great numbers for his party on the election days. 
</P>
<P>
 "My supporters stretch across the nation," he said. "And the politics my party 
endorses has not only remained consistent and pragmatic but has a universal 
appeal of which no other South African party can boast."

RABIN ARRIVES IN MOSCOW FOR TALKS ON WAYS TO KEEP PEACE MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the highest-ranking Israeli leader ever to visit 
Russia, arrived in Moscow on Sunday, seeking ways to maintain the momentum of 
the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, on a four-day trip, was met at Moscow's Vnukovo diplomatic airport by 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving for Moscow, Rabin was briefed at Tel Aviv airport by Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres, who had returned to Israel several hours earlier from 
meetings in Bucharest, Romania, with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Army chief Ehud Barak and his deputy, Amnon Shahak, also participated in the 
briefing. Shahak is Israel's chief negotiator at the Cairo peace talks with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of his trip, Rabin told army radio that he would seek more active 
Russian involvement in the peace process. Russia and the United States are 
co-sponsors of the Middle East peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that we will be able to establish much closer contacts with the 
Russian leadership concerning the peace process," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Arafat paid his first visit to Russia since the 1991 collapse of 
Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat accused Israel of stalling a withdrawal from the West Bank town of 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip, due to come under Palestinian control under a deal 
signed in Washington last year. He told journalists that he would propose that 
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin ask Rabin: "Are you serious about peace or 
not?" If not, Arafat said, the result could be anarchy in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has said differences over the scope of Palestinian jurisdiction over 
the two areas have held up the pullout.

IN SUBTLE CAMPAIGN, CUBA SEEKS BETTER TIES WITH U.S.; CARIBBEAN: HAVANA ALSO 
MAKES GESTURES TO EXILES. IT HOPES FOR AN EASING OF A CRIPPLING TRADE EMBARGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beset by a withering economy, Cuba is reaching out to two of its worst enemies 
for help: Cuban American exiles and the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 According to diplomats and political experts here, Fidel Castro's government 
is in the midst of a subtle campaign to isolate or split the exile community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it is playing to elements of the Clinton Administration seen 
as potentially open-minded about the prospects of better Havana-Washington 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlines of the Cuban strategy began to take shape this past weekend 
during a rare conference here with about 200 exiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply by holding meetings with people who fled the Castro regime, the 
government was fostering a sense of accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also announced reforms in immigration regulations aimed at removing the 
red tape that impedes travel to and from the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures included removing a five-year waiting period before a Cuban exile 
can return; creating a high-level office within the Foreign Ministry to deal 
exclusively with exile immigration matters; permitting the children of exiles 
to attend school in Cuba, and eliminating expensive fees charged exiles who 
return for visits. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have two immediate objectives, said a diplomat from a country with 
relatively cordial relations with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "First is to split the exiles and weaken the hold of the foundation," he said 
in a reference to the Cuban-American National Foundation, a virulently 
anti-Castro organization based in Miami. The foundation is perceived widely as 
influencing, if not dominating, U.S. Cuba policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next," the diplomat said, "is the hope that these so-called humanitarian 
gestures will give moderates in the (Clinton) Administration an opportunity and 
rationale for easing the pressure on Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate goal, and one acknowledged by Cuban officials, is the easing, if 
not total lifting, of the 30-year-old U.S. trade embargo that the Castro 
government blames for much of the island's wrecked economy and for the 
increasingly visible misery of nearly the entire population of 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have immediate relief in terms of investment, tourism, international 
aid and credit," said Ariel Ricardo, a Foreign Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, there is no question that lifting the embargo would 
promote political and economic changes inside Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the real danger, the diplomats and other experts say. Any 
liberalization of Cuba's Communist economic program and relaxation of the 
repressive political system would begin a process that Castro might not be able 
to control. 
</P>
<P>
 That such a threat exists was seen in the public reaction to the existence of 
the meeting with the exiles, a three-day session that ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the agenda supposedly was limited to discussions of immigration 
matters, many ordinary Cubans held out hope that the conference would bring 
immediate relief from their impoverishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Castro created immediate expectations of immediate improvements here in 
Cuba," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Castro was frightened by what happened to the Soviet Union and the other 
(Communist) countries that lost power when they tried to reform," a Western 
diplomat said. "He thought that he could somehow survive either through 
willpower or by hoping something would just work out. He's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, all the sources agreed, that Cuba is doomed economically. It has 
almost no way of earning the foreign currency needed for recovery. It lost its 
foreign aid when the Communist world collapsed four years ago, and its only 
viable export, sugar, will fall far short again this year of meeting even 
minimum needs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the country has almost no industrial production, it is nearly out 
of fuel, electricity and even food, and the government is about to eliminate 
tens of thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now," a foreign economic expert said, "Cuba is in danger of falling to 
the level of the poorest countries in the region." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the immigration measures will have little real impact beyond 
the exile communities themselves, a Western diplomat said, certainly not enough 
to cause a change in the anti-Castro nature of U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "these are important steps," said Alicia Torres, a prominent Miami 
exile who attended the conference, the first such meeting since 1978, "because 
it accepts the idea of freedom of travel," a powerfully emotional issue among 
the exiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubans hope that the measures announced here will have such an impact that 
large numbers of the estimated 1.5 million Cubans living in the United States 
will begin to question the rigid positions of the Cuban-American National 
Foundation, which demands the total removal of Castro and all remnants of his 
regime before accepting any easing of U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of some Western diplomats here, the Cubans are deluding 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't create any momentum toward lifting the embargo," one diplomat 
said.

IN BOSNIA, A NUMBING RESCUE REDUX; EVACUATION: U.N. AIRLIFTS OUT OF BESIEGED 
CITIES LIKE GORAZDE HAVE BECOME A TRAGIC ROUTINE AS SERB AGGRESSION CONTINUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whirring helicopter blades churned up a deafening windstorm as blue-helmeted 
U.N. troops ferried stretchers bearing bandaged children and stubble-faced 
fighters with crudely amputated limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the first of hundreds of casualties whisked from Gorazde to Sarajevo 
for treatment Sunday, but shuttling broken bodies from one hellish war zone to 
the ruins of another has become a tragic routine for the U.N. peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly a year ago, U.N. troops and humanitarian relief workers evacuated 
maimed Muslims from Srebrenica, where a brutal offensive like the campaign 
against Gorazde inflicted grave injury and terror on that population. 
</P>
<P>
 And some observers fear that there will be other Srebrenicas and Gorazdes as 
the Bosnian Serbs, seemingly undaunted by threats of air strikes, continue 
their drive to "ethnically cleanse" the area and create a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few months ago the choppers airlifting maimed civilians were headed out 
of Sarajevo, not in. That Gorazde's casualties can be accommodated in this 
battered capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina is testimony both to the improved 
security here since shelling was stopped by a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization ultimatum and the sad reality that two years of savagery have 
taught medical workers to take massacres in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a shame on all of us to fail in dealing with this crisis after 
the experiences of sudden tragedies we have already endured," Osman Duric, the 
chief surgeon at Kosevo Hospital, told his medical staff a few hours before the 
wounded began to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first three British Sea Kings roared into nearby Zetra stadium, 
hundreds of French, Ukrainian, Swedish and other soldiers set up a stretcher 
relay. Triage doctors dispatched the wounded to a fleet of waiting ambulances 
and then braced themselves for the next round. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the shellshocked children brought out without their parents were visibly 
relieved at having escaped the horrors of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Emina Dizdarevic, her right eye gouged by shrapnel and covered 
with a dirty bandage, said her father was killed during the war's first year 
and her brother lost as their family was uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
 For Medina Dzananovic, an 8-year-old wounded when shrapnel struck her head, 
even a few hours more in devastated Gorazde might have dangerously worsened her 
condition, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almir Sarajlic, an 18-year-old wounded on the defense lines the first day the 
Serbian assault began, suffered an emotional blow as he was evacuated Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know our house had been burned until I saw it from the air as we 
lifted off," the conscript said. 
</P>
<P>
 His family had been driven out of their village in the first days of the 
Serbian incursion. The rebels torched the Muslim houses to ensure that their 
victims would never return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," said Mary McLaughlin, an Irish doctor who had been trapped 
in the city since the onslaught began. "It was very frustrating as a doctor 
because we could do very little. For five days we couldn't even go out." 
</P>
<P>
 One official of the United Nations' refugee agency noted the similarity 
between rebel sabotage in the two "safe havens" of Gorazde and Srebrenica, 
where water facilities were blown up as the Bosnian Serbs were forced to 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fear is that Gorazde is even less viable now than Srebrenica," he said. 
"There are more people in what is effectively an even smaller place."

MEDICAL IMPLANT MAKERS WARN OF CUT OFF IN SUPPLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some major manufacturers of materials used to make heart valves, artificial 
blood vessels and other implants have been warning medical equipment companies 
that they will be cutting off supplies because they fear lawsuits, a published 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policies have not forced important products from the market, but 
implant companies are struggling to find other suppliers, the New York Times 
said in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've approached more than 15 polyester makers in the United States and 
Europe, but the best response we've had so far has been a few people willing to 
give us samples to test with no commitment to supply," said Dennis Genito, vice 
president of product surveillance at Medox Medicals Inc., an Oakland, N.J., 
manufacturer of artificial blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and industry executives said that the trend could end up making some 
needed implants hard to get and devastate the development of new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturers, which include Dow Chemical Co. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 
are getting out of the medical business because they fear being dragged into 
consumer lawsuits against implant makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppliers have been named in hundreds of lawsuits involving such things as 
silicone breast implants and jaw implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates said the manufacturers are dropping out of the medical 
supply business in an attempt to pressure Congress to limit legal redress 
available to people injured by faulty products.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; O.C. MAN RECALLS DUTY ON DAY LEADER RESIGNED

 Twenty years ago this month, Andy Gonis was a young Marine private with a set 
of orders that was the envy of his mates. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh out of military police training, Gonis was one of a handful of recruits 
chosen for a special detail: guarding the President of the United States, 
Richard Nixon, whenever he came to Orange County to visit La Casa Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was to assist however necessary whenever he was coming to the Western White 
House," said Gonis, a New York City native who is now a Newport Beach police 
sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonis' expected glory days of protecting Nixon were cut short by the tug 
of history. The first time Gonis participated in actually guarding the 
president was the day of Nixon's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a very important moment in history," Gonis said. "But it was 
kind of sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis, then 19, was assigned to the special 12-man unit at El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station in April, 1974. He was eager to catch a glimpse of the armed 
forces' commander-in-chief up close. 
</P>
<P>
 The first opportunity for that came a few weeks later as Nixon arrived at El 
Toro for a trip to San Clemente. But as one of the newer men in the unit, Gonis 
was placed with the overnight detail guarding Air Force One's fuel truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not the gravy assignment," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Aug. 9, when Nixon addressed the nation and boarded Air Force One one 
last time for the trip west, Gonis' unit was readied again for the Nixons' 
landing at El Toro. The preparations lacked the verve of other visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood was generally low among all the Marines," Gonis recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, the base was opened to civilians who wanted to witness Nixon's 
landing, Gonis said. Supporters and detractors showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 As the jetliner touched down at El Toro, Gonis said he remembered the crowd 
erupting into both cheers and boos. Yells of encouragement were laced with 
catcalls and hisses, which raised the stress level for the Marine guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were on alert for any unusual outbreaks," he said. "Fortunately, there 
weren't any." 
</P>
<P>
 For half an hour, the Marines scanned the jostling crowd as speeches were 
delivered on the runway not far from Gonis. Then as quickly as he arrived, 
Nixon was whisked away. 
</P>
<P>
 The brush with history had passed, it is a time that Gonis will never forget. 
Like millions of other Americans, he recalled pondering the state of the 
nation; it seemed America would never emerge from the turmoil and upheaval that 
plagued the country through much of the 1960s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a difficult period of time for society in general," Gonis said. 
"I was wondering where the country was headed myself. There was a whole range 
of emotions running through the crowd that day. But my concerns at the moment 
were to provide security and make sure I did my job. That was the most 
important thing."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; STORES FINDING NO GREAT DEMAND FOR NIXON BOOKS

 Propped on a crowded shelf at Rizzoli International Bookstore is a hardback 
copy of "Nixon: Ruin and Recovery," by Stephen E. Ambrose, sharing space with a 
long line of volumes by and about other American political luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 And like the other weighty tomes surrounding it, Ambrose's biography of the 
37th President was passed up Sunday by book shoppers who browsed the tony South 
Coast Plaza bookshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised," said assistant manager Garrick Brown. "We haven't had many 
requests for Nixon books." 
</P>
<P>
 While federal, state and county officials stepped up preparations for the 
funeral of Richard M. Nixon in his hometown of Yorba Linda, bookstores across 
the county reported spotty interest in either histories about Nixon or works he 
had penned himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Many store clerks interviewed Sunday said they did not have any Nixon books at 
all, not because they had sold out but because they were returned to suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the renewed focus on Nixon's topsy-turvy career, some stores are 
taking no chances on being caught short. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we heard he was in a coma," Brown said, "we put some orders in. All the 
attention brings him back to the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the county's larger book chains said they are expecting a rush of 
renewed interest in literature on Nixon as the week wears on. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzoli's main rival, Brentano's Bookstore, also in South Coast Plaza, 
reported making "a few sales" over the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Store manager Cathy Dages said that of the wide variety of books on Nixon's 
life and times, most buyers prefer those about him to those by him. 
</P>
<P>
 But as television continues to air snippets of his life, many readers will 
grow increasingly curious about his resignation from office, his efforts at 
instituting dialogues with the Soviet Union and China and his career as an 
elder statesman, several shop managers supposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that as the talk shows keep bringing Nixon up and as Larry King keeps 
talking about him, we'll see more interest," Dages said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers at other bookstores, however, were skeptical about a rush on Nixon 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 At Waldenbooks in the MainPlace mall in Santa Ana, store manager Mike McIntosh 
said that he has seen no interest in Nixon books whatsoever and that, after 
sending what stock the store had back to the publishers, he does not anticipate 
calling for new volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just been no demand whatsoever," McIntosh said. "Believe it or not, 
we have been selling more Henry Kissinger books lately." 
</P>
<P>
 "I really expected to see a huge run on Nixon books," said Melissa Knight, 
manager of Super Crown Books in Laguna Niguel. "It just hasn't happened."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; CLINTON PLAYS AN IRONIC ROLE FOR NIXON FUNERAL; 
PRESIDENCY: TWO DECADES AGO, HE PROTESTED THE WAR WHILE HILLARY RODHAM AIDED 
WATERGATE PROBE. NOW THE WHITE HOUSE IS PLANNING RITES FOR A RESPECTED ADVISER. 
</P>

<P>
 The President who once protested Richard Nixon's war policies -- and whose 
wife once helped try to impeach him -- is playing a major role in honoring the 
former President with a state funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton White House and State Department are handling many of the 
preparations, including the logistics for the media, the congressional 
delegation and the foreign leaders who will make up the majority of the private 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's body will be flown to the West Coast aboard one of the planes in the 
presidential fleet, and his funeral will include a military honor guard to 
carry the flag-draped coffin to the garden at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part of a surprisingly close professional relationship President 
Clinton and Nixon established during Clinton's 15 months in office, an alliance 
that both men sought and drew benefit from. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nixon, it was the final piece of a 20-year effort to resurrect his 
prestige after the disgrace of being forced to resign under the threat of 
impeachment. He was publicly functioning as the reflective elder statesman, the 
wise man to Presidents. According to Nixon's informal advisers, part of his 
carefully constructed strategy for his public rehabilitation was not to appear 
too partisan. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, in turn, Nixon provided a valuable ally and prestige in his most 
vulnerable area: foreign policy. And the relationship enhanced Clinton's 
standing with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first hour after Nixon's death was announced Friday night, Clinton 
paid tribute to the former President in a live TV statement from the White 
House Rose Garden. He also noted that he had spoken with Nixon's daughters, 
Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower, by telephone after hearing the news. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nixon himself asked that Clinton give a eulogy at his funeral. Late last 
week, after Nixon's stroke, the Rev. Billy Graham conveyed to the White House 
Nixon's desire to be eulogized by the President, U.S. News & World Report 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides are being unusually reticent about the details of the 
funeral at the behest of the Nixon family, including the reasons for the former 
President's decision to eschew lying in state at the Capitol in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is much I can't tell you because we are trying to respect the family's 
privacy," an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, Nixon's body will remain at an undisclosed New Jersey funeral 
home, where his family and invited friends will be able to pay their respects, 
according to the late President's New Jersey office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's body then will be driven north to Stewart Air National Guard Base in 
Newburgh, N.Y. An aircraft from the presidential fleet will fly the body to El 
Toro Marine Air Station in California. 
</P>
<P>
 His coffin will be taken by motorcade to the library's main lobby, where Nixon 
is to lie in state until 11 a.m. Wednesday. Officials are expecting thousands 
of mourners -- so many, in fact, that they are reserving parking lots miles 
away and chartering shuttle buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tidal wave coming at us," one library official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with Nixon's wishes, his coffin will remain closed as mourners file 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral service at 4 p.m. Wednesday, for invited guests only, will be 
broadcast on all major television networks. Music will be provided by the Navy 
choir and orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members will occupy seats on the lawn, while the hundreds of guests 
will fill bleachers that are being hastily erected in the library's parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's prominent role in the funeral proceedings is yet 
another in a long list of ironies in Nixon's incredible career. As President, 
Nixon described students who protested the war as "terrorists." Clinton was one 
such protester while a student in Britain. Hillary Rodham Clinton worked as a 
staff attorney on the House committee that voted to impeach Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Clinton was in office, however, the two men exchanged letters, phone 
calls and held private meetings. Clinton offered Nixon briefings on U.S. 
foreign policy, and Nixon presented reports on his foreign travels. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pat Nixon, the former President's wife of 53 years, died last year, 
Clinton dispatched the plane that had served as Nixon's Air Force One to fly 
her body home to California. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton asked, Nixon vigorously lobbied members of Congress on behalf of 
increased aid to Russia. And as Nixon made his last trip to Russia in March, 
Clinton called to say that the former President's plans to meet with opponents 
of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin would be "useful" to the White House, a 
calculation that later resulted in Yeltsin furiously refusing to see Nixon 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our relationship (was) warm and constructive," Clinton said Friday, "and he 
went out of his way to give me his best advice, and I was incredibly impressed 
with the energy and the vigor and, frankly, the rigor that he brought to 
analyzing this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a book completed shortly before his fatal stroke -- and excerpted in 
Time magazine today -- Nixon does criticize Clinton's handling of the situation 
in Somalia while warning that America's next war will be an internal battle for 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debacle in Somalia was a lesson in how not to conduct foreign policy," 
Nixon wrote in "Beyond Peace." "What began as a highly popular humanitarian 
relief program under President Bush became a highly controversial U.N. 
nation-building project under President Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also denounced Clinton's health care reform plan, whose "1,342 
impenetrable pages is less a prescription for better health care than a 
blueprint for the takeover by the federal government of one-seventh of the 
nation's economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The book's other message, about national unity, might seem particularly 
ironic, coming from the President who employed dirty tricks against his 
political foes, kept an enemies list in the Oval Office and whose own close 
advisers talked about the depths of his paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States must "learn the art of national unity in the absence of war 
or some other external threat," Nixon wrote. A failure to do so will jeopardize 
the nation's diversity, individuality and freedom, he said.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; NIXON PLANNED MILESTONE OPENING TO CHINA FOR LONG 
TIME, BOOK SAYS; DIPLOMACY: IN TAIPEI IN 1965 -- FOUR YEARS BEFORE BECOMING 
PRESIDENT -- HE SAID U.S. HAD TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
CHINA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Richard Nixon sat down for a private chat with senior U.S. diplomat 
Arthur W. Hummel Jr. in Taipei's Grand Hotel in 1965, what he said took Hummel 
by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, then an out-of-office Republican warhorse and devout anti-Communist, 
asserted that Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist regime would never achieve its 
dream of returning to mainland China. And so, Nixon said, U.S. relations with 
the People's Republic of China would have to be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said that in the hotel room, with all the microphones in it," recalled 
Hummel with wonder, meaning that Taiwan's intelligence service was probably 
monitoring what Nixon was saying and would report it back to Chiang. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident -- first reported in a newly published book about Taiwan by 
Georgetown University historian Nancy Bernkopf Tucker -- appears to show that 
the origins of Nixon's milestone opening to China date back earlier than was 
previously known. 
</P>
<P>
 They also bolster other recent historical evidence that gives more of the 
credit for the China diplomacy to Nixon and less to Henry A. Kissinger, Nixon's 
national security adviser and later secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taipei conversation took place four years before Nixon entered the White 
House and six years before he stunned the world with the announcement that 
Kissinger had made a secret trip to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the United States had no diplomatic relations with Beijing and 
recognized Chiang's Nationalist regime on Taiwan as the government for all of 
China. Moreover, the United States was in the middle of the Vietnam War, in 
which China was supporting and supplying America's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1971 announcement, together with Nixon's own presidential visit to China 
the following year, marked one of the fundamental turning points in the history 
of the Cold War. It opened the way for extensive strategic cooperation between 
Washington and Beijing to offset the military power of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, histories of the Nixon-Kissinger initiative to China have 
invariably started with an article called "Asia After Vietnam," which Nixon 
wrote for Foreign Affairs magazine in October, 1967, with the help of adviser 
(and now New York Times columnist) William Safire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China forever outside 
the family of nations," Nixon said in the article. "There is no place on this 
small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry 
isolation." 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the article, Nixon did not advocate any new diplomacy with 
Beijing. And the depth of Nixon's commitment to a new U.S. policy toward China 
was hard to judge from that article because it could be written off as merely 
serving Nixon's immediate political needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foreign Affairs piece appeared at a time when he was running for President 
and was engaged in a public-relations campaign to show that there was a "new 
Nixon" -- more reflective and innovative than the man who had been defeated by 
John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 Hummel's 1965 conversation seems to demonstrate Nixon's proposal for improving 
U.S. relations with China was not a casual or one-shot proposal intended merely 
for public consumption, but reflected a broader change in his thinking that 
dated back several years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time they met, Hummel was the deputy chief of mission of the U.S. 
Embassy in Taipei. He later served as U.S. ambassador to the People's Republic 
of China from 1981 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kissinger eventually spearheaded the complex diplomacy leading to the 
U.S. rapprochement with China, several recent histories and memoirs suggest 
that he was at first reluctant and that the idea was originally Nixon's. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander M. Haig, who served as deputy national security adviser at the time, 
recalled in a recent book that in early 1969, Kissinger returned from a 
conversation with Nixon and, rolling his eyes in disbelief, said the President 
wanted to normalize relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kissinger was at first skeptical about any quick opening to China, and it was 
Nixon's dogged vision that propelled the initiative," wrote Walter Isaacson in 
his recent biography of Kissinger. "On one trip early in 1969, (White House 
Chief of Staff H.R. (Bob) Haldeman) talked to Nixon on the plane and then came 
to sit next to Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You know,' Haldeman said, 'he actually seriously intends to visit China 
before the end of the second term.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Kissinger took off his glasses, polished them slowly, smiled and replied, 
'Fat chance.' "

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; NIXON FORESAW EXONERATION IN TAPES, HAIG SAYS; OVAL 
OFFICE: FORMER PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY FEARED WHAT HE MIGHT BE ACCUSED OF BY 
AIDES. HE BELIEVED RECORDINGS WERE 'EXCULPATORY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Richard Nixon refused to destroy the tapes that led ultimately to his 
resignation as President because he thought that they would exonerate him -- 
and he believed that to his death, one of his top aides said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander M. Haig, Nixon's last chief of staff, said he tried to get Nixon to 
burn the recordings of the Oval Office discussions during which Nixon conspired 
with aides to direct the cover-up of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought lawyers in, one of whom the President knew I supported, who urged 
him" to burn the tapes, Haig said on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nixon refused "because his own paranoia had suggested to him -- and he 
told me this at that time -- that he didn't know what he'd be accused of by his 
closest associates," former Chief of Staff H.R. (Bob) Haldeman and domestic 
affairs adviser John D. Ehrlichman, Haig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt those tapes were exculpatory," Haig said, "and I think to the day he 
died he believed that." 
</P>
<P>
 One of several key figures involved in Watergate to appear in TV interviews 
Sunday, Haig also said the former President instinctively wanted to fight 
rather than resign the presidency in August, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "His instincts were to fight and to fight through the impeachment and, if 
necessary, to go to jail. This was clearly an alternative that he would have 
faced," Haig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he concluded, however, in the final analysis, that the economy was 
beginning to erode very seriously, that conflict was shaping up in the Middle 
East and that he simply couldn't govern, and therefore it was time to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Another major figure from the time, former Republican Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr. 
of Tennessee, said he went into the investigation of the scandal thinking that 
it would damage the Democrats. Baker was the ranking minority member of the 
Senate's special Watergate Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 When burglars were first arrested trying to bug Democratic National Committee 
headquarters in the Watergate building and identified themselves as working for 
Nixon, "I thought it was a Democratic dirty trick to embarrass Nixon in the '72 
campaign," Baker said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he first began to suspect that Nixon was involved after meeting with 
the President in a hideaway office next door to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left there, I had the jolting realization that I had a very difficult 
task ahead of me. I had helped nominate Nixon. . . . And I was going to follow 
the facts wherever they led me." 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Baker said, "I'm convinced that Richard Nixon didn't know a thing 
on Earth about that burglary before it happened. . . . But the real triggering 
episode that brought about the fall of Richard Nixon was that decision to try 
to contain the thing instead of going to the American people and saying: 'You 
wouldn't believe what some of these clowns have done' and firing them, maybe on 
television. But he didn't make that decision, and it brought him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) was a House freshman when he was assigned to the 
Judiciary Committee that conducted the impeachment inquiry. Also appearing on 
the CBS program, he said his newness to Congress may have influenced him to 
vote to impeach Nixon, but that time had not changed his views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the evidence, the accumulation of evidence, was simply overwhelming. 
As we sat and listened to the tape-recorded conversations, you could not ignore 
the fact that there were encouragements to commit perjury . . . discussion of 
the payment of hush money, obstruction of justice -- it was just the total 
accumulation of evidence that said this conduct is inconsistent with the powers 
that the people expect the President of the United States to exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger praised Nixon, saying that "in 
the field of foreign policy (Nixon) will go down as one of the seminal American 
Presidents, not only because of the specific initiatives that he guided or 
invented but, above all, because he tried to relate the various elements of 
American foreign policy to some overriding theme." 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger also denied the charge that Nixon's detente policies of easing 
relations with the Soviet Union might have prolonged the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "We faced what looked like a Communist monolith with a badly divided country. 
. . . We divided the Communist bloc. We demonstrated that the Communist world 
was not a monolith. We then began to play these two (China and the Soviet 
Union) against each other. We gradually weakened their self-confidence."

THE ADMIRAL COMMANDS CLIPPERS WITH 71 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Robinson, in a supreme effort that won the NBA scoring title Sunday, 
became the fourth player in league history to surpass 70 points by collecting 
71 in San Antonio's 112-97 victory over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson finished the season with 2,383 points in 80 games, giving him an 
average of 29.787. Shaquille O'Neal, who led Robinson by an average of .06 
going into the game, scored 32 against New Jersey, but needed 68 to win the 
scoring title at 29.790. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's finish was reminiscent of the final day of the 1977-78 season when 
David Thompson scored 73 points in an afternoon game, but lost the title when 
George Gervin had 63 that night. Wilt Chamberlain, Thompson and Elgin Baylor 
are the only players to score 70 points in an NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson scored the Spurs' first 18 points and had that total after one 
period. He scored just six points in the second quarter, but came back with 19 
in the third period and 28 in the fourth. He was 26 for 41 from the field, 
including one of two three-pointers, and made 18 of 25 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The 71 points established was a team record, surpassing Gervin's 63 on April 
9, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Terry Dehere led the Clippers with 26 points. Dominique Wilkins and Loy 
Vaught added 16 points each for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, Robinson was seven for 10 from the field while his 
teammates missed 12 of 13 field-goal attempts. Negele Knight's 18-foot jumper 
with 23 seconds remaining were the first San Antonio points other than 
Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who played 44 minutes, left the game to a standing ovation with just 
34 seconds left remaining. His 25 free-throw attempts established a team 
record, and the 18 points from the line tied a club record. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson scored his 64th point on a free throw with 1:33 to play. But Spurs 
Coach Jonh Lucas wasn't satisfied. He instructed his team to foul the Clippers 
intentionally even though the Spurs held a 101-80 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs continued to pass to Robinson, who scored seven points in the next 
59 seconds before leaving the game. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA rebound champion Dennis Rodman grabbed 17 boards, 10 of them in the final 
quarter, for San Antonio. Robinson had 14 rebounds.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; AIMING FOR THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR VIOLENT SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Common-wisdom time. Everyone knows that crime in the United States is up 
dramatically, right? And that television gore is one of the prime reasons? 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. Perhaps we don't know what we think we know. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that crime is a voracious Pac Man that renders some 
segments of the nation more perilous than passive. Yet by far the most 
arresting aspect of last Thursday night's "Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?" 
was its truth-liberating statistics about crime. They'd been previously 
reported in this newspaper and elsewhere, but not with such visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronting the ABC News hour was reporter John Stossel, armed with such visual 
aids as a graph with Justice Department statistics showing that all crime 
during the last 20 years is down about 25% and that violent crime has dropped 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, does so much of the public believe the opposite -- the result being 
an aggressive campaign to have Congress bring its clout to bear on perpetrators 
of TV violence as one means of curtailing real-life violence? 
</P>
<P>
 Stossel and others suggested that what has risen is not the rate of crime 
itself but the reporting of crime. "We've seen . . . large increases in 
reported rape over the last 30 years," University of Texas criminologist Mark 
Warr said on the program. "Does that mean that rape is going up? Possibly, but 
it could also be that women are more willing to report a rape today than they 
were 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Warr added that when the news media headline crime statistics 
over long periods, they rarely take into account population increases that have 
occurred during the same years. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, he noted that relentless TV news emphasis on violent crime -- 
abetted by technology that brings instantaneous reporting of everything grisly 
-- adds to the impression that your next-door neighbor is John Wayne Gacy and 
just about everyone is constantly at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to deny that violent crime is a major problem in the United States. 
But how much is television to blame for the real-life carnage, and how much of 
the blame lies elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Canadians -- especially those in large urban centers -- watch 
essentially the same entertainment television as U.S. viewers. From Hollywood's 
lips to Canadian ears, the blood and bang-bang travel right across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet their crime rate is dramatically lower than ours. And, notably, so is 
their access to guns. 
</P>
<P>
 A message here? It's not unlike the one "Kids Killing Kids" aims to deliver at 
8 p.m. Tuesday on both CBS (Channels 2 and 8) and Fox (Channels 11 and 6). 
Arnold Shapiro ("Rescue: 911") is the executive producer, David J. Eagle the 
writer, director and producer of this commercial-free drama that tells four 
separate stories of youths who fall prey to guns. In a twist, the stories are 
then retold to show how things would have been different without the presence 
of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle, best known for creating socially aware "Afterschool Specials" for kids, 
says it was two years ago that he thought of doing an "Afterschool"-type 
program telling four separate stories of kids who meet tragic ends due to guns. 
But, after he and his associate, Carol Starr Schneider, researched handgun 
violence and presented their program proposal to a spate of networks, they were 
turned down across the board. One network executive claimed he was declining 
"because of (fear of) the NRA (National Rifle Assn.)," Eagle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time later, Eagle said, he learned from Judy Price, CBS vice president 
for children's programming, that CBS (which earlier had rejected his proposal) 
had put a kids-and-guns afternoon program into development with Shapiro. Price 
united him and Shapiro, and it was Shapiro, Eagle said, who came up with the 
concept of showing kids-and-guns tragedies from two perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, protests against TV violence had become a steady loud din, 
prompting Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and others in Congress to put pressure on 
the industry to drastically change its ways. As the pressure increased, so did 
the determination of the networks to alleviate it by demonstrating their 
goodliness. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Eagle, a top CBS executive decided that the network could get 
more "brownie points" if "Kids Killing Kids" were plucked from the afternoon 
ghetto and showcased in prime time. So, although made on a relatively skimpy 
"Schoolbreak Special" budget, "Kids Killing Kids" was granted Shapiro's 
"Rescue: 911" slot in prime time as part of a weeklong slab of programs 
examining the problem of violence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "CBS also decided to make it an event and offer it to the other networks," 
Eagle said, "but only Fox took it. I understand one of the networks turned it 
down because they thought our story about suicide was too scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the youth suicide rate in the United States is too scary. And the 
recent case of the 10-year-old Los Angeles boy who who came to school and 
fatally shot himself in the head with his father's automatic pistol is too 
scary. And the number of kids with access to guns is too scary.

Q & A; 'IMPORTANT MUSIC COMES FROM THE GUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J ohnny Cash says it feels good to be starting over again at 62. Just when his 
recording career seemed to be winding down, country music's legendary Man in 
Black returns Tuesday with an album that is as surprising as it is affecting.  
</P>
<P>
 Titled "American Recordings," the solo acoustic effort was produced by Rick 
Rubin, the maverick owner of Los Angeles-based American Records who is best 
known for working with rap acts (including Public Enemy) and rock groups (the 
Red Hot Chili Peppers).  
</P>
<P>
 But Rubin has not tried to push Cash onto a '90s commercial bandwagon. Indeed, 
he has helped capture the rich essence of the singer-songwriter better than any 
recordings since the prison albums that Cash made in the late '60s with 
producer Bob Johnston or the '50s hits that Cash made with Sam Phillips.  
</P>
<P>
 "American Recordings" features just Cash's voice and guitar on a varied 
collection of songs that reflect the wide range of a man who has been voted 
into both the rock 'n' roll and country music halls of fame. (See review on 
Page F5.) The material ranges from Cash originals to such familiar tunes as 
Leonard Cohen's "Bird on a Wire" and Kris Kristofferson's "Why Me."  
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the album's release, Cash spoke by phone from his home near 
Nashville about the latest twist in a career that has done so much to enrich 
both country music and rock.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: It was an interesting idea to do an album with just your voice and 
guitar. When did you come up with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: (laughing) Oh, about 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Really? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I always wanted to do an album like this. I even had a title for it: 
"Johnny Cash Alone." I used to talk to Marty Robbins about it because Marty 
used to close the Grand Ole Opry by just doing a song on his own, and it was my 
favorite part of the show. I just never got around to doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did the concept come up this time? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Rick Rubin started coming around to our shows about 18 months ago and 
talking to me about making a record. I didn't know if he would be into my music 
when we first met because he was associated with rap and hard rock, but he was 
a fan . . . and one night he said he'd love to hear just me and my guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 So we set up a recording machine in Rick's living room, and he had me sing 
everything I could think of . . . gospel, blues, country. We tried some things 
with other musicians, but what we really liked was the intimacy of the solo 
recordings . . . just from me to you, so to speak. The thing that was good 
about Rick was that he was really trying to find out the heart of who I am as a 
musician. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why didn't you do a solo album like this before? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I talked to companies and producers over the years, but there was never an 
interest in it. We'd start out doing something simple, but they always thought 
it would sound better -- which means more commercial -- if we had other 
instruments on there too, so I would go along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you surprised that companies aren't more sensitive to what the artists 
want to do -- especially artists, like you, who have shown time and time again 
that what seems a radical step really will work in the marketplace? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I am. If I owned a company, I know I would listen carefully to the 
artist more because no one knows what's inside more than the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was there one producer or record company executive over the years who 
seemed to be the best at that -- trying to find your true creative center? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'd have to say Sam Phillips back at Sun Records in Memphis. Sam didn't 
have a clock in the studio. He didn't let me feel like I was spending anybody's 
money by just singing new songs. After an hour or two, he'd say, "OK, what else 
you got? Let's keep going till we get your best." I loved that in a producer. 
That's what Sam did with all of us at Sun. . . . Elvis, Carl (Perkins), Jerry 
Lee (Lewis). He tried to find the uniqueness in each of us. He didn't try to 
simply make us sound like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think there is too little emphasis on individuality now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, I think so, especially in country music today. So much of it sounds 
alike to me . . . both the singers just starting out and the ones that are 
already on the charts. But it's kind of been that way for years now . . . ever 
since the "Urban Cowboy" craze around 1980. That's when everyone got into 
overproducing the music -- making it for the people who were in New York City 
who were buying cowboy boots. It was embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was it like working with Rubin? 
</P>
<P>
 A: He was a lot like Sam, actually. We talked a lot about the approach we were 
going to take, and he said, "You know, we are not going to think about time or 
money. I want you to come out as much as you can." He even had some suggestions 
for songs. We must have ended up recording 70 or more before settling on the 
ones we put on the record. . . . Old hillbilly songs, folk songs, blues, gospel 
. . . all sorts.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a theme to the album? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To me, the songs are about sin and redemption. That's the thread running 
through the whole album. . . . The dark and glorious moments in life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of dark moments, have you been reading about the suicide of Kurt 
Cobain? A lot of adults just can't understand the pressures on him and how he 
meant so much to so many young people. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure, I read about it, and I think it's obvious what he meant to so many 
people. Everybody likes to hear something they can identify with, and we can 
see that millions of young people identified with Cobain's music. That's what 
music is about: communication. It doesn't matter if it's country or blues or 
rock. The most important music comes from the gut. . . . It's something that is 
honest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the pressures of stardom? You had problems in your early days, 
too, didn't you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It can be really hard. It can just take your life away from you. It changes 
everything around you. That's why drugs came into my life and kind of took over 
for years. I couldn't handle that kind of success. A lot of people couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, it was like I felt guilty about it all. I had come from 
this real poor background and I didn't feel like I deserved all this money and 
attention. I kept thinking, "I'm not what they think I am. I don't have all the 
answers. I'm not magic ." 
</P>
<P>
 But then you grow with it, and you learn that it really doesn't matter what 
other people think of you. You're just one human being, and you're doing the 
best you can. But it's not easy. It almost destroyed me. There but for the 
grace of God . . . you know the line.

FOCUSING ON SOUTH AFRICA ELECTIONS; TELEVISION: ALL-RACE VOTING DRAWS 
ON-THE-SCENE COVERAGE FROM MAJOR NEWS OUTLETS, INCLUDING L.A.'S KCAL CHANNEL 9. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week's first-ever all-race elections in South Africa will draw special 
coverage from network, cable and public television outlets as well as KCAL-TV 
Channel 9. Voting is scheduled to be conducted Tuesday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's Peter Jennings is the only anchorman from the three major broadcast 
networks who will be in South Africa this week, although CBS' Dan Rather was 
there last week to work on a series of reports that are scheduled to continue 
through Wednesday. NBC had intended to dispatch anchorman Tom Brokaw to South 
Africa, but scrapped those plans when former President Richard M. Nixon had a 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC also plans to devote at least one "Nightline" broadcast to South Africa 
this week. "CBS This Morning" will have live reports from Martha Teichner today 
and Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Public Broadcasting Service plans to report on South Africa in a pair of 
ways. Charlayne Hunter-Gault of "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" will report from 
the scene, and the network's "Front-line" documentary series on Tuesday night 
presents "Mandela," an analysis of Nelson Mandela's ascent to his expected 
election as the nation's first black president, and the political comeback of 
his ex-wife, Winnie Mandela, following her conviction for kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 On cable, Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network is also in South Africa to anchor 
that network's coverage. Cheryl Martin of Black Entertainment Television is in 
Johannesburg to provide reports for its news programming Thursday and Friday, 
as well as follow-up stories for "BET News," May 6 and 13. C-SPAN plans on 
airing the victory and concession speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most ambitious coverage plans comes not from a major network or 
cable service but from KCAL-TV Channel 9. The Walt Disney Co.-owned independent 
began a two-week series of reports on South Africa last Monday. Today, it 
begins five days of live reports from Johannesburg by anchorwoman Pat Harvey. 
(Her reports will appear on all of KCAL's newscasts but particularly on the 9 
p.m. newscast, which emphasizes national and international news.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there is a lot of interest in what's going on in South Africa," said 
Bob Henry, KCAL's senior vice president and director of news. "This is one of 
those times in world history that a country is making a fundamental change in 
the way it governs itself. One of the reasons that has happened is there has 
been a fair amount of information and entertainment that has come out of 
Southern California in terms of films, movies and records that all have South 
African connections." 
</P>
<P>
 CNN, with which KCAL is affiliated, will help boost KCAL's coverage in several 
ways. CNN will be providing reports of the major day-to-day events, so Harvey 
will be freed to "look for people with connections to Southern California and 
do stories we think will be of interest to Southern Californians," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 KCAL has frequently dispatched its reporters abroad in the four years since it 
adopted a three-hour prime-time news block. Other destinations have been Mexico 
for a visit by Pope John Paul II, El Salvador, the Persian Gulf, Russia and 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Viewers) remember the stories that are done and done well from faraway 
places," Harvey said. "People say a lot of folks aren't interested in what's 
happening in other parts of the world, but among our viewers, there is a strong 
interest there. They look upon our station as a news leader when we are able to 
do this kind of coverage."

ANN CONWAY: O.C. GETS STREISAND, BUT ITS CHARITIES WON'T SEE PROCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, Las Vegas. Then London, Washington, Detroit. And then Barbra Streisand 
brings her platinum pipes to Orange County -- you know, that 31-city enclave 
that's part of L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 Yup. That's the way Streisand's assistants saw it when they divvied up the 
prime seats -- as many as 500 per night -- that will benefit Los Angeles 
charities at her six concerts May 25 through June 4 at the Pond in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not Orange County charities? "Those charities are benefiting Orange 
County," says a Streisand spokesman. "Orange County is part of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Hello? The designated charities -- Natural Resources Defense Council/Pesticide 
Campaign; Alliance for Children's Rights; Girls' Voices Women's Lives; Legal 
Aid Foundation; Operation USA/LA Earthquake Relief, and United Friends of the 
Children -- are all in the City of Angels. And that's where the proceeds will 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a snub. Talk about an identity crisis. When are they going to 
figure it out? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has its own world-renowned arts venue, Segerstrom Hall; its own 
Tony Award-winning theater, South Coast Repertory; its own world-class retail 
shopping mecca, South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about its world-class hotels, restaurants and some of the priciest 
coastal property this side of Monte Carlo? What about the marble-paved Pond 
(which Streisand chose over the Los Angeles Forum) that houses Orange County's 
own red-hot hockey team? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the slew of nonprofits here that might have sold those 
$1,000-per-person concert tickets (which the charities bought for $350 each). 
</P>
<P>
 "It does seem a little strange (that local charities weren't offered tickets 
to sell), because a good portion of the audience is certain to be from here," 
says Tom Tomlinson, executive director of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The allocation of charity tickets is "exciting and thrilling and somewhat 
disappointing, because you can't say yes to everybody," says a spokesman for 
Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, the project came together rather quickly. Ms. Streisand was 
very anguished to find out how much money scalpers charged for her Las Vegas 
concert. She was afraid it would happen here. Giving tickets to charities takes 
a lot of tickets out of the hands of scalpers." 
</P>
<P>
 No one would criticize Streisand's efforts on behalf of charitable causes. Her 
Barbra Streisand Foundation, which she founded seven years ago, has doled out 
$7.5 million to charity. "She's especially concerned about AIDS and children 
and women at risk," says a spokesman. "And she is very much involved in 
ameliorating Black-Jewish relations and Jewish-Arab relations. She has a wide 
list of compassions." 
</P>
<P>
 Locals just wish her organization had taken a closer look at Orange County's 
charity landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ken Goldman, outgoing development director for the Pacific Symphony: "I 
think Ms. Streisand is an artist who is very much an important person in this 
world and can pretty much do whatever she wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it would be nice, in the future, if she does this in other communities, 
to at least include a charity from the community where she is appearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Tomlinson and Goldman think the way to energize sales for the charity 
concert tickets (which are going slowly, according to reports) would be to 
offer more activity for the dollar -- a preconcert supper, perhaps, or a 
post-concert party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our fund-raisers don't begin to approach that kind of ticket dollar . 
. . and, even then, usually include other activities like a dinner or a party," 
Tomlinson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, who has helped orchestrate hundreds of concert-related parties, has 
found that art patrons, especially, want more for their benefit dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some charity events, the cause is enough," he says. "Especially when it 
is a benefit for a disease such as AIDS or a cause like battered women. (At 
those events) people aren't so much concerned with the details of the event as 
they are with supporting the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the arts, however -- because it is the arts -- there seems to be a need 
for more of an entertainment factor in selling the event." 
</P>
<P>
 Preconcert parties are successful because they get the evening off to an 
exciting start. But post-concert parties (especially those attended by the 
entertainer) are the most popular, Goldman says. "Then, there's so much to see, 
talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Building a benefit around a Streisand concert in 1994 is a charity's dream, 
Goldman says. "A Streisand concert is probably the most desirable one you could 
imagine. Not only is she a great star, she hasn't really been around for 20 
years in public. There is a tremendous pent-up demand to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it wouldn't have been a slam-dunk to sell tickets at that price, but it 
would have been great to try."

READING, WRITING, THERAPY; EDUCATION: THE ART OF OPTIMISM. COPING WITH LIVING. 
MANY SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO FILL A PSYCHOLOGICAL VOID -- BUT DO THESE SUBJECTS 
BELONG IN THE CLASSROOM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's today's pop quiz: 
</P>
<P>
 What do "Peace Builders," "Coping With Living" and automated teller-machine 
training have to do with reading, writing and arithmetic? 
</P>
<P>
 How does "Optimism" play on your kid's school transcript? 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what do college admissions committees think when they find out that 
your child spent part of his or her senior year learning to balance a 
checkbook? 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has all the answers yet. But more and more, touchy-feely programs are 
popping up in schools all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some focus on confidence, self-esteem, "negotiation enhancement" or 
"aggression containment." Others target diversity, disability, death and 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 There are coming-out seminars for gay adolescents, symposiums for children of 
gay parents, AIDS information workshops. Classes in sexual harassment awareness 
abound. Some schools even provide quick-hit sessions on table manners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the skills we teach are just like teaching reading," said Mark 
Greenberg, a psychologist at the University of Washington who develops 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 This shift in academic mandate -- call it, for lack of a more pronounceable 
term, the "psychologization of education" -- has been slow, subtle and largely 
unheralded. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents and educators praise the inclusion of these subjects as an 
important recognition of the role of education in the 1990s. But others decry 
it as "psychobabble," stealing already limited class time and treading on turf 
traditionally belonging to another of America's beleaguered institutions, the 
family. Yet another contingent wonders both about the quality and piecemeal 
nature of these psychological services. 
</P>
<P>
 "As our society changes, as families change in the various ways they have 
changed over the last 25 years, some of the things one used to assume occurred 
in the home are not taking place. Schools have been encouraged, forced, told or 
directed to pick up the vacuum," said Connie LaFace Olson, career equity 
services coordinator for the Los Angeles Unified School District.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen it much more than in the past, and I think it's really a positive 
trend," said Carol Mares, a teacher adviser whose three children attend public 
schools in Pasadena. "It's little by little giving kids tools with which to 
work out their problems as they go out into the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the therapeutic interventions, while well-intentioned, "have a low 
probability of efficacy," said Dennis D. Embry, an Arizona psychologist who 
works extensively with schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 He said families and educators alike may attach excessive weight to these 
efforts, reasoning that if a child has studied something in school, there's no 
further reason to pursue it. "It's like, 'Johnny, you've had your self-esteem 
training. Now shut up,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Kelly, president of the National Assn. of School Psychologists in Silver 
Spring, Md., said psychologically oriented programs are, for the most part, 
welcome additions to the conventional school menu of learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said recent research shows that "there are a lot of children coming to 
school whose lack of social skills gets in the way of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weiss, a psychologist who heads the family and school project at the 
Ackerman Institute in New York City, finds no fault with the premise that as 
"the business of living" in contemporary society has changed, so have the 
obstacles confronting schools, parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, "the discussion usually stops at that point." Schools have 
ventured into territory traditionally occupied by the family with "no central 
set of beliefs," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools have had to take it on," he added. "It's like a relay race -- 
you're the schools, and somebody passed you the baton. There's a sense now that 
things are going down a rat hole, and we've got to plug the hole" with new 
learning strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift nature of this approach makes long-range success unlikely, said 
Susan Swapp, professor of education at Boston's Wheelock College. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems are so pervasive that patchwork, onetime Band-Aid approaches are 
not going to do it," she said. "You can take all the programs in the world on 
self-esteem or sexual adjustment or whatever it is, and if it is not connected 
to a larger vision of what the purpose of school is, or what the connection 
between school and family should be, then it is not effective." 
</P>
<P>
 But vision is a luxury in a time of educational trench warfare. School 
administrators never sat down and hatched a battle plan for students' 
psychological well-being, said Olson, of the L.A. Unified School District. 
Instead, she said, a ticking grenade of dysfunction and discontent was tossed 
on their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the question is, 'Why are schools doing this?' the answer is, 'Because 
society is demanding it,' " Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students today enter school with emotional and psychological equipment that is 
vastly altered from what their parents brought to the classroom, said Lee Huff, 
a psychologist at Fountain Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the dissolution of the family unit, the structure isn't there to 
provide students with any kind of frame of reference," he said. Courses with 
such titles as "Mediation Training" and "Conflict Resolution" may generate 
guffaws among academic purists, Huff conceded, but without adult role models or 
training, "kids resort to their peers" -- meaning, they duke it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look around, Huff suggested. "The extended family seems to have 
vanished from the scene. I can't tell you the number of students I talk to, 
they don't have a grandma, a grandpa, an aunt or an uncle to rely on for sage 
advice." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Albuquerque, N.M., Paquita Hernandez replied -- in effect -- get real . 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't looking at the roots of these problems," she said. "We're not 
looking at causes." 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing school-based programs on self-esteem or aggression is "a way of 
pacifying our anxiety," she added. "We're looking at little ways of 
entertaining ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Hernandez points to Celebrate Youth, the independently funded 
after-school program she introduced to secondary-school students in Albuquerque 
seven years ago. It pairs students with adult mentors who work with them for a 
minimum of one year in fields of mutual interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't give people self-esteem through a workshop," Hernandez said. 
"Self-esteem evolves because you feel competent." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with so many other phrases in the current lexicon of public education, 
competence has become a buzzword. The University of Washington's Greenberg, who 
has worked with public schools to enhance "thinking skills" and other social 
problems since 1981, argues, in fact, that the entire objective of 
psychologically adjusted curricula is to make students "more socially 
competent." 
</P>
<P>
 He helped launch a program called Fast Track, funded by the National Institute 
of Mental Health, which is aimed at identifying primary school students with 
emotional problems. He bristles if Fast Track or its cousins are described as 
non-academic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't talk about it as something outside academic work," Greenberg said. 
"We think of it as making children more successful in their academic work." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that whereas "10 to 15 years ago, these were seen as problems only 
for kids who were 'at risk,' now they are seen as more generalized" in the 
school population. Similarly, Greenberg said, the value of social skills 
training is now more widely recognized in the culture at large. 
</P>
<P>
 But Susan Neufeldt, director of graduate programs in the school of psychology 
at UC Santa Barbara, worries that while "more behavioral things have been put 
into schools, there are fewer psychologists in the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeldt's concerns come from her roles as a clinical psychologist and as the 
mother of a 13-year-old girl. "We look for quick, inexpensive ways of solving 
problems that have little effect," she said, adding that too often, teachers 
conducting socialization or behavioral segments of the school day have had only 
minimal training in the subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know much about it," said Neufeldt, an ex-high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 She cited, for example, a self-esteem seminar she attended at her daughter's 
public school. "I went to some of these meetings as a parent, and they were 
just laughable. They don't provide the training or the experts that are needed 
-- and you're just not going to solve problems of this magnitude with quick 
hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeldt judged the vogue toward psychologization in education harshly, saying 
it detracts from traditional curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 But L.A. Unified's Olson said that "to suggest that these kinds of trainings 
are at the expense of academics is probably too broad." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Olson said, "what I see happening is that some of these issues are 
covered in the course of a particular subject area." As examples, she pointed 
to gender role training that can begin as early as kindergarten, "making sure 
that it's not always the boys who carry the books to the storeroom" -- and 
making sure that boys and girls know they are equally qualified to perform this 
task.

JACK SMITH: RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS ARE PUBLIC PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am not surprised to encounter some controversy over the origin of the maxim, 
"Today I will commit one random act of senseless kindness. Will you?" 
</P>
<P>
 As I said in a recent column, that precise version of the sentiment is 
attributed to Chuck Wall, a professor of human relations at Bakersfield 
College. Wall adapted it from a newscaster's report of "another act of 
senseless violence." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought if I just took out that word violence and put in the word kindness 
," Wall said, "I'd take a well-known negative phrase and turn it into a 
positive phrase." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall intended the saying as an assignment for his students, but it has spread 
far beyond the campus. It appears on more than 15,000 bumper stickers. It was 
the subject of an Oprah Winfrey show, and a resolution designating the week of 
Feb. 12, 1995, as "National Acts of Kindness Week" has been introduced in the 
House by Rep. Walter R. Tucker of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 But of course there is nothing new under the sun. Thomas Rische of Torrance 
writes to inform me that a similar idea was expressed by columnist Adair Lara 
in the December, 1991, Glamour magazine and her article was condensed in the 
May, 1992, edition of Reader's Digest.  
</P>
<P>
 Lara's version of the maxim was "Practice random kindness and senseless acts 
of beauty." She said she heard it was originated by Anne Herbert, a Marin 
County writer, who had written it on a Sausalito restaurant place mat where 
another guest saw it and copied it. Thus it flew. 
</P>
<P>
 I called Chuck Wall and he told me that he believes the phrase is probably 
generic, and he doesn't care how many people copy it. "The more people who want 
to get in with variations the better off we'll be," he said. When the slogan 
began bouncing around, he got so many calls from businesses hoping to 
capitalize on it that he had it copyrighted, to limit profits to charities. 
"This is not for making money off of," he said.' 
</P>
<P>
 Rische said Lara is also philosophical about the widespread borrowing of the 
idea. "It becomes part of the culture, like Kilroy," she wrote, referring to 
the ubiquitous GI ghost of World War II. (Who has not seen the sign, "Kilroy 
was here," posted in the most unlikely places?) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to his colleagues, Tucker observed that his resolution "builds 
upon the dedicated work of Dr. Charles Wall and expresses the sense of Congress 
that all people should be encouraged to practice random acts of kindness and 
goodwill toward all men." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker adds a long list of whereases to his letter, noting that a rape is 
committed every six minutes in the United States, 3 to 4 million women are 
battered by their mates every year, and every year there are 758 random acts of 
violence for every 100,000 persons. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that the United States "strongly opposes random acts of violence, and 
all forms of intolerance and mean-spiritedness based on ethnicity, religion, 
race, gender or sexual orientation. We should be encouraged to practice random 
acts of kindness. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I believe I was the victim of a random act of violence in my 
earlier column on this subject. I wrote that Oprah Winfrey had recently based a 
show on Wall's maxim, and I suggested that if each of her 22 million viewers 
committed one act of kindness, "the world would suddenly be a better place to 
live in." 
</P>
<P>
 In print, however, that phrase came out "a better place in which to live." 
Evidently my editor was obeying that mythical rule that one should not end a 
sentence with a preposition. 
</P>
<P>
 As I have often written, "A preposition is often the best thing to end a 
sentence with." It may be especially useful in avoiding that graceless phrase 
"in which."  
</P>
<P>
 The sainted H.W. Fowler called the so-called rule a "cherished superstition" 
and noted that it deprives English of its "remarkable freedom . . . and 
flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I have often told the story that Winston Churchill, noting that an 
assistant had changed a sentence he had ended with a preposition, wrote in the 
margin: "This is the type of arrant pedantry up with which I shall not put." 
There are other versions of Churchill's comment, but the point is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Gowers, in "Plain Words," said: "There used to be a rather half-hearted 
grammarians' rule against doing this (ending a sentence with a preposition), 
but no good writer ever heeded it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I review this point only to reassure readers who might be shocked at my using 
a phrase that I have so publicly deplored. Actually, my editor is a woman of 
erudition, perspicacity and compassion, and when I fall, her net is always out 
to catch me in. 
</P>
<P>
 I say that as a random act of kindness.

MAKING UP IS HARD TO DO; IF YOU CAN PATCH THINGS UP AFTER A BIG BLOWOUT, YOUR 
RELATIONSHIP MIGHT ACTUALLY IMPROVE. BUT THE ROAD TO RESOLUTION IS FULL OF 
POTHOLES.

<P>
 It happened right here, in the breezeway of Georgetown's Four Seasons Hotel. 
On a cold December night in 1991, Marla threw her shoe -- and her 7.5-carat 
diamond engagement ring -- at the Donald and told him that she never wanted to 
see him or any of his billions again, ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Donald, strong but seldom silent, had some words of his own. Best not to 
think about printing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked bleak in the house of Maples-Trump. Who could imagine 
reconciling after such an angry, public explosion? Yet the last time we 
checked, there they were, having a baby and marching down the aisle, in that 
order. Love -- and reconciliation -- had triumphed. 
</P>
<P>
 Patching things up after a huge and horrific argument is not a subject most 
couples like to talk about. (Unless you're Roseanne and Tom Arnold.) Our 
culture, after all, continues to base its expectations of marriage around 
romantic notions that do not often hold true in real life. Mythology holds that 
after the Big One, we kiss and make up. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most couples, the reality is not so simple. Sooner or later, the giant 
fight is likely to take place -- the confrontation where you reach into the 
deepest well of rage to hurl insults and imprecations designed to wound and 
that do so with great effectiveness. The five-alarm fight is a nasty fact of 
life -- so much so that Michael Albano, president of the American Academy of 
Matrimonial Lawyers, keeps a plaque on his wall that reads: "Marriages are made 
in heaven. But so is thunder and lightning." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such fury, said USC psychology professor Constance R. Ahrons, 
"reconciliation is hard work. It's incredibly hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly that was the case for Dennis and Mary, who agreed to talk about 
their own personal moment of marital Armageddon provided that neither their 
actual first nor last names were used. Dennis and Mary live in Los Angeles; 
he's a businessman, she's a teacher. They have two young children, and 
normally, in the five years they have been married, they coexist in relative 
tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Saturday night not long ago, after the kids were asleep and the house 
should have been calm and quiet, things somehow got out of hand. "I'm not even 
sure what started it," said Mary, although Dennis said he was irked when Mary 
complained about the division of labor in their family -- a familiar theme, as 
it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 With the doors closed so as not to wake the kids, they were soon shouting at 
each other. Mary, enraged, made an unflattering comparison between Dennis and 
his father, whose idea of cooperation was lifting his feet when the vacuum 
cleaner came by. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you're no different than your (bleeping) mother," Dennis fired back. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary countered with an unkind description of her husband's anatomy, another 
family trait, she added for bad measure. Dennis dived right into the domestic 
gutter as well. His wife's rear end, he told her, could be used as a retaining 
wall the next time the San Gabriel Mountains fell down. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went, spiraling into the kind of family faceoff that happens "for 
most of us," said Santa Monica psychiatrist Dr. Mark Goulston, because "there 
is a longtime buildup of unexpressed disappointment, which hardens into 
frustration and anger, and smolders into bitterness and belligerence."  
</P>
<P>
 Mary and Dennis did cool down -- and, it's a relief to report, did stay 
married. But they admit that at that white-hot moment, when the marital ceiling 
threatened to crumble, it was hard to imagine even wanting to be friends again 
-- never mind partners or, God forbid, lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 As Goulston promised: "If you can get to the other side, you do develop a 
different level of closeness. You become the kind of couple that other people 
gravitate toward." 
</P>
<P>
 In researching his book "Staying the Course," an examination of the careers 
and marriages of 80 highly successful men, University of Massachusetts-Boston 
psychology professor Robert S. Weiss found that the impact of nuclear-level 
domestic disputes is "really severe. It just lays people out." 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, it's the little irritants that add up to the big, bad brouhaha, 
domestic law specialist Albano observed. "They start saying things they wish 
they hadn't said -- and should not have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing they know, they're saying, 'Oh, and by the way, so-and-so made 
a pass at me' " -- a real red flag, in Albano's experience -- "or, 'You're 
overweight.' Or, 'You don't look as good as your best friend.' The next thing 
you know, you're talking about getting a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 in the marital insult hall of fame is "You're lousy in bed," said 
Albano, who practices in Independence, Mo. Next comes the affront that sends 
most grown people into major tantrum mode: "You're more and more like your 
mother/father every day." Finally, Albano said, out comes the handy-dandy, 
all-purpose "I never really loved you anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 As trite as such aspersions might appear, their effect can be devastating. "I 
don't think we do forget these things," said USC's Ahrons, who has just 
completed a book called "The Good Divorce" that addresses many of these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are sort of always there," Ahrons said, building up into what she calls 
the scar tissue that is part of any intimate relationship. Still, she said, "I 
do think you can forgive, even without forgetting." 
</P>
<P>
 Reconciliation turns out to be a kind of art. It takes practice. It takes 
skill. And it comes in many packages. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Ahrons cautioned, "there's pseudo-reconciliation, where people 
get scared" of what has just happened between them, or of the possibility of 
ending up alone. In these circumstances, she said, "often they will pull back 
together and reconcile temporarily without resolving anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For some couples, Ahrons said, this kind of high-conflict drama becomes part 
of their domestic fabric. They feed on the Sturm und Drang , "and then, of 
course, there is the big apology and they make up, and usually there's good sex 
after that," Ahrons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get into getting back together," she said. What they say, invariably, 
is "this time it will be different." But of course, Ahrons said, "Nothing is 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 True reconciliation, specialists maintain, requires recognition that some 
change is needed. "There has to be some sense that the way we work together 
isn't working," Ahrons said. "It's not just an apology for an event. It's a 
real sense that we've got some big problems, and we don't know if we're going 
to make it, but we're going to try." 
</P>
<P>
 A genuine armistice also means acknowledging that no one is blameless, said 
Goulston, who teaches at UCLA. "In explosions of this magnitude," Goulston 
said, "it takes two to tango -- and it takes two to tangle." 
</P>
<P>
 Owning up to some degree of responsibility for the battle is critical, said 
Roger Fisher, director of the Harvard Negotiation Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us tend to allocate blame," Fisher said -- when in fact, "apologizing 
for what I did wrong tends to be better if done honestly than saying, 'I 
forgive you for what you did wrong.' " The latter response has a "point-scoring 
quality," Fisher said, "and it says, 'Not only are you a bastard, but I'm an 
angel.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it helps to pull pride out of the picture as well, said Albano, who, 
as a divorce lawyer, admitted that he does not see men and women at the height 
of connubial bliss. "I always suggest that you have to get beyond the hurt and 
look at the facts, the circumstances, the motives that led up to the argument," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even then, Fisher cautioned, a cool-headed resolution may not necessarily 
mean the end of a communications crisis. When Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin 
shook hands on the White House lawn, it was an extraordinary miracle of 
mediation, Fisher said, "but it did not solve the trouble in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 Honest resolution, he explained, implies an understanding that "we're still 
going to have disagreements" from time to time -- but perhaps we can avoid 
breaking all the wedding china when we do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most steadfast of relationships -- what social scientists call a 
"validating" partnership -- has a "5-to-1 ratio of positive to negative 
events," said University of Washington psychology professor John Gottman, 
author of "Why Marriages Succeed or Fail." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people just kind of go on," Gottman said, even when a massive flare-up 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconciliation often takes time, and always takes tenderness, Albano has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most people can get beyond a single big blowup," he said, "and realize 
that no one is perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask another fun couple, Dudley Moore and Nicole Rothschild. Just a few 
weeks ago, Rothschild had Moore arrested for allegedly attacking her. On April 
16, the pair got married and beamed happily at each other for photographers.

LAUGH LINES; THE GOOD OLD DAYS? SOMEBODY STOLE 'EM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PAULA POUNDSTONE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paula Poundstone is a comedian and 
writer who lives in the Los Angeles area.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if no one actually steals anything from me ever, for the amount of time, 
money and energy it has cost me to constantly lock and unlock, and be locked 
out of, lock my keys in, alarm and false alarm, and drive two blocks away and 
turn back to make certain I put the alarm on, I might as well have just been 
robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, especially when I can't find my keys, I bitterly reflect on how 
awful the world has become. For a brief and harrowing moment, I become a live 
one for those running for office on the "get tough on crime" platform.  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how long it will be before we hear a guy on a paid political 
advertisement claim, "If I am elected governor and there are any criminals in 
this state, I'll personally smash their heads in." 
</P>
<P>
 The more I think about it though, the more I realize that things have been 
worse. Take the Old West for example. Now, I'm not exactly a historian, but I 
used to watch "The Big Valley" a lot. People carried guns back then like it was 
a perfectly normal thing. They didn't have the evil NRA then because nobody was 
against guns to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Percentage-wise, we couldn't possibly have as much violence as they had back 
then. They were ambushed, their stagecoaches were robbed, they had shoot-outs 
in the middle of the street at noon (right in the middle of the lunch rush), 
they hanged each other from trees, they tarred and feathered people. They used 
to shoot people for cheating at poker.  
</P>
<P>
 My brother used to always get dibs on being the banker in Monopoly in order to 
steal 500s. He never even got yelled at.  
</P>
<P>
 It was definitely a more violent time. Hell, someone could just come up to you 
in a bar and shoot at your feet to get you to dance. You never hear of that in 
the 1990s. We're either less violent or a lot more willing to dance.  
</P>
<P>
 I read once that Geronimo used to bury his victims alive with only their heads 
sticking out, pour molasses over their heads and allow ants to eat them. Geez, 
that went out with tube tops. We're beginning to look like angels, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When you think about it, the frightened, angry argument that insists we build 
more jails before we address prevention of the root causes of our violent 
crimes, because we are in a crisis, doesn't make much sense. As it turns out, 
we're always in a crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 I guess Barbra Streisand was right in her "memories" song, which was later 
recorded by Gladys Knight and the Pips, when she said, "What's too painful to 
remember, we simply choose to forget." Still, I'm amazed at how fast her 
tickets went. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the news of the poor, stupid American teen-ager who vandalized cars 
in Singapore and has been sentenced to six disfiguring lashes with a bamboo 
cane, administered publicly by a martial arts guy -- as soon as that story came 
to us, people were calling in to God-awful radio shows going on and on about 
that being the kind of justice we need over here. These are the kind of people 
who used to form a posse without the sheriff's permission.  
</P>
<P>
 Punishment has never been the rewarding fix-it we had hoped for. We need to 
deal with the causes of criminal behavior or we'll just keep building tons of 
jails and slowly but surely we'll all fill them. 
</P>
<P>
 The only people on the outside will be a handful of really clever criminals 
and one lonely, honest citizen who will earn a living mowing our lawns, 
bringing in our mail and flipping our porch lights on and off so it looks like 
we're at home.

 The other night, my wife suggested we see "The Piano." Now that sounds like a 
lot of fun: two hours of watching Holly Hunter saying nothing. Sorry, not even 
the presence of Harvey Keitel -- one of my favorite movie thugs -- could get me 
off the couch for that. 
</P>
<P>
 I think my wife was just testing me, to see if my knuckles still scrape the 
ground when I walk. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of disagreement over whose choice will prevail, Robin and I have 
concluded that we suffer from what we call Boys' Movie-Girls' Movie Syndrome. I 
know it sounds like a cliche, but that's just the way it is: I like mindless 
action; she prefers gauzy sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin's a pushover for the period piece, with a musical score as lush as 
Hawaii and major redemption in the end for extremely Angst -ridden characters. 
An extra "thumbs up" if it was produced before Sputnik. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a sucker for squealing tires, spent shell casings, and guys who are long 
on attitude but short on the verbal ability to express it. She loves to razz me 
about my "buddies," as she calls them: Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Lee 
Marvin, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger -- that crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's her problem? Here's a woman who's trying to convince our young son 
that "Camelot" is a war movie, when anybody knows it isn't a war movie unless 
Sylvester Stallone wastes everything in his path searching for POWs in the 
jungle.  
</P>
<P>
 Robin's ideal movie is long and boring and frilly and subtitled and who needs 
it and please, wake me when it's over. In the checkout line at our local video 
store, there she'll be with stuff like "A Room With a View," "The Age of 
Innocence" and "The Remains of the Day." But I'll be right behind her with "Out 
for Justice," "Death Wish II" and "Missing in Action III." 
</P>
<P>
 And she has the nerve to complain about my taste? This is a woman who: 
</P>
<P>
 * Adores movies only with costumes from the French Renaissance, Victorian era 
or the mid-1950s (which pretty much rules out cowboy hats, loincloths and 
anything that clanks when you walk). 
</P>
<P>
 * Raves over cinematography that makes every scene look as if it were shot 
through a heavy glaze of Vaseline (but can't quite appreciate the same effect 
in "Emmanuelle"). 
</P>
<P>
 * Swoons over any musical with Fred and Ginger, Gene Kelly -- even John 
Travolta (yet doesn't share my enthusiasm for guys in togas blaring trumpets). 
</P>
<P>
 Would you trust the judgment of a woman who once passed on tickets to a 
Redskins-Cowboys game at RFK to watch "The Nutcracker" on PBS? Sheesh. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as we're on the subject of taste, what can you say about somebody who 
won't miss an episode of "All My Children" and thinks it's a travesty that 
Susan Lucci hasn't won an Emmy? Who gets weepy over phone company commercials? 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always this way. During our courtship, I willingly accompanied Robin 
to see films with an appeal to the intelligentsia, offbeat flicks such as 
"Diva" and "The Gods Must Be Crazy." By the time we got married, Robin probably 
believed that she was gaining a life partner whose taste in film was every bit 
as refined as her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha! Fooled her! 
</P>
<P>
 She thought she was getting Gene Siskel, but she wound up with Snuffy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 We still haven't fully resolved our differences in this department. We've 
discussed going our separate ways at the multiplex, but mostly we enrich the 
local video store by checking out two movies instead of one: something froufrou 
for her, something a bit more basic for my caveman instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 I try to tell her that maybe some of us brutes embrace the lowbrow because we 
were force-fed the highbrow when we were too young. Like so many George Bushes 
who gleefully abandoned the broccoli of childhood for the pork rinds of 
adulthood, maybe we just hunger for the lowest common denominator in movie 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes our tastes miraculously converge and she actually likes something I 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 It's happened with "Unforgiven," "In the Line of Fire" and "The Fugitive" -- 
all chock-full of my buddies. When the film credits roll, she turns to me and 
whispers: "Honey, I liked that. Really." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there's hope for her after all. I suppose, in the spirit of marital 
harmony, I ought to give "The Piano" a chance. My buddies will just have to 
understand.

<P>
 On an oinker scale of 1 to 10 -- 10 being that mythical guy who willingly 
cleans the house and does the laundry, all before bringing you breakfast in bed 
-- I'd give my husband a solid 7. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he does help around the house (when he's reminded), he's very 
supportive and, most important, he's a great dad. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one's perfect. And when it comes to Steve's movie-viewing habits, well, 
only one word comes to mind: Neanderthal . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm one of those women who thought one of the bonuses of marriage would be 
that I'd always have a steady date for the movies. There we'd be, his arm 
lovingly draped over my shoulder while we sat cuddled in a darkened movie 
theater munching popcorn and watching some great flick. 
</P>
<P>
 Or we'd be at home, curled up on a sofa, a fire blazing, the lights low, 
sharing one of those great movie classics, such as "It Happened One Night" or 
"Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 What could I have possibly been thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 I used to feel sorry for women sitting alone in a movie theater. Now I know 
the truth. Chances are the woman is alone not because she couldn't get a date. 
She's probably sans partner because her other half refuses to see any movie 
that doesn't feature sneering he-men karate-kicking their way to saving a world 
threatened by bloody and massive destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of movies I have missed because Steve thinks they're just for girls 
is a who's who of the Academy Awards. Before marriage, I could have been a 
voting member of the Academy. I'd see every nominated film -- even the foreign 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Now? Well, let's just say watching the Academy Awards is not what it used to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say Steve is without his reasons for refusing to see movies such 
as "Steel Magnolias." (Him: "Why would I want to see a movie about the South? I 
grew up there.") Or "Driving Miss Daisy." (Him: "Who wants to see a movie about 
some guy driving some woman around?") Or "The Piano." (Him: "You expect me to 
pay to see Holly Hunter not talk?") "Thelma and Louise"? Didn't even suggest 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, I know the real reason he won't see those movies. Not enough blood, 
guts, action, suspense. No Terminator, Exterminator, Schwarzenegger or 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Chuck Norris. We have some friends who were lucky enough to be invited to 
attend a State Dinner at the White House a few years ago. I wanted to hear the 
important details: Who wore what, who sat next to whom, who ate what and who 
embarrassed whom. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Steve care for any of that? Not a chance. He found out that Chuck Norris 
was on the guest list and spent the rest of the evening telling our friends 
what they should have said to "good ol' Chuck" about every movie he ever 
starred in. 
</P>
<P>
 But what do you expect from a guy who planned, as a birthday surprise, to take 
his wife to see a University of Tennessee football game? (Him: "But, honey, 
they play at the second-largest college football stadium in the country !") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This same guy believes that the greatest movie ever made was "The Package." 
Never seen it? I have. Dozens of times. Even with featuring roles by three of 
the sexiest guys on film -- Gene Hackman, Tommy Lee Jones and Dennis Franz of 
"NYPD Blue" -- I inevitably fall asleep before the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it's a bad movie. It's just not a great one. It's certainly not the 
kind of movie worth renting over and over.  
</P>
<P>
 And yet Steve has the nerve to tease me mercilessly each Christmas for 
searching the TV listings lest I miss any showing of "It's a Wonderful Life," 
"White Christmas" and "Miracle on 34th Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Now I don't want you to think this marriage can't be saved. I'll happily watch 
"The Fugitive" or "In the Line of Fire," and Steve went willingly to "Sleepless 
in Seattle" and "The Paper." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, we've given up trying to reconcile our differences 
on the subject. And you know what? It doesn't matter. If blood and guts make 
him happy, so be it.  
</P>
<P>
 Most important, I've learned one lesson. The next time I go to a movie and see 
some woman happily munching popcorn -- alone -- I'll know she's probably there 
by choice. And she will probably be me.

<P>
 There are two kinds of people in this world: Movers and shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows a few movers -- the folks who can't settle in an apartment or 
house. We're talking serial offenders here. For a mover, the other side of town 
is always greener. 
</P>
<P>
 A shaker, on the other hand, develops nervous tics and quaking hands whenever 
mover friends start scanning the classifieds. 
</P>
<P>
 Call movers the floating debris of a restless generation. Call them the lost 
children of Romany, with strains of Gypsy blood. Be afraid to call them back. 
</P>
<P>
 You can tell which category you fall into by whether you return the phone 
messages that start like this: "Hi. I know we haven't talked in awhile, but I'm 
having this moving party on Saturday. It should be really fun. Do you still 
have that truck?" 
</P>
<P>
 Movers return the call, if they aren't switching habitats themselves that 
weekend, knowing that they will need the same help someday. Shakers go looking 
for that note from their chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some say moving is a sport of the young. Age, possessions and 
contentedness slow us down. But even the young wonder sometimes -- as they pack 
boxes, lug refrigerators, sign leases for apartments just blocks away -- why 
are we compelled to move?  
</P>
<P>
 It's the adventure of finding new homes, movers say, discovering the unique 
qualities of a different neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, those adventurers may have a problem maintaining 
interpersonal relationships, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People move as a way to clean up and clean out their lives, and that includes 
cleaning out the emotional shelves," says Barbara Cadow, an adjunct professor 
of psychology at USC who also sees plenty of restless patients in her private 
Westside practice.  
</P>
<P>
 "But it's also a way to avoid interpersonal relationships. Every time you 
move, you lose people -- like all your old neighbors. So moving gives people an 
excuse not to work out their interpersonal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the reasons are simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Druiff looks back fondly on the days when she and her husband were more 
footloose. They now have a 4-year-old daughter and 5-year-old mortgage in 
Huntington Beach, but there was a day when they moved simply because mold was 
building up in the closets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rush -- just the idea of throwing everything up in the air and 
starting over," Druiff says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanliness is a draw for some repeat movers. Frequently, your home is never 
as clean as when you first moved in -- when professionals had just been there 
with paint and stiff brushes, scrubbing in the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has lived in a place for more than five years knows about the 
strange accumulation of . . . things . . . that comes with stability. Except 
for the brave few who execute spring cleaning with a vengeance, most everyone 
has stacks of paper, old toys and mementos, a collection of jars and lidless 
Tupperware lurking in cupboards and closets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to move because I don't want to see all the stuff I've got 
stored away," Cadow says. 
</P>
<P>
 To move, she says, is to steam-clean both our souls and our stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking through history, we can easily spot a nomadic strain in just about 
every culture. 
</P>
<P>
 From the tribes who crossed the Bering Strait land bridge into this continent, 
to traders bringing noodles from China to Italy, the movers have been a source 
of cultural regeneration. They bring foreign perspectives to homebound 
citizens. They offer new ideas, fresh energy. 
</P>
<P>
 They give a pain in the lower back to friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 In modern society, the nomadic subculture really began, Cadow says, after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "As corporations expanded, they moved workers all over the country," she says. 
"Nobody thought about what dislocation did to families -- executives, 
especially, were expected to tough it out." 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1950s, the system of extended families, born on the farm, was rapidly 
dissolving. Without roots, there was little reason to remain in one place. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving, even across town, became socially accepted. Some people got hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Zayra Cabot, a 32-year-old assistant to a television producer, was one of 
those for whom moving became a kind of drug. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving Cleveland, she lived 10 months in Tucson, a year in Phoenix and 
then came to Los Angeles. And for four years, she moved about every six months. 
There was an apartment and two guest houses in Hollywood, then the San Fernando 
Valley, Glendale, back to the Valley . . . she gets lost reciting the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to the point that every six months, a clock went off in my body or my 
mind and I would be in that moving mode," Cabot says.  
</P>
<P>
 Cabot relates this with a kind of glee, remembering her glorious rootlessness. 
But when confronted with Cadow's analysis of frequent movers -- an inability to 
connect with others or resolve interpersonal conflicts -- her mood plummets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, maybe I was running away," Cabot acknowledges. She might have been 
trying to shake Cleveland (understandable) and an old boyfriend, she says. He 
made the first few moves with Cabot, but the hopscotching she did without him 
-- well, she was probably still running from the memory, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabot has lived in the same place for three years now and figures she will 
stay. But she did have to fight the urge, 2 1/2 years ago, to scan the 
classifieds for new rental listings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I've been where I am. I feel more stable," Cabot says. "Besides, 
I've found out that if you're filling out applications, it doesn't look good if 
you're moving every six months." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cadow advises patients who have trouble settling down to create a sense of 
home wherever they live. Paint the rooms a new color, buy things you like, 
invite friends over, she tells them. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is that if you can embrace your home, you might be able to throw your 
arms around a few people and forge lasting relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years spent helping the rootless souls who skip from one home to 
another, Cadow is willing to admit that there are some who forgo stability but 
aren't necessarily in need of extensive therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people just need more stimulation," Cadow says. "It's hard for them to 
feel content." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a dog walking circles over its bed before lying down, movers need to 
tread over the landscape, try different positions and neighborhoods, before 
getting comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Druiff has settled down in Huntington Beach, she looks back on her 
moving days as a search for the right nest.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you keep moving until you find the right place -- or moving wears you 
out," she says. "Then you make do with the nest you've got."

PROGRAM URGES STUDENTS TO 'ASPIRE TO BE MORE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLEN JUSTICE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some immediately raised their hands to protest. Others just shifted in their 
chairs. But everybody in the Westchester High School classroom groaned as guest 
speaker Arthur Richardson announced the next assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were to come to class dressed up in preparation for a four-minute 
mock job interview. That meant no sneakers, baggies or halter tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be anything you want to be," said Richardson, who works for the 
Boston Co., a mortgage lender. "If you sell yourself short and allow someone to 
dictate to you what you can do, you will never reach your true goals. It's not 
enough to say you are working at McDonald's. What's wrong with owning 
McDonald's? Aspire to be more than what your job calls for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to know you can go out there and get a job. This is not going to 
be easy. You can't just go through the motions. You have to be a part of it. 
But I promise that at the end of 10 weeks, all of us are going to feel a lot 
better about ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The class is Education and Career Planning, a graduation requirement for high 
school students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Richardson was 
brought in as a guest lecturer for 10 weeks as part of the district's First 
Break program, designed to bring professionals into the classroom to teach and 
ease students' transition from school to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The program reflects a trend nationwide as schools offer classes with a 
psychological bent to counter violence, drug abuse and other growing problems.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, there are few new programs offered on a districtwide basis 
beyond those that deal with drug awareness, said LAUSD administrator Phil 
Nassief. Rather, teachers at individual high schools have sponsored 
extracurricular support groups dealing with grief, gangs and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In his classes, Richardson hopes to arm students with the skills necessary to 
get a job. He addresses dress, applications and such interviewing basics as eye 
contact and shaking hands. Dressed in a suit and tie himself, Richardson does 
not soft-pedal his message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty (percent) to 40% of getting a job is how you look," he told his class. 
"Nobody is going to hire you if they are afraid of you. Nobody is going to give 
you a job if you look like you are going to hang out with the fellows. The 
fellows aren't hiring." 
</P>
<P>
 Ula Pendleton, the teacher who invited Richardson to class, said she supports 
his confrontational style. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is able to tell the students a lot of things that I would like to," she 
said. "But it works better when he says it. He gets under their skin because he 
tells them things they need to be told. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some students came to me and said he had an attitude. But I told them he is 
like a parent. He cares too much, and I do too."  
</P>
<P>
 Some students were taken aback. "It's a little insulting," said Hakim Allen, a 
senior. "He generalizes about all of us. . . . I know I'm not unmotivated." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, such as freshman Trisha Jenkins, said the practical information 
Richardson gives out is useful. "I had no idea I had to put together a resume 
at all, so it's helping me," she said.

ADVICE FROM FREQUENT MOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the rare person who doesn't move at least once in a lifetime. Most of us 
face the drill of packing everything we own a few times in our adult lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For amateur movers, getting all that stuff organized and into boxes can be a 
daunting task. So we've found some professional help for you. What follows are 
the helpful directions of nomads and paid movers, including a place called I 
Love to Move in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * When looking for a new apartment or house, don't rely on advertised 
promises. Turn on faucets, light switches, garbage disposals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check out the neighborhood more than once. Do loud parties begin every night 
at 9? Will you feel comfortable after dark? 
</P>
<P>
 * If it's a rental, check the premises carefully and write down everything 
that's damaged. Give a copy to your landlord within a week of moving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't pack jewels or valuable papers in a box. Keep them in a purse or bag 
with you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using a professional moving company? Ask for prices, including a maximum 
quote, in writing. Ask a mover to come by your home and look around to give a 
more accurate price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take one room at a time, pull out everything that lurks in drawers and 
closets. Be unsentimental about throwing out less-than-useful items. Impose 
organization on the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have plenty of boxes on hand -- either found or purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 * When packing, you may want to take out your dresser drawers, wrap favorite 
breakables in the clothing, cover each drawer with cardboard and tape firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pack everything that can't walk on its own. Even houseplants can go into 
lidless boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Label every box with its contents and destination. 
</P>
<P>
 * If friends and their trucks are helping you move, rent a hand truck or dolly 
for the larger items (refrigerators and the like). Your friends' backs will 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure everything is packed when the muscle arrives. Food and drink 
should be waiting. Thank your friends loudly and often. EMILY ADAMS

THE 3 HS AND 3 RS OF RECONCILIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In working with couples of all sexual orientations, Santa Monica psychiatrist 
Dr. Mark Goulston has devised a kind of alphabet guide to conflict resolution. 
He breaks the process down into what he calls the three Hs and the three Rs. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Goulston said, a person feels injured and hurt . Next comes a feeling 
of hate , where "you are so infuriated at someone who betrays such a deep level 
of trust, someone you thought of as an ally who now seems like an adversary." 
As a consequence, reaching reconciliation means working through a sense of 
hesitation , or reluctance to renegotiate the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 To get past these hurdles, one must first feel remorse , meaning, Goulston 
said, "a sense that they feel hurt at having hurt you. You have to be able to 
see the apology in their eyes." Restitution means a demonstrable, tangible 
signal that shows some degree of sacrifice. Finally, there must be signs of 
rehabilitation , which in Goulston's view means that "the person who has 
inflicted the most harm has to on at least three other occasions show a 
different behavior." ELIZABETH MEHREN

CAN WE ALL GET ALONG?

 As director of the Harvard Negotiation Project and author of "Beyond 
Machiavelli: Tools for Coping With Conflict" and other top-selling books on 
mediation, Roger Fisher usually spends his time counseling government officials 
and corporate leaders about how to get along with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the same principles apply in reconciling family crises, Fisher 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He advises couples to begin with a premise of unconditional communication -- 
"that is, you want to listen and talk without preconditions." Take the "oughts" 
out of all dialogue of this kind, Fisher suggests. And sit beside one another, 
not opposite, where confrontations are likely to seem magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 A useful tool in reconciling any difference, Fisher says, involves taking a 
pad of yellow paper and, on the right side, writing down exactly what the other 
person said. On the left side, "write what you assume they were thinking." 
Similarly, Fisher reduces misunderstandings by using a "ladder of inference," 
which is basically a sophisticated version of the children's game of telephone 
where a message is passed from person to person. In this exercise, "one person 
tells the other, 'when you said so-and-so, I interpreted it to mean 
such-and-such.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher also urges individuals to speak only for themselves, "to talk about the 
effect on me, as in 'when that happened, I felt demeaned and put down,' not 
'you put me down.' " ELIZABETH MEHREN

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
ONE GROUP'S APPROACH: TAP NATURE'S WONDERS

 Southern California's natural beauty is legendary, seen by millions nationwide 
in everything from car commercials to movies. But for many urban families who 
have limited incomes and transportation options, the miles of coastline -- more 
than 4 million acres of national forest and 25 million acres of desert that are 
within a 90-minute drive from the most densely populated areas -- may as well 
be a Hollywood illusion. Enter Nursery Nature Walks, a group determined to 
provide wilderness programs for young children, parents, educators and extended 
families. Since 1985, scores of the group's volunteers have used workshops, 
walks and classes to introduce more than 10,000 children and parents each year 
to parks and wilderness areas throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
Walks for low-income and disabled children are funded by membership fees and 
donations. In the past three years, Nursery Nature Walks has increased its 
support to these children by 60% and developed workshops for their teachers and 
child-care providers to show that nature activities and projects are as close 
as a neighborhood tree, sidewalk crack or snail. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE: Broadway

 More than 200 trained volunteers organize workshops, walks and classes at 50 
locations in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The "walk leaders" conduct 
wilderness activities after completing eight, three-hour classes. During class, 
experts instruct volunteers in trail safety and first aid, nature-oriented 
children's games, songs and activities, local animal and plant identification, 
geology and Native American culture. A SAMPLE ACTIVITY 
</P>
<P>
 Nursery Nature Walk volunteers spent five years creating "Trails, Tails & 
Tidepools in Pails," a nationally acclaimed, award-winning book filled with 
dozens of simple, illustrated nature activities for parents, educators, child 
care workers or other adults to do with their young children. Here's a sample 
activity that finds an artistic use for a gardener's nemesis: 
</P>
<P>
 BORROW SEVERAL SNAILS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO 
</P>
<P>
 Place them on a piece of black construction paper, then watch the patterns 
they leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Gently touch them as their art take shape 
</P>
<P>
 Pluck your snails off the paper after several minutes, and let them go home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the paper up to the sun and enjoy the painting you've helped the snails 
create. TO GET INVOLVED 
</P>
<P>
