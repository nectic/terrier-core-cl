A FRIEND IN NEED; QUAKE VICTIM'S RESCUER HELPS HIM PICK UP PIECES OF HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Six months ago, Los Angeles Police Department reserve officer Don Stein helped 
rescue Steve Langdon from beneath the collapsed roof of the quake-wracked 
Northridge Meadows Apartments. Now Stein is the only thing keeping a roof over 
Langdon's head. 
</P>
<P>
 With about $20,000 in debts from the Northridge earthquake, Langdon is again 
counting on his savior's help to survive -- staying rent-free in Stein's Van 
Nuys home while trying to recover financially from the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides just being somebody that rescued me, we have turned out to be 
friends," said Langdon, 46. "There's a bond there. He was there to help me get 
back on my feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Stein, who heard Langdon's weak cry for help on Jan. 17, mind 
answering the call for help again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so lucky to be alive," said Stein, a 36-year-old mechanic at a Panorama 
City auto shop. "I want this guy to think there's still hope left in the world. 
That somebody cares." 
</P>
<P>
 The bond between the two men developed during a brief but emotion-laden 
encounter at the collapsed Northridge apartment complex Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer trouble-shooter working for a Van Nuys sportswear company, Langdon 
awoke at 4:30 that morning, about half an hour before normally getting ready 
for work. Unable to go back to sleep, Langdon rose from his bed to brew some 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute later, his world collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The second floor of the complex dropped onto his ceiling, which crumpled onto 
his bed. Pinned between a dresser, the bed and the ceiling, Langdon feebly 
called for help. His roommate, 67-year-old Jerry Prezioso, was trapped several 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hours later, Stein heard their cries and pinpointed them for 
firefighters, who used air bags to lift off the concrete, stucco and wood 
encasing them. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken collarbone, collapsed lung and five fractured ribs kept Langdon in 
the hospital through February, during which time he and Prezioso, who suffered 
leg and stomach injuries, were reunited with Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso returned to his job as a Budget-Rent-A-Car employee, but Langdon did 
not go back to work until June 6, after five months recuperating with his 
family and girlfriend in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 But Langdon's finances suffered while he was away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FEMA gave him $2,300, that money was used for living expenses in 
Reno. His share of medical bills after insurance topped $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I had to come back to was my job," said Langdon, who returned 
to the San Fernando Valley with hardly more than a sackful of clothes tossed in 
his Chevy Blazer. "I didn't really have the money to move in anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Stein had kept in touch. Hearing of Langdon's plight, he offered 
his three-bedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon agreed. In return, he buys groceries, takes out the trash and keeps 
the place clean. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more than just housecleaning that makes Stein appreciate 
Langdon's company. "I see a guy who's been through such a trauma and has such a 
zest for life," Stein said. "To see that come out of a guy, that's something. 
He makes me smile just to be around him." 
</P>
<P>
 The feelings are mutual, Langdon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon is hopeful that changes will happen soon. Some of his next paycheck 
will go toward rent at Stein's home. He also hopes that FEMA will give him more 
money to replace his property still wedged into Northridge Meadows.. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I repay somebody who has been at the right place at the right time 
and heard you yelling for help?" Langdon said. "There's no way I can repay 
anybody for that. All I can do is have him hopefully understand how grateful I 
am."

LAWYER'S AWARD BEARS WITNESS TO HIS TENACITY; JUSTICE: CRUSADE FOR PROTECTION 
FOR THOSE TESTIFYING IN COURT BRINGS HIM A TOP LEGAL HONOR AND GRATITUDE FROM 
SLAIN TEEN-AGER'S MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tenacity pays off. The two engraved plaques presented this week to Los Angeles 
lawyer Raymond P. Boucher bear witness to that. 
</P>
<P>
 One is from Lula Wallace, thanking Boucher for spending 10 years on a lawsuit 
stemming from the 1983 slaying of her daughter as the teen-ager prepared to 
testify in a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is from a national public interest law group that has named Boucher 
its lawyer of the year for winning the case -- and prompting changes in police 
procedures that could help save witnesses' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The award from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice came Tuesday in ceremonies in 
Chicago. Wallace's came in a gaily wrapped birthday present that was unwrapped 
Thursday in Boucher's West Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't wait to open the box," said Boucher, who turns 37 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boucher has plenty of patience when it comes to law cases. His 
precedent-setting case, Wallace vs. the City of Los Angeles, proves that. 
</P>
<P>
 He took it on in 1983 after several other attorneys shrugged off Wallace's 
claim that her daughter died because a Los Angeles police detective failed to 
warn her that her life was in danger because she was a murder witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen-year-old Demetria Wallace was killed by a shotgun blast as she sat on 
a bench waiting for a bus five days before she was scheduled to testify against 
a man accused of fatally shooting a taxi driver. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been a high school honors student who was studying criminology at Los 
Angeles City College. She was leaving a dental office where her boyfriend 
worked when cabdriver Kimbrough Foley was shot in an adjoining alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace reported the shooting to police and agreed to testify after 
authorities charged Grant Christon, 22, with the murder. But soon after her 
name appeared as a witness on police reports that were provided to Christon's 
lawyer, police said, Wallace received a death threat. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Lula Wallace alleged that Police Detective Donald Richards 
told her daughter not to worry about the threat. The young woman was in no 
danger, she said Richard had related, because Christon was behind bars and 
there were many other witnesses prepared to testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, Demetria Wallace was the only witness in the murder case. "The one 
person standing between Grant Christon living and dying was Demetria," Boucher 
said Thursday. "That made her a sitting duck." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Demetria Wallace's testimony, the case fell apart. A short time after 
her murder, charges against Christon were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police eventually arrested Christon's twin brother, Kent Christon, on 
suspicion of killing Wallace. But that case also collapsed when no witnesses to 
her slaying stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher spent five years preparing the Wallace lawsuit before it went to trial 
in 1989. But after a week in court, Superior Court Judge Leon Savage took the 
case out of the jury's hands and ruled in the city's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in tears," Boucher recalled. Lula Wallace put her arms around him and 
thanked him for trying. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the case to the state Court of Appeal in late 1992 and argued that the 
death of Demetria Wallace showed the value of fearless witnesses -- and the 
debt society pays when there are fearful ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling issued early last year, the appellate court agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The city tried without success to get the state Supreme Court to overturn that 
ruling. Last March, as Boucher prepared to go back to the lower court to again 
press Lula Wallace's suit, the city agreed to settle for $730,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The precedent set by the case is important, said Arthur Bryant, executive 
director of Washington-based Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was an excellent example of a lawyer dedicating an extraordinary 
amount of time to a case advancing the public interest," Bryant said Thursday. 
"Far too often, cases with big dollars are the ones that get attention. But 
this case makes a big difference to society as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police have already reacted to the Wallace case. Last year they 
issued a bulletin advising officers to properly warn witnesses of potential 
threats to their safety. Soon, Lt. John Dunkin said Thursday, the department 
will publish a "special order" for officers, expanding on the issue of warning 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula Wallace -- whose plaque will soon be placed on Boucher's office wall, 
right next to the trial lawyers' plaque -- was thrilled by the national award. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times I sort of gave up, but Ray wouldn't," she said Thursday. 
"It's a matter of justice. People shouldn't be afraid to get involved."

FEMA OKS MORE FUNDS FOR REPAIRS AT COLISEUM; EARTHQUAKE: THE ESTIMATED COSTS 
REACH $58 MILLION. THE PLANNED SEPT. 3 REOPENING IS CALLED AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Top officials of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum rushed to Washington to 
inform federal authorities Thursday that earthquake repair costs at the stadium 
could reach $58 million, and they came away with assurance of continued federal 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The $58-million repair estimate -- which represents the third increase since 
the original estimate of $35 million after the Jan. 17 earthquake -- was 
reported to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and to the White House by 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the Coliseum 
Commission's president, and Don C. Webb, director of the stadium's repair 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before Burke arrived at the White House for a meeting with John 
Emerson, adviser to President Clinton on earthquake problems, and then dinner 
with the President, a ranking FEMA official told the Los Angeles emissaries 
what they wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Krimm, FEMA associate director for response and recovery, said the agency 
this week is committing an additional $11 million to the Coliseum repair 
project, bringing the amount obligated so far to $44 million. He indicated that 
after further review, the rest of the 90% federal share for the project's costs 
will be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's very important that, as a symbol of the earthquake recovery, the 
Coliseum open on time, and we're going to continue to do everything we can to 
work with the Coliseum Commission and local government to achieve that result," 
Krimm said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is responsible for a 10% share, which Gov. Pete Wilson has committed 
to paying after the federal contribution is received. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke attributed the increase in repair costs in part to building-code 
upgrades that city inspectors have required, including a sprinkler system in 
the upper concourse of the stadium and elaborate new electric power facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Krimm said FEMA understands why the cost has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with earthquake damage," he said, "is you look at the outside of 
the building and you come up with an estimate. But when you tear things apart, 
you find the damage is much greater and that everything is going to be much 
more expensive. You certainly have to bring things up to code." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said one matter also discussed at the White House on Thursday was 
federal participation by a high official in the Coliseum's reopening ceremonies 
at the USC-Washington game Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, the primary reason that she traveled to Washington was that 
the federal money actually available to pay for Coliseum repairs had dipped to 
$200,000, and she had become concerned that the many minority contractors 
participating in the work would not be paid on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had to make sure we didn't end up embarrassed at not being able to 
pay for the work that was being done," she said. "That's why I went there." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he considers the Coliseum project, which now will cost nearly twice 
as much as repair of the Santa Monica Freeway, "a metaphor for the 
revitalization of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we open on Sept. 3, we'll be doing what many people said was impossible, 
and we could do it only with help from FEMA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb in January estimated repair costs at $35 million. He raised that 
assessment on June 1 to $42 million. On June 28, Burke said it would reach $50 
million. The new $58-million estimate by Burke and Webb came just a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the massive construction site Thursday showed that much remains to 
be done before the projected opening. Burke acknowledged that considerable 
detail work will be done for two months after Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 A 600- to 800-person work force is toiling around the clock at the facility. 
Much has been achieved since the earthquake, but with only 36 days remaining 
until USC's home opener, and 44 days until the Raiders open against Seattle, 
major tasks remain to be finished. 
</P>
<P>
 On the upper concourse level, restrooms are still without fixtures. Some 
interior walkways, where concession areas are still being rebuilt, reverberate 
with the sound of jackhammers. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, on the north side of the Coliseum, heavy construction vehicles rumble 
over barren ground and muddy puddles, in the shadow of giant cranes. Part of 
the earthen berm on which the stadium rests has not been replaced, and 
landscaping has not begun. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coliseum's trademark peristyle end, scaffolds are still in place and 
most reinforcing concrete remains to be poured. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seating areas, several thousand seats have been unbolted from their 
concrete anchors and lie about, awaiting completion of repairs to the 
underlying superstructure.

16 RESIGN FROM RLA BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first major exodus of RLA board members, 16 community leaders -- 
including Police Chief Willie L. Williams, City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas 
and Southern California Edison Chairman John Bryson -- have resigned from the 
nonprofit rebuilding agency formed after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, RLA, initially known as Rebuild L.A., has added 10 new board 
members, bringing the membership of the already massive board of directors to 
87. 
</P>
<P>
 The new members are Japanese Business Assn. President Kazunori Amano, Deputy 
Los Angeles Police Chief Ronald C. Banks, Food 4 Less Chairman Ronald Burkle, 
contractor David Honda, Southern California Edison Vice President Mike Mendez, 
Black Business Assn. Chairwoman Mary Ann Mitchell, Walt Disney consumer 
products senior Vice President Nancy Rahnasto, pastor and religious broadcaster 
Gene Scott, Los Angeles Business Journal associate publisher Matt Toledo and 
city Councilwoman Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sveral of those who have decided to leave the agency, including Ridley-Thomas 
and Warner Bros. senior Vice President Daniel P. Garcia, have long voiced 
dissatisfaction with the lack of progress by RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said Thursday that he decided to resign even though he supports 
RLA President Linda Griego, who took over leadership of the organization this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never wanted a preponderance of elected officials on the board and Mrs. 
Walters represents the South Los Angeles community as well," Ridley-Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego said the new members are "sure to strengthen the economic development 
efforts of RLA" and that most departing members are being replaced by people 
doing similar work. 
</P>
<P>
 Those leaving the board include American Savings Bank Chairman Mario Antoci, 
Hughes Aircraft Co. Chairman C. Michael Armstrong, attorney T.S. Chung (who has 
moved to Washington to work for the Clinton Administration), Metropolitan 
Theaters Corp. President Bruce Corwin, Pueblo del Rio Housing resident site 
coordinator Annie Mae Curry, boxer Oscar De La Hoya, pastor William Epps, city 
librarian Elizabeth Martinez, Southern California Gas Co. President Warren I. 
Mitchell, actor Edward James Olmos, Union Bank President Tamotsu Yamaguchi and 
developer Ira Yellin. PAUL FELDMAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-HEAD OF 
JOBS AGENCY INDICTED ON 34 CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury Thursday returned a 34-count indictment against the 
former director of an El Monte agency that receives up to $3 million annually 
in federal job-training funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, charges Douglas 
L. Shaw with conspiracy, embezzlement, tampering with witnesses and obstructing 
a federal investigation, among other allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, 50, headed Mid-Valley Manpower Consortium, a job-training agency, from 
1979 until he was suspended earlier this year after a preliminary county audit 
of the agency's records revealed several questionable practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's attorney, Arthur Lindars, said he had not seen the indictment. However, 
"if the allegations are as I expect they are, he can expect to be found 
innocent of the majority of them. I don't think there was any criminal intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Shaw, who is in custody, would be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment alleges that he conspired to embezzle and convert federal funds 
by intercepting checks payable to Mid-Valley and depositing them into secret 
accounts. Other charges allege that Shaw used consortium credit cards for 
personal purposes, misapplied funds by paying the salaries of people who were 
not employed by Mid-Valley, and misled investigators by ordering employees to 
lie and falsify documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium funds came from the federal Job Training Partnership Act, which 
was passed by Congress to help prepare youths, unskilled adults and the 
economically disadvantaged to learn job skills.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; CHARGES 
SOUGHT AGAINST FORMER CEMETERY OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State cemetery officials have asked legal authorities to initiate criminal and 
civil action against the former owner of a historic Long Beach graveyard who is 
accused of having misspent more than $600,000 from the cemetery's endowment 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Cemetery Board asked the attorney general's office to begin civil 
proceedings against Dean A. Dempsey for allegedly mishandling the account.The 
board also urged civil action against Dempsey's former wife, Debra Dempsey; his 
parents, Nelson Dempsey and Shirley Husbands, and a stockbroker, Bill Notrica. 
The parents had been trustees of the endowment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has also asked the Los Angeles County district attorney to file 
grand theft charges against Dean Dempsey, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Cemetery board officials began investigating the accounts at Sunnyside 
Cemetery after receiving complaints that the site had fallen into disrepair. 
The investigation determined that Dempsey had spent endowment care funds to 
lease a Mercedes, make alimony payments to his former wife and to pay tabs at 
local bars and restaurants. The endowment fund, which once totaled more than $1 
million, was supposed to remain intact, with the interest used to cover 
cemetery expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey has denied the charges, saying he used the money to maintain the 
graveyard after he developed terminal lung cancer and could no longer do the 
job himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery is the final resting place of some of Long Beach's most prominent 
historical figures.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ROSEMEAD; MAN SLAIN 
WHILE HELPING CONFRONT BURGLARY SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An El Monte man was killed Wednesday night and his brother was wounded as they 
tried to help the owner of a Rosemead tavern confront possible burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 David Valenzuela, 37, was pronounced dead at San Gabriel Valley Medical Center 
shortly after the 11:30 p.m. shooting outside Critters Bar at 9322 E. Valley 
Blvd.Valenzuela's brother Clyde, 34, was in fair condition with a bullet wound 
to the upper body, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when bar owner Herbert Finley, 58, went into the parking 
lot of his tavern and spotted three men in a blue pickup. Finley apparently 
thought that one of the men in the truck had been involved in the burglary of 
his bar about four months earlier, sheriff's spokeswoman Benita Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley went back inside to elicit the help of the Valenzuela brothers. As the 
three men approached the truck, one of the men inside fired a handgun, striking 
Clyde Valenzuela in the upper body. As the truck pulled out of the parking lot, 
David Valenzuela ran after it and was gunned down in the street. Finley was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 An empty semiautomatic handgun was found at the scene.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ALLRED 
HIRED BY WOMAN IN RECOVERED MEMORY LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening a new chapter in a widely watched dispute over recovered memory 
therapy, Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred has been hired by a woman who 
claims that she forgot and later remembered that her father had raped her when 
she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The move marks the latest twist in the battle between Gary Ramona, a former 
top executive at a Napa Valley winery, and his daughter Holly, a graduate 
student at Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Gary Ramona won $475,000 after a Napa County Superior Court jury 
concluded that two Orange County therapists and a hospital had reinforced false 
memories of sexual abuse in his daughter's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict was hailed by critics of recovered memory therapy -- one of the 
most divisive issues confronting the mental health community -- and was said to 
mark the first time a non-patient had successfully sued a therapist for 
malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Allred is representing Holly Ramona in round two of the battle -- a civil 
lawsuit seeking damages for the alleged abuse. Holly Ramona contends that she 
had no recollection of being raped until age 19, when she had vivid flashbacks 
during therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 She first sued her father in 1990, charging that he molested her repeatedly 
between the ages of 5 and 8. In a newly amended version of the lawsuit, she 
claims the abuse lasted much longer -- until age 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred is a veteran of celebrated cases, many of them involving women. In 
1992, she helped a client win $500,000 in a similar lawsuit involving repressed 
memories. That award was one of the first under a change in state law that 
allows victims who claim they have retrieved buried memories to sue years after 
the alleged crime occurred.

TRANSIT PANEL MEMBER LEAVES AMID SHAKE-UP; GOVERNMENT: RYAN SNYDER IS THE FIRST 
RIORDAN APPOINTEE TO PUBLICLY SAY HE WAS ASKED HIM TO STEP DOWN BECAUSE HE 
DIFFERED WITH MAYOR'S AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's commission appointees resigned 
Thursday, saying he was asked to step down because he was not supportive enough 
of Riordan's plan for turning some city services over to private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of Ryan Snyder from the city's Transportation Commission is 
the latest in a reorganization by the Riordan Administration designed to 
refocus the mayor's agenda as he enters his second year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder is the first appointee to publicly say that he was asked to leave 
because of philosophical differences with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riordan spokesperson conceded that there had been differences with Snyder, a 
Westwood urban planner, but denied that he left solely because of 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said trouble for him began last month when the Transportation 
Commission recommended a pilot project that would put parking enforcement on 
the Westside in the hands of a private firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he supported the concept in order to allow a comparison of the 
efficiency of public and private workers. But he asked for an amendment to the 
proposal guaranteeing that the private firms would pay their employees wages 
and benefits competitive with those offered by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Efficiency is deploying your forces better, using better equipment and 
finding legitimate ways of saving money," Snyder said Thursday. "Efficiency is 
not simply paying people lower wages and benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission adopted some of Synder's suggestions, but he cast the lone vote 
against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has said that he believes private firms should be allowed to compete, 
but not by paying lower wages. One member of Riordan's staff said Thursday that 
is still the mayor's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who did not want to be identified, said Snyder's departure had 
more to do with his inability to work with other commission and staff members. 
"He was just not a team player," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a union representative said Snyder's ouster indicates that Riordan is not 
prepared to make private companies compete "on a level playing field," with 
equivalent wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the mayor really wants just his way, why don't we have just one member on 
the commission, who agrees with him?" said Julie Butcher, spokeswoman for the 
Service Employees International Union Local 347. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he was asked by Deputy Mayor Rae James to resign. "She said I 
wasn't in sync. I asked what they meant by that and she mentioned the parking 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, Snyder led efforts to simplify the permit process for the 
taxi industry and helped make more wheelchair-accessible cabs available.

FORMER PTA PRESIDENT CLEARED IN MURDER CASE; COURTS: BABY-SITTER DEBRA CUMMINGS 
IS ACQUITTED IN THE DEATH OF A 9-MONTH-OLD BOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former PTA president from Reseda charged with murdering a 9-month-old boy 
placed in her care was acquitted Thursday in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In an abrupt climax to a retrial that had focused national attention on the 
quality and affordability of child care, a jury deliberated seven hours before 
acquitting Debra Suzanne Cummings, 36, of second-degree murder, voluntary 
manslaughter and child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings earlier had been cleared of manslaughter charges in the death of a 
14-month-old boy in her care. 
</P>
<P>
 As the verdicts were read, Cummings shook with excitement and cried out: "Oh!" 
She laid her head down on the table, embraced her attorney and sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can leave," Judge Michael J. Farrell told her. She bolted from her chair 
and yelled to family and friends: "We're going home!" 
</P>
<P>
 On her way to the elevator, she amended that, shouting out: "We're going to 
Disneyland!" Surrounded by well-wishers, she insisted she was serious: "We may 
stay there the next three days." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the way down in the elevator, Cummings hugged her 10-year-old 
daughter, Megan, and said quietly: "It's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, after four years and two trials, are the charges. The verdict, however, 
leaves unresolved the underlying mystery: How did 9-month-old Kevin Young die? 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, president of the PTA at Shirley Avenue Elementary School, had 
advertised "Loving Child Care in My Home" for $75 per week. She has admitted 
repeatedly that she ran an unlicensed baby-sitting service.  
</P>
<P>
 On June 15, 1990, she was baby-sitting Kevin. The next day, he died from 
severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended that Cummings attacked the boy, but she maintained that 
the child exacerbated a prior injury. 
</P>
<P>
 At her first trial, which ended last July, a jury deadlocked after eight 
contentious days of deliberations 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Carol Fisch pressed for a retrial. Cummings complained that she was 
a victim of coincidence and the target of a vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother, Toni Majoy-Young, testified in February before a 
congressional subcommittee investigating the availability of quality child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a judge dismissed manslaughter charges against Cummings in an 
unrelated case, saying there was no evidence of foul play in the March, 1990, 
death of 14-month-old Matthew Cooley. He died after an apparent seizure while 
she was baby-sitting him in a park. 
</P>
<P>
 At the retrial, which began two weeks ago, Farrell barred any mention of 
Cooley's death, ruling that it would be too prejudicial. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young told jurors that Kevin was "alive and well" when she dropped him 
off. That afternoon, after picking him up, she said, "I was screaming at him 
the entire time I was in the car. I said, 'Kevin, wake up. It's mom. Wake up! 
Wake up!' And he never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings testified that she never would have hurt the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Deputy Public Defender Tamar Rachel Toister, contended that the 
injury did not occur at Cummings' home and that, in some cases, symptoms of 
head injuries do not occur for hours or even days. Many doctors testified about 
the causes and effects of head injuries. One said that the injury could have 
been 36 hours old when Kevin was dropped off at Cummings' house.

MISSING CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 4:15 p.m. July 17, the dread of all parents occurred to us. Our 
15-year-old daughter disappeared from the house.She has Down syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 After a frantic two-hour search, we notified the polilece. Sgt. Stephaney 
Payne of the Los Angeles Police Department, West Valley Division, set up a 
command post in our kitchen, immediately mobilizing police and media. As it 
grew dark, our anxiety fast became panic. Our daughter had never been away from 
home alone at night. Her communication skills are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, the police were out in mass, and, by midnight, there were over 
90 police and reserves, joined by neighbors and friends, combing the 
neighborhood. Capt. Harlan Ward arrived to oversee the operation. All worked as 
though they were searching for their own children. 
</P>
<P>
 After a harrowing 24 hours, our daughter, who was with a transient man, was 
found because of the alertness of Bridget Barnes Gonzales, a guard at a 
production office in the Valley. Gonzales, recognizing her from a newscast, 
shrewdly separated her from the man and led her to safety inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bud Mehringer's announcement that our daughter was safe was met by 
tears and cheers from everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to thank our friends and neighbors, the incomparable and indefatigable 
Sgt. Payne, Capt. Ward, Lt. Tony Alba, Detectives Mary Hones, Bob Peloquin and 
all the other officers of the West Valley Division. Never have we been exposed 
to such compassion and professionalism.

CULTURE WATCH; HEARING THE HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caroline Thompson's new film "Black Beauty," whatever the final critical 
consensus about it, is virtually certain to enjoy a warm reception as "family 
entertainment" or, in plain language, a children's movie. But the publication 
in 1877 of Anna Sewell's novel, "Black Beauty: The Autobiography of a Horse," 
on which the film is based, was in its way an important moment in Western 
intellectual history. 
</P>
<P>
 There are new, self-interested reasons why the members of our species should 
seek to defend other species -- from whales at the upper end to Amazonian ants 
at the lower -- or at least preserve them from extinction. But true kindness to 
animals, a late-developing but now distinctive feature of Western culture, 
arises ultimately not from rational self-interest but from imaginative 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because animals cannot speak, their feelings can only enter human 
consciousness by an effort of the imagination. Anna Sewell's only novel made 
that effort. She was not the first to speak on behalf of kindness to animals. 
She offered no new arguments. What she did was imagine everything afresh. Her 
novel affected the anti-cruelty movement as Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle 
Tom's Cabin" affected abolitionism: by bringing the tenderness of a woman's 
heart into what had been a cold philosophical and commercial debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Her novel is narrated by a horse -- a literary device that at book length 
should have become ridiculous. But she made it work so well that she virtually 
created the talking-animal novel and, along the way, changed the public mind 
forever -- and for good.

OVERPROTECTING OUR '84 LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has changed in Los Angeles, and much has been forgotten, in the decade 
since Rafer Johnson proudly ascended the steps of the Memorial Coliseum to 
ignite the flame that opened the Games of the XXIII Olympiad. Such Olympic 
memories are worth keeping alive. 
</P>
<P>
 One enduring legacy of the 1984 games -- which for its time was the most 
watched, most lucrative and best-attended in history -- is the Los Angeles 
Amateur Athletic Foundation. The nonprofit corporation, launched by $95.4 
million in surplus funds from the Los Angeles Games, keeps the spirit of 
competition and charity alive by grants to youth sports programs in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently the organization found itself in the uncomfortable position of 
saying no to kids. After two months of deliberations, the foundation turned 
down a $250,000 request by Los Angeles County officials to help defray the 
costs of entry fees -- $1 per child -- at county pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's grant director cited AAF's interest in "supporting organized 
sports programs that integrated components of teaching, learning and 
competition." But board member John C. Argue put it more bluntly: "If the AAF 
starts giving money to replace government programs, it would be throwing it 
down a rat hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Such brusque sentiments may explain why the county hasn't received more money 
for swimming programs over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foundation did give $31,000 to county pools this year. But that's $25,000 
less than in 1985. To be sure, part of the reason for the decline is that money 
was spent on one-time purchases for equipment and other pool improvements. The 
rest of the money goes to fund county swimming programs, including lessons and 
swim leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all fine. But what good are lessons if children cannot afford to pay a 
pool fee and use the equipment? 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed here is some flexibility. At a time when deep budget cuts 
threaten to further deplete the county's recreation budget, the AAF can help 
address some of those financial problems. Not permanently, to be sure, but at 
least for the duration of one long, hot summer. Surely that would be a fitting 
tribute to the Olympic spirit of that fondly remembered summer a decade ago.

CONGRESS' FARSIGHTED ACTION; DESERT ACT IS LANDMARK LAW, BUT MOJAVE MUST BE 
MADE A TRUE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight years after Sen. Alan Cranston first introduced the bill, it is 
gratifying to be able to report that the California Desert Protection Act is 
now at last almost law. The House of Representatives passed it Wednesday by a 
bipartisan 298-128 margin. And since the Senate passed a similar bill last 
April, all that remains is to resolve certain differences in conference and for 
President Clinton to sign it, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit for extending federal protection to nearly a third of the 
25-million-acre Mojave Desert -- which includes some of the nation's most 
spectacular and fragile ecosystems -- goes especially to Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) and Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez). Feinstein had the political 
skill to find the compromises that revived what seemed like a moribund bill 
until her election in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She can rightly claim it as a major accomplishment. Miller shepherded the bill 
through the House, which finally broke a parliamentary guerrilla war waged by 
five Republicans who represent desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The House version extends the boundaries of the Joshua Tree and Death Valley 
national monuments and elevates them to full national park status. But as a sop 
to the National Rifle Assn., the House refused to turn the East Mojave National 
Scenic Area into a full park, designating it instead as a "preserve," a device 
to permit hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the chief bone of contention between House and Senate conferees, 
because the Senate version makes it a national park. We worry that Feinstein, 
in a tough reelection battle against Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), 
who, we regret to say, voted nay on the bill, may be too eager to have a bill 
signed before the November election and will compromise. She should be as tough 
as possible. Even if the conferees, cowed by the NRA, are unwilling to 
eliminate the noxious hunting provision, they could place such restrictions on 
hunting that it will not be a problem. It is incredible to think that Congress 
would subject hikers, campers and naturalists to the dangers of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 That flaw aside, we applaud Congress for this farsighted action. Generations 
of Westerners still unborn will benefit from this legislation to preserve the 
West's fast-fading natural heritage.

KEEP THE COST OF AGGRESSION HIGH; WATCH OUT FOR THE GOOD COP / BAD COP ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diplomacy may always be full of ruse and stage management, but the show being 
mounted just now in the Bosnian theater is nonetheless remarkable. When the 
"Contact Group" of five major powers offered a last-chance peace plan in early 
July, the foreign ministers of Britain and France said that if the plan was 
rejected, the U.N. forces might have to withdraw. Then, last Monday, as the 
five met in Moscow, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that if 
the plan was accepted, the U.N. forces might have to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia accepted the plan, while the Serbs 
rejected it. Then, after the Serbian rejection, the Muslims and Croats withdrew 
their acceptance. At this point, the Serbs began a countrywide military 
escalation, including attacks on U.N. personnel and new sieges overnight of 
Sarajevo and Gorazde. The return of the horror? 
</P>
<P>
 More likely an elaborate game of good cop/bad cop by Slobodan Milosevic, 
leading Serbia proper, and Radovan Karadzic, leading Serbian Bosnia. Though the 
49% of Bosnia assigned to the Bosnian Serbs by the plan is less than the 70% 
they hold, this is not likely to be their real reason for rejection. No one -- 
certainly not Boutros-Ghali -- has ever believed that the agreement would for a 
certainty be observed. The Serbs could easily have accepted it and then 
disregarded it. Neither NATO nor anyone else would have stopped them. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Serbs are almost certainly seeking is the lifting of the economic 
sanctions that remain in place against Serbia proper. Good cop Milosevic, by 
elaborately and publicly distancing himself from bad cop Karadzic, has set the 
stage for a sudden rescue of the plan that now seems doomed by the bad cop's 
uncontrollable rage. "I can barely control this guy," the good cop says, "but 
I've got a deal I think he'll go for. I just need a little help." 
</P>
<P>
 The help he needs is the lifting of the sanctions. But this move, though it 
will be presented as part of normalization and a return to peace, would in fact 
remove the major continuing cost to Serbia for past aggression, including past 
ethnic cleansing, and the major deterrent against future aggression. 
Maintaining and even tightening the economic sanctions on Serbia is far more 
important to halting the spread of violence in the former Yugoslavia than 
rescuing the peace plan of the Contact Group. On the most optimistic reading, 
that plan would buy only a temporary peace and only in Bosnia, while peace is 
threatened throughout the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs are militarily overextended. Serbia's debit-financed 
economic bubble may be about to burst. Whether the U.N. forces stay or go, now 
is not the moment for the major powers to let an aggressive minor power panic 
them into surrender.

CAL THOMAS ON LIMBAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In defending Rush Limbaugh (Column Right, July 19), Cal Thomas suggests a 
conspiracy is at work to discredit the talk-show host/commentator: "Newspaper 
columns and paid newspaper ads allege 'factual errors' in some of his comments 
(would that someone held the big media accountable for their very real and 
numerous factual errors)." 
</P>
<P>
 As the media watch group responsible for the paid ads, and the group mentioned 
in most of the columns, we have news for Thomas: For years, we've been holding 
the big media -- New York Times, Washington Post, Time, Nightline, CBS News, 
etc. -- accountable for their errors. But now that we've issued our first 
report on Limbaugh, rather than discuss the merits or specifics of our survey 
on Limbaugh's chronic inaccuracy, Thomas hints of a liberal plot. 
</P>
<P>
 We do agree with Thomas on one point: "Limbaugh should challenge some of his 
most visible critics to public debate." We stand ready to debate Limbaugh. But 
when national TV and radio networks invite Limbaugh to appear with us in 
debate, he refuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh's attitude seems to be: Why debate when I can serve up 22-minute 
political sermons every night on TV, unchallenged by opposing views, voices or 
facts?

Limbaugh's legions share a keen sense of "at last!" At last, a spokesperson who 
can articulate the frustration many of us feel as we see the values we hold 
dear assaulted at every turn. At last, someone with the chutzpah to pillory the 
arrogance and elitism that are the hallmarks of the left. At last, someone who 
is, as he puts it, "equal time" to balance the decidedly left-leaning 
"mainstream media." 
</P>
<P>
 Because his message is so welcome and refreshing and his intelligence so 
clearly formidable, I have often wished that Rush were less bombastic and his 
style less in-your-face. I know that he is dismissed as a raving right-wing 
loon by people who cannot get past the buffoonery; indeed there are many times 
that I cringe at the excesses of his style while wholeheartedly agreeing with 
the substance of what he says. But "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" and given 
the swelling number of ditto-heads in the country, Rush "ain't broke."

The Times.

 * Thomas defends Limbaugh by passing on his assertion that his opponents are 
not regular listeners. As proof, Limbaugh claims that his detractors have not 
even noticed that he stopped using the term femi-Nazi over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a perfect example of the way Limbaugh uses half-truths to build his 
arguments. For, while Limbaugh may not utter the epithet himself, it is alive 
and well on his show. In fact, only recently, it could be heard in a satirical 
song Limbaugh played about (Health and Human Services Secretary) Donna Shalala.

GUN VIOLENCE AT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It's time to stop making excuses about gun violence in schools so that our 
law-abiding students can learn in safety. I entirely agree with The Times' 
editorial ("Don't Fire Indiscriminately," July 24) that schools need to be safe 
havens from guns and that local school districts need to have some flexibility 
in administering gun-free school policies. The legislation I have introduced 
with Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) accomplishes both goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, an estimated 100,000 students bring guns to school. Thirty-two of 
the 44 largest school districts in the country now use metal detectors to keep 
guns off campus. By adopting a gun-free school policy, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District has seen gun-related incidents decrease by 14% in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The straightforward amendment I have introduced with Dorgan will mean that any 
school district that wants a portion of $12 billion in federal funds over the 
next five years must adopt a policy to expel any student who brings a gun on 
campus for one year. Flexibility is built into the policy so that school 
administrators can make exceptions on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar amendment was added earlier this year to the Goals 2000 education 
bill, which will impact some schools around the country. Yet, the only way to 
impact every public school is by adding this legislation, as we have suggested, 
to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that will be considered by the 
Senate in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Making schools gun-free is just part of the mosaic of efforts -- at home, at 
school, and in the community -- to reduce violence. The crime bill, approved by 
a Senate-House conference committee Thursday, complements the gun-free policy 
by providing $100 million for drug and gang prevention programs, $3 billion for 
programs such as military-style boot camps for first-time offenders, and $8.9 
billion over five years to put 100,000 more police on our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN 
</P>
<P>
 D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 * A "bring a gun and you're out of school" law is labeled as simple-minded by 
The Times because it allows for zero flexibility. Yet you have no difficulty in 
crusading for a zero-flexibility law that would prohibit the mere possession of 
a handgun by an honest and law-abiding citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 You contend that the proposed law to exclude students who bring guns to school 
should have broad-based support if it can provide some flexibility. Perhaps the 
argument for the absolute ban of all guns from honest citizens would also 
benefit from some flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 If the possession of guns is so injurious to society that The Times would 
confiscate the handgun of a 70-year-old woman who can't defend herself from an 
intruder without such a gun, even if the intruder is armed only with a strong 
body, then might not one legitimately argue that "children who foolishly, but 
without malice, carry weapons because they live in fear" should be excluded 
from school? A gun at school is certainly as dangerous as one in the home of an 
honest citizen.  
</P>

<P>
 * I was appalled to read that Sen. Feinstein and Sen. Dorgan are seeking 
passage of legislation to require nearly every public school to expel any 
student for one year if he or she is caught carrying a gun in school. 
</P>
<P>
 While I totally support a gun-free school policy, this legislation is destined 
to cause more problems than solutions. Students who carry guns to school and 
are consequently expelled for one year will have 365 days to pursue a life of 
crime. Education is the solution. Prohibiting these potential felons to get an 
education will only push them in the wrong direction.

<P>
 Now it's Mexican food that is a target for the "socicobrally correct"! 
</P>
<P>
 We are seeing more and more needless criticism and talempering with the way we 
live, with the constant reminder that living carelessly is dangerous.As if we 
didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's make it "three strikes and you're out" (smoking, hot dogs and now tacos) 
for these extremists before they turn their attention to banning the 
automobile, which is admittedly the biggest killer of all.

CIRCLING BETWEEN OBLIVION AND THE STARS, A POET OF FLIGHT CALLS TO US; 
SAINT-EXUPERY: 'THE LITTLE PRINCE' AUTHOR VANISHED 50 YEARS AGO THIS WEEKEND IN 
WARTIME SERVICE TO FRANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is a writer in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years ago this weekend, French author and aviator Antoine de 
Saint-Exupery took off on a World War II reconnaissance mission over the south 
of France and never came back. In America he is remembered for "The Little 
Prince," the classic fable of childhood. But in Europe, North Africa and South 
America, where he pioneered air routes, he is revered as a great poet of 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 At the dawn of aviation, Saint-Exupery set out to explore the planet; he 
frequently lost his physical bearings but never his capacity for wonder. He 
combined courage and sensitivity, traits today's men are struggling to 
reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, flying blind across the Sahara at night, he navigated toward a mirage of 
Berber campfires, only to discover that they were stars rising above the 
horizon. He flew on, navigating by constellations, until he encountered the 
"bewildering fact that this Earth that is our home is yet in truth a wandering 
star." 
</P>
<P>
 Flying in the 1935 Paris-to-Saigon race, he and his mechanic crashed in the 
Egyptian desert; they trudged three days through burning sands before being 
rescued. Saint-Exupery defied typhoons in Tierra del Fuego and flew 
reconnaissance sorties during the Nazi invasion of France. A romantic, he loved 
metaphors and florid language, princes and stars; today, we might say he was in 
touch with the child inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Born into a noble family in 1900, the young count endured boarding school by 
indulging fantasies of flying. In 1926 he was an aviator flying the mail across 
the Western Sahara from Casablanca to Dakar. His insights on these long, lonely 
flights found their way into his personal journals, scribbled in cafes and 
desert oases. He described the currents of air, the textures of terrain, the 
fingerprints left by nomads on nature. Carried aloft in primitive machines that 
frequently ran out of gas, lost course or crashed, he was engaged in a quest of 
consciousness: to grasp, from high above, a pattern of meaning on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The dawn of global awareness is often ascribed to the moment astronauts first 
beheld Earth shimmering in space. But Neil Armstrong's words from the moon, 
"one small step for man . . . ," pale in comparison to Saint-Exupery's 1939 
rendering of a colleague's passage across the South Atlantic in a hydroplane: 
</P>
<P>
 "As day was dying he ran afoul of the Black Hole region, off Africa. . . . 
Great black waterspouts had reared themselves seemingly in the immobility of 
temple pillars. Swollen at their tips, they were supporting the squat and 
lowering arch of the tempest, but through the rifts in the arch there fell 
slabs of light and the full moon sent her radiant beams between the pillars 
down upon the frozen tiles of the sea. Through these uninhabited ruins Mermoz 
made his way . . . flying for four hours through these corridors of moonlight 
toward the exit from the temple." 
</P>
<P>
 Saint-Exupery held faith with technological progress, believing air travel and 
air mail would bring countries closer together. But the Nazi invasion of France 
caused him to despair that the beloved airplane, with all its potential for 
communication, had instead regressed to weapon of destruction. He flew 
reconnaissance missions but refused to pilot fighter aircraft. He was nearly 
shot down in 1940, an experience he converted into "Flight to Arras." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Little Prince" was written in a Victorian mansion deep in the woods of 
Long Island. Saint-Exupery had gone there for a rest but he couldn't stand the 
isolation. Twice as old as the typical military flier, his body wracked by 
injuries, he returned to North Africa to help liberate France. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm shot down, I won't regret anything," Saint-Exupery wrote before his 
final mission in an unmailed letter to a friend. His P-38 Lightning was 
presumed lost in the Mediterranean; it remains a mystery whether he was shot 
down, crashed or, in growing despondency, committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as we talk of information highways and virtual reality making it 
possible to travel without leaving our TV screens, Saint-Exupery's writings are 
a guide back to the path of the explorer who risked his life searching for 
knowledge and truth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50 years since his disappearance, Saint-Exupery's literary reputation 
has stayed aloft. "The Little Prince" has been republished in a special 
anniversary edition. His aviation books, "Night Flight," "Wind, Sand and Stars" 
and "Flight to Arras" -- all still in print -- are guideposts to explore 
meaning in life's journey. Saint-Exupery was not only a pioneer of air routes; 
he was one of the first in modern times to grasp a whole-Earth vision. Circling 
somewhere between oblivion and the stars, the poet of flight challenges us "to 
set our course for distant destinations."

 NEW HOBBY: Store managers are sprucing up this week at Hobby City, the 22-shop 
crafts and collectors center on Beach Boulevard in Anaheim, just south of 
Knott's Berry Farm. Reason: They're expecting a boost in business from the new 
"Adventure City." It's a $4-million, mini-amusement center -- 10 children's 
rides -- that Hobby City will open Aug. 20 on two adjacent acres. . . . Says 
Hobby City owner Bea DeArmond: "We're all putting a little trim on our shops to 
get ready for it."

 JUST BECAUSE: What do you do when you're no longer on the swim team after 
seven years? Cyrise Calvin, 30, says you keep on swimming. Calvin, who swam for 
seven years with the Nadadores in her home town of Mission Viejo, arrives home 
Saturday after swimming the English Channel. Two years ago she became the 24th 
woman to swim to Catalina Island. . . . Says her father, Robert Calvin: "She'd 
say she did it just because it was there." If you're interested in swimming the 
channel, her time was just under 11 hours.

 WORLDLY VIEW: Here's one way for Asian refugees to get jobs: Find someone 
willing to hire them. More than half of the 200 employees at Narendra Gupta's 
rapidly expanding automotive accessory company, Dashking in Santa Ana, are 
refugees. . . . "Why not?" he says. "People are the same the world over." A 
fringe benefit for him: Gupta was recently honored by the county Social 
Services Department and Catholic Charities for his record in hiring refugees.

<P>
 BIKING FOR BIKERS: How would you feel going home in rush-hour traffic if your 
vehicle were stuck behind a group of bicyclists, six abreast? . . . That could 
happen on Aug. 19, when a loose-knit local bicycle group is planning what it 
calls a "critical mass instructional ride" on Edinger Avenue in Westminster, 
starting at Beach Boulevard and heading west. . . . That's a Friday, at 5:30 
p.m. -- rush hour. Says one person involved: "We aren't radicals. We just hope 
to make the public more aware of cyclists' right to use all the roads."

 STRIKE? Baseball players have set an Aug. 12 strike deadline (C1), and former 
major-leaguer and Valley resident Pete Redfern thinks they'll go through with 
it. . . . "It doesn't surprise me one bit," he said. "The players union is one 
of the strongest in the country.But I'd hate to see it." Redfern, City Section 
player of the year for Sylmar in 1972, played for the Minnesota Twins (and was 
part of the 1981 players strike). He is now a coach with The Master's College 
in Newhall.

 DOWN A NOTCH: You can't stay on top of the charts forever, as an R&B group

 WATER: There may be no Fountains of Youth in the San Fernando Valley, but, 
from CityWalk in Universal City (above) to Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, there 
sure are plenty of fountains for youth, and anyone else, for that matter. . . . 
"We live in a desert," said Barbara Piniero of Santa Monica, "so the presence 
of water is essential." See Valley Life! Page 10.

 LOCAL HERO: He's a sports legend who lives in Encino but you may not be able 
to name his accomplishment. That would be Alex Olmedo. . . . Olmedo, 58, beat 
Rod Laver to win the Wimbledon tennis title in 1959. He's still on top of his 
game, making the finals last week at the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s 55-and-over 
national singles hard-court championships (C10).

ACLU REVEALS FBI'S FILES ON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to know what pieces the late composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein played 
at a 1940s benefit for the Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee? Or what the 
performers wore during a Washington rehearsal of his celebrated "Mass"? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers -- Brahms and boogie-woogie, and some wore hot pants -- along with 
a great many other details, are contained in more than 600 pages of FBI files 
compiled on Bernstein over three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's liberal political activities -- no matter how trivial or well 
known -- were chronicled with the help of informants and news clippings for the 
ultimately futile purpose of proving that Bernstein was a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI's monitoring of Bernstein started in the 1940s during the Red scares 
that permeated American politics and continued into the 1970s, when the White 
House was informed of an alleged plot by Bernstein to embarrass President 
Richard Nixon at a performance dedicating the Kennedy Center for the Performing 
Arts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who died in 1990, knew of the files, even citing them as evidence 
of the FBI's attempts to discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't seem to rile him up. I think it disappointed him," said Schuyler 
Chapin, a longtime friend of Bernstein's and one of the executors of his 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 After the composer's death, Chapin and others in Bernstein's circles examined 
copies of the files, which contain numerous passages blacked out by the FBI 
before they were released. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction was sadness that we had reached a point in our country that a 
distinguished artist was being fingered by the FBI because they didn't like his 
political opinions," said Chapin, who is New York City's commissioner of 
cultural affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all curious to know what it is that been blacked out," Chapin added. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the files through a 
Freedom of Information Act request and is releasing them to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate the FBI is still trying to withhold from legitimate public 
scrutiny evidence of what it was doing," said Allan Parachini, public affairs 
director for the ACLU's Southern California chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Parachini, who speculates that the missing information may deal with 
Bernstein's private life, said the ACLU will file an appeal challenging the 
FBI's deletion of several dozen pages for national security and other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be hilarious if it weren't so serious," Parachini said of the fat 
Bernstein file. "Clearly the FBI invested thousands of person-hours of 
surveillance on the activities of Leonard Bernstein and other individuals who 
should have never come under FBI scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 For all their efforts, the FBI did not find much. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't actually prove anything that we didn't know all along -- that 
Bernstein was a sympathizer with liberal causes," said Humphrey Burton, whose 
biography of Bernstein was published this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The files examine those sympathies at considerable length, recording his 
membership in groups deemed "Communist fronts," his hobnobbing with suspected 
Communists, his "anti-American" comments and his travels abroad.

 "Confidential Informant of known reliability advised May 7, 1945, that during 
an executive board meeting of the American Committee for Spanish Freedom held 
on March 30, 1945, at 11 Gramercy Park, New York City, it was announced that 
Leonard Bernstein had consented to dedicate a musical number to a 'Free Spain,' 
" one entry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Informants are even used for obvious bits of information, such as a 1952 
observation that Bernstein was assistant director of the New York Philharmonic 
and was on a national tour. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ample references to mention of Bernstein by the House Un-American 
Activities Committee, which chilled Hollywood and much of the rest of the 
nation's cultural community with its hearings in the 1940s and 1950s on the 
alleged Communist affiliations of major arts and entertainment figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, biographer Burton said Bernstein was denied his passport in 1953 
because of his suspected Communist leanings. As a result, Bernstein signed an 
affidavit swearing that he had never been a member of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a subsequent Justice Department investigation into whether Bernstein 
had lied in that affidavit found that "the only available evidence linking 
Bernstein with the Communist Party was based on hearsay rather than personal 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 That the files would be crammed with secondhand information was typical, said 
Peter Buckingham, author of "America Sees Red," a history of anti-radical 
thought and action in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They start snooping around and end up reporting really hearsay in these 
files," Buckingham said. "It's really smear stuff . . . laughable but scary." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1955 acknowledgment that there was no hard evidence against Bernstein did 
not dampen the government's interest, however. Joan Peyser, who wrote a 1987 
biography of Bernstein, says that Bernstein appeared before a 1956 
congressional subcommittee that was concerned that he and a number of other 
musicians were security threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI had little to worry about, according to Peyser: 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I found Bernstein to be in many ways to be quite a passive man. . . 
. He would join the most liberal to radical causes and sign petitions. And yet 
when he was confronted with it and there was any kind of risk to his career he 
would try to extricate himself. I don't have any evidence he was a 
card-carrying Communist." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and early 1970s, the files follow Bernstein's anti-war and civil 
rights activities, including his wife's famous hosting of a 1970 fund-raising 
party for Black Panther Party members accused of plotting to dynamite a police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which Bernstein attended and which caused a considerable stir -- 
even in liberal circles -- prompted the FBI to recommend that information be 
given to "a cooperative news media source on a confidential basis" about the 
criminal background of one of the Black Panthers.

HUNDREDS OF HOMES THREATENED BY WILDFIRE IN WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A huge, wind-whipped fire threatened hundreds of homes -- some expensive 
vacation retreats -- as it moved toward the lakeside town of Chelan on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54,000-acre fire was within five miles of the forested campgrounds, summer 
homes and condominiums, said Barry Marsh, a district engineer for the Wenatchee 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those could go like Roman candles," he said. Earlier in the week, the fire 
destroyed 13 homes near the Entiat River. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Chelan, located about 105 miles east of Seattle, had not been 
ordered to leave, although weather forecasters predicted a wind shift that 
would drive the fire toward town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are preparing our community for the worst possible contingency without 
frightening them to death," Mayor Joyce Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious injuries had been reported among the 1,500 people battling the 
Chelan blaze. One man, identified as Paul Hodges, 58, of Plain, Wash., died 
from a heart attack while in a fire camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chelan fire and dozens of smaller ones across the state were sparked by 
lightning storms Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 miles away, fires in Colville National Forest burned almost 600 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like Mt. St. Helens went off" and spread ash over the area, said 
Colville forest spokeswoman Diana Baxter. "It's eerie out there."

MOUNTAIN LION KILLED IN SCHOOLYARD TREE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A game warden shot and killed a mountain lion that had perched in a schoolyard 
tree early Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were called by a woman who reported seeing a lion peeking at her 
through a window.When Monterey County sheriff's deputies went to investigate, 
they found the lion in the tree watching the playing children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies notified the Department of Fish and Game, which sent a game 
warden to the location. The lion was determined to be a threat to people in the 
area, and was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the animal is that acclimated, not afraid of humans, it is going to 
cause problems in the area," said Capt. Ed Nagel of the Department of Fish and 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent killing of a jogger by a mountain lion in Northern California has 
affected recent decisions when lions are in populated areas, Nagel said.

HIGH COURT TO RULE ON MAN'S RIGHT TO VETO SON'S ADOPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Revisiting an emotional issue of family law, the state Supreme Court agreed 
Thursday to decide whether a San Diego man could veto an adoption the day after 
his child was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven justices, all but Ronald George, voted to review a lower 
court ruling that allowed the father, Mark King, to exercise parental rights on 
the grounds that he had shown a full commitment to assume parental 
responsibilities after the birth. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing had been sought by the adoptive parents, John and Margaret Stenbeck 
of San Diego, and a lawyer appointed to represent the 3-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves an issue that the state's high court addressed in 1992, when 
it said a biological father who makes a prompt and thorough commitment to 
assuming parental responsibilities has the same right as the mother to veto an 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 King, of Prescott, Ariz., was 20 when he impregnated his 15-year-old 
girlfriend, Stephanie Harman, in 1990. King was surprised by the pregnancy 
because he had undergone a vasectomy, and he had twice beaten Harman, used 
drugs and attempted suicide halfway through the pregnancy, said the 4th 
District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple agreed to the adoption by the Stenbecks, but King changed his mind 
while recovering from his suicide attempt, the court said. However, he did not 
tell the Stenbecks until a day after the child, Michael, was born in February, 
1991. Over the objections of Harman, from whom he had separated, he sued for 
custody.

'92 ELECTION WINNER FINALLY DECIDED; SUPERVISORS: COURT NULLIFIES CHALLENGER'S 
VICTORY OVER SLOW-GROWTH INCUMBENT IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bizarre dispute over a Santa Barbara County supervisor's election reached a 
quiet climax here Thursday -- 20 months after votes were cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot: Supervisor Willy Chamberlin is officially out.His opponent, former 
Supervisor Bill Wallace, is in. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began with the election of November, 1992, a high-stakes battle between 
Chamberlin -- a conservative rancher and oilman -- and Wallace, an 
environmentalist and the longtime incumbent in the seat. More than $1 million 
was spent on the race, which was viewed as a pivotal fight between proponents 
of slow growth and forces more friendly to development. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Chamberlin was declared the winner by seven votes. Wallace paid for a 
recount -- which narrowed Chamberlin's winning margin to five votes -- and then 
appealed to a Superior Court judge, who further cut the margin to two votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Wallace pressed on, and finally found victory at the 3rd District 
Court of Appeal. In a 62-page decision in April, the justices declared Wallace 
the winner -- by 12 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, however, Chamberlin had grown comfortable in his supervisor's seat, 
and he appealed to the California Supreme Court. On Thursday, he lost. In a 
two-sentence order, the state's high court declined to hear the appeal.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; KINCHEN LOOKS SHARP IN HIS RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Todd Kinchen, who underwent reconstructive knee surgery late 
last season, caught a pass in an organized practice for the first time in eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams put Kinchen on the physically unable-to-perform list earlier this 
week, only to take him off Thursday. After passing a physical exam in the 
morning, Kinchen was on the practice field in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the rush? Kinchen will be hard-pressed to make the roster with rookies 
Isaac Bruce and Chris Brantley and veterans Flipper Anderson, Greg McMurtry, 
Jessie Hester and Nate Lewis in camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kinchen looked good," Coach Chuck Knox said. "He has those fresh legs out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen, who ran full-speed pass routes, said he is 85% fit. After making his 
first catch in practice, he pumped his fist at teammates standing on the 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the defensive players were cheering for me," said Kinchen, who caught 
eight passes for 137 yards and a touchdown last season. "It felt good to be 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knox doesn't seem to be a big fan of the new two-point conversion rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two-point conversion will give you people something to write about," he 
said. "Let's say it's 7-6 with five seconds left and you kick it to tie and go 
into overtime. Then you lose the coin toss and the other team goes down the 
field and kicks a field goal. Everybody will say, 'You should have gone for 
two.' And if you go for two and miss it and lose, 7-6, then you should have 
kicked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody will go for two in a 7-6 situation, will they? 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone will say that you should have," he said. "Hindsight is 20-20."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BOSTON, NEW YORK WIN ONE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox each scored only one run Thursday, but 
that was all they needed to gain a victory as the teams completed a suspended 
game from Wednesday night and played their regularly scheduled contest at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brunansky hit a home run, and Joe Hesketh (7-5) -- with help from three 
relievers -- held the Yankees to four hits to give the Red Sox a 1-0 victory in 
the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the day, I was keeping the ball down," Hesketh said. "I was getting 
the majority of the guys I got out today out with sliders." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the Yankees defeated the Red Sox, 4-3, in 11 innings to 
complete a game suspended by rain in the eighth inning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Williams led off the 11th with a single and scored on a double by Mike 
Gallego to make a winner of Bob Wickman (5-3). Mike Stanley led the way with 
two homers for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 7-5, Baltimore 2-2 -- Eddie Murray homered twice and Tony Pena hit a 
solo home run at Baltimore, as the Indians completed their first doubleheader 
sweep in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Albert Belle hit his seventh homer in nine games and Sandy 
Alomar hit a three-run homer off Mike Mussina (14-5), providing Jack Morris 
(10-6) with enough runs for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, the Indians took a 2-0 lead against Sid Fernandez (6-6) 
when Murray homered after Belle's single. Kenny Lofton's double and Manny 
Ramierez's single made it 3-0 in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Toronto 4 -- Kevin Seitzer singled in the winning run in the 
ninth inning to lift the Brewers to their first three-game sweep at Toronto 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Reed led off with a single and Turner Ward walked before Seitzer singled 
to score Reed. Jesse Orosco (2-1) struck out one of two batters he faced in the 
eighth and Mike Fetters pitched the ninth for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 5, Chicago 3 -- David Cone struggled at Kansas City, but the 
Royals completed their first- four-game sweep of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone (15-4) gave up eight hits and three runs in 7 1/3 innings, with five 
walks and four strikeouts. The Royals, whose six-game winning streak matches 
their longest of the 1990s, scored two runs on catcher Mike LaValliere's error 
in a four-run second. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 4, Seattle 2 -- Mickey Tettleton's two-run home run in the 11th inning 
gave the Tigers their first three-game winning streak at Detroit in more than 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Cuyler started the inning with a single off Bobby Ayala (4-3), the third 
Seattle pitcher. Tettleton, who had only one run batted in since July 4, then 
hit his 15th homer.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ROCKIES DEFEAT GIANTS, BUT LOSE GALARRAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two hit batsmen helped the Colorado Rockies put the game out of reach and 
pulled them closer to first place. The cost, however, may have been too high 
for the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Galarraga suffered a broken right right hand when he was hit by a pitch 
during Thursday's 5-1 victory over the Giants at San Francisco. Galarraga, who 
was batting .319 with 31 home runs and 85 runs batted in, was hit in the ninth 
inning by a pitch from reliever Dave Burba, who also hit Dante Bichette in the 
Rockies' three-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "That right there, if there's a situation that lost them the game, hitting us 
two was it," said Bichette, who wasn't injured but homered and scored twice. "I 
think that won the game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 After Salomon Torres of the Giants broke Charlie Hayes' cheekbone with a pitch 
last month, having two more players hit by San Francisco pitchers angered 
Colorado Manager Don Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy takes it off the nose, the other guy off the forearm," Baylor said. 
"You can't let them do that. We're not going to retaliate or anything, but 
we're not going to stand back and let our guys be hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Manager Dusty Baker, a close friend of Baylor's, said he hopes the 
situation doesn't escalate into a beanball war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, in the game like that, nobody's trying to hit anybody," he said. "It 
seems like the guys who are getting hit are the guys with sort of unorthodox 
stances and guys that like the ball over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 1-1 until the eighth, when Joe Girardi doubled and scored the 
go-ahead run on an error, one of two by the Giants. Marvin Freeman (10-2) went 
seven strong innings for the victory, giving up one run and four hits in seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 10, Pittsburgh 3 -- The Cubs took a five-run lead in the first inning 
as Pirate starter Steve Cooke couldn't retire a batter at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Foster (3-3) pitched out of bases-loaded jams in the first two innings 
to win for the first time since June 25. He yielded four hits and struck out 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 3, Cincinnati 2 -- Bip Roberts singled home Brad Ausmus from second 
base with one out in the bottom of the 10th inning to lift the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Ausmus led off with a single and went to second on a wild pitch by loser 
Johnny Ruffin (6-2). After Billy Bean struck out, Roberts singled home Ausmus.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; MARINERS STILL WITHOUT A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The longest road trip in Seattle Mariners' history was extended Thursday when 
the players' union rejected Tacoma's Cheney Stadium as an alternate site to the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle had a nine-game homestand scheduled to begin Tuesday, with games 
against the Angels, Kansas City and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariners infielder Mike Blowers lives in Tacoma, about 30 miles south of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected it to happen," he said. "I made plans early this week to 
take my family to Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 After the rejection, the American League announced the Mariners will play 
those games on the road while King County officials scramble to remove 40,000 
faulty acoustical ceiling tiles from the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when all was said and done, players couldn't get themselves, based on 
their knowledge of the stadium, to agree to play there or be convinced that it 
was up to major league standards," Eugene Orza, the associate general counsel 
of players' association, said in New York. "They regard it as a substandard 
field. I don't say that critically or perjoratively of Tacoma." 
</P>
<P>
 Players for all three opposing teams rejected the Tacoma option. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have 75 players vote against it and 25 for it, who are you going to 
listen to?" said Dan Wilson, the Mariners player representative. "If we were 
the other team, we'd vote the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle would have had to play day games in Cheney because the Pacific Coast 
League Tacoma Tigers are playing night games there. The Mariners were in 
Detroit on Thursday, on a road trip that wraps up Sunday against the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingdome has been closed since July 19, when four ceiling tiles dropped 
into the stands shortly before a game against Baltimore. Two Orioles games were 
postponed and a subsequent four-game series against Boston scheduled for the 
Kingdome was played at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they expect all of the 26-pound ceiling tiles will be 
removed by Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Acoustical consultants hired by the county say between 90,000 and 110,000 
square feet of vinyl-covered insulation will be needed to control noise inside 
the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of that stopgap solution would be about $500,000, Deputy County 
Executive Pearl McElheran said. Rental of cranes and other equipment needed for 
the job may cost hundreds of thousands dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Kingdome could be ready for a Mariners home series that begins 
Aug. 22, McElheran said. "I think we can do it by then." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said there was an outside chance the work could be completed in time 
for the Aug. 8-10 series against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's Seattle Seahawks are playing their Aug. 13 exhibition game against 
Tampa Bay in the University of Washington's Husky Stadium, and are considering 
playing their Aug. 20 exhibition game against Minnesota there. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they expect the Kingdome to be ready for their regular-season home 
opener against San Diego on Sept. 18.

 The U.S. basketball team gained a bit of consolation and revenge Thursday by 
beating Russia, 80-71, to take the bronze medal at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Finley of Wisconsin led the Americans with 24 points, Alan Henderson 
of Indiana added 17 and Shawn Respert of Michigan State had 11.Sergei Babkov

 Puerto Rico beat Italy, 94-80, for the gold, avenging a defeat to the Italians 
in the preliminary round. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the best game in five we played here," said U.S. Coach George 
Raveling. "It made a difference the game was against the Russians. If we'd have 
played anybody else but Russia I'm not convinced our incentive would have been 
as high." BOXING

DEL MAR; BERTRANDO'S VICTORY ON GRASS SETS UP A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The country's best older horse running on dirt last year made his grass debut 
a success Thursday as Bertrando scooted around Del Mar's turf course for a 1 
1/4-length victory in the $60,900 Wickerr Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 This race might have been a preliminary for another grass appearance, in the 
Arlington Million on Aug. 28, but Bertrando's owners, Eddie Nahem and Marshall 
Naify, and the 5-year-old's new trainer, John Shirreffs, don't think so. The 
Del Mar Classic on Aug. 13 is too handy, it's also $1 million, and Bertrando 
won the 1 1/4-mile race a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Classic is only 16 days away," Nahem said. "But we didn't have to beat up 
on our horse to win today. (Jockey Pat Valenzuela) didn't have to hit him once; 
he did it all on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a new surface and a new trainer, Bertrando was being ridden by 
Valenzuela for the first time, after his seven victories in 16 previous starts 
had been the work of Alex Solis, Chris McCarron and Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat's a natural speed rider and Bertrando's a natural speed horse, so they're 
a perfect fit," Nahem said. "When Pat's right, there's not a better jockey in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Bon Point, who runs for Bobby Frankel, Bertrando's former trainer, tried to 
sneak past Bertrando with a move along the rail in the last sixteenth of a 
mile, but he wasn't up to it and finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt great," Valenzuela said of his first ride on Bertrando. "He relaxed 
all the way around. He's a classy one. He was just galloping out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando ran the mile in 1:36 1/5, carrying 121 pounds, which was four to 
seven pounds more than his five rivals. After running second to the 133-1 
Arcangues in last fall's Breeders' Cup Classic, Bertrando underwent 
arthroscopic surgery for a chipped knee and was successfully bred to 58 mares, 
at $20,000 per breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando paid $5 as the favorite, earning $33,900 to boost his career total 
to $3,058,365. Of horses in training, only Best Pal, with $4.7 million, has 
earned more. Best Pal, winner of the first Pacific Classic, in 1991, and third 
in the race last year, is expected to run in the $1-million Del Mar race next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Best Pal was fantastic (at Hollywood Park) the other night," Nahem said. "And 
I have a lot of respect for Slew Of Damascus too. But I think that with the 
possible exception of Holy Bull, there's not a horse in the country who's 
faster than Bertrando." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the jockeys nor the horses were seriously injured in a spectacular 
two-horse spill in Thursday's third race. Western Style, who finished first, 
was disqualified to fourth place by the stewards for her part in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the stretch, Western Style, running in second place under 
Stevens, was brought to the outside, bumping Solis and his mount, Et Voila. 
After Et Voila went down, Viz stumbled over her, unseating jockey Martin 
Pedroza. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedroza continued riding in later races, but Solis, returning to the jockeys' 
room after his X-rays were negative, complained of soreness and took off the 
rest of his mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens was reportedly so shaken by the incident that he considered canceling 
the rest of his mounts. "The bump was not as bad as it seemed," track 
veterinarian Jock Jocoy said. "When Gary's horse came over, Alex's filly had 
all four feet off the ground, and that's what caused her to lose her balance." 
</P>
<P>
 In the disqualification, the stewards moved Fast Reward up to first place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron, who injured his ankle when a mount flipped in the gate before a race 
Wednesday, was off his mounts Thursday but is expected back today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, the leading rider at Del Mar a year ago with 67 winners, 
returns today after serving a five-day suspension that started at Hollywood 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett Gomez begins a five-day suspension Sunday for an incident that 
resulted in his mount, Ocean Crest, being disqualified from third to fourth 
place in the second division of the Oceanside Stakes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ed Friendly, who took over last month as president of the California 
Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn., said Thursday that the 
organization's recently elected board of directors is reviewing an underfunding 
of more than $2.8 million in the group's backstretch pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the California Horse Racing Board in Del Mar Thursday, 
commissioner Robert Tourtelot asked the state attorney general's office to 
investigate the possibility of criminal activity regarding management of the 
pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Clark, who preceded Friendly as president, serving in the position for 
about 16 months, said that the pension was underfunded before he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't hold me to the exact year," Clark said, "but I think about five or six 
years ago, the monthly benefit was increased from $250 to $300. Since then, 
revenues have declined and interest rates have plummeted like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The CHBPA, an organization of horse owners and trainers, is paying pensions to 
about 400, according to Brian Sweeney, former chief operating officer of the 
group. Backstretch employees must be 65 to qualify, and there are slight 
increases in the monthly benefits for those with more than 10 years of working 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 It bothers Friendly that a large percentage of the pension recipients are 
trainers. "About 35% are in that category," Friendly said. "I thought the main 
purpose of this fund was help the beleaguered backstretch help." Del Mar Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Following up the passage of a new state law, the California Horse Racing Board 
voted Thursday to recognize the Thoroughbred Owners of California as the group 
that will represent owners, and the California Horsemen's Benevolent and 
Protective Assn. as the organization that will represent trainers, beginning 
next year. Before Ed Friendly and others formed the owners' group last year, 
the protective association represented owners and trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdom Found, who was shipped to Belmont Park and ran last in the Suburban 
Handicap on July 4, is the 116-pound high weight for Saturday's $125,000 San 
Diego Handicap at Del Mar. Others entered are You And I, Blinking Lights, 
Berillon, Tossofthecoin, Rapan Boy, Dr. Pain and Brilliant Blue. . . . In 
Saturday's $75,000 San Clemente Handicap for 3-year-old fillies, Work The 
Crowd, who has had seven victories and three seconds in her last 10 races, 
carries high weight of 120 pounds. Her opponents will be Musical Pal, C'mon 
Lets Dance, Fancy 'N Fabulous, Pharma, Solar Beam, Dancing Mirage, Wood Of 
Binn, Malli Star and Rabiadella.

GILMORE CONTINUES TO BE AN INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for Lynell George's article on Mikal Gilmore ("A Legacy Survived," 
July 6). 
</P>
<P>
 I have been an admirer of Gilmore since his days as a rock critic for the 
(now-defunct) Los Angeles Herald Examiner. Reading his reviews of artists 
ranging from Prince to Fleetwood Mac to Johnny Cash to the Sex Pistols made me 
seek out music I otherwise may not have discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 That Gilmore overcame a background of family violence and pain is truly an 
inspiration to me.

OF COURSE, CORGIS ARE BEAUTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hold it. Stop the presses. I demand a retraction or at least a clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 In "From Plain Pooches to Top Dogs" (July 14) Kathie Jenkins quotes anonymous 
dog show judges as incredulously allowing that, "Yes, even corgis are 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 As the owner of two such creatures and a member of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi 
Club of Southern California, I am stunned. I can only assume another breed was 
the intended target. 
</P>
<P>
 Corgis (corgwyn actually) are beautiful by all true canine standards: Foxlike 
faces with eyes ringed by natural "eyeliner," usually a crisp white blaze from 
nose to forehead and large ears held erect combine to handsomely betray the 
breed's intelligence and aesthetic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously your article meant to refer to some truly cosmetically challenged 
breed. Pugs, perhaps?

BRAVE WOMAN WITHOUT WORKSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Graham's book "Women Who Run with the Poodles" had me roaring out loud 
("Fed Up With Your Inner Child?" July 11). 
</P>
<P>
 These days it's a brave woman who thinks she's perfectly capable of living 
without going to past-life workshops or paying huge therapy bills to find 
someone else to blame for her problems.Graham's tweaking at the pomposities of 
the New Age and feminist movements is a breath of fresh air for people fed up 
with all the inane psychobabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarissa Estes, author of "Women Who Run With the Wolves," and other feminist 
authors who objected to HarperCollins' publishing of Graham's book reinforce 
the stereotype that feminists are all humorless fanatics who quell anyone in 
the ranks who disagrees with them. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're not allowed to laugh at ourselves, that means all the laughter will 
come from people like Rush Limbaugh.

ONE KOREAN AMERICAN INSPIRES ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a young Korean American architecture student, I am proud to know the recent 
addition to the Los Angeles Convention Center was designed by a Korean 
American. "One Man's Vision" (June 26) about Ki Suh Park, was refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 I have for some time been lost and confused and could not really grasp why I 
am not as motivated as before. I have let down my teachers who went out of 
their way to help me and I let myself down. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ordeals and obstacles Park overcame were obviously far more difficult. 
That is why I'm writing to thank you for a great article. It is wonderful to 
find Koreans are being recognized in a profession such as architecture, and not 
just as grocery merchants.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean to degrade merchants, but am only trying to express my happiness 
that we are recognized. I think there are many things young Korean Americans 
can contribute to the community.

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; FRESH LOOK AT DIRECTOR GEORGE CUKOR DOESN'T REVEAL 
ALL; GEORGE CUKOR / MASTER OF ELEGANCE BY EMANUEL LEVY ; MORROW $25, 400 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emanuel Levy has written a meticulously researched and gently revisionist 
biography of the esteemed but controversial director George Cukor, attempting 
to capture the particular vision that gave a Cukor film its unique qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 The author has also set out to alter "some of the prevalent myths and 
long-held notions about Cukor as an artist and a man," believing that previous 
biographers have perpetuated the idea that Cukor's films tended to be overly 
static and confined and that he was replaced as director of "Gone With the 
Wind" because Clark Gable found working with him impossible and resented his 
attention to Vivien Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
 By exploring and investigating all of the complex circumstances surrounding 
these questions in "George Cukor: Master of Elegance," Levy offers a fresh and 
different take upon the perceived wisdom, one that should be of considerable 
interest to film historians. 
</P>
<P>
 When he confronts the issue of Cukor's homosexuality and the effect of that 
sensibility on Cukor's work, Levy is less persuasive, finding excessive 
significance in the fact that most of Cukor's films had "strong, eccentric 
heroines, outsiders who wished to assimilate but without giving up their 
idiosyncratic habits and traits -- just like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Though such heroines do appear in some Cukor films, and he is well-remembered 
for "The Philadelphia Story" and "Holiday," he also directed a wide variety of 
pictures in which resemblances between the director and the heroine are faint 
to nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 When you consider that Cukor was also responsible for "Little Women," "David 
Copperfield," "Romeo and Juliet," "A Star Is Born," "Gaslight" and "A Double 
Life," the hypothesis, shaky at best, quickly begins to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Cukor was not the author of any of the scripts in question, 
though he may have taken particular pleasure in choosing and directing stories 
with spirited female characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1930s and '40s were the heyday of witty, willful and often rebellious 
movie heroines, winsome types who went into sad eclipse in the following 
decades, supplanted by more passive and far less vivacious characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of dimming during this later era, Cukor's own star seems to have 
blazed even more brightly, and he did much of his most memorable work in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting lavish praise of "A Star Is Born," Levy says, "(The film) showed of 
Cukor's multiple skills as politician, statesman, psychiatrist, magician, 
painter, writer, animal trainer, nurse, elocutionist, dancer, mathematician, 
musician, cameraman, dressmaker -- everything but Garland's husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Levy makes a strenuous effort to present a fully realized portrait of 
the man as well as the work, like the biographers who preceded him, he tends to 
be stymied by Cukor's extreme reticence about his private life. There are 
descriptions of Cukor's lavish luncheon and dinner parties, events 
characterized for remarkable food and indifferent wine. 
</P>
<P>
 An abstemious chap, Cukor allowed his guests a single drink before dinner, and 
seemed totally oblivious to the beverages that accompanied the exquisite meals, 
though his taste in other aesthetic matters was flawless. 
</P>
<P>
 His house, an ongoing project, was filled with splendid antiques and 
extraordinary contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 A perfect, if somewhat affected, gentleman in virtually every respect, Cukor 
apparently dropped that facade only on the set, where he allowed himself to be 
amazingly profane, particularly when his suggestions were contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy interviewed scores of actors in writing the book, most of whom remember 
Cukor with respect and admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The few who are less laudatory -- Stewart Granger, Anouk Aimee, Jacqueline 
Bisset -- add welcome vitality to what might have otherwise been merely homage 
to an unusually long and distinguished career spanning half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Levy shows Cukor the director to have been far more versatile than 
prior books suggest, ultimately Cukor's extreme discretion about other matters 
turns even this definitive study into an extended professional resume. 
</P>
<P>
 The human being responsible for the polished gestures, the subtle interplay 
and the sophisticated interpretations remains an elusive presence.

LAGUNA HILLS FINDINGS MOVE HUBER CASE TO O.C.; CRIME: TESTS INDICATE SHE WAS 
KILLED IN WAREHOUSE, NOT IN ARIZONA. FAMILY IS RELIEVED JURISDICTION IS 
SETTLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Long-awaited blood tests indicated that a Newport Beach woman whose battered 
body was found in a freezer here was bludgeoned to death three years ago in 
Laguna Hills, leading Arizona authorities on Thursday to send the murder case 
to Orange County for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors quickly filed capital murder charges in Municipal 
Court in Newport Beach against John J. Famalaro, a 37-year-old house painter 
who lived most of his life in Orange County before moving in 1992 to Arizona, 
where he was arrested earlier this month on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Denise Huber, a 23-year-old UC Irvine graduate, disappeared June 
3, 1991, after her automobile had a tire blowout on the Corona del Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Her whereabouts had been a mystery until Arizona detectives, thinking they 
were about to uncover a cache of illicit drugs, found her nude and handcuffed 
body in the freezer, which Famalaro brought here from California and kept 
running in a Ryder rental truck parked in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although criminal attorneys both here and in California have said that 
prosecutors would have a tougher time securing a death sentence if the murder 
case were sent to Orange County, they also said that Arizona would have little 
choice but to surrender jurisdiction if evidence surfaced that the actual 
slaying occurred in California. 
</P>
<P>
 That evidence was uncovered by Costa Mesa police detectives and confirmed by 
crime lab technicians of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint statement issued Thursday said that the decision to send the murder 
prosecution to Orange County was "based on the DNA analysis of bloodstains 
collected at the warehouse (Famalaro occupied) at 23192 Verdugo" in Laguna 
Hills. Two types of DNA testing were being done, the statement said, and 
"results to date show that the blood found at the warehouse matches that of 
Denise Huber." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint charging Famalaro with murder included the "special 
circumstance" of kidnaping. "Due to the special-circumstance allegation, 
Famalaro is eligible for the death penalty," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder victim's father, Dennis Huber, said from the family home in Newport 
Beach that he and his wife, Ione, were greatly relieved that the jurisdictional 
issue had finally been resolved, and that his daughter's body would be released 
in time for a twice-postponed funeral now scheduled for Tuesday in South 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "It closes the chapter, but not the book," Dennis Huber said. He added that he 
had "mixed feelings" about the case being transferred to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it might have been an easier prosecution over there," he said. "I 
think it will be a fair trial and justice will be served. It just might be 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's defense attorney, Thomas K. Kelly, agreed with that assessment. 
"From Day One, I believed it to be in my client's best interest to have the 
case tried in California," he said, adding that the obstacles to imposing the 
death penalty are more easily overcome in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, only two of California's more than 300 Death Row inmates have been 
executed since 1977, even though the death penalty was restored in California 
in that year. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one good aspect to the case being transferred, Dennis Huber said, 
it is that "we know a lot of people here, and if we come out for the trial 
we've had a lot of offers from people to stay at their homes." The Hubers are 
planning to move from Newport Beach to North Dakota in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors were looking 
into the possibility of filing a murder charge with other special 
circumstances. California reserves the death penalty generally for those 
killers who commit a second crime, such as rape or robbery, in connection with 
the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 When her body was discovered, Huber's eyes and mouth had been covered with 
cotton and sealed shut with duct tape. Autopsy results have not been officially 
released, but officials say there are no obvious signs of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to prove kidnaping, the state must show that a person was 
"transported against his or her will by force or threat of force," and defense 
attorneys say a persuasive argument could be made that Denise Huber might have 
willingly accepted a lift from a passing motorist when she found herself 
stranded on a dark freeway at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said the murder complaint was filed late in the day, and that documents 
supporting a request for an arrest warrant have been sealed by the court. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Famalaro will continue to be held without bail in Arizona's Yavapai County 
Jail pending extradition to Orange County, said Yavapai County Sheriff Buck 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he waves extradition, he'll go quick (to Orange County). If he doesn't, he 
goes slow. But he goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the Yavapai County attorney's office has filed papers requesting 
that all evidence seized in three searches of Famalaro's home here be turned 
over to Orange County authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yavapai County grand jury last week indicted Famalaro on first-degree 
murder and grand theft charges, but those charges are expected to be put on 
hold and ultimately dropped now that Orange County prosecutors are taking over 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia was traveling to Prescott 
late Thursday night and was expected to meet with Kelly and Famalaro to discuss 
proceedings in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro must be found to be indigent, lacking the financial resources to hire 
his own attorney, in order to qualify for the services of a public defender. 
But he has stated in court records that he is penniless and it is widely 
assumed that Gumlia will be appointed to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said he was considering fighting Famalaro's extradition to California, 
but said Thursday that will be a joint decision made by himself and Gumlia. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is this is a very high-profile case in Orange County. I'm 
really concerned about Mr. Famalaro," Kelly said. "I don't know what is going 
to happen to him there." 
</P>
<P>
 If Famalaro's attorneys decided to fight Famalaro's extradition to Orange 
County, Yavapai Deputy County Counsel Thomas B. Lindberg said it could take at 
least four weeks and probably longer to resolve the matter. If not, Lindberg 
said Famalaro could be moved within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yavapai prosecutor said he would have liked to have handled the case, but 
acknowledged that it had become a distraction for the office because of the 
intense media interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard to get things done," Lindberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that Yavapai officials would continue to provide any help that 
Orange County authorities needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides are being cooperative as ever," Lindberg said. "That's not going 
to change. They (Orange County authorities) are not going to be out in the cold 
on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Department Detective Lt. Ron Smith, who has been working 
10-hour workdays in Prescott for almost two weeks as he struggles with fellow 
Costa Mesa detectives Lynda Giesler and Frank Rudisill to piece together the 
strongest case possible against Famalaro, said Thursday was really "one long 
day . . . just so much happening so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the blood at the Laguna Hills storage facility narrowed down the 
time between Huber's disappearance and her murder, which will help authorities 
create a case for kidnaping. It's a critical allegation, he said, because that 
is what would make Famalaro eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blood helps us to establish a shorter time period between the 
disappearance and the murder, which would show cause as to kidnap," Smith said. 
Smith said there are probably additional crimes involved with carting the body 
around for three years, but said police are instead focusing on the most 
serious charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that all evidence "points very strongly to Huber dying in that 
warehouse in Laguna Hills." He stopped short of ruling out the possibility that 
Famalaro might have had an accomplice, but said that is "less and less likely 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Orange County authorities agree that the killing took place in Laguna 
Hills, which is policed by the Orange County Sheriff's Department, it was 
decided that the Costa Mesa Police Department should handle the investigation 
because that was where Denise Huber disappeared and its detectives have the 
most experience with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our case from here on out," said Smith, adding that Costa Mesa police 
really had no preference about where the case should be tried. "Wherever the 
prosecution would be best, that's where everybody's heart has been at. The case 
came first. There was never any question." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Thursday, Yavapai County Superior Court Judge Raymond W. 
Weaver Jr. signed an order allowing the medical examiner to release Huber's 
body. Lindberg said he had spoken Thursday with Maricopa County Medical 
Examiner Dr. Philip E. Keen to make arrangements for the release of Denise 
Huber's body, but it was not immediately clear who would take possession of the 
body and how quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County coroner's pathologist wanted to review the body before the 
funeral, and Dr. Richard Fukumoto had flown from Orange County to Phoenix in 
hopes of conducting an examination last Friday. But he was denied access to her 
remains by Arizona medical examiners, who said the Orange County pathologist 
had no jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute led Dennis and Ione Huber to complain that Arizona "egos" were to 
blame for repeated delays in holding their daughter's funeral, which was 
postponed twice. Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department said 
Fukumoto has not requested another review of the body, and will simply review 
the work already performed by Maricopa County medical examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of jurisdiction also stalled forensic testing of other evidence, 
such as bloodstained clothing found at Famalaro's home, and several items that 
police speculate may have been the murder weapon. Arizona authorities were 
reluctant to conduct such forensic tests if the case was going to move to 
California, requiring a second round of identical tests in Orange County, or 
possibly the presence of Arizona crime technicians to testify at an Orange 
County trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Costa Mesa officers will need a large moving van to cart all the 
evidence back to Orange County, and that he expects those arrangements to be 
complete within a few days. Famalaro's parents, Anne and Angelo Famalaro, 
arrived at the Yavapai County Jail some two hours before normal visiting hours 
Thursday to see their son. They were accompanied by three female companions, 
whom Anne Famalaro referred to as her "Maude Squad." 
</P>
<P>
 As they waited to enter the chamber where they would speak to their son 
through a plate-glass window using a telephone, Anne Famalaro was animated and 
visibly agitated, talking with her husband and three female friends about the 
case being moved to California, the possibility of the death penalty, the 
lawyers she has consulted with, and the media frenzy that has surrounded her 
family since her son's arrest two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to bother you for the rest of your life," one of the women said 
as they waited. "Unless he gets the death penalty," added another. "But even 
that can take 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Famalaro was making a living as a 
jack-of-all-trades. 
</P>
<P>
 He did house painting and repairing, carpet cleaning and most recently turned 
to real estate when his state contracting license was revoked because of 
customer complaints about shoddy workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors described him as a moody sort who one day would be chatting with 
residents about everything from the weather to his work, while another day he 
would refuse to make eye contact or acknowledge a neighbor's wave as he walked 
to pick up his mail or newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all his neighbors, however, had gripes about eyesores at Famalaro's 
home, where law enforcement authorities say he lived like a pack rat. Paint 
cans, tools and the now notorious rental truck took up much of the driveway, 
while lumber and tools littered his balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, law enforcement officers found a cluttered home, and noted that it was 
oddly organized. Scores of dated magazines were neatly grouped and stacked. 
Famalaro ordered his books by subject, and they included medical and law 
textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bizarre items were seized from inside, including women's clothing that 
appeared to carry bloodstains, as well as women's personal identification. 
</P>
<P>
 The finds set off fears that Famalaro was a serial killer -- but those fears 
remain unfounded, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have tracked down 11 women whose names turned up in Famalaro's 
home to ensure their whereabouts -- and all have been found safe. Authorities 
are still searching for another woman, Patricia Gage, whose Social Security 
card was found in Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have linked Famalaro to Huber's death through additional items 
discovered in his house, including Huber's clothing and personal identification 
collected in a box in a garage, keys to the freezer and handcuffs, evidence 
that Famalaro purchased the freezer nine days after Huber disappeared, and 
Orange County newspaper clippings that chronicled the young woman's 
disappearance.

MAJOR CRIME BILL OKD BY CONFEREES; CONGRESS: LONG-DELAYED MEASURE THAT WOULD 
BOLSTER POLICE FORCES AND BAN ASSAULT GUNS GOES TO HOUSE, SENATE FOR LIKELY 
VOTES NEXT WEEK. REPUBLICANS CALL IT A 'BIG-SPENDING BOONDOGGLE.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate and House negotiators ended a political impasse and approved a massive 
$32.8-billion crime bill Thursday that would put 100,000 more police officers 
on the street, ban combat-style assault weapons, build more prisons and require 
life terms for three-time violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-delayed measure, immediately hailed by President Clinton as the 
"toughest, largest and smartest federal attack on crime" in U.S. history, was 
sent to the House and the Senate for up-or-down votes, which are expected next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 While Democratic leaders predicted that the bill would be approved in both 
chambers, Republicans denounced it as a "big-spending boondoggle" that would be 
too soft on criminals. In addition, many Democrats in the Congressional Black 
Caucus were unhappy over the failure to include a controversial "racial 
justice" provision aimed at halting bias in imposing the death penalty. Other 
Democrats opposed the new weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates, however, said that the 1,100-page measure strikes the right balance 
between punishment and prevention, including strong provisions to deal with 
violence against women and $1 billion to add 1,000 agents and bolster control 
of illegal immigration at the nation's borders. It also includes dozens of new 
federal death penalties and stiffer sentencing provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate the agreement Thursday, Clinton appeared with 200 law enforcement 
officers from across the nation at a Justice Department rally, complete with a 
brass band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assure you I will sign it into law without delay," Clinton said. "It puts 
more police on the street and takes more children off the street. It puts 
violent criminals behind bars and gives others the chance to avoid a life 
behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
 The President clearly hopes that the crime bill will reverse the downward 
trend in his popularity ratings. Public opinion polls have indicated that crime 
is regarded as the most pressing concern in all parts of the nation, far ahead 
of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times Poll this week indicated that the crime bill enjoys broad 
support, with 67% of those surveyed nationally in favor of the bill and 26% 
opposed. Even those who identified themselves as Republicans backed the 
measure, 64% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 As the legislation made its way through Congress, Clinton had to walk a 
politically difficult line, backing some get-tough provisions admired by 
conservatives and moderates in his party but also supporting 
multibillion-dollar spending on prevention programs that appealed to liberal 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 His supporters in Congress dropped some major Republican proposals, including 
one by Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) that would have made it a federal 
offense to commit a crime with a gun and another by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), 
that would have imposed mandatory minimum sentences from 10 years to life in 
prison for carrying or using a gun during the commission of a crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said that these provisions would have turned scores of thousands of 
routine crimes into federal offenses that are better handled at the state and 
local levels, thus clogging federal courts and federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, leading Republicans, who had tried without success to cut spending 
on crime prevention programs and devote the funds to prison construction or to 
law enforcement, indicated that they would oppose the measure on the House and 
Senate floors on grounds that it contains $7.3 billion of dubious social 
spending and is not tough enough on hard-core criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's loaded with billions of dollars for pork," complained Sen. Orrin G. 
Hatch (R-Utah), who said that he is inclined to vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the tough provisions are gone," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). "Congress may have flunked its most important crime-fighting 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats got a 'twofer' -- a crime bill and President Clinton's stimulus 
program," quipped Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), alluding to Clinton's defeated 
1993 plan to spend $16 billion to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation contains a unique funding arrangement, funneling $30.2 billion 
in savings from cutbacks in federal payrolls over the next six years into a 
trust fund that will be used to finance almost all of the anti-crime programs. 
An additional $2.6 billion was authorized, mostly for prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest share of funds -- $13.4 billion -- would be earmarked for law 
enforcement and courts. Of that total, $8.8 billion was allocated for 100,000 
community-based police, or about a 20% increase in police strength nationally. 
That element would carry out one of Clinton's campaign promises. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles area, for example, would get funds to add 1,500 to 2,000 
police officers for a period of six years, after which local governments would 
have to take over the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city would receive about $28 million in Local Partnership Act 
funds, which allow broad discretion for cities to design their own 
crime-fighting programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants for more officers would be made by the Justice Department, partly under 
a formula that would assure every state a share of the funds. Local governments 
would have to put up a share equal to 25% of the federal outlay. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $8.3 billion from the trust fund and another $2.2 billion from 
general revenues would be allocated for state and local prison construction or 
operation. Of that total, $1.8 billion would be used to help compensate states 
for imprisoning illegal immigrants who commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $1.3 billion would be spent on "drug courts," a system that requires 
treatment for addicts rather than imprisoning them. A total of $425 million 
would be allocated for drug treatment of federal and state prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 About $7.3 billion would be spent over the six-year period for a range of 
crime prevention programs, such as grants to high-crime areas for economic 
development, anti-gang activities, midnight sports leagues, youth employment 
services and police partnerships with children. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to avoid a Senate filibuster, the conferees dropped the House-passed 
"racial justice" provision that would have allowed challenges to death 
sentences on the basis of statistical evidence indicating racial bias in the 
criminal justice process. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Times Poll indicated that a large majority of those questioned -- 
63% to 23% -- opposed the racial justice measure. Even blacks opposed the 
measure but by a smaller margin, 46% to 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton indicated that he would sign an executive order to deal with racial 
bias in the administration of the death penalty in federal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill represents a setback for the National Rifle Assn., which had led the 
fight in Congress against the ban on 19 specific semiautomatic assault weapons 
and their look-alike versions that was championed in the Senate by Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer David Lauter contributed to this story. The $33-Billion 
Compromise 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise reached by House and Senate negotiators would: 
</P>
<P>
 Put 100,000 more police on the street 
</P>
<P>
 Build more prisons 
</P>
<P>
 Ban 19 basic models of assault-style firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Provide life imprisonment for three-time violent felons whose third offense 
was a federal crime. Where the Money Would Go

JURY AWARDS $312,000 TO O.C. CANCER PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that adds fuel to a national health care debate, a Superior Court 
jury in Los Angeles Thursday awarded damages of $312,000 to a Tustin woman 
whose insurer had refused to pay for an expensive breast cancer treatment that 
she believes saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, voting 10 to 2, found that Blue Shield of California had acted 
unreasonably in adopting a blanket policy of rejecting such treatment -- bone 
marrow transplantation in conjunction with high-dose chemotherapy -- for women 
with metastatic breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Schoenburg, 50, who brought the lawsuit, said she felt overwhelming 
relief when the jury returned the verdict Thursday morning after seven weeks of 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just put my head down on the table and cried," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the decision does not change Blue Shield's policy, the trial raised 
issues that are the subject of continuing controversy nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when employers, who control most health insurance purchasing, are 
pushing their insurers and health care providers to slash costs, pressure is 
also building to force insurers and health maintenance organizations to pay for 
a wider array of potentially life-saving treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers worry about having coverage decisions taken out of their hands, with 
both courts and legislatures intervening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schoenburg case is at least the third of its kind to go to trial in 
California. Last December, a Riverside County jury returned an $89-million 
verdict against Health Net, the large, Woodland Hills-based health maintenance 
organization, for denying the treatment to breast cancer patient Nelene Fox, 
who died at age 40 before the case reached trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), Democratic nominee for state insurance 
commissioner, is sponsoring a bill now before the California Senate that would 
require insurers to cover physician-recommended treatments for any 
life-threatening condition providing that the treatment is considered safe and 
effective by the relevant national medical body -- the American Society of 
Clinical Oncologists, in the case of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the Schoenburg case is the fact that Blue Shield is not her 
direct insurer. Because her husband, Robert, is a lawyer for Caltrans, Judith 
Schoenburg is insured by the California Public Employees Retirement System. 
CalPERS hired Blue Shield to administer its health plan, and Blue Shield -- 
with CalPERS approval -- applied the same standards it uses in its own plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Schoenburg underwent the bone marrow transplant and a high-dose 
chemotherapy regimen in 1992 and has had no recurrence of the cancer. However, 
the $312,000 in medical costs forced her and her husband to borrow against 
their home. Had the jury not decided as it did, "We'd have lost the house," 
Robert Schoenburg said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield rejects the treatment for all breast cancer patients, contending 
that it has not been proven safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>
 During trial, a Blue Shield physician testified that the insurer receives -- 
and rejects -- about three requests per month for such treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were told at the trial that numerous other insurers, including Blue 
Cross of California, cover the procedure on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Thursday afternoon, most of the jurors said they believed that 
Blue Shield adopted the policy solely to save money rather than because it 
considered the treatment unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Diana Bailli of Rosemead said she was particularly upset by testimony 
that such treatment requests get only token consideration before being 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take someone's file and give it a cursory, 15-minute review, that's 
not right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all seven jurors interviewed said they were disappointed by a judge's 
ruling preventing them from assessing punitive damages against Blue Shield. The 
jury consisted of 10 women and two men; both men voted in Schoenberg's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge David A. Horowitz ruled out punitive damages on grounds that there was 
no evidence that Blue Shield had acted maliciously. He also dropped CalPERS as 
a defendant in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schoenburgs and their attorney, Michael J. Bidart, took several jurors to 
lunch after the verdict was returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-spoken Judith Schoenburg said she was exhausted but elated. She said she 
felt strongly that she had been treated unjustly by CalPERS and Blue Shield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know about 14 women who had this procedure, and all of them had it paid 
for," she said. "I'm the only one who didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Schoenburg said he hoped the verdict would "send a message to Blue 
Shield that they can't get away with this kind of policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield attorney A. Robert Singer said it was too early to speculate on 
whether the insurer would appeal, since several issues remain to be decided 
through post-trial motions. The judge could conceivably reverse the verdict 
based on the motions, Singer said. One issue to be decided is whether Blue 
Shield -- as administrator rather than direct insurer -- should be held 
responsible for a coverage policy that CalPERS approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said the verdict also raises a fundamental question: "Are organizations 
involved in the provision of health care services going to be able to make 
informed and rational decisions regarding medical treatment, or will they be 
subject to second-guessing and perhaps serious financial penalties at the hands 
of people who -- however well-intentioned they may be -- do not bring a great 
deal of medical expertise or experience to the table?"

CONFUSION MARS U.S. EFFORT TO AID RWANDANS; AFRICA: DESPITE PROMISE OF 
'IMMEDIATE AND MASSIVE' RELIEF, ONLY A TRICKLE HAS REACHED EXHAUSTED REFUGEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after President Clinton announced an "immediate and massive" increase 
in aid to alleviate the suffering of the 1.2 million Rwandan refugees here, 
deliveries of American relief supplies have barely begun and the operation 
appears marred by woeful confusion and delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a growing buildup of supplies in distant depots, only a trickle of 
emergency aid sent under "Operation Support Hope" has reached the sick and 
exhausted refugees. Doctors say a growing number are now dying from lack of 
water, as well as from a fierce cholera epidemic and outbreaks of measles and 
meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry is due to arrive Sunday for a visit here 
and at the operation's airlift staging site at Entebbe International Airport 
near Kampala, the capital of Uganda. One of his missions will be to sort out an 
American operation that has had virtually no impact here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been screaming up the chain of command to say get your act together," 
one angry U.S. officer said. "It's been a very frustrating experience." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.N. official here said the American effort has been disappointing so 
far. "We keep getting a lot of promises, but then we keep waiting," he said. 
"We need the Americans. We're desperately, urgently waiting for them. But right 
now, all we've got is promises." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 20 U.S. military flights and 75 soldiers and civilian contractors have 
landed at Goma's chaotic airport so far, including an 18-member airlift support 
team that flew in Thursday. By contrast, Doctors Without Borders, the largest 
of the non-governmental groups working here, has posted a staff of 120.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military has brought about 71 tons of humanitarian aid, including 
oral rehydration salts, high-protein biscuits and medicine. Other flights have 
carried rice and cooking oil. More than 300 tons of relief supplies from other 
groups pass through the airport each day.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. forces have also brought a large forklift and 15 other vehicles, 
including Humvees, pickup trucks, two firetrucks and a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the initial troops were surprisingly ill-prepared. Most have slept in two 
borrowed tents inside the French Foreign Legion compound at the airport. They 
have only three satellite phones, including one that arrived Thursday. Many of 
the TV networks camped nearby have more. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Capt. David Burgess of the 436th Airlift Control Squadron at Dover 
Air Force Base in Delaware arrived with neither a uniform nor a razor. He was 
in Nairobi, Kenya, when he was ordered to assess needs at the airport here. He 
quickly hitched a ride on a relief plane flown by Ukrainian pilots.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here seven days," he said, scratching his stubble. "I told them six 
days ago what I needed. That's my job here. I need 30 people and equipment. And 
I've waited and waited and waited." 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent the week driving a forklift at the airport, and slept in it one 
night as well. "I'm a C-5 pilot," he added. "Get the picture?" 
</P>
<P>
 About 420 American troops have been deployed at Entebbe. Twenty who arrived 
Thursday are to assess a possible support role at Kigali, the largely empty 
capital of Rwanda, according to U.S. Army Col. Robert Mirelson, spokesman for 
the military operation here.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. airlift began Sunday when three Air Force planes parachuted seven 
tons of food and clothes near the Katale refugee camp. But the airdrop proved 
more an embarrassment than a help since only one-third the promised supplies 
were dropped, they included such unusual items as chocolate and mittens, and 
the pallets nearly hit a Zairian school and a U.N. helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent American aid has been just as disappointing, relief workers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite widespread publicity about the arrival of two water purification units 
early this week, for example, the first delivery of 15,000 gallons of clean 
water produced by the Americans didn't start until Wednesday. About 24,000 
gallons were produced Thursday, or enough for about 20,000 refugees for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army 2nd Lt. Carl Brosky, who heads a 42-member team of soldiers and 
civilians who have set up camp here, said it would take up to another week to 
hook up eight huge "super-chlorination" units and achieve full production of 
500,000 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Since relief groups estimate the refugees need five liters of water, or just 
over a gallon, each day to survive, that will be enough for only one-third of 
the refugee population. And that assumes the water gets to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the United States didn't deliver any tankers, the United Nations is 
delivering the clean water to Kibumba refugee camp in six locally hired trucks 
usually used to haul gasoline. A yellow, 55,000-liter truck, with "Petroleum" 
marked in huge letters on the side, was pumped with water Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 John Crosthwaite, the convoy manager, said three other gas trucks had been 
sent for cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the long-awaited military airlift support team that arrived 
Thursday was able to bring only one-third its 60-member team and half its gear. 
It won't begin full operations before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the team left the United States on Sunday, the airlift and 
airport specialists spent three days waiting at Moron Air Base in Spain before 
finally getting clearance to come. One officer said Franco-American military 
rivalry was part of the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a lot of time prepared, ready and capable of being here," said Capt. 
Tom Mauchly, the operations officer. "We were told the French were concerned we 
were going to eat their food, drink their water and take their space." 
</P>
<P>
 France sent about 3,000 troops to eastern Zaire and southwest Rwanda in June 
in an attempt to stop the massacres of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis 
by the majority Hutu-led government and militias. The Tutsi-led rebels later 
took over the country, sparking a mass exodus of refugees.

AVIATION OFFICIALS VOW FAST ACTION TO ENSURE SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Facing criticism for their handling of the Boeing 757 wake turbulence problem, 
federal aviation officials Thursday vowed to move more swiftly to alert those 
in the airline industry to potential safety hazards and announced new measures 
intended to prevent accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement marked the second time that the Federal Aviation 
Administration has taken safety-related steps following disclosures that agency 
officials had been warned about the potential danger of wake turbulence created 
by 757s years before two fatal accidents claimed 13 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and 
Aviation, FAA Administrator David R. Hinson pledged that within 60 days his 
agency would review the role of its Office of Aviation Safety and create an 
efficient method to identify and act upon safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have asked specifically that they define management responsibility and 
accountability more clearly, so that we may be confident that safety issues are 
raised and receive appropriate priorities," Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson said the agency has hired an official of Rand Corp., a well-known think 
tank, whose top priorities will include ensuring that safety concerns raised by 
scientists and researchers within the FAA get a proper hearing inside and 
outside the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And starting this weekend -- at a convention of general aviation pilots in 
Oshkosh, Wis. -- the FAA's Flight Standards and Aviation Safety office will 
disseminate information to pilots on the wake turbulence issue, Hinson said. He 
said the agency will quickly establish a process that makes certain that 
"emerging safety issues are addressed promptly and effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson's announcements came two days after an internal report concluded that 
the FAA may have mishandled the 757 wake turbulence issue because bureaucracy 
and poor communication sometimes compromised the agency's ability to pinpoint 
and respond to potential safety problems in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the internal report and Thursday's hearing were prompted by a June 5 
story in The Times, revealing that internal documents showed that the FAA had 
been warned about the 757 wake turbulence hazard by its own chief scientist, 
Robert E. Machol, starting in 1989. Eleven days before the first of two fatal 
accidents related to 757 turbulence, Machol had predicted to FAA managers that 
a "major crash" would occur if the agency failed to take actions to protect 
planes, especially smaller ones, landing behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Subcommittee members Thursday repeatedly expressed concerns that the FAA could 
-- and should -- have acted sooner on the 757 turbulence issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, most appeared to believe that the agency should have publicly 
drawn attention to the problem sometime between the first fatal accident in 
Billings, Mont., in December, 1992, and the second, in Santa Ana, in December, 
1993. The Billings crash took eight lives; the Santa Ana crash killed five 
people, including the top two officials of the In-N-Out Burgers chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Both accidents happened after private aircraft encountered wake turbulence 
from 757s landing in front of them -- the very scenario Machol had laid out in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony at Thursday's hearing, Machol, who retired from the FAA April 
30, said there was "nothing brilliant about any of these predictions. There 
(were) very good, solid reasons" for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the blunt-spoken, former college professor portrayed the FAA as being the 
victim of a "bureaucratic stasis that sometimes gets in the way of anything 
useful" being achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a situation where someone who seems to know what he's talking about 
made a prediction that a cataclysmic accident could happen," said subcommittee 
member Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, (R-Huntington Beach). While the FAA often does 
its job well, Rohrabacher said, "the way they did it in this particular case . 
. . perhaps cost the lives of some innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
 Subcommittee members seized on the point that while the FAA has said nothing 
it could have done would have prevented the two fatal accidents, the fact that 
the agency in May announced new policies on controllers' handling of 757s, as 
well as Hinson's announcements during the hearing, suggests otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things should have been done that probably could have (prevented) these 
accidents -- at least one of them," said Rep. Thomas Lewis (R-Florida), a pilot 
and veteran congressman who requested the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Timothy Valentine (D-North Carolina), said, "I 
believe the majority of the criticisms leveled at the FAA in this case are on 
target." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at one point by Rohrabacher if some of the recently instituted 
operational procedures regarding 757s may have "averted these two tragedies," 
Hinson paused and said, "Yes, perhaps." 
</P>
<P>
 In what congressional sources described as an unusual measure, Valentine 
agreed that the subcommittee would soon meet in an executive session and draft 
a letter to Hinson. The action is intended to put more pressure on Hinson to 
follow through with the numerous safety-related measures he has promised to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to follow up and make sure they get their act together," one 
congressional source said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the five-hour hearing, subcommittee members also expressed concerns 
about why aviation officials in Canada and the United Kingdom took action on 
the 757 turbulence issue before the FAA did; whether the FAA can balance its 
two missions of ensuring safety and promoting the airline industry; and when 
the agency will hire a new chief scientist to replace Machol. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Machol and Hinson, the subcommittee heard testimony from officials 
representing the National Transportation Safety Board, the Boeing Co., the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's aviation safety reporting 
system, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National 
Business Aircraft Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's actions by the FAA come two months after the agency in May adopted 
a policy requiring smaller planes in most instances to stay four miles behind 
757s during landings to avoid their potentially deadly wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is not a consensus on the level of danger, the 757's "clean" wing 
and body design appear to make it capable of producing higher-intensity levels 
of wake turbulence, funnels of air emanating from each wingtip containing 
hurricane-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to recommendations made by the NTSB last February, the FAA also 
announced in May that air traffic controllers would be required to exercise 
caution when dealing with aircraft landing and taking off behind 757s, and to 
encourage 757 pilots to use established approach paths so that other pilots 
would not unwittingly fly into their wakes. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the FAA has resisted increasing the separation distance for planes 
landing behind 757s because it could cut the number of flights at the nation's 
busiest airports. That could result in delays and revenue losses for the 
aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson told subcommittee members that the agency does not factor in how the 
industry will be affected by the FAA's decision-making process. But internal 
documents obtained this week through the Freedom of Information Act showed that 
FAA officials, while deliberating on what to do about the 757 wake turbulence 
problem, raised the issue of how Boeing might be affected by any decision they 
might make.

DECADES OF FBI FILES ON BERNSTEIN ARE RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to know what pieces the late composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein played 
at a 1940s benefit for the Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee? Or what the 
performers wore during a Washington rehearsal of his celebrated "Mass"? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers -- Brahms and boogie-woogie, and some wore hot pants -- along with 
a great many other details of Bernstein's life, are contained in more than 600 
pages of FBI files compiled on the famed musician over three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's liberal political activities, no matter how trivial or well-known, 
were assiduously chronicled with the help of informants and news clippings for 
the ultimately futile purpose of proving that Bernstein was a Communist. 
</P>
<P>
 The typed confidential memos reveal the sometimes comical lengths to which the 
FBI went as it attempted to endow Bernstein's comings and goings with sinister 
meanings, reflecting an era when the agency delved freely into the lives of 
prominent citizens, ever on the hunt for Communist sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI's monitoring of Bernstein started in the 1940s during the Red scares 
that permeated American politics and continued into the 1970s, when the White 
House was informed of an alleged plot by Bernstein to embarrass President 
Richard Nixon at a performance dedicating the Kennedy Center for the Performing 
Arts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, one of this century's most celebrated American musicians, knew of 
the files, even citing them as evidence of the FBI's attempts to discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't seem to rile him up. I think it disappointed him," said Schuyler 
Chapin, a longtime friend of Bernstein's and one of the executors of his 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bernstein's death in 1990, Chapin and others in Bernstein's circles 
examined copies of the files, which contain numerous passages blacked out by 
the FBI before they were released. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction was sadness that we had reached a point in our country that a 
distinguished artist was being fingered by the FBI because they didn't like his 
political opinions," said Chapin, who is New York City's commissioner of 
cultural affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all curious to know what it is that has been blacked out," Chapin 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the files through a 
Freedom of Information Act request and released them Thursday to the Los 
Angeles Times and the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Parachini, public affairs director for the ACLU's Southern California 
chapter, said the ACLU will file an appeal challenging the FBI's deletion of 
several dozen pages for national security and other reasons. He speculated that 
the missing information may deal with Bernstein's private life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be hilarious if it weren't so serious," Parachini said of the fat 
Bernstein file. "Clearly the FBI invested thousands of person-hours of 
surveillance on the activities of Leonard Bernstein and other individuals who 
should have never come under FBI scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past decade, journalists and scholars have shown that under 
Director J. Edgar Hoover's long reign, the FBI maintained numerous files on 
figures ranging from John Lennon to Ernest Hemingway, Eleanor Roosevelt and 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the documents released Thursday, the FBI's inquiry into 
Bernstein's activities yielded little or no startling information.  
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't actually prove anything that we didn't know all along -- that 
Bernstein was a sympathizer with liberal causes," said Humphrey Burton, whose 
biography of Bernstein was published this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The files examine those sympathies in sometimes absurd detail, recording his 
membership in groups deemed "Communist fronts," his hobnobbing with suspected 
Communists, his "anti-American" comments and his travels abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidential Informant of known reliability advised May 7, 1945, that during 
an executive board meeting of the American Committee for Spanish Freedom held 
on March 30, 1945, at 11 Gramercy Park, New York City, it was announced that 
Leonard Bernstein had consented to dedicate a musical number to a 'Free Spain,' 
" one entry says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ample references to mention of Bernstein by the House Un-American 
Activities Committee, which chilled Hollywood and much of the rest of the 
nation's cultural community with its hearings in the 1940s and 1950s on the 
alleged Communist affiliations of major arts and entertainment figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The often repetitive files note that Bernstein's parents were both born in 
Russia, that he just returned from a European tour, that his wife, Felicia, 
once leased her apartment to someone reported to be a Communist Party member. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1955 cable, labeled urgent, advises that Vice President Nixon has accepted 
honorary chairmanship of an organization headed by Bernstein. A 1959 memo notes 
that Bernstein "is now being heralded in Moscow." Another summary refers to the 
fact that he was a judge in a 1947 musical talent contest for the National 
Negro Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents also include Hoover's response to a 1961 letter in which a nun 
inquires about Bernstein's political leanings. Hoover replies that he cannot 
furnish any information, but suggests she read his book "Masters of Deceit" on 
how to fight Communism. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, according to the documents, information on Bernstein was sent to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, investigators report that Bernstein participated in an Alabama civil 
rights march and that in 1971 he and his wife hosted a fund-raising party for 
anti-war activist Philip Berrigan, collecting $35,000. There is also reference 
to a widely publicized fund-raising party given by Bernstein's wife for the 
Black Panther Party, as well as recommendations to plant information with 
"cooperative" media on the criminal history of one of the Black Panthers who 
attended the gathering in Bernstein's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The monitoring continued into the mid-1970s, despite a 1955 acknowledgment 
that "the only available evidence linking Bernstein with the Communist Party 
was based on hearsay rather than personal knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 That the files would be crammed with secondhand information was typical, said 
Peter Buckingham, author of "America Sees Red," a history of anti-radical 
thought and action in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They start snooping around and end up reporting really hearsay in these 
files," Buckingham said. "It's really smear stuff . . . laughable but scary." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI had little to fear from Bernstein, according to Joan Peyser, who wrote 
a 1987 biography of the conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I found Bernstein to be in many ways to be quite a passive man. . . 
. He would join the most liberal to radical causes and sign petitions. And yet 
when he was confronted with it and there was any kind of risk to his career he 
would try to extricate himself. I don't have any evidence he was a 
card-carrying Communist."

D.A. DEFERS DECISION ON CHARGES AGAINST COWLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A close friend of O.J. Simpson who was arrested last month on charges of 
harboring the famed athlete during his six-hour disappearance will not face 
criminal charges, at least for now, prosecutors announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney's office has determined that further investigation is 
required to make a decision on whether to file criminal charges against Allen 
Cowlings," a statement released by the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office said. "Therefore, no criminal charges are being filed at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings' attorney, Donald Re, welcomed the news that his client would not be 
charged, but also noted that prosecutors have not ruled out bringing charges in 
the future. That leaves Cowlings vulnerable to a future prosecution and could 
complicate matters for the Simpson defense team if it seeks to call him as a 
witness in their case. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern at this point is that they may be trying to use him to gain some 
tactical advantage in the Simpson case," Re said. "I'm concerned that that may 
be lingering in the background here." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the decision not to file charges against Cowlings means that 
his $250,000 bond will be returned to him at a court appearance today, Re said. 
The announcement came amid two other developments in the Simpson case: Closely 
watched DNA tests got under way outside Washington, and a lawyer representing 
the parents of Nicole Brown Simpson said he hoped O.J. Simpson would not 
contest their efforts to win legal guardianship of his two young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were stabbed to death June 12. Last 
week, Simpson pleaded "absolutely, 100% not guilty" to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cowlings case, Re emphasized that prosecutors had not shared any plans 
with him, but he added that their decision to leave his client "hanging" could 
make it harder for Cowlings to testify for Simpson if his former teammate 
wanted him to take the stand. With criminal charges still a possibility, 
Cowlings would almost certainly be advised not to testify and instead exercise 
his right against self-incrimination as guaranteed under the 5th Amendment, Re 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a strategy move on their part," Simpson lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. 
said of the decision not to drop charges against Cowlings. "Will he be 
prevented from testifying on our behalf because he has this thing hanging over 
him? That's fundamentally unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the potential impact on the Simpson case, Cochran called on prosecutors 
to resolve the Cowlings matter before Simpson goes to trial -- which could 
happen as early as September. 
</P>
<P>
 According to law enforcement sources, police recovered nearly $10,000 and 
Simpson's passport from the car after he and Cowlings were arrested June 17. 
Partly in light of that evidence, investigators have said they believe Simpson 
was fleeing, not preparing to kill himself. Evidence of flight to avoid 
prosecution can be introduced to suggest that a criminal defendant had a 
"consciousness of guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Re has said that if money and the passport were indeed recovered from the car, 
Cowlings was not aware of them. 
</P>
<P>
 If he chose to testify in the Simpson case, Cowlings could bolster the 
contention of Simpson's attorneys that he was not fleeing prosecution but 
rather was on the verge of killing himself, Re said. But the decision to leave 
the Cowlings investigation open makes it much more difficult for him to take 
the stand, legal experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes Cowlings unavailable for either side in the Simpson case," said 
Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, a noted Los Angeles criminal defense attorney, agreed, 
saying that as long as Cowlings faces criminal charges, Simpson "effectively is 
deprived of a relevant witness." Braun added, however, that Cowlings could 
elect to testify at his own risk, knowing that it could be used against him if 
charges are someday filed but electing to go forward out of loyalty to his 
lifelong friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as prosecutors were backing away from their pursuit of Cowlings, their 
experts joined with several from the defense to start a test that could 
influence the Simpson case profoundly. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Germantown, Md., private laboratory, experts for O.J. Simpson's defense 
team were on hand when 10% was carved from blood samples discovered outside his 
ex-wife's Brentwood home, at his nearby estate and on his Ford Bronco. The 
samples were split so experts can conduct future tests if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducting the actual tests at the Cellmark Diagnostics lab are analysts hired 
by Los Angeles prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival Thursday morning of defense experts Dr. Henry Lee and Dr. Edward 
Blake was a surprise, because Simpson's attorneys had announced one day earlier 
that they would not participate in the DNA testing because the conditions being 
placed on them were too limiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from the brick and glass complex just before the firm closed for the 
day, Lee said the conditions for the testing set by Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Lance A. Ito are "unacceptable for both of us -- Dr. Blake and myself. 
Therefore we are not participating in the observation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense experts wanted to set aside a portion of the blood samples 
because "if we don't preserve some sample for the future, we don't have any 
chance to do any testing," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists were accompanied by Peter Neufeld, a New York attorney 
experienced in DNA cases. Neufeld has criticized the Cellmark laboratory in the 
past for producing "false positives." Simpson's attorneys may question the 
credibility of the lab and the admissibility in court of its test results. 
</P>
<P>
 Neufeld has sought stringent regulations on DNA testing and has tried to 
exclude it as evidence in several court cases. DNA, which contains an 
individual's genetic blueprint, can be tested using different methods. 
</P>
<P>
 The test that will be conducted in Maryland is called Restriction Fragment 
Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and is considered highly precise. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense team's samples, which were mutually agreed to by the defense 
experts and Cellmark analysts, will be stored in Cellmark's vault. Lee said 
analysts extracted six blood samples from the drops collected by police last 
month. But it "remains to be seen" whether the samples will be enough to get 
definitive results from the RFLP tests, Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellmark officials refused to comment on the case. Lee thanked the 
laboratory's scientists for their courtesy and said they "worked with us 
closely" in selecting the samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 3,000 miles away, a lawyer for the parents of Nicole Simpson said 
they have asked a court to formally nominate them as guardians for Simpson's 
daughter Sydney, 8, and son Justin, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do what's best for the children," said William M. Walker, a 
Santa Ana attorney who filed the guardianship petition for Nicole Simpson's 
father, Louis Brown. "They've been with their grandparents (since their 
mother's murder), and they're comfortable with their grandparents. I've been 
told that they are doing as best as can be expected under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary guardianship would allow the Browns, who live in coastal Orange 
County, to make decisions for the children, such as enrolling them in school 
and providing emergency health care, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said Louis and Juditha Brown are not trying to establish a permanent 
guardianship but one that is "reviewable whenever there is a change of 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson gets out of jail, he can petition the court to regain custody of 
his children, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton reported from Los Angeles; Leeds from Germantown, Md. Times staff 
writer Davan Maharaj in Orange County also contributed to this report.

MTA TALKS TO START; GUARDED OPTIMISM TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With talks scheduled to resume today between striking workers and the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, union and management officials expressed 
guarded optimism about getting Los Angeles' transit system back in gear, but 
there was no relief for bus-dependent riders and merchants bracing for a summer 
weekend without any service.  
</P>
<P>
 Two days after suspending the stalemated bargaining sessions, negotiating 
teams plan to hole up in an undisclosed hotel, where the MTA will again try to 
reach a compromise with its 1,900 mechanics, whose 5-day-old walkout has 
disrupted life for hundreds of thousands of commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the resumption of talks, MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin White 
continued his efforts to bypass the union leadership, revealing that he had 
mailed a conciliatory letter to each of the striking workers. Unimpressed, 
rank-and-file employees peppered White with jeers Thursday when he visited bus 
yards in Downtown Los Angeles and Highland Park, where they told him to "go 
back to New York" and challenged him to explain salaries of more than $100,000 
for transit executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to stand here and tell you management has done everything 
right," said the shirt-sleeved White, vowing that his financially strapped 
agency would not jeopardize the strikers' jobs in its effort to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Covarrubias, a striking mechanic at the Downtown yard, was not 
convinced. "He's just trying to brainwash us," Covarrubias said. "The man makes 
$175,000 a year. He's not talking about giving up any of his money." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as White and the workers waged their sidewalk debate, merchants along the 
normally bustling Broadway corridor -- one of Los Angeles' most bus-dependent 
shopping hubs -- could have rolled a bowling ball through their deserted stores 
without striking a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of selling boomboxes, TVs, men's silk shirts, jeans or groceries, the 
clerks ate sandwiches and burritos, talked on the telephone, stocked shelves 
and worried that things will get even worse when bus service evaporates 
altogether during the all-important weekend. The MTA estimated the strike is 
costing at least $1.5 million daily in lost sales and wages in the Downtown 
area alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ay, Dios!" Manuel Lopez, 50-year-old owner of Maria's Seafood, said as he 
threw up his hands. Inside his venerable Grand Central Market fish store was 
nearly $5,000 worth of salmon, shark and other fresh seafood that he feared 
would rot if his regular customers were unable to make it Downtown this 
weekend. "This is the worst time during 30 years in business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 4: 
</P>
<P>
 * The first Los Angeles transit strike in 12 years appeared destined to grind 
on at least into the weekend, with MTA management and the mechanics union still 
divided over the issue of subcontracting. MTA officials, who hope to save money 
by shifting some tasks to less expensive private companies, said they were 
pleased to see both parties back at the bargaining table. Union leaders, who 
consider subcontracting a threat to their jobs, also looked forward to the 
dialogue. "I can't predict what could happen at the bargaining table," said 
Mike Bujosa, president of the local Amalgamated Transit Union. "All I can say 
is that I feel positive we're at least talking." 
</P>
<P>
 * In his letter to striking workers, White promised employees that 
subcontracting would have no adverse impact on them. "Despite what you may have 
been told, I want you to know that no current ATU employee will lose his or her 
job as a result of any of the MTA's contract proposals to subcontract a limited 
amount of work," White said in the letter, dated Wednesday. He explained that 
subcontracting is one cost-cutting tool for the agency, which already has had 
to make up for a $126-million operating deficit. "The best job security of 
all," White concluded, is "a healthy MTA." 
</P>
<P>
 * Transit officials reported that a bus was hit by gunfire Wednesday near an 
Eastside MTA facility. A small-caliber bullet left a dent in the vehicle, 
officials said, but no one was injured and no suspects were in custody. Also 
Wednesday, a striking driver was arrested on charges of interfering with a 
police officer, who was citing another striker for allegedly throwing a soda 
can at a bus outside an MTA facility in South-Central Los Angeles. Meanwhile, 
several dozen two-inch nails were found scattered in the roadway outside the El 
Monte bus terminal. No MTA buses suffered damage, but several Foothill Transit 
buses had flat tires, MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of buses on the streets declined Thursday, from 345 to 339, as 
replacement drivers -- some of them veteran supervisors who had to relearn the 
basics of maneuvering a seven-ton bus -- began to tire from their 12-hour 
emergency shifts. Usually, 1,900 buses are in service, but 5,000 drivers and 
clerks have honored the mechanics' picket lines. Beginning today, the MTA plans 
to put an additional 20 buses on the road. The new buses, which will come from 
Riverside and Santa Barbara counties, will include more yellow school buses 
and, for the first time, touring buses. If the strike lasts, the MTA plans to 
add 10 more buses Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weekend service will be suspended altogether, largely because the MTA does 
not have enough drivers. Another concern, transit officials said, was the 
potential risk for fights among passengers if only a few buses were put in 
service and crowds began to form at bus stops. The Hollywood Bowl, which has 
concerts accompanied by fireworks scheduled for tonight and Saturday night, has 
contracted with Laidlaw to shuttle concert-goers from outlying parking lots 
this weekend. Buses to Dodger Stadium will be cut, but MTA officials said the 
service had not been attracting many fans and is due to be eliminated in 
September anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this was satisfactory to April Norton-Morgan, a 15-year-old high 
school student from South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really going to mess my schedule up," she said, waiting for a bus on 
Vermont Avenue, as she headed home from a USC summer camp. "On the weekends, I 
like to go out with my friends and get out of the house early. Now . . . I'm 
going to have to ask my mom for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The service cuts will be much more than an inconvenience along Broadway, which 
connects with some of the busiest weekend lines. Already, some shops had begun 
sending employees home, while others concocted creative schemes to keep from 
losing their weekend revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Josef Cohen, who manages two stores on Broadway for Sam's Electronics, said he 
will spend $50 for a van on Saturday and Sunday to ferry customers from their 
homes if they want to shop in person, or to deliver merchandise ordered over 
the telephone. Anyone who makes it in on their own -- and purchases one of his 
TVs, typewriters or car stereos -- automatically qualifies for a free ride 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are 97% empty compared to what we're supposed to have," Cohen said. "On 
the weekend, it's going to be even worse." 
</P>
<P>
 At Lorenzo Clothing, near 3rd Street and Broadway, manager Manuela Alvarado 
glumly ate a seafood taco doused with lime juice and listened to music booming 
over the store's stereo. Usually, she and the other clerk get one short break 
for lunch during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Alvarado was working alone and still, she said: "I can eat all 
day if I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway's fate rests in the hands of two groups who, so far, have not been 
able to get along. The formal bargaining sessions are being conducted in a San 
Fernando Valley hotel, which negotiators would rather not disclose for fear of 
being pestered by the media. Leading the discussions is veteran state mediator 
Tom McCarthy, who helped settle past Los Angeles transit strikes. He sometimes 
passes messages from one camp to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanics are represented by their local president, Bujosa, and Jim Wood, 
secretary-treasurer of the County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. Representing 
the MTA are Gordon Krischer, a $290-an-hour private attorney, and Ann Neeson, 
director of employee relations for the MTA. They sometimes meet together, and 
at other times, meet privately among their own staffs to assess proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, they negotiated for six hours before breaking about 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 White, the MTA chief, said he has been visiting the striking workers in person 
because most of them are "less strident" than the union leadership. But his 
Thursday excursions -- his sixth and seventh trips to a bus yard since workers 
walked out Monday at 12:01 a.m. -- were marked by testy exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you drive up, you never have an idea about how hostile they're going to 
be," said White, who was driven by the uniformed transit police chief, Sharon 
Papa. 
</P>
<P>
 When White arrived at the Highland Park bus yard, it was not clear whether he 
was immediately recognized by the strikers. They continued marching on the 
sidewalk in front of the driveway, despite a court order prohibiting them from 
blocking vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys, if you let us across, he'll get out and talk to you," Papa told the 
strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as they figured out who their visitor was, the taunts began. White 
tried to shake hands, but one of the strikers turned away. "I have no respect 
for the man," said Jose Loredo, a mechanic. "The man comes out here from New 
York. . . . He comes out here and lies." Undaunted, White rubbed shoulders with 
the crowd while about 10 transit police stood in a semicircle several feet 
behind him. "We're in a new era," he said. "We aren't going to be able to do in 
1994, '95 and '96 what we were doing 10 years ago. . . . We're broke." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our fault," one mechanic interrupted.  
</P>
<P>
 "Where was he before we went on strike?" Carlos Curiel, vice president of 
Amalgamated Transit Union, shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 One union member complained about previous work that has been contracted out 
to private companies, only to have to be fixed later by union mechanics. 
Another mechanic invited White to visit the maintenance yards more often. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come and see what your supervisors do in between naps," a mechanic said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that a low blow?" said a smiling White. 
</P>
<P>
 In another moment of lightheartedness, White grabbed a picket sign to shade 
himself from the fierce midday sun. For several of the strikers who happened to 
be toting cameras, it was a once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity: a snapshot of 
top management hoisting a union sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the day ended, union leaders already had printed up T-shirts capturing 
the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Patrick J. McDonnell contributed to this report. The MTA 
Strike: Day 4 
</P>
<P>
 The region's first transit strike in 12 years began at 12:01 a.m. Monday. Here 
is a look at Day 4: 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ISSUE: Dispute between the Amalgamated Transit Union, representing 1,900 
mechanics and service attendants, and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. About 5,000 bus and train drivers and clerks are honoring picket 
lines. The major sticking point is the MTA's demand to contract out work. Union 
members say they believe that it will eliminate jobs and result in poorer 
quality work. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE STATUS: Negotiations were scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT'S OPERATING: The transit agency planned to put 20 more buses into 
service today, increasing the number to about 365 buses serving portions of the 
34 busiest routes, out of the usual 1,900 buses on 200 routes. Some routes will 
use school buses, operated by private drivers, identified by "M" logos on the 
front and back. Service is continuing on the Red Line, Amtrak, Metrolink 
commuter rail and municipal/private operators such as Foothill Transit, L.A. 
city commuter express and DASH. The Blue Line is offering limited service. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ROUTES: 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is offering regular service on these routes:  
</P>
<P>
 204 Vermont Ave.; 240 Reseda Blvd.; 424 Ventura Blvd.-L.A., and 442 
Hawthorne-Manchester-Express and on the Red Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the following routes are being served:  
</P>
<P>
 1/217 Hollywood Blvd.-Fairfax Ave.; 16 West 3rd St.; 18 E. Whittier Blvd.-West 
6th St.; 21 Wilshire Blvd.; 30 Pico Blvd.-East 1st St.; 33 Venice Blvd.; 45 
Broadway; 76 Valley Blvd.; 81 Figueroa St.; 92 Glenoaks Blvd.-Brand Blvd.; 105 
Vernon Ave.; 108 Slauson Ave.; 115 Manchester Blvd.-Firestone Blvd.; 117 
Century Blvd.; 125 Rosecrans Ave.; 152 Roscoe Blvd.; 163 Sherman Way; 180 
Hollywood-Glendale-Pasadena; 207 Western Ave.; 210 Crenshaw Blvd.; 212 La 
Brea-San Fernando Valley; 251 Soto St.; 260 Atlantic Ave.; 420 San Fernando 
Valley-Hollywood-L.A.; 470 Whittier-Montebello-L.A.; 560 Van Nuys 
Blvd.-Westwood. Scheduled to be added today are 90 Los 
Angeles-Sunland-Tujunga-Sylmar; 130, Artesia Blvd.;, 232, Long Beach-Los 
Angeles International Airport; 234, Sepulveda Blvd.-Hubbard St. The Blue Line 
route runs between Willow station in Long Beach and 7th/Metro station only. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOURS: Bus and train service is from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays only. 
</P>
<P>
 * FARES: 50 cents on MTA buses and Blue Line, with no transfers. Elderly and 
the disabled pay 25 cents. No fee on the emergency school buses. 
</P>
<P>
 * FOR INFORMATION: (800) COMMUTE or (800) 371-LINK (for Metrolink 
information.) Recorded information in English and Spanish is available on (800) 
870-0MTA.

IS MOTION TO SEEK EVIDENCE IN SIMPSON CASE TOO BROAD?; LAW: DEFENSE WANTS 
INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP CLIENT. PROSECUTORS WILL ARGUE THAT THE REQUEST IS 
TOO SWEEPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-one years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court laid down the law: Prosecutors 
have to give defendants any information that could help exonerate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, "Brady motions" -- named after the landmark Brady vs. Maryland 
decision -- have become a central element in criminal law in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands are filed every year but none so widely watched as the one scheduled 
to be heard this morning in the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Simpson's defense lawyers' sweeping request that the district 
attorney's office immediately disclose any exculpatory investigative leads. It 
will be up to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito to determine the 
breadth of the prosecution's obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady motions are filed routinely and some are mere fishing expeditions. But 
in several important cases they have led to stunning outcomes: Charges have 
been dropped and convictions reversed when defense lawyers could show that 
prosecutors failed to turn over critical information -- even if it was a 
good-faith mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, the defense is asking for a lot: six months worth of 
police reports on prowlers or burglaries in the Brentwood neighborhood where 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were murdered; "all police reports 
of unsolved similar murders in California in the past year"; all investigative 
leads concerning the backgrounds of associates of the victims; any records of 
people who were treated for cuts or dog bites at nearby hospital emergency 
rooms in the 24 hours after the murders; a computer match of any unidentified 
fingerprints found at the murder scene, and any other potentially exculpatory 
leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys also are seeking personnel records of the detectives in 
the case, in part to determine whether there has been any disciplinary action 
taken against them and in part to establish whether any of them had reasons to 
bear a grudge against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 One piece of information that would appear to fall within the scope of the 
request is a Jan. 19, 1989, letter by LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman, who 
discovered a key piece of evidence in the Simpson case. The letter, a copy of 
which was obtained by The Times, details a previous meeting Fuhrman had with 
the former football star and Nicole Simpson, then his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Fuhrman said he had responded to a family dispute at Simpson's 
home in late 1985. When he arrived, Fuhrman said, he found O.J. Simpson in the 
driveway and his wife sitting near a car and sobbing. According to Fuhrman, she 
told him her husband had bashed in the windshield with a baseball bat. Upon 
hearing this, Simpson said: "I broke the windshield. . . . It's mine. . . . 
There's no trouble here," according to Fuhrman's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 When he testified during the preliminary hearing in the current case, Fuhrman 
said he had been to the Hall of Famer's house in 1985, but he was not asked to 
elaborate. The 1989 letter was apparently written at the request of the city 
attorney's office, which was then preparing a case against Simpson in 
connection with a Jan. 1, 1989, allegation of abuse -- one to which he 
eventually pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems odd to remember such an event, but it is not every day that you 
respond to a celebrity's home for a family dispute," Fuhrman concluded in his 
letter. "For this reason this incident was indelibly pressed in my memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the letter indicates that Fuhrman knew of Simpson's troubled 
relationship with his ex-wife, it could help defense attorneys who tried during 
the preliminary hearing to show that detectives believed Simpson was a suspect 
when they went to his home. Fuhrman and the other LAPD detectives said they did 
not suspect Simpson at that time but merely went to his home to tell him that 
his ex-wife had been killed and that his children were at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's attorneys, said the Fuhrman letter 
raises questions about whether the detective was lying when he said he did not 
consider Simpson a suspect when he and other investigators went to Simpson's 
estate hours after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe you me, I think you'll find that we will be pursuing that," Cochran 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its formal discovery request, the defense also has made a 
lengthy informal discovery request to prosecutors. In it, Simpson's lead 
lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, asked for records of any statements made by police 
to Simpson or others to encourage the former Heisman Trophy winner to cooperate 
with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 That request seems to indicate that the defense may attempt to challenge the 
admissibility of a statement Simpson made to the police the day after the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a section of the Penal Code delineates information that must be 
disclosed by the prosecution -- including statements made by defendants, all 
relevant evidence obtained as part of the investigation, the existence of a 
felony conviction of any key witness, experts' reports and the results of 
scientific tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brady doctrine applies not only to the conduct of attorneys, but also to 
police officers and others working with them. For example, in 1992, 17 years 
after being convicted of murdering a deputy sheriff, two Los Angeles men -- 
Clarence Chance and Benny Powell -- were released from prison after 
investigators discovered that the two may have been framed by overzealous 
investigators for the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the investigators found that during a 1975 trial, the 
police had withheld from prosecutors and the defense information that a 
jailhouse informant who testified against Chance and Powell may have been lying 
and had implicated others in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a classic Brady violation," said Los Angeles lawyer Sandra E. Smith, 
one of the attorneys for the pair. "It's just as egregious to have exculpatory 
information withheld when the prosecuting attorneys don't know, as when they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court decision involved John L. Brady, who was sentenced to death 
for robbery and murder. When he appealed, his lawyers found that prosecutors 
failed to disclose that an accomplice had confessed to the murder. Brady's 
conviction was upheld, but his death sentence was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic standard that has evolved since Brady is that if the prosecution 
withholds information requested, a conviction must be reversed -- or a penalty 
annulled -- if the information is deemed "material," meaning it might have 
affected the outcome of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpretation of the word "material" is hotly debated, though. In September, 
1990, a Los Angeles federal judge dismissed payola and racketeering charges 
against record promoter Joseph Isgro of Glendale and two other men after 
learning that a veteran Justice Department lawyer concealed information that 
cast serious doubts on the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman ruled that a prosecutor had violated 
Isgro's rights by failing to disclose that a key witness had, in an earlier 
case, provided testimony that flatly contradicted his statements in the later 
case. An appeals court reversed Ideman, saying Isgro's rights had not been 
materially prejudiced because the information had been discovered before the 
witness testified and thus it could be used to impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, defense attorneys contend that the prosecution's 
obligation is very broad and should include disclosure of information that has 
even the slightest potential of clearing Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 That is particularly important, the defense team said, in a case where "the 
prosecutor (Marcia Clark) has publicly committed herself very early in the 
investigation to a theory of the evidence which excludes the possibility of 
innocence," and therefore "the exculpatory potential of evidentiary leads may 
be cursorily dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Attys. Clark, William Hodgman and Cheri Lewis acknowledge in a 
response motion their duty to turn over relevant, helpful information to 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they say "if and when" any fingerprints found at the crime scene 
are matched by computer, "we will provide that information to the defense as 
soon as a match is made." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutors contend that the rest of the defense request is much too 
broad, is not specific enough and fails to provide legally adequate grounds for 
the material it seeks. In regard to the request for information about "similar 
murders" the prosecutors ask, "All double homicides? All domestic violence 
murders?" 
</P>
<P>
 And in order to comply with the defense request for dog bite records, the 
prosecutors said they would have to trample on the privacy rights of hospital 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Clark said, the California Supreme Court has ruled that there is "no 
general duty on prosecutorial officials to serve as defense investigators." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson said that is a critical point. 
"While we consider it a fundamental requirement of due process of law for the 
prosecutor to give the defendant information that would tend to exonerate him, 
that does not mean the prosecutor has to take over the role of the defense 
lawyer or one of his investigators." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, numerous state and federal cases during the past 30 years have shown 
that the Brady decision does not require the disclosure of all evidence 
requested by the defendant, Levenson said. Cases have held that the government 
does not have to disclose speculative evidence, evidence available to the 
defense from other sources or evidence the prosecutor does not possess. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most significant is that prosecutors are not required to open their 
files for "an open-ended fishing expedition," in search of Brady material, 
Levenson added. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other legal experts said they believed the defense request was too 
broad. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent defense lawyer Harland W. Braun questioned the demand for 
information on the victims' associates. "That's too sweeping," Braun said. 
"Does that mean reports on every person who worked at Mezzaluna where Goldman 
was a waiter? Does that mean reports on every person who worked out at the gym 
Nicole went to?" 
</P>
<P>
 USC criminal law professor Charles Weisselberg said several of the defense 
requests would have to be more narrowly tailored and buttressed by a theory 
about how the murders occurred to have a chance of success.

NERVOUS DESK JOCKEY PILOTS HIS 1ST BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The first thing Armand Parada did was run his bus up on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous," conceded the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
telecommunications analyst. "All of a sudden, I lost it." 
</P>
<P>
 Parada usually drives a shiny red Porsche. He wears three-piece suits to work, 
and carefully combs his shoulder-length black hair into a dapper ponytail. The 
physical demands of his job go no further than lifting a heavy report off his 
desk. In his office, people rarely talk with exclamation points. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, as the MTA struggled to put a skeleton fleet of buses on the 
road during the first transit strike in 12 years, Parada was behind the wheel 
of the No. 180, shuttling between Hollywood and Pasadena. He was among 129 
other mostly white-collar supervisors rushed through bus-driving school and 
thrust into emergency service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing I ever drove is a sports car," said Parada, 51. 
</P>
<P>
 But a 40-foot, seven-ton behemoth? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a wide monster," said Parada, his voice hushed with awe and 
respect. "I never dreamed I would do this." 
</P>
<P>
 When the MTA drew up strike contingency plans last month, officials dispatched 
70 non-union employees to attend an intensive four-week driving course at its 
El Monte depot. While none were forced to attend the program, most felt that 
they had no choice. Accountants, engineers and others such as Parada, who never 
imagined piloting a bus, found themselves worrying about how far they stopped 
from the curb and whether a fire extinguisher was beneath the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Parada was among the second class of student drivers to graduate. Wearing 
jeans and a work shirt, unbuttoned to reveal his gold Porsche medallion, he 
took his bus license test Wednesday. When he pulled into the El Monte bus yard, 
strikers, screaming "Scab!" threw a soda can into the bus, splashing cola all 
over his instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we volunteered to do this," said Parada, visibly upset. 
</P>
<P>
 But 12 hours later, having passed the test, he was behind the wheel again, 
this time preparing to pick up passengers at the beginning of Line 180. Parada 
had already checked and rechecked his bus -- a process that took 35 minutes. 
His six mirrors were adjusted properly. Fuel? Sufficient. Brakes? Adequate. 
Coin box? Working. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pass signal? What is that? " Parada asked in horror, realizing that he had an 
unfamiliar switch on the cockpit-like dashboard of MTA bus No. 2627. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for the passengers' bell cord," said instructor Jerry Woodson, trying 
to calm his rattled charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passengers? Oh, right," Parada said. "It's like football -- there was spring 
practice and now we've got the game. This is for real. The more I think about 
it, the scarier it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a deep breath as he headed toward his first stop, Parada turned his 
unwieldy bus at Mentor Avenue and Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena. Maneuvered 
too tightly, the bus jumped the curb just as Woodson ordered: "Watch your right 
side!" 
</P>
<P>
 Too late. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Parada had hit the curb in three weeks. Like a coach 
reviewing a failed play, Woodson analyzed the turn, walking outside the parked 
bus and discussing where Parada went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they clambered back aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:05 a.m., bus No. 2627 lurched forward. No one waited at the first stop 
on Line 180. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darn, it would have been nice to get it over with," Parada muttered, anxious 
to pick up his first passenger. Two blocks later, Parada's wish came true as 
Luetta Webb slowly climbed aboard the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good morning!" Parada sang out. Webb eyed him with the caution of a passenger 
unaccustomed to such friendliness and sat down. Three stops later, she folded 
her newspaper and rang the bell. "You're doing good," she told Parada. 
</P>
<P>
 "And here I worried that you'd be mad at the new drivers," Parada said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want is a ride," Webb replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Parada wended his way along Colorado, picking up passengers. He apologized to 
Woodson for running a yellow light. He pulled into stops at a crooked angle. 
And when a young woman asked him if he stopped at the Glendale Galleria, he 
looked at her blankly, until Woodson signaled him to say that yes, he did go 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 When passenger Deborah Laws learned that the bus driver was a rookie, she was 
initially alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he just go to training school this week?" said the 30-year-old nurse, 
looking for the passenger bell cord. Reassured, she settled back in her seat 
and analyzed Parada's driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "He must be a natural. He hasn't hit a curb or anything," said Laws, lucky to 
have boarded after Parada's first run-in with sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bus passed through Los Feliz, the streets became narrow and clogged 
with cars. Then the route turned south, continuing west on Hollywood Boulevard. 
Outside Mann's Chinese Theatre, tourists spilled into the street.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, this is a really good line to give a rookie," said Parada, hitting the 
brakes. At 11:26 a.m., about 90 minutes after he had begun, Parada reached the 
end of the line. He leaned on his steering wheel, looking fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "With passengers aboard, it's a lot of responsibility. My primary object this 
morning was not to kill anybody," he joked. "I don't think I want to do this 
eight hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Woodson discussed the first run. His turns were too early. His stops 
were too far from the curb. He had trouble seeing the bus stop signs hidden in 
the trees. Then Woodson directed him to start up the bus again for the return 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Parada: "Do we have to go back the same way?"

NUSSBAUM TELLS OF CALM REACTION TO WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum told House investigators Thursday 
that he thought it was "no big deal" when he learned in late 1993 that 
President Clinton had been named as a potential witness in a federal 
investigation of improper savings and loan contributions to one of his Arkansas 
campaigns for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum, who resigned last April because of criticism of his handling of the 
Whitewater controversy, and 10 current White House employees testified on the 
second day of Whitewater hearings by the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Lloyd N. Cutler, his successor as White House counsel who testified 
Tuesday, Nussbaum met with a well-orchestrated Republican barrage of questions 
pointing up discrepancies in the White House version of events. Republicans 
were particularly disdainful of Nussbaum's claim that he initially viewed it as 
"no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cutler, Nussbaum insisted that neither he nor any other presidential aide 
acted improperly when they learned of Clinton's possible involvement in the 
investigation by the Resolution Trust Corp. He emphasized that no one in the 
Clinton Administration tried to interfere with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have been manifestly improper. That did not happen," said 
Nussbaum, now a lawyer in private practice in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum recalled that he first learned from Treasury officials in September, 
1993, that the names of the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had 
been mentioned in a confidential RTC memo to the Justice Department. The memo 
outlined the evidence in a case involving the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 James B. McDougal, owner of Madison, had been a longtime friend and political 
supporter of the President and a partner with the Clintons in an unsuccessful 
Ozark Mountains resort venture, Whitewater Development Corp., which they 
founded in 1978. The Clintons sold their stake in Whitewater to McDougal before 
entering the White House in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum said that, although he took the news of the RTC memo seriously, he 
did not panic because he understood that Clinton was mentioned only as a 
potential witness, not as a target. 
</P>
<P>
 "This, very frankly -- although in retrospect it's a great irony -- was not 
such a big deal at this time," Nussbaum said. "Whitewater was not on the screen 
. . . . This was not a major crisis or a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The comment drew a response from Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), who noted that, 
when White House officials responded to the news by alerting the President, 
they indicated that they had indeed regarded it as a crisis. "The way you 
reacted -- it was a very big deal," said McCollum, who led the Republican 
attack on Nussbaum's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum later admitted that he may have exaggerated when he called it "no big 
deal." He acknowledged that in hindsight, it turned out to be "a serious 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the 10 top aides involved in most of the contacts that the White House 
had with federal regulators all told the committee that they had done nothing 
to interfere with the progress or direction of the RTC's investigation. Cutler 
had told the committee Tuesday that, although many of the contacts were 
improper, none had violated any laws or ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aide Thomas (Mack) McLarty, who at the time was Clinton's chief of 
staff, echoed that judgment. "It would have been better if some of these 
contacts had not occurred," he said, but "nothing happened" as a result of them 
and "no one in the White House attempted to influence the RTC" in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials uniformly argued that Treasury officials acted properly 
in notifying the President's aides that the Clintons were named in the RTC's 
so-called criminal referral to the Justice Department. The notification was 
necessary because the President had to be prepared to respond to anticipated 
leaks about the referral to the news media, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nussbaum explained it, Treasury and White House aides were motivated by a 
desire to prevent Clinton from suffering a setback that would undermine his 
ability to perform his officials duties -- not by any personal or political 
concern for him. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aide Bruce Lindsey had passed the information along to the 
President shortly after Treasury Department Counsel Jean Hanson, at a meeting 
on Sept. 29, 1993, first told White House officials about the criminal 
referral. Lindsey told the committee that he "briefly mentioned" it to Clinton 
on Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not suggest, nor did the President ask, that any action be taken and 
none was," said Lindsey, a longtime Clinton friend and adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey said he did not know -- and thus did not tell Clinton -- that Arkansas 
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, Clinton's successor in Little Rock, also was mentioned in 
the criminal referral. Republicans criticized Clinton for meeting with Tucker 
shortly after learning about the referral. Democrats have insisted that Clinton 
and Tucker never discussed the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 McCollum argued that information about the RTC criminal referral should not 
have been passed along to the President. Nussbaum replied that it is the duty 
of White House aides to keep the chief executive informed of information that 
might be the subject of press inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were quick to note that Cutler had criticized Nussbaum for urging 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, then acting head of the RTC, not to 
disqualify himself from decisions involving the Madison Guaranty inquiry. 
Cutler told the committee that he believed it was the most questionable action 
taken by White House aides in response to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum, in defending his action, noted that Altman had been advised by the 
Treasury's ethics counsel that he was not obligated to disqualify himself from 
acting in the case, even though he had long been a friend of the President. 
Nussbaum said government appointees are sometimes too quick to disqualify 
themselves in instances where there is no conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the normally feisty Nussbaum admitted humbly that he had made 
some mistakes during his White House tenure. Among them, he said, was that he 
should have taken more time to brief the press on these matters. "I was not a 
perfect counsel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also disagreed with Cutler's statement that on a scale of 1 to 10, 
Whitewater is a 2 or 3. He said the Watergate scandal of the Richard Nixon 
Administration, which he helped to investigate as a House Judiciary Committee 
aide, was a 10, whereas Whitewater is no more than 0.025. 
</P>
<P>
 As Republican questioners repeatedly failed to crack the composure of 
witnesses, emboldened Democrats at the highly partisan hearings began to 
ridicule their frustrated GOP colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans, Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) said, are just trying to 
"paralyze the presidency with blatantly partisan and baseless allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should start calling this Wastewater," Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney 
(D-N.Y.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hearings wore on, partisan tempers grew so short that, when a 
Republican lawmaker refused to stop talking after he had been ruled out of 
order, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) yelled across the room to him to 
"shut up!"

THE TIMES POLL; AMERICANS SENDING MIXED MESSAGES ON HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For members of Congress confronted with difficult choices over health care and 
hoping for guidance, the polls have an answer: You're on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-gridlock in Congress over health care reflects the reality in the 
nation. On almost every major issue involved in the yearlong debate over health 
reform -- from universal coverage to cost-control efforts -- Americans remain 
closely divided, according to The Times Poll.  
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, health care has risen once again on the scale of public 
concerns, after being partly eclipsed earlier this year by public worries over 
crime. Asked to name the nation's most important problem, 22% said it was 
health care, up from 18% in the last Times Poll in April and only 12% in 
January. In comparison, 38% named crime or related issues such as violence in 
society and drug use -- down from 51% in April and 43% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 An overwhelming majority of Americans would like to see Congress pass some 
kind of health reform plan. Despite the recent remark by Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) that "there might be a big sigh of relief around the country" 
if Congress passed nothing, only 14% of those polled said that Congress should 
"pass no health reform plan." 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable minority, 35%, said that they will be "angry" if Congress "cannot 
get a health care plan passed by the end of this year." That sentiment was 
strongest among Democrats -- 44% of whom said they would be angry -- but exists 
among 23% of Republicans and 28% of conservatives as well. Moreover, asked if 
Republicans were "offering constructive criticism" or "being obstructionist for 
mostly political reasons," 57% overall, and even 37% of Republicans, said that 
GOP members of Congress were obstructionist. Only 28% overall said that they 
were being constructive.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, concern about health care and a desire to see some plan 
pass does not translate into a consensus. To make matters more complicated, 
core constituencies of the two parties have staked out strongly opposing 
positions -- weakening the ground under members of Congress from either party 
searching for a middle position. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusually large numbers of registered Democrats, 45%, and liberals, 49%, said 
that they would be inclined to oppose their representative in Congress if he or 
she voted against universal coverage. On the other side, while only 14% of all 
those polled said that Congress should pass no health bill, 25% of 
self-identified Republicans said that is what they think. 
</P>
<P>
 The net result for members of Congress is political peril in almost every 
direction. Democrats who move too far away from coverage for everyone risk 
alienating their core supporters -- something that could cost the seats of 
members from closely divided districts. Republicans who vote for any health 
reform plan may anger supporters who have decided that no bill would be best. 
But with the public so divided about what reform should mean, compromise would 
appear necessary to produce any bill that would garner majority support. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, supervised by Times Poll director John Brennan, was conducted 
nationally among 1,515 adults from Saturday through Tuesday. The results have a 
sampling margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll confirms the sense in Congress that abortion coverage probably will 
have to be dropped or severely watered down for a health reform bill to pass. 
Asked if companies should be required to "make abortion coverage available to 
any worker who desires it," only 33% said that they favored the idea, while 60% 
opposed it -- with 46% strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poll contradicts several other beliefs that have gained strong 
currency in the health reform debate. 
</P>
<P>
 First, support for universal coverage, although large in the abstract, is far 
shakier than many Democrats assert. 
</P>
<P>
 By 58% to 31%, poll respondents said they favor a bill that would guarantee 
insurance for all by requiring companies to cover all their workers rather than 
"more limited reform that would . . . leave some people without coverage." But 
asked if they would still go along if the coverage requirement "would cause job 
losses," almost half the supporters defected. Overall, 28% of those polled 
supported the mandate even if it would cause job losses, 31% supported it, but 
not at the cost of jobs, and 31% said that they wanted Congress to pass a more 
limited bill regardless. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts generally agree that requiring all companies to provide insurance 
would cost jobs in some industries while creating them elsewhere, but they 
disagree on the net effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other central elements of most reform plans are also highly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 On efforts to control health costs, the poll found that 47% favor some 
government price limits even "at the risk of limiting the availability and 
quality of health care," while 40% would leave prices to the free market "even 
if that might mean higher health care costs for the average person." 
</P>
<P>
 And asked about the proposal that insurance companies be required to charge 
all residents of the same community roughly the same premium for health 
insurance, Americans were evenly divided -- 48% in favor, 46% opposed. People 
between the ages of 18 and 29, whose insurance premiums typically would go up 
under community rating, opposed the idea, 58% to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 Those polled, however, strongly rejected an argument made by some conservative 
leaders that insurers should be allowed to charge gay Americans more because, 
the conservatives argue, gays are more likely to engage in unhealthy sexual 
practices. By 63% to 30%, those polled rejected that argument. The margin was 
closer, but still negative, 51% to 43%, among those who identified themselves 
as conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 While Democrats have overstated support for key elements of reform, the poll 
contradicts Republican claims that support has collapsed for Clinton's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what they would like Congress to do on health care, the largest group in 
the poll, 38%, said that they want Congress to pass Clinton's plan either as is 
or with only "minor changes." In addition to the 14% who want nothing passed, 
another 32% would like to see Clinton's plan with "major changes" or "a plan 
other than Clinton's." Those numbers are largely unchanged since April. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed since April is public confidence in Clinton's ability to 
handle health care issues. Three months ago, 50% said that Clinton could handle 
such issues better than congressional Republicans. Now only 37% say so. Belief 
in the Republicans, however, has not risen substantially -- going from 27% in 
April to 31% now. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are almost equally split on Clinton's argument that limited reforms 
will end up costing society more in the long run than would universal coverage, 
with 43% agreeing and 40% disagreeing. That argument, however, does not 
necessarily determine people's overall position. More than a third of those who 
said that they would prefer limited reforms do so even though they believe that 
those reforms eventually will cost more. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely held belief that pressure for health reform is driven primarily by 
Americans' concerns about the security of their own care also appears 
overdrawn.  
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of Americans, 36%, said they are "very concerned" about losing 
"the health coverage you currently have" sometime in the next few years. 
Another 24% said that they were "somewhat concerned" and 10% said they have no 
benefits now. Only 30% of Americans are comfortable with the security of their 
benefits, saying that they are either "not concerned at all" or are "not too 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are very concerned about their coverage and those who have no 
coverage are slightly more likely than other Americans to support Clinton's 
plan or something close to it -- 40% would like to see his plan pass as is or 
with only minor changes -- but the difference from the rest of the population 
is not large. 
</P>
<P>
 The only group that stands out as having a substantially different view than 
other Americans are the 15% who said that they are "not concerned at all" about 
losing benefits. Those Americans give scant support to Clinton's plan or 
something close to it -- only 12% -- and 29% said that they would like Congress 
to do nothing on health care. But that opposition probably stems as much from 
the anti-Clinton demographics of that group -- who are more likely to be 
Americans earning more than $60,000 a year, Republicans, conservatives -- as it 
does from the group's personal health care circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most Americans, 53%, do not think health reform will change their 
family's circumstances one way or the other, according to the poll. Only 16% of 
those polled said they believed that their circumstances would improve, while 
23% said they expected them to worsen, if reform passes. Most of those 
questioned, 75% to 23%, said they think that their own coverage is currently 
sound but they have far more doubts about the overall health system. Only 31% 
said that they think the overall system is sound, while 63% called it unsound. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being driven primarily by personal circumstances, support or 
opposition for health reform appears to be propelled mostly by ideology, with 
Democrats and liberals strongly supporting a plan similar to Clinton's, and 
Republicans and conservatives opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem clearly facing Clinton and his allies is the "knowledge gap" on 
health care. Despite -- or perhaps because of -- months of media coverage of 
the health reform debate, only 26% of those polled said that they believe that 
they know a "great deal" or a "good amount" about "the details of the health 
care proposals that are currently being considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Another 31% said that they do not know much at all, while 42% said they know 
only some of the details. Those numbers have changed only slightly since last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage saying that they are well informed about the health reform 
debate rises sharply with income. Among those earning more than $60,000 per 
year, 42% said they were well informed, but only 16% of those earning less than 
$20,000 and 21% of those earning between $20,000 and $40,000 made that claim.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan, indeed nearly all health reform plans, would shift money from 
upper-income Americans to lower-income working families -- providing government 
subsidies, for example, to make insurance more affordable to those with lower 
incomes but paying for those subsidies by changes that would raise premiums for 
most upper-income Americans. The poll strongly indicates that those who stand 
to lose in health reform know more about it and are, therefore, in more of a 
position to influence the process than those who stand to gain by it. That 
could change as the debate enters its final stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The health reform debate has clearly had a major impact on Clinton's 
popularity -- in both directions. When people who have a favorable impression 
of Clinton were asked why, 16% mentioned his health reform proposals -- the 
only policy issue to get substantial mention. At the same time, when people who 
have a negative impression of Clinton were asked why, 10% mentioned health 
reform -- the most often raised substantive issue on that side. Reaction to 
Reform 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are divided in their priorities and split over different health care 
proposals. Most are concerned about losing health coverage, but don't think 
theirs will improve if reforms are passed. 
</P>
<P>
 What should Congress and the President make their top priority this year?: 
Health care reform: 30% Welfare reform: 25% anti-crime bill: 31% Campaign 
finance reform: 7% Other/Don't know: 7% 
</P>
<P>
 Do you support funding universal health care by requiring employers to pay for 
insurance: Yes: 28% Yes, but only if no job loss: 31% Want more limited reform: 
31% Neither/Other/Don't know: 10% 
</P>
<P>
 How concerned are you that in the next few years you will lose the health care 
coverage you currently have?: Concerned: 60% Not concerned: 30% Don't have 
benefits: 10% 
</P>
<P>
 Do you prefer a health care reform plan where everyone in the same community 
pays the same, regardless of age, lifestyle or health status?: Pay the same: 
48% Pay different rates: 46% Don't know: 6% 
</P>
<P>
 Do you prefer a plan limiting the amount or medical or insurance bills, at the 
risk of limiting availability, or do you prefer a free market system even if it 
might mean higher costs for the average person? Government sets prices: 47% 
Free market: 40% Don't know: 13% 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress passes health care reform, how do you think you and your family 
will end up?: With better health care: 16% With worse health care: 23% Don't 
expect change: 53% Too early to say: 3% Don't know: 5%

Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the nation. 
Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and non-listed numbers 
could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. The 
sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age 
and education. The margin of sampling error for the total sample is plus or 
minus 3 percentage points. For certain sub-groups the error margin may be 
somewhat higher.

COLUMN ONE; MASSACRE AND MYTH IN TEXAS; ONE MAN ENDED CHARLES WHITMAN'S 
COLDBLOODED AUSTIN SLAUGHTER. WAS IT THE HERO OF LEGEND, OR A SECOND OFFICER IN 
THE TOWER, WHO SAYS THAT HE FIRED THE CRUCIAL SHOTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legends die hard in Texas, and so the truth may never be known about who 
really killed Charles Whitman on top of the University of Texas tower here 
nearly three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it Officer Ramiro Martinez, showered with national acclaim as a true Texas 
hero, who rode that fame in a 20-year career with the fabled Texas Rangers and 
was lionized in a made-for-TV movie? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was it Officer Houston McCoy, a lanky, slow-moving drifter who eventually 
left police work and took a twisted trail that has left him drunk, broke and 
divorced? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a west Texas cowboy and west Texas cowboys don't normally open their 
mouths," McCoy said the other day, after all these years coming forth to claim, 
with a good deal of proof, that he is the real hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if Ramiro Martinez was sitting right here and saying he shot Charles 
Whitman, I'd call him a liar right to his face." 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred miles away but worlds apart, Martinez feels equally unkind toward 
McCoy. "All I can say is I feel sorry for him," he said with a ring of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Whomever it is, the man who shot Charles Whitman was the bravest of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman, an altar boy, an Eagle Scout, a Marine -- the All-American Kid -- had 
climbed to the top of the 300-foot Texas landmark and opened fire. In 
cold-blooded murder on a hot August day, 16 were left dead and 31 injured, and 
a nation forever changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of its kind, the first time a madman would shoot down so many 
innocent people in a public arena. It was 1966, before police had SWAT teams 
and hostage negotiators, before police in Austin even had walkie-talkies or 
bulletproof vests or the firepower to cut down a crazy blond-haired 
sharpshooter who packed his footlocker full of guns and lugged it up the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitman shooting spree stunned the nation, and more would follow in the 
years ahead. The San Ysidro McDonald's. The Stockton schoolyard. The post 
office slayings. Today the random killings -- sometimes as many as two or three 
a month -- often seem to go unnoticed, relegated to the back pages of the 
nation's newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact they are traumatic events in our lifetime, events so difficult to 
deal with that many of the survivors and their families and the police officers 
forced to risk their lives never fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
 That is certainly true in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, said James Alan Fox, an East Coast criminologist, Whitman never 
died at all. Rather, he lives on in the lore of the Wild West, more so than 
most of the other killers Fox has studied as the co-author of two books about 
mass murder in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie Whitman looked and acted so normal," said Fox, dean of the College of 
Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "He targeted college students, purely innocent people in the wrong place at 
the wrong time. He had all the elements for affecting the American psyche." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hoopla that surrounded the tower shooting, could the public have been 
duped? If the wrong man was named a hero, how do you correct such a mistake? 
How do you right history? Maybe you don't. Maybe it's like that John Ford movie 
classic, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance," in which the wrong man is honored 
for killing a notorious outlaw. At the end of the Western, the editor of the 
Shinbone Star, upon learning the truth, tears up his notes and says: "This is 
the West, sir. When fact becomes legend, print the legend." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the legend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guns at the Whitman home. Guns in the family pickup. Guns at the firing range 
and in long hunting trips in the Florida marsh. It was a love passed down from 
his father, Charles Whitman Sr., who at 76 is still working in the plumbing 
business around West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Whitman had three sons, and when each graduated high school, he 
handed them a new car and "all the love I could give them." Today, all three 
boys are buried together in South Florida -- one killed in a barroom shootout 
in Florida, another lost to AIDS in California, and Charlie dead on top of the 
tower in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went hunting all the time," the elder Whitman recalled in a recent 
interview, speaking of his namesake and favorite son. "Both of us did. I taught 
him how to shoot before he even joined the Marines." 
</P>
<P>
 He was rated a sharpshooter in the military, just one peg below expert, and it 
was said "he could hit a quail on the fly with a .22 rifle." 
</P>
<P>
 Later he married, moved to Austin, and enrolled as an architectural 
engineering student at the university here. He soon was earning A's and Bs. In 
the summer of 1966 he was a junior majoring in architectural engineering, drove 
a Navy blue Chevrolet Impala and, doctors discovered later, had a small tumor 
in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before he climbed the tower, he shot his mother in her Austin 
apartment, then stabbed her with his old military bayonet. He lifted her body 
into bed and covered her with a floral bedspread. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he returned to his little brick house, stabbed his wife five times, 
killing her, and before heading out for the campus, left a series of notes. He 
talked about "the pressures bearing down," how he had "decided to fight it out 
alone," how "I am prepared to die." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there exists a God," he wrote, "let Him understand my actions and judge me 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 He dressed in nylon coveralls and a white bandanna. He was hatless in the hot 
Texas sun. And he was armed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the footlocker he had packed a sawed-off shotgun, a .35-caliber Remington 
pump rifle, a 6-millimeter Remington bolt-action rifle with four-power scope, a 
.30-caliber M-1 carbine, a .25-caliber pistol, a 9-millimeter Luger, and a .357 
Smith & Wesson magnum pistol. He also carried three hunting knives, one pocket 
knife and about 1,200 rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical Austin police officer carried only a service revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 For 99 minutes on Aug. 1, Whitman ruled the campus. With deadly, pinpoint 
accuracy, he killed or wounded fellow students, a police officer, shopkeepers 
and shoppers on busy Guadalupe Street, even a newspaper boy making his rounds 
on a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 He was firing so fast and so often, with so many puffs of smoke coming from 
different angles on the observation deck, that many on the ground believed 
there were two or three snipers. Some thought it was the Black Panthers; others 
thought it was student activists who'd had enough of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh it hurt," said Lana Kay Mitchell, then a 20-year-old part-time student 
wounded on Guadalupe Street, now a mother and music teacher. "It deafened me it 
was so loud. It went in my shoulder and hit a brick wall and bounced off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a madhouse. I thought the whole world had gone crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Heard, an Associated Press reporter, scrambled from the nearby Capitol 
building to the campus a few blocks away. He saw several police officers trying 
to make it to the base of the tower. His instincts kicked in and he followed 
them, trying to zigzag as he ran across the campus lawn. Then he was hit in the 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three nights after that, I had nightmares," he said. "It was always the 
same nightmare. I could see myself in the scope of a rifle and the cross-hairs 
were at my chest and I was running." 
</P>
<P>
 But what he never saw was what happened on top of the tower because he never 
made it there. If he had, he would have been the one professional objective 
observer, the one man who could have told the world who indeed shot Charles 
Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman's bullet-riddled body was finally brought down, his face and head 
nearly blown off, his heart and chest a burned mess of gunpowder and shotgun 
pellets. A mad throng of people crowded, pushed, mauled even, to try to reach 
the stretcher and tear at his body. Anger was high, eyes were ablaze, and at 
that moment was born the hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first day, Martinez was hailed as a hero. His photograph, larger even 
than Whitman's school mug shot, covered a quarter of the front page of the next 
morning's Austin American.  
</P>
<P>
 The caption read: "SHOOTS SLAYER. Patrolman Ramiro Martinez put the first 
bullet into the sniper atop the University of Texas tower, and then emptied his 
police revolver as the sniper whirled and fired at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Whitman's father, after flying to Austin to confer with Chief Bob Miles 
and Martinez, came away from the meeting convinced that Martinez had killed his 
boy. "I believed he did it and I still believe it today," the father said. "And 
if I had been in his boots, I'd have done the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The plaudits came tumbling in, even the cherished National Police Officers 
Assn. Medal of Valor, citing Martinez for bravery. He catapulted his stardom 
into a two-decade career with the Texas Rangers, bought a new home in New 
Braunfels, Tex., and is still so well-known that he recently was elected a 
county justice of the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the sniper incident was turned into a movie, which clearly 
portrayed him as the hero, he received an out-of-court settlement with the 
producers because he did not like everything they said. After that, who would 
want to take on the man who shot Charles Whitman? 
</P>
<P>
 Those same years passed hard for Houston McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 He left police work, and tried and failed at a series of odd jobs. He 
befriended the bottle, and he lost his wife. When he sued the same movie 
company for making him out a coward, the judge not only tossed out the lawsuit, 
but also ordered him to pay the opposing attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives today in a boarded-up laundry once owned by his family in tiny 
Menard, Tex. His memories are stuffed into a little cardboard box, full of 
yellowed newspaper clippings and police reports and scribbles he can hardly 
read himself. He is too broke to pay for copying fees. You want to read his 
files, bring a notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 For inside that box lies his secret. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the findings from Whitman's autopsy, which says that because of the 
numerous shotgun rounds fired by McCoy, it is impossible to tell whether any of 
Martinez's .38-caliber slugs ever hit the sniper. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a statement from Austin's ex-Police Chief Miles, made shortly 
before his death, attesting to the fact that the media hoopla that rose so 
quickly around Martinez never gave authorities a chance to honor the right man, 
McCoy, a man too modest to assert his own heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came right down to it," the chief said, "it was Houston McCoy who 
killed him. Houston got the short end of the stick on publicity, if anyone 
wants to take credit for killing somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief's words were carried in a few of the state's papers shortly after 
his death. But it never resurrected McCoy's reputation, nor dampened 
Martinez's. So now McCoy wants to say what he remembers what happened 30 
stories above the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But first let Martinez tell it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his day off when he heard the news on the radio at home. He said he 
dressed quickly, drove to the school, and immediately headed for the tower. 
"Nobody had to tell me what to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was met at the top by other Austin police officers. While some of them 
helped several seriously wounded members of a Texarkana family who had been 
sightseeing when Whitman shot them, he and McCoy cautiously stepped out on the 
lookout deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was carrying his six-shot revolver and he crept forward along the 
outdoor tier. He said McCoy, armed with a shotgun, followed closely behind. 
Martinez turned a corner of the observation deck and spotted Whitman, crouched 
down at the end of the other tier. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez: "I fired. All six times. Boom. Boom. You have to keep firing and you 
don't hesitate. And I hit him. He jerked up and he stood up and kept firing and 
he was firing as he was being hit. But if I hadn't hit him first, he damn sure 
would have shot and killed me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on duty, but was bored and he said he was looking for a place to hide 
and take a nap when the first police calls of the sniper shook him awake. He 
too sped straight to the scene, and made it to the top of the tower, and did 
indeed follow slowly behind Martinez out onto the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that when he turned the corner, it was clear that his partner had 
missed all six times because Whitman was calmly rising up. Rising up not in 
pain, but in anger. And he was clearly still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy: "I shot him once and his whole head went right back and I knew he was 
dead. Then I jacked another shell into my shotgun and I hit him again in the 
head and then I was through with him. I knew he was dead then." 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly, McCoy said, Martinez was yelling for him to shoot Whitman again, 
and Martinez threw down his revolver and grabbed McCoy's shotgun and then, 
breaking into a loud war whoop, he ran up to within inches of Whitman and blew 
away almost the entire top of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Martinez continued running around the top of the tower, McCoy said, 
shouting to those below, " 'I got him! I got him!' 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was wrong," McCoy insisted. "I killed Whitman. All Martinez did was 
kill a dead man." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez admitted he did let out a cry and ran up and shot Whitman with 
McCoy's shotgun. But he does not remember bragging from the tower. And he said 
he only grabbed McCoy's weapon because McCoy "is a slow person, and he was slow 
in reacting." 
</P>
<P>
 And about the police chief recanting the official version of his heroism, 
Martinez said simply: "That bothers me. But I can't talk about the chief now 
that he's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So there it is. Two men climbed up into the sky that afternoon and met danger 
and risked their own lives to save others. Two men were brave that day. Their 
names are Ramiro Martinez and Houston McCoy. And one of them killed Charles 
Whitman.

U.S. SENATE; ABORTION RIGHTS GROUPS CRITICIZE HUFFINGTON RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of abortion rights groups assailed U.S. Senate candidate Michael 
Huffington on Thursday as an abortion opponent masquerading as an abortion 
rights legislator, citing a series of nine votes he has cast in less than two 
years in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcela Howell, executive director of the California Abortion Rights Action 
League, said she and other activists were speaking out against Huffington, a 
Republican, because he describes himself as a supporter of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who represents the Santa Barbara area in Congress, is seeking the 
Senate seat held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein received the abortion 
rights league's endorsement before the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just getting tired of having Michael Huffington say he was a 
pro-choice legislator," Howell said. ". . . Two years ago, we had a man saying 
he was pro-choice. Now he has a voting record, and it's not a pretty one." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Huffington's campaign said that the congressman generally 
favors abortion rights and that Feinstein and the groups speaking against 
Huffington were extremist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Huffington is in the mainstream, not the extreme, and her position is in 
line with extremist elements," spokesman Marc Thiessen said of Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein supports abortion rights without exception. Thiessen said Huffington 
supports some exceptions: He supports parental notification before abortions 
for minors, he opposes federal funding for abortions and opposes 
third-trimester abortions for the purpose of sex selection. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1992 campaign statements, however, Huffington did not mention those 
exclusions. He says that he opposes parental consent before abortions for minor 
without mentioning his support of parental notification laws. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the issue of federal funding, Huffington's campaign platform said that 
he believes "all women should have access to reproductive choice, regardless of 
their ability to pay. He supports local and state funding of abortions, and 
federal funding if there is no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in one of the votes cited by Howell and others, Huffington voted against 
allowing the city of Washington to use local funds to provide abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that a pro-choice candidate is one who would not vote to restrict 
a woman's access and that's what he does in voting against access to clinics 
and against funding for the District of Columbia," said Jane Hasler Henick, 
president of the California branch of the National Women's Political Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiessen said Huffington voted against the Washington measure because it was 
part of a "massive, huge, fat appropriations bill" that had been turned into a 
referendum on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He supports the principle of local funding but that bill had absolutely 
nothing to do with that issue," Thiessen said. Huffington's other actions cited 
by the abortion rights groups include his refusal to be a sponsor of the 
Freedom of Choice Act, which would codify the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade 
decision. Huffington, in his campaign literature, says that he supports the 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he voted for final passage of a bill that was meant to provide 
medical clinics freedom from anti-abortion blockades, he sanctioned five 
amendments and other measures that abortion rights supporters said were 
intended to kill the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Huffington has been given a 20% rating by the National Abortion 
Rights Action League, while Feinstein has a 100% rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell said she believes Huffington's record will sway Republican women who 
support abortion rights from Huffington and into Feinstein's camp. Huffington 
spokesman Thiessen, however, said he believes the issue will have no impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the 6% of extremists on this issue are going to oppose Mike Huffington 
because he supports parental notification, they weren't going to vote for us 
anyway," he said.

FAA PROMISES FASTER ACTION ON SAFETY ISSUES; AIRLINES: CHIEF VOWS CHANGES AFTER 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT AGENCY BEING WARNED ABOUT POTENTIALLY FATAL WAKE TURBULENCE 
CREATED BY 757S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing criticism for their handling of the Boeing 757 wake turbulence problem, 
federal aviation officials Thursday vowed to move more swiftly to alert those 
in the airline industry to potential safety hazards and announced new measures 
intended to prevent accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement marked the second time the Federal Aviation Administration 
has taken safety-related steps since it was disclosed that agency officials had 
been warned about the potential danger of wake turbulence created by 757s years 
before two fatal accidents claimed 13 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the House subcommittee on technology, environment and 
aviation, FAA Administrator David R. Hinson pledged that within 60 days his 
agency would review the role of its Office of Aviation Safety and create an 
efficient method to identify and act upon safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have asked specifically that they define management responsibility and 
accountability more clearly, so that we may be confident that safety issues are 
raised and receive appropriate priorities," Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson said the agency has hired an official from RAND, a well-known think 
tank, whose top priorities will include ensuring that safety concerns raised by 
scientists and researchers within the FAA get a proper hearing inside and 
outside the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And starting this weekend -- at a convention of general aviation pilots in 
Oshkosh, Wis. -- the FAA's Flight Standards and Aviation Safety office will 
disseminate information to pilots on the wake turbulence issue, Hinson said. He 
said the agency also will quickly establish a process that makes certain that 
"emerging safety issues are addressed promptly and effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson's announcements came two days after an internal report concluded that 
the FAA may have mishandled the 757 wake turbulence issue because bureaucracy 
and poor communication sometimes compromised the agency's ability to pinpoint 
and respond to potential safety problems in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal report and Thursday's hearing were prompted by a June 5 story in 
The Times, revealing that internal documents showed that the FAA had been 
warned about the 757 wake turbulence hazard by its chief scientist, Robert E. 
Machol, starting in 1989. Eleven days before the first of two 757 
turbulence-related fatal accidents, Machol had predicted to FAA managers that a 
"major crash" would occur if the agency failed to take actions to protect 
planes, especially smaller ones, landing behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Subcommittee members Thursday repeatedly expressed concerns that the FAA could 
-- and should -- have acted sooner on the 757 turbulence issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, most appeared to believe that the agency should have publicly 
drawn attention to the problem sometime between the first fatal accident in 
Billings, Mont., in December, 1992, and the second, in Santa Ana, in December, 
1993. The Billings crash took eight lives; the Santa Ana crash killed five 
people, including the top two officials of the In-and-Out Burger chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Both accidents happened after private aircraft encountered wake turbulence 
from 757s landing in front of them -- the very scenario Machol had laid out 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony at Thursday's hearing, Machol, who retired from the FAA on 
April 30, said there was "nothing brilliant about any of these predictions. 
There (were) very good, solid reasons" for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the blunt-spoken, former college professor portrayed the FAA as being the 
victim of a "bureaucratic stasis that sometimes gets in the way of anything 
useful" being achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a situation where someone who seems to know what he's talking about 
made a prediction that a cataclysmic accident could happen," said subcommittee 
member Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, (R-Huntington Beach). Although the FAA often does 
its job well, Rohrabacher said, "the way they did it in this particular case . 
. . perhaps cost the lives of some innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at one point by Rohrabacher if some of the recently instituted 
operational procedures regarding 757s may have "averted these two tragedies," 
Hinson paused and said, "Yes, perhaps." 
</P>
<P>
 During the five-hour hearing, subcommittee members also expressed concerns 
about why aviation officials in Canada and the United Kingdom took action on 
the 757 turbulence issue before the FAA did; whether the FAA can balance its 
two missions of ensuring safety and promoting the airline industry, and when 
the agency will hire a new chief scientist to replace Machol. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's actions by the FAA come two months after the agency in May adopted 
a policy requiring smaller planes in most instances to stay four miles behind 
757s during landings to avoid their potentially deadly wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is not a consensus on the level of danger, the 757's "clean" 
wing and body design appear to make it capable of producing higher-intensity 
levels of wake turbulence, funnels of air emanating from each wingtip 
containing hurricane-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the FAA has resisted increasing the separation distance for planes 
landing behind 757s because it could cut the number of flights at the nation's 
busiest airports. That could result in delays and revenue losses for the 
aviation industry.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; FORMER OPPONENT CRITICIZES BROWN'S HANDLING OF 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former State Treasurer Tom Hayes attacked his successor, gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown, for her conduct as treasurer Thursday -- blaming her 
for a potentially serious technical mistake in the sale of $4 billion in state 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference arranged by Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign committee, Hayes 
contended that the error in last week's sale could have cost the state millions 
of dollars had it not been promptly corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 And Republican Hayes did not stop there as he heaped abuse on Democrat Brown, 
who defeated him in the 1990 treasurer's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's staff contended that Hayes' charges were a predictable part of 
election-year gamesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely hypocritical for the governor's campaign to put forth Tom 
Hayes to cover for (the Wilson Administration's) failed budget and fiscal 
mismanagement," said Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly seeking to belittle Brown's claim to be "America's best treasurer," 
Hayes also accused Brown of hurting California's standing on Wall Street and 
adding to the cost of state borrowing by berating Wilson's handling of the 
state budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treasurer is bad-mouthing California's financial status at the same time 
she is arranging to borrow billions of dollars on behalf of California's 
citizens, undermining California's credibility in the financial marketplace," 
Hayes said. And he contended that she ought to stand up and take responsibility 
for a $2.8-billion internal accounting error uncovered in a 1991 audit of the 
treasurer's office -- a problem that Brown has blamed on Hayes' administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign and treasurer's office contended that Hayes was wrong on 
all counts and that his charges were politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the issuance of $4 billion in warrants -- part of $7 billion 
that California has had to borrow this month to tide government through a 
continuing financial crisis -- was handled by state Controller Gray Davis. 
Brown's role was to market the notes on behalf of the controller. Before the 
warrants were sold, representatives of Wilson's Department of Finance, the 
state attorney general's office and the respected bond firm of Orrick, 
Herrington & Sutcliffe all reviewed and approved the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has dismissed the problem as technical in nature. Both he and Brown have 
noted that the error was caught quickly and fixed before any damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' opponent in the fall, state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), on 
Thursday sent letters to Davis and Brown, requesting all documents on the 
$4-billion warrant deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, interest income from state bonds and notes is tax free, which keeps 
interest rates low and saves California taxpayers considerable money. But 
shortly after the $4 billion in revenue anticipation warrants, or RAWs, were 
sold as tax-free notes last week, investors began to realize that under certain 
circumstances some future purchasers of the bonds might have to pay taxes on 
part of their return on investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery, based on a review of IRS rules, created a whirlwind in the bond 
market. But Davis was able to correct the potential problem for investors by 
paying interest in two installments rather than as originally planned -- in one 
lump sum at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement Thursday, Davis said Hayes should be praising the 
state's top financial officers "for a job well-done -- not embarking on a 
political witch hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Controller D. Robert Shuman said the decision to pay interest in 
two installments will save the state $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the warrants were issued by the controller and marketed by the 
treasurer, Hayes contended that the error was Brown's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the problem not been caught, it would have cost investors millions of 
dollars and would have meant a rash of lawsuits, Hayes said. "And it would have 
jeopardized California note sales for years to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes also said Brown ought to take full responsibility for a $2.8-billion 
internal accounting error uncovered by state auditors in 1991. The error was 
discovered in March of that year, less than three months after Brown succeeded 
Hayes. Hayes conceded Thursday that the accounting problem cost taxpayers 
nothing and that it was eventually corrected. But he resented a statement that 
Brown made to The Times last week, blaming the problem on his administration of 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 audit noted a variety of problems with the way the treasurer's office 
balanced the state's checkbook. In a written response at the time, Brown said 
her staff discovered and corrected the problem, which was caused by a "software 
design flaw."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / GLENN F. BUNTING: IS FEINSTEIN A BACK-SEAT DRIVER 
ON PERKS?

 Next to crime, health care and welfare reform, the parking privileges enjoyed 
by members of Congress hardly rank among the weightier issues in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But you would never know it judging from the flak Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) 
catches every time he tries to shut down the free parking lots reserved for 
lawmakers, diplomats and Supreme Court justices at nearby National and Dulles 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had advocated a declaration of World War III, I believe it would have 
probably evoked less emotion in my colleagues," McCain cracked in April after 
the Senate rejected an amendment that merely suggested -- but did not require 
-- eliminating the perk. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-53 margin of defeat was closer than usual because 21 of the 25 senators 
who are up for reelection this year voted for it. California Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, who faces a strong challenge from multimillionaire Republican Rep. 
Michael Huffington, co-sponsored the bill and called attention to it in a press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein scolded her colleagues in a Senate floor speech for putting 
themselves above normal working stiffs. She said that "for men and women 
anywhere else, if work or some other task keeps them late, they do not have the 
option of zipping into their free parking spot at the movie theater or at the 
grocery store or at the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the airport parking perk came at no personal inconvenience to 
Feinstein -- she never uses the special lots anyway. Like many members of 
Congress, Feinstein is driven to the airport and back by an aide on her Senate 
staff whenever she flies in or out of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical workday, Feinstein is met early in the morning at her downtown 
Washington townhouse by a member of her Senate staff and driven to work in her 
personal car -- a Navy blue Buick Park Avenue sedan. She also uses the staffer 
to transport her to meetings and appearances off Capitol Hill and to take her 
home at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein reacted angrily when she was asked about the driving arrangement 
during an interview in her Senate office this week. "This has nothing to do 
with a parking lot!" she said. Asked about the appearance of hypocrisy by a 
legislator who employs a driver taking credit for trying to eliminate free 
parking perks, Feinstein erupted: "Oh bull -- -- -- -- ! Bull -- -- -- -- !" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress have grown sensitive to the issue of personal 
transportation and government perks. California's other U.S. senator, Barbara 
Boxer, was blistered by Republican Bruce Herschensohn in a television ad during 
the 1992 campaign for routinely billing taxpayers for "limousine service" to 
the airport. The use of a chauffeur, Herschensohn argued, was just one example 
of Boxer's abuse of taxpayer-financed benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer was further embarrassed when The Times reported that she sometimes 
arranged for rides to the airport in official U.S. government vehicles with 
flashing red lights at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Boxer is usually dropped off and picked up at the airport by a staffer 
or a family member, said spokeswoman Linda Marson. She added that Boxer walks 
to work from her Capitol Hill apartment and prefers to drive herself to events 
in Washington, although she is often taken by a staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate rules do not prohibit using staff members to drive lawmakers to and 
from work or appointments. Indeed, many senators rely on their aides to shuttle 
them to events throughout the day, although fewer are picked up at their 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody, if they choose to do so, can get a member of their staff to drive 
with them," Feinstein said. "It happens all the time around here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview this week, Feinstein initially said that no taxpayer money 
was spent on driving services for her. "No, I pay that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later she said the amount she pays "is not meant to recompense (the driver) 
fully. It is meant to be a little extra." She described the amount she pays as 
a "nice thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She could not recall the specific amount, but an aide the next day said she 
paid $2,000 per year. The driver receives a $20,000 government salary for 
chauffeuring and other responsibilities in Feinstein's office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata clarified further. He said 
Feinstein's payment to the driver covers all trips deemed to be personal, 
including those to and from her home each day and some trips to the airport. He 
acknowledged that the accounting was informal. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein argued that members of Congress are entitled to have drivers on the 
government payroll for security purposes and because they are busy working on 
the cellular phone and studying legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask me, you ought to be able to use a staff person to drive you and 
not have to recompense them," Feinstein said. "That is a legitimate job that 
can come with government."

IRAN OFFICIALS MAY BE LINKED TO JEWISH CENTER BOMBING, ARGENTINA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Diplomatic relations between Argentina and Iran were strained to the breaking 
point Thursday after the Buenos Aires government received evidence that 
implicates Iranian officials in the bombing of a Jewish community center that 
killed nearly 100 people.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the evidence is proven true, it leads right to the Iranian Embassy" in 
Buenos Aires, a well-placed Argentine government source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Argentina has stopped short of formally accusing Iran, but tensions 
between the two countries have been rising steadily ever since a powerful car 
bomb on July 18 ripped through the center of Argentina's century-old Jewish 
community, the largest in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, a Panamanian plane carrying Jewish and Israeli businessmen -- and 
two U.S. citizens -- was downed by a bomb, killing all 21 people aboard. And 
this week two bombs exploded near the Israeli Embassy and in a Jewish 
neighborhood in London, injuring 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's ambassador to Argentina was summoned to the Foreign Ministry for 
questioning for two consecutive days this week, and Buenos Aires on Wednesday 
recalled its ambassador in Tehran for consultations. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella will appear today before the U.N. 
Security Council to demand a condemnation of the bombing as part of a surge in 
international terrorism. While he does not plan to single out Iran before the 
United Nations, Di Tella told The Times that he will ask for measures that make 
it easier to prosecute diplomats who are found to have participated in 
terrorist acts.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the participation (of Iran) is proven . . . we will respond with the 
maximum firmness," Di Tella said in an interview Thursday. "It's a very 
sensitive moment" in Argentine-Iranian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran, through its ambassadors here and at the United Nations, has denied 
involvement in the bombing. The pro-Iran fundamentalist organization Hezbollah 
was blamed for the 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires, which 
killed 29, and a group thought to be associated with Hezbollah claimed 
responsibility for the July 18 attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which is in the hands of federal Judge Juan Jose Galeano, centers on 
information provided by an Iranian defector who is seeking asylum in Venezuela. 
Galeano traveled secretly to Venezuela last weekend to question the man, 
Monousheh Moatamer. According to sources, Moatamer implicated at least two and 
as many as five people who work at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information he gave me is of extreme importance," Galeano said, declining 
to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation here has focused on the Iranian ambassador, Hadi Soleimanpour, and 
cultural attache Moshe Rabbani. Both deny any role in the bombing or in 
harboring or providing assistance to the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman, in Buenos Aires to show 
solidarity with the Jewish community, told a news conference that Argentine 
President Carlos Saul Menem vowed to break off diplomatic ties with Iran if 
Iran's role is proven. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem, speaking later to Argentine reporters, sought to soften the statement, 
saying Argentina's diplomatic actions against Iran would depend on the case 
Judge Galeano presents. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina faces two problems in suspending relations with Iran, according to 
diplomatic sources. About 300 Argentines live in Iran, and their safety is a 
concern. Also, Argentina sells more than $100 million in grains to Iran 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The Menem government, however, is under intense pressure to show it can 
investigate the attack and bring the bombers to justice. Many in the Jewish 
community blame the government's lack of resolve in the past for creating the 
conditions that permitted the July 18 tragedy. The 1992 bombing was never 
resolved and no one was ever arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Iranians have reportedly been arrested in last week's attack, including a 
woman detained at the airport when she tried to leave the country with an 
altered passport. Argentine wire services reported late Thursday that three 
more people were arrested, including a man of "Arab heritage."

NORTH KOREA; CAN THE CULT OF THE FATHER BE VISITED UPON THE SON?; KIM IL SUNG'S 
GODLIKE STATUS EARNED HIM UNDISPUTED CONTROL AND UNQUESTIONING OBEDIENCE. WITH 
HIS DEATH, KIM'S RECLUSIVE HEIR MUST TRY TO MAINTAIN THE POWER WITHOUT THE 
PERSONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In North Korea, the sacred Mt. Paekdu mourned for Kim Il Sung, the dictator 
who ruled the country from 1948 until he died July 8. A double rainbow signaled 
his death. Paying tribute, swallows hovered above statues of him scattered 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the culmination, as reported by North Korean media, of the cult of 
personality of Kim Il Sung, which the 82-year-old leader began building half a 
century ago with Soviet guidance after Josef Stalin picked him to lead the 
northern half of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the cult, the unquestioning obedience it produced and the country itself, 
with 1.1 million troops and nuclear weapons capability, have been handed over 
to Kim Jong Il, 52, the reclusive eldest son of "the Great Leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Can it work for the son as it had for the father? The answer may be no -- but 
in North Korea, there are no definitive answers to questions of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In TV footage relayed to the world from the capital, Pyongyang, since Kim's 
fatal heart attack, the world caught a glimpse of the Orwellian society that 
Kim Jong Il has inherited. Day after day, tens of thousands of citizens sobbed, 
wailed and flailed their arms in unison before a towering statue of the late 
Kim in central Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's longevity, the relative prosperity he initially created from the poverty 
left by 35 years of Japanese colonialism, and the fierce independence he 
established for Koreans whose intense nationalism borders on xenophobia all 
were factors in bolstering the cult. 
</P>
<P>
 But fiction, not fact, was its base. According to the cult, it was Kim, not 
the United States, that defeated Japan and liberated Korea; it was the United 
States, not he, who started the Korean War. Even his name -- adopted from that 
of a romanticized guerrilla fighter of the past -- was fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorist attacks staged over the years against South Korea were never his 
doing, according to the fabrication. Rather, they were incidents staged by 
South Koreans as plots in Seoul's own domestic political manipulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung-ism and the ideology of juche (self-reliance) -- taught in the 
schools, drilled into the minds of workers at factories and offices, and 
instilled in the armed forces -- found no contradictions. TV sets in North 
Korea receive only state broadcasts. Only single-channel radios are sold. No 
satellite dishes or foreign publications are found there. 
</P>
<P>
 And in nearly half a century of national division, no mail, no phone calls and 
virtually no contacts between ordinary citizens of North and South Korea have 
been permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have Christ. The Muslims have Allah. We have Kim Il Sung," Pyongyang 
officials reportedly told an American when asked about the leader's 
overwhelming persona. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers praised him for bountiful harvests. Mothers thanked him for the 
successful birth of children. In the only exchange of visits between relatives 
separated on both halves of the peninsula, a South Korean Catholic bishop was 
told by his North Korean sister: "What do you mean by 'heaven'? This is heaven, 
where we are living with our Great Leader, Kim Il Sung!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasies of the phenomenon of nature enforcing the righteousness of Kim found 
fertile ground in the mythology, shamanistic animism and superstition that 
remains deeply rooted in Korean culture, both North and South. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Paekdu, for example, is where the nation's mythological founder, Dankun, 
descended to Earth to conceive the first Koreans in a union with a 
bear-turned-human. And in the myth North Korea started building two decades ago 
for Kim Jong Il, Mt. Paekdu replaced Siberia as his birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 From ancient monarchy through Japanese colonial rule through Kim Il Sung's 
reign, North Koreans have never been exposed to anything resembling freedom of 
speech or thought. Post-World War II American occupation troops introduced 
democracy to the South for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il's inheritance of his father's cult following appears certain to 
guarantee him, at least initially, a solid base of public support. The way was 
paved for his smooth ascension to power in the past three weeks -- 
contradicting predictions of some foreign analysts that the Great Leader's 
passing would precipitate a rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 But how long the cult will sustain Kim Jong Il is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after his father's death, new propaganda started being churned out 
for Kim Jong Il. The older man's dying words, North Korean media reported, 
were: "Ask the people to unite and be loyal to Kim Jong Il as they were to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing what it called an example of Kim Jong Il's "humane love" for his 
people, Radio Pyongyang last week quoted the new leader as saying, "If the 
people want, I would plant flowers and make them bloom in rocks and pull stars 
from the sky." Children were composing essays and poems praising him. 
</P>
<P>
 Woefully lacking the charisma of his father -- and Kim Il Sung's power to 
command authority -- short, chubby Kim Jong Il certainly won't find sustaining 
the cult as easy as his father did, said a Western diplomat, who asked not to 
be named. 
</P>
<P>
 "The apparatus can crank and puff all its wants to, but in the end, there has 
to be a wizard in Oz," the diplomat said. Kim Jong Il, however, hasn't even 
given a speech since he took over the country's leadership. Indeed, he has 
never publicly given a speech as far as outsiders know. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Do Kyoung, research director at the Lucky-Goldstar Research Institute 
here, said that, if Kim Jong Il is to stay around, he'll need to make some 
mark, something to feed the cult machine. "Some degree of relief" from four 
years of decline in the economy might do the trick, he said: "If people are 
eating well, they will forgive a lot of other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently has news of the outside world started trickling into North Korea 
-- mainly through China. Contacts at the countries' common border are 
relatively unfettered, and North Koreans have been able to sneak home 
pocket-size Chinese-made radios that open a crack to news of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the cult falters, however, many outside analysts agree that a civilian 
uprising is highly unlikely. The ruling Workers Party's control of the society 
and the armed forces is too tight to allow unrest to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Han Sung Joo, South Korea's foreign minister, insists that North Korea's 
new leaders will at least have to pay attention to public sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his charisma and his stature, the late president could make up for some 
of the serious economic difficulties. But a new leadership probably would be 
more vulnerable to a deterioration of the economic situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the ruling group, who know what is going on in South Korea and the 
rest of the world, are unlikely to be swayed by the cult beyond the degree to 
which it helps them maintain power. 
</P>
<P>
 They know, for example, the lie of the cult that teaches that South Korea 
suffers in poverty as a vassal of the United States with its 37,000 troops 
here. (South Korea, with twice the population of the North, operates an economy 
12 times the size of the North's.) 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's closed society, however, has rendered reading tea leaves a 
useless occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for Asia, said last week in 
Washington, "If anyone gives you flat assurances or predictions or analyses of 
what's happening in North Korea, immediately distrust him or her."

U.S. MAY OFFER TECHNOLOGY TO N. KOREA AS BARGAINING TOOL; ASIA: NEW REACTOR 
WOULD LESSEN CHANCE PYONGYANG COULD MAKE NUCLEAR ARMS. BUT COST, OTHER PROBLEMS 
LOOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration and its allies have gradually figured out what sort 
of bribe it would take to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons 
program: more advanced nuclear-power technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are zeroing in on the hard questions: What countries are going to pay 
for it and how? Who will provide the new technology to North Korea? 
</P>
<P>
 In talks with the United States, North Korean officials have made it clear 
that they would like to have what is called a light-water reactor -- that is, 
nuclear technology that is more modern and more efficient than anything in 
North Korea's existing nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 That idea is being seriously considered by the Administration because such 
advanced technology reduces the possibility that North Korea would be able to 
convert byproducts into fuel for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Light-water reactors produce a lower-quality plutonium than the gas-graphite 
technology the North Koreans are now using. U.S. officials believe North Korea 
has produced enough plutonium in its facilities at Yongbyon to make one or two 
nuclear bombs. And two months ago, Pyongyang removed spent fuel rods that could 
also be used to produce plutonium for about five weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they get rid of their gas-graphite technology, that would be much better 
than the status quo," one Administration official said. From the North Korean 
point of view, a light-water reactor would provide much-needed power for the 
country's energy-starved economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem solved? Hardly. The price tag for a light-water reactor is roughly $2 
billion. And there are all sorts of laws that would prohibit the United States 
or its allies from supplying any kind of nuclear technology to an outlaw regime 
like North Korea, with which the United States has no diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 So, at the moment, Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci -- the 
Administration's top negotiator with North Korea -- is traveling the globe, 
visiting South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, largely in an effort to resolve 
the legal and diplomatic tangles surrounding light-water reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Japan and South Korea, the countries most threatened by a North Korean 
nuclear weapon, pick up the entire tab? Should the United States contribute 
too? What countries, or companies, would supply North Korea with the 
light-water technology? Who would provide the financing? What would happen to 
the export-control restrictions? 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the sorts of questions Gallucci must resolve if he is to have any 
chance of making a deal over North Korea's nuclear program. The United States 
and North Korea are scheduled to meet in Geneva next Friday to resume the 
negotiations that were broken off when President Kim Il Sung died July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, at least, Administration officials are trying to play down the 
scope of these difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing here is less the obstacles than on just getting there," 
said one U.S. official working on North Korean issues. "We're open to anything 
that works." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are already signs of resistance in Washington to the idea of 
providing North Korea with new nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials are said to have balked at the suggestion of 
spending U.S. funds to help North Korea. Resistance in Congress seems to be 
high too. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, critics ask, even if Pyongyang eventually puts all its nuclear 
facilities under international safeguards, it is only carrying out its 
obligations as a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Why should it 
be rewarded? 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) recently won Senate approval for new 
restrictions on any U.S. financial assistance to the Pyongyang regime. And many 
existing laws, including the Trading With the Enemies Act, already bar U.S. aid 
to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have voiced hope that, in the end, South Korea and Japan will 
help pay for all or most of the costs of a light-water reactor for North Korea. 
Officials in these countries have made vague statements suggesting that they 
would be willing to support the idea but have given no firm commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to questions of money, there are also disputes over which 
country's technology might be used for a light-water reactor in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States uses light-water technology in most of its nuclear plants, 
as do South Korea, Britain, France and other countries. So does Russia, and 
Moscow has talked about supplying four light-water reactors to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian light-water reactor might be cheaper than one using Western 
technology. And it might be installed more quickly, diplomats say, because 
Russia has already done the feasibility studies that would be required if some 
other system were used. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, there would also be many 
problems in ensuring the safety of any Russian reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also conceivable that South Korea could supply the light-water 
technology. But diplomats worry that the Pyongyang regime is simply too proud 
and insecure to accept technology from the South.

AZERBAIJAN, ARMENIA AGREE TO EXTEND CEASE-FIRE ON ENCLAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed Thursday to extend the longest cease-fire yet in 
their bloody conflict over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, officials from the 
warring sides and foreign diplomats here said. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal extension of the 10-week truce along the front lines has raised 
hopes among both mediators and combatants that an end is in sight to one of the 
ugliest conflicts triggered by the collapse of the Soviet Union. At least 
15,000 people have been killed since the fighting started in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the military leader of 
Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenians signed the extension, said Vefa Gulizade, foreign 
affairs adviser to Azerbaijani President Gaidar Aliyev. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia also announced the cease-fire extension but stressed the importance of 
further talks next month about international monitors and progress toward a 
lasting political solution, the Russian news agency Interfax said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief -- and some grumbling -- greeted the news in the Azerbaijani capital, 
Baku. The agreement leaves nothing to celebrate. Up to 20% of Azerbaijan is 
still under Armenian control, and 1 million Azerbaijanis are still displaced 
from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh may still theoretically be part of 
Azerbaijan, but its 30,000 Azerbaijani residents have been expelled and it is 
now linked by conquered territory to Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev has quietly put aside vows made after coming to power last year to 
retake all territories held by Armenia. A major Azerbaijani offensive in 
January won back little land but killed and injured thousands of young, 
ill-trained Azerbaijani recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite minor clashes that have interrupted the cease-fire, brokered by Moscow 
in May, Western and Russian diplomats are unusually optimistic. They believe 
the combatants are sincere in their search for a way out of a conflict that has 
left both Armenia and Azerbaijan poor, war-weary and increasingly dependent on 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost count of cease-fires. But this one seems a blissful lull . . . on 
both sides," said Mahmoud Said, the U.N. representative in Baku.

RIVALRY BETWEEN RABIN, PERES REKINDLED OVER WHO DESERVES CREDIT FOR JORDAN PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The old rivalry between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, 
his foreign minister, has resurfaced with new bitterness over who should get 
credit for the dramatic progress in Israel's peace negotiations with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, who has pursued peace with Jordan through decades of secret contacts, 
was angered by Rabin's initial failure to invite him to Washington for the 
summit meeting with King Hussein this week. He then was upset by the way he was 
pushed into the background during the celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole trip, which focused on Rabin and Hussein, was a three-day 
"nightmare" for Peres, according to his friends. As he boarded the plane home, 
the 71-year-old foreign minister was hinting at resigning and reportedly told 
aides, "I won't let him (Rabin) damage my honor or credibility another time." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Rabin, 72, has told his political confidants that the credit for 
the Jordanian breakthrough belongs to "the man who took the hard decisions, not 
a man who creates formulas to embody those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The feuding has serious implications for Israel's continuing negotiations with 
all its Arab neighbors because, despite their sharp differences in the past, 
Rabin and Peres have proved effective partners in pushing the peace process 
forward since they returned to office two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, according to political insiders, the differences between the 
two men are wholly personal and have nothing to do with the substance of the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the daily backbiting by their aides and supporters, inflammatory 
leaks to the press and tension spreading through the government, they will find 
it difficult to work as a team, Israeli political observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, members of the Cabinet asked the two men to put aside their 
rivalry, which goes back more than 20 years, and resume their cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appealed to them and said this tension is completely unnecessary," Police 
Minister Moshe Shahal said after the Cabinet session, which approved the 
nonbelligerency declaration signed with Jordan in Washington. "There is enough 
room for both of them in history for what they have done and the achievements 
they have attained. . . . There is no need to create this tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinet member Shulamit Aloni, who has known both men since the 1940s, said, 
"There is competition here and there between them, there are misunderstandings 
here and there between them, but they are wise enough to overcome these. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are fighting for certain things . . . want to be recognized for 
(what they have done), they want the whole world to see them and hear their 
voices, they want the credit," she added, noting that Peres had "a big show" 
when he went to Jordan to lay the groundwork for the Washington trip. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matti Golan, an Israeli journalist who has chronicled the Rabin-Peres 
dynamic for years, predicted: "It simply won't end. It's much more than a 
political issue -- it's psychological and very complicated."

SYRIA'S ASSAD SEEMS TO BE EDGING TOWARD MAKING PEACE WITH ISRAEL; MIDEAST: 
OBSERVERS POINT TO THE MILD REACTION FROM DAMASCUS TO THE JEWISH STATE'S 
JUST-CONCLUDED AGREEMENT WITH JORDAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The haggling over details will go on for months, but there is growing evidence 
that Syrian President Hafez Assad has decided to make peace with Israel and end 
the longest and bitterest conflict in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Arab, Israeli and U.S. officials all point to the remarkably mild reaction 
from Damascus to this week's nonbelligerency agreement between Israel and 
Jordan as a clear indication that Assad has passed a psychological barrier and 
now is ready to make peace, provided he can get acceptable terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The most telling evidence was the live coverage that Syria's state-owned 
television service provided of the ceremony on the White House lawn ending the 
technical state of war between Israel and Jordan. The event was carried without 
critical commentary, even though Syria had long demanded that no Arab state 
make peace with Israel until all were ready to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria's broadcast of speeches by President Clinton, Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin of Israel and King Hussein of Jordan was "a good omen," said Jawad Anani, 
a Jordanian minister of state and coordinator of the kingdom's participation in 
the peace process. Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defense minister, agreed that 
the telecast showed that Assad is getting ready for serious peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the Syrians are using what is happening on the Jordanian track to 
prepare their people for what is coming," Anani said Thursday at a breakfast 
sponsored by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that there has been very little official Syrian criticism of 
Hussein's peace policy, a stark contrast to earlier years when Syria was 
vehement and sometimes violent in its opposition to any Arab country making a 
separate peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian government daily newspaper Al Baath denounced the Israel-Jordan 
agreement Thursday and warned that peace will not last unless it is 
comprehensive. But the criticism was relatively mild and was delayed for three 
days after the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who plans to visit the Middle East 
in about a week to resume efforts to broker an Israel-Syria deal, is 
uncharacteristically optimistic about his chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is certainly true that the Arab-Israeli conflict is not over yet, but 
today I think we can say with more confidence than ever before that it is on 
the road to resolution," Christopher told the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that Assad and Rabin are tough and meticulous negotiators but "both 
are determined, I believe, to find a way to a political settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official cautioned that long and detailed negotiations will be required 
before Israel and Syria reach agreement. But he said that the Syrian television 
coverage of the Rabin-Hussein handshake was "good news in itself."  
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's decision to take a lead in peacemaking after decades of hiding 
behind the Arab consensus has been interpreted as a bold act by the normally 
cautious monarch. But it seems likely that Hussein sounded out Assad's attitude 
in advance and was assured privately that the Syrian president would not make 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad's own position clearly is weaker than it was during the Cold War, when 
Damascus was one of the most important Soviet clients in the Middle East. The 
collapse of the Soviet Union ended Assad's dream of gaining military parity 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Syria maintains a formidable army that could inflict major 
casualties in any war with Israel. For this reason, neither the Israeli 
government nor the Clinton Administration wants to push Assad into a corner 
where he might become more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some who suggest that we should not chase after President Assad, 
that we should perhaps leave him out in the cold and then he will recognize 
that his only interest is to come in from the cold and engage in negotiations," 
a senior Administration official said. "It's not a question of chasing after 
Assad. It is our sense that President Assad is seriously engaged, is committed 
to achieving what he refers to as the peace of the brave." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Kemp, the National Security Council's Middle East expert in the 
Ronald Reagan Administration, said that Assad "is very nervous and definitely 
has watched this with great caution." But he said the Syrian leader may just be 
trying to hedge his bets while waiting to see how Israel's agreements with 
Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization develop.

COUPLE GUILTY OF SENDING PORNOGRAPHY BY COMPUTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A husband and wife were convicted Thursday of distributing pornography via 
computer in a case that raised questions about how to apply federal obscenity 
law to the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Carleen Thomas, both 38, of Milpitas, Calif., were each convicted 
of 11 counts of transmitting obscenity through interstate phone lines via their 
members-only computer bulletin board.Each count carries up to five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thomases remain free on $20,000 bail. No sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, jurors were shown photographs carried over the Thomases' 
bulletin board featuring scenes of bestiality and other sexual fetishes. The 
images were available, for a fee, to computer users around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A postal inspector said he joined the bulletin board under a fake name and 
received sexually explicit pictures in his computer in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense argued that prosecutors had shopped around for a place to try the 
case, looking for a city where a more conservative jury might be found. It 
raised questions about a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that obscenity must be 
judged according to local community standards.

TORNADO KILLS 3, INJURES 30 IN PHILADELPHIA AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tornado plowed through two suburban areas of Philadelphia, killing three 
people and injuring more than 30 others, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 15 homes were destroyed and 15 heavily damaged when the storm struck 
a housing development in Limerick Township, about 25 miles northwest of 
Philadelphia, just before midnight Wednesday, officials said.Seven other homes 
were severely damaged in neighboring Chester County, where the storm hit first. 
</P>
<P>
 The development is about 1 1/2-miles from PECO Energy Co.'s Limerick nuclear 
power plant, but there was no damage reported there, Montgomery County Public 
Safety Director Jim Giannini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm knocked out power to 80,000 homes in Maryland and Pennsylvania, but 
most customers had electricity back by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tornado touched down in central Delaware near Harrington, where 
several thousand people were attending the state fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was incredibly frightening," police officer Terry Helsel said. But no 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of roads littered with debris remained closed Thursday in both 
Pennsylvania counties. High-tension wires knocked loose by the storm crackled 
as they hit roads and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're instructing people just to avoid Limerick Township," Limerick police 
Sgt. William Schlichter said. "It's a total disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The heaviest damage appeared to be in a rural cluster of relatively new homes 
where Giannini said the three bodies were found. They were identified only as a 
man and woman found outside and a girl found in a home.

POSTAL HEAD IS UNDER FIRE FOR DELIVERY DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Angry members of Congress berated Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. 
Thursday for allowing the quality of mail service to deteriorate, citing 
reports of millions of pieces of mail found stashed in trucks and letters 
arriving weeks or months late in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have focused on cutting overhead and may have left the Postal Service in 
a state of unpreparedness," Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told Runyon in one of 
several heated exchanges at a House subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as 75% of the mail handled at a huge processing center in Maryland has 
been subject to delays, complained Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), citing a 
report by Postal Service inspectors. And Rep. Leslie L. Byrne (D-Va.) said that 
Postal Service managers sometimes order date stamps on bags of mail altered to 
hide delivery delays. She also said that officials had hidden some delayed mail 
on a day when she toured a postal processing center. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon pledged to improve service, blaming a Postal Service "culture" that 
sometimes allows local management officials to act like "dictators." The 
controversy over mail service in the Washington area reflected rising 
congressional skepticism about a major restructuring program launched by 
Runyon, who is beginning his third year as postmaster general. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon's defenders note that he has saved the Postal Service money through a 
buyout program that trimmed 47,000 workers from the payroll in 1992. They say 
that postal customers have benefited because he has delayed a request for a 
rate hike. The 29-cent stamp, which has been in effect for first-class mail 
since 1991, will continue until next year, when an increase to 32 cents is 
likely. Traditionally, rates have been increased every three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Runyon's critics say that the financial savings to the Postal Service and 
consumers have come at too high a cost in terms of service, that the accuracy 
and reliability of delivery has deteriorated because many of the workers who 
took the buyout were experienced mail handlers and letter carriers.

FUNERAL, TRAVEL ARRANGED AT NO COST TO THE HUBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Robert R. Risher never knew Denise Huber, nor is he acquainted with the Huber 
family. But he is a friend of Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden, and 
that's all the reason he needed to assist the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how much this case meant to (Snowden) and I wanted to help in any way 
I could," said Risher, who has arranged for the funeral and the family's travel 
at no cost to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Risher, president of a mortuary and ambulance business in Montebello, said he 
doesn't want the family to have to worry about any of the funeral plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is difficult time for people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Risher, 46, of Montebello, has assisted the Costa 
Mesa Police Department at a time of mourning. In 1987, he paid for the burial 
of two police officers who died when their helicopter crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a compliment to the human race. I love him to death," Snowden said. 
"Because (Huber's death) hurt me, it hurt him. He's an incredible guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Snowden and Risher have been friends for more than 20 years. They met when 
Snowden was a rookie officer in Montebello and Risher was driving ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like brothers," Risher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the investigation of Denise Huber's June 3, 1991, disappearance, 
Risher had tried to help. When Orange County residents started using bumper 
stickers to spread the word that the 23-year-old Newport Beach woman was 
missing, Risher asked for a stack of stickers to put on his ambulances in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 And, even though he never met the Hubers, he has been touched by their ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 22-year-old daughter and can only imagine how they feel," Risher 
said. "You've got to look at it from that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Ione Huber said the family is grateful for help with the funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Risher said he used his contacts in the mortuary business to provide the 
funeral at no cost to the Hubers. He said business associates were standing 
ready in Arizona, California and South Dakota to transport and prepare Denise 
Huber's body for the funeral, which is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday in 
Herreid, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not often that a loved one is found after such a long period of time," 
Risher said. "We just want to help put the body to rest and bring the family 
some peace."

DEMOCRATS SEEK TO FORCE HEALTH NETWORKS TO ADMIT ANY DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Setting the scene for a high-stakes brawl between doctors and managed care 
networks, Senate Democratic leaders intend to include in their health reform 
bill a provision that forces the networks to admit any physician, informed 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called any-willing-provider provision is coveted by doctors -- 
especially high-priced specialists -- who fear that they may be shunned by the 
growing numbers of health maintenance organizations and other managed care 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 By limiting the number of doctors and ensuring that they follow the group's 
guidelines on medical care, the organizations can negotiate lower fees in 
return for giving physicians access to large numbers of patients. HMOs also 
tend to concentrate on primary-care doctors, restricting patients' access to 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians say that the any-willing-provider provision would ensure that 
health care reform does not end a patient's right to choose his or her doctor 
-- or restrict a doctor's ability to do what he or she deems is best medically. 
</P>
<P>
 But managed care networks -- and many of the nation's large employers that use 
them -- say that the provision would seriously undermine cost-containment 
efforts by preventing the networks from negotiating the best possible rates 
with providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be devastating to us," said John M. Gibbons, a spokesman for the 
Alliance for Managed Competition, which represents the nation's five largest 
insurers, who have a combined managed care population of 65 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to members of Congress this week, leaders of the managed care 
industry warned that the any-willing-provider provision would "seriously 
undermine two key objectives of health care reform -- cost containment and 
quality improvement -- by eliminating health plans' ability to select high 
quality, cost-effective providers." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the fight between medical providers and the insurance 
industry-dominated managed care networks has been waged largely in state 
capitals. But with the impending introduction of major health reform 
legislation in the House and Senate, the issue is about to boil over in 
Congress -- just one of many sleeper issues that have gone virtually unnoticed 
amid the debate over universal coverage and employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Any one of such "second-tier" issues could "make or break" health care reform, 
one senior congressional aide said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The divisiveness of the any-willing-provider issue can be seen in the fact 
that in recent years 19 states have enacted it while 10 have rejected it. And 
its fate in Congress is highly uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, both Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and 
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) were putting the final 
details on the bills that they hope to take to the floors of their respective 
chambers within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gephardt set to unveil his measure today, House leaders continued their 
efforts to determine how many votes the bill -- a version of legislation passed 
last month by the House Ways and Means Committee -- could get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are having very good success in talking to individual members 
and groups of members," House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said, 
describing the initial reaction as "very positive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), another member of the leadership, said that 
there will not be a clear picture of support for the measure until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservative Democrats were not enamored with the emerging package, which 
retains President Clinton's controversial proposal that requires employers to 
pay at least 80% of a worker's insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not at all interested in the leadership plan. It's like the third 
variation of the Clinton plan," Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many House members are also reluctant to commit their votes to the health bill 
-- especially on the employer mandate issue -- until they have some indication 
of whether the Senate will retain the employer mandate.

FORMER NAACP EMPLOYEE SUES OVER SEX DISCRIMINATION SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former NAACP employee is suing the civil rights group for $250,000, claiming 
its executive director breached the terms of a sex discrimination settlement, 
the NAACP's attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Stansel of Washington, a former interim assistant to executive director 
Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., filed the lawsuit in Superior Court in the District 
of Columbia on June 30, said Abbey Hairston, attorney for the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
 Stansel, who worked for the group for five weeks in April and May, 1993, says 
that Chavis passed her over for a permanent staff position, giving jobs to men 
instead, Hairston said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stansel threatened to sue the NAACP, Chavis settled with her out of 
court, Hairston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the settlement, the NAACP agreed to pay Stansel $80,000 and 
then $5,400 per month between November, 1993, and June, 1994, Hairston said. 
Chavis also agreed to help Stansel find a government job. If Stansel didn't get 
a job by June, the NAACP was to pay her an additional $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Stansel says the fact that she didn't find a job is a breach 
of the settlement, and she is seeking $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP didn't give Stansel a permanent job because of personality clashes 
with staff members and because she demanded a $120,000 salary, Hairston said.

 When Time magazine printed a cover photo last month of America's most famous 
murder suspect with his face darkened, black journalists said they clearly saw 
a powerful message that somehow eluded the white editors who had approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Caldwell, a veteran New York columnist, said: "At Time (magazine), there 
was not one person of color in the hierarchy to pass on this" darkened photo of 
O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Johnson, a TV reporter from Washington, said: "If you have some 
diversity, you are not going to make those kinds of stupid mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams said he was "sickened" to see a 
recent Newsweek cover that portrayed four members of "Generation X." Three of 
the young persons in their 20s were stylishly dressed, but on the left side, 
with his face darkened, was a young black male wearing a gang-style kerchief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that typical of African American males? No," Williams said. "It says to me 
you should fear my two sons in their 20s, one of whom is a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 A common complaint heard among black journalists at "Unity '94," a conference 
of minority journalists here this week, is that African Americans are too often 
portrayed in the media with a "criminal face." 
</P>
<P>
 This view is shared by black readers and TV viewers as well. A USA Today-Cable 
News Network poll released this week found that 53% of blacks said members of 
their race were treated unfairly in local TV coverage of crime. Newspapers did 
not fare much better, since 47% of blacks were similarly troubled by how their 
local papers covered crime. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of Latinos said they believed that Latinos were unfairly 
portrayed in crime stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Although newspapers and magazines came in for their share of criticism, 
especially regarding photographs, the harshest comments were directed at local 
television and its near obsession with violence and mayhem. This steady diet of 
crime stories convinces many viewers, wrongly, that crime is at an all-time 
high and that whites are likely to become the victims of black criminals, the 
poll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a very small number of black people commit crimes, Harvard law professor 
Charles J. Ogletree Jr. said. "Yet we see so many images of blacks as criminals 
that it creates the presumption that all blacks are involved in crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The result, he said, is that most black males, even well-dressed 
professionals, can expect to be stopped by the police and questioned about 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI statistics show that the rate of violent crimes, such as rapes, robberies, 
assaults and murders, peaked in 1974 and has fallen 16% since then. But in a 
survey published in June, Money magazine found 88% of those surveyed believed 
that crime in America is at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, blacks are three times more likely than whites to be victims of a 
violent crime. Although black teen-age males are the most likely crime victims, 
whites over age 65 are the least likely, the FBI data says. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints about crime coverage were certainly not limited to blacks. 
Melita Garza, an ethnic affairs reporter for the Chicago Tribune, recalled 
working for a Milwaukee newspaper that ran a headline that said: "Hispanics 
Half of All Drug Felons." 
</P>
<P>
 She said there were no Latinos in top news positions at the Tribune to 
question that story. "They would never have thought of doing a story that said 
'99% of white-collar crimes are committed by white males,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where blacks find themselves routinely questioned about crimes, Latinos can 
expect to be stopped by immigration officers, she said. A fellow journalist in 
Los Angeles had the right approach, she said. When an immigration officer 
stopped him and asked to see his green card, "he pulled out his American 
Express card." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the media in California have contributed to the belief that 
Latinos are likely to be illegally in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is clearly race-based reporting," he said. "When you say 'illegal 
alien,' they immediately think 'Hispanic.' The second-largest illegal 
population is Canadians but you can't pick them out as easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans usually do not figure in crime stories, except for the recent 
wave of "Asian gang" stories, said Vic Lon, a reporter for KRON-TV in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 From the media, "you get the idea that Asian American kids are either nerds or 
in street gangs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to change crime coverage for the better? The minority 
journalists said news organizations need racial and ethnic diversity in their 
upper ranks.

BROWN ASKS FOR 5 TV DEBATES WITH WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown on Thursday proposed a series of five televised 
debates with Gov. Pete Wilson during the fall campaign; Wilson agreed there 
should be debates but said the number should be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, proposed in a letter to Wilson that she and Wilson 
meet five times around the state, beginning in Wilson's hometown of San Diego 
the evening of Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I owe the voters of California a full and public airing of our views 
on the issues that affect the lives of all of us," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 She proposed that all five be televised statewide. During the Democratic 
primary election campaign, Brown agreed to three debates but would not allow 
all of them to be broadcast statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 In response Thursday, Wilson campaign chairman George Gorton wrote to Clint 
Reilly, his counterpart in the Brown campaign, to remind him that they already 
had agreed, almost a month ago, to begin debate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In your previous correspondence on this subject, you indicated that your team 
was going to contact ours during the week of July 12, but I understand that 
that did not occur," Gorton told Reilly. "Let's see what we can do to bring 
them together." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has designated Chip Nielsen, a Sacramento and Mill Valley lawyer, to be 
his campaign's chief debate negotiator. Brown has a five-member negotiating 
team led by Los Angeles lawyer Kim Wardlaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown proposed that the five meetings be in the Los Angeles, Sacramento, 
Fresno and San Francisco television markets, as well as in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter, Brown suggested that she and Wilson hold their first session 
for one hour in San Diego before "a nonpartisan group." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton said in his response: "The governor strongly believes the public would 
benefit from statewide television debates that involve representatives of the 
political press corps." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown letter did not indicate whether she intended that reporters be 
present to ask questions. That is the sort of issue that often becomes a 
subject of pre-debate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said the governor has not yet committed 
to a specific number of debates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the primary, Brown faced Democratic challengers John Garamendi and Tom 
Hayden in three meetings: a regionally televised session in Sacramento, a 
statewide-broadcast debate from San Francisco and an afternoon meeting on radio 
station KABC in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson held one rancorous radio debate with his late-starting GOP opponent, 
Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson debated his 1990 Democratic gubernatorial opponent, Dianne Feinstein, 
once on statewide television. Attempts to arrange a second debate failed.

 Authorities were called by a woman who reported seeing a lion peeking at her 
through a window. When Monterey County sheriff's deputies went to investigate, 
they found the lion in the tree watching the playing children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies notified the Department of Fish and Game, which sent a game 
warden to the location.

SIMPSON'S FORMER IN-LAWS HOPING TO AVOID CUSTODY FIGHT FOR CHILDREN; COURTS: 
MONARCH BEACH COUPLE, WHO SEEK GUARDIANSHIP OF BOY AND GIRL, WANT MURDER 
SUSPECT TO NAME THEM AS CARETAKERS. 
</P>

 The parents of Nicole Brown Simpson are hoping that O.J. Simpson will not 
contest their petition seeking legal guardianship of his two young children, 
the Brown family's attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The family wants the former football star to formally nominate the Browns as 
guardians of his daughter, Sydney, 8, and son, Justin, 5, said William M. 
Walker, a Santa Ana attorney who filed the guardianship petition for Nicole's 
father, Louis Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran said he had not had a chance to discuss the 
Brown family guardianship request with Simpson, but added that relations 
between his client and the children's grandparents seemed solid. "I don't sense 
any rift," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers did not return calls seeking comment on the guardianship 
papers filed Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Brown family, who live in Monarch Beach, declined to talk about 
the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. Before his arrest, Simpson gave 
the Browns temporary custody of his children in a written authorization, Walker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guardianship now being sought will "cloak the (grandparents) with the 
legal authority to do what they're doing now," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do what's best for the children," Walker said. "They've been 
with their grandparents (since their mother's murder), and they're comfortable 
with their grandparents. I've been told that they are doing as best as can be 
expected under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said Louis and Juditha Brown are not trying to establish a permanent 
guardianship but one that is "reviewable whenever there is a change of 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 A court investigator is expected to interview the grandparents and file a 
report on the children's current living arrangements for a Sept. 12 hearing 
before Supervising Probate Judge John Woolley. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary guardianship would allow the Browns to make decisions for the 
children, such as enrolling them in school and providing emergency health care, 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson gets out of jail, he can petition the court to regain custody of 
his children, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts said Thursday that judges routinely approve requests by 
grandparents for temporary custody in cases where parents are unable to care 
for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Davis, founder and director of Grandparents Offering Love & Direction, 
a statewide support group of grandparents who care for their children's 
children, said it appears that in the Brown guardianship petition "the court 
doesn't have much choice." 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens if O.J. ever gets out is another problem," said Davis, a 
60-year-old San Diego County woman, who is caring for her three teen-age 
grandchildren. "But I've seen dozens of cases where the court feels obligated 
to let the children stay with their grandparents until the circumstances 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the Browns are among a growing number of senior citizens in 
California -- and across the nation -- who are caring for their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census reported that 673,000 children were living with relatives, 
mainly in the care of grandparents, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The foster-care system couldn't function, it would be extremely overburdened, 
if it didn't get such great support from grandparents," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no firm statistics on the number of grandparents who, like the 
Browns, are raising their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Grandparent Information Center in Washington estimates that 3.2 
million children nationwide live with grandparents or other relatives. In 
one-third of these households, neither parent is living in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago, the American Assn. of Retired Persons in Washington opened 
the Grandparents Information Center as a national referral service to assist 
the increasing numbers of older men and women who are raising their 
grandchildren.

POST SURVIVES TRICKY CONDITIONS; OP PRO SURFING: SHE ADVANCES TO QUARTERFINALS 
IN MIXED SWELL COMBINED WITH A LITTLE WIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After four years on the world tour, Huntington Beach surfer Nea Post left in 
December. Surfing for the first time after six months off, Post still had what 
it took in tricky conditions Thursday to advance to the women's quarterfinals 
at the Op Pro Surfing Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Post, 22, spent the afternoon watching the familiar beach break and trying to 
stay relaxed. Scanning the waves at 4 p.m., she said, "You look for 
consistency," but an hour later when she had to surf, there was none. A mixed 
swell combined with a little wind to make the three- to four-foot waves bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the 20-minute heat, Post found eight waves. After throwing 
out the high and low judges' scores from each wave and counting only the best 
four, Post moved on with two waves in the five-point range and another two in 
the four-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Andersen, who leads the women's world tour, caught 10 waves and only was 
able to score slightly higher on her top four. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tricky out there, but I hate to blame it on the conditions," Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 Post began surfing off the Huntington Beach pier 10 years ago and began 
competing as an amateur a couple years later. "I've been competing every two 
months. This is the longest break I've had in a while," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a little off out there, but I don't think it had anything to do with 
taking time off. My timing was off but I think it's just life. You know some 
days are that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Post will compete next week in the U.S. Open of Surfing and is considering 
three events in France in late August, but a couple of things might keep her 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 With an associate of arts degree from Golden West College, Post starts next 
month at UC Irvine as a physical science major. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a steppingstone," she said, adding that she plans on a career in health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more immediate jobs could also take precedence over the contests. After 
being sponsored by Op her first two years on the tour, Post paid her own way 
the next two. She estimates her earnings each of those years at $10,000 and her 
expenses at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets old," she said. But still, France has its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's risky because you never know how you'll do, but I always take extra 
surfboards there to sell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frieda Zamba, a five-time Op champion, understands the financial difficulties 
women surfers face. Athletically, she said, there isn't much difference between 
the men and the women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We catch just as many waves and we surf big waves," Zamba said. "But it's 
tougher for women as far as sponsorship goes. A lot of companies don't make 
women's clothes and there just aren't the dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be bitter, but as you get older, you realize it doesn't make sense. 
It just makes you surf bad," Zamba said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as more women surf -- this year, a record 54 have entered the Op -- things 
might get easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cori Schumacher from Oceanside, Tricia Gill, originally from Huntington Beach, 
Alisa Schwartzstein from Laguna Beach and Rochelle Ballard from Kauai, Hawaii, 
also made it through their heats and into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's surfing, amateurs Kalani Robb and Tim Curran finished one-two in 
their heat to advance into the main event. Robb of Sunset Beach, Hawaii, and 
Curran of Oxnard, also made the quarterfinals of the Op Junior, scheduled for 
4:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Drummy and Donovan Frankenreiter of San Juan Capistrano, Daniel Del 
Castillo of Redondo Beach, Doug Silva of Solana Beach and Richie Lovett of 
Manly, Australia, also advanced from the trials. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Today's schedule: 6-11:20 a.m., men's surfing main event Round 1; 11:20 
a.m.-4:40 p.m., men's surfing main event Round 2; 4:40-7:20 p.m., longboard 
main event Round 1.

POSITIVE ACTS; AN ANTI-GANG DRAMA WILL BE STAGED AT SAN FERNANDO HIGH THIS 
WEEKEND TO RECOGNIZE NINE MONTHS OF A TRUCE BETWEEN THE VALLEY'S LATINO RIVALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The clock is ticking. Every minute represents another young man who doesn't 
die. Every hour is another family that doesn't grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost nine months have passed since Latino gangs in the San Fernando Valley 
agreed to a fragile truce and, as of early this week, the same amount of time 
had passed without a single Latino gang-related homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is claiming an end to the violence. But police report that a noticeable 
peace has settled over the streets, with rivals fraternizing at parties and 
freely crossing boundaries. And one of the groups that helped forge the treaty 
-- a Christian organization called Victory Outreach -- will hold a celebration 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will stage an anti-gang play, "Duke of Earl II," Saturday and Sunday 
evenings at San Fernando High School. Organizers William (Blinky) Rodriguez and 
Javier Nunez hope to fill the school's football stadium with crowds that could 
include hundreds of rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The climate is right for something like this," said Rodriguez, a Van Nuys 
businessman whose son was killed in 1990 by gang members. "Tensions have been 
down. People haven't been looking over their shoulders every second." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who wrote "Duke of Earl II" knows a little something about looking 
over his shoulder. Pastor Ed Morales, who heads the Victory Outreach program in 
San Jose, based the drama on his experiences as the teen-age leader of a 
Fullerton barrio clique called Tokers Town. 
</P>
<P>
 The play -- which has been performed throughout California since 1979 -- 
features other former gang members playing the parts of "Duke" and "Indio," 
rival drug dealers who struggle over turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We show the drugs and violence, but we don't amplify it," Morales said in an 
interview with The Times last year. "This has a positive message." 
</P>
<P>
 It also has a religious message, with one of the main characters turning to 
Christianity. But church members say they don't "Bible-thump" the gang members. 
In addition to offering religious doctrine, they try to help with schoolwork 
and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us know what it's like to use drugs and run around on the streets 
because we have been a part of that," said Nunez, an admitted former drug 
dealer who now works in the construction business. "Once we get these young 
guys to come in and they see a portrait of their life on stage, something hits 
home. Then we offer a solution. We say, 'We're here to help you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The trick will be attracting thousands of young men and women, along with 
others in the community, to fill the bleachers at San Fernando High. Dozens of 
volunteers have been recruited to distribute flyers in East Valley 
neighborhoods. Police say they are watching over the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a large group of people, it's a potential problem," said 
Lt. Fred Tuller, coordinator of the LAPD's gang unit in the Valley. "If you 
take a large group of people who have been involved in more violence than 
average citizens, sure it raises an eyebrow." 
</P>
<P>
 But a relationship of trust has grown, if slowly, between authorities and the 
people responsible for the treaty, which reportedly began when a prison gang 
known as the Mexican Mafia ordered a halt to drive-by shootings. Last April, 
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon publicly commended both gangsters 
and Victory Outreach leaders. Police are more cautious with their praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Blinky has played a role," Tuller said. "I'd also give credit to my 
guys on the street and to the youth programs at the various councilmen's 
offices. But we could have one homicide and it could start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer can be a volatile time on the streets, with teen-agers out of school 
and temperatures soaring. That is why Victory Outreach picked summer to stage 
its anti-gang drama. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the school performances, the play will be presented at the 
group's North Hollywood church with tickets given only to the gang members who 
have regularly attended Sunday truce meetings there. In this way, Rodriguez 
hopes to build on a sense of optimism that he suggests has resulted from the 
pact. 
</P>
<P>

HATRED STILL FAMILIAR; WRITER AND PERFORMERS DRAW ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FOR 
THE DEBUT OF 'UNDER THE MOON.' 
</P>

 Everything's different, Gertrude Stein said, and yet everything's the same. 
That's the paradox Layce Gardner explores in her drama "Under the Moon," 
opening this weekend at American Renegade Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The play takes place in 1958 in Mississippi, before the civil rights movement, 
before the sexual revolution, before women's lib and gay lib. And Gardner 
comments on all of these societal advancements from the dark perspective of 
that long-ago abyss when, to paraphrase Oscar Hammerstein's lyric, "You've got 
to be taught/Before it's too late/ . . . to hate." 
</P>
<P>
 In the story, Opal Wilson, a widow, is trying valiantly to raise her three 
daughters properly. Suddenly it all seems to go awry. Her second daughter is 
beginning to discover her homosexuality. Her youngest, equating love with pain, 
is a victim of self-abuse. And her oldest is dating a black man, Henry Davis. 
Opal's prejudice rises to the boiling point, and she lashes out in anger at her 
oldest daughter's liaison. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, whose play "Tiger Lady" is enjoying an Equity production in Dallas, 
grew up in an insular Oklahoma town that had a sign on its outskirts, "If 
You're Black, Don't Let the Sun Set on You Here." In fact, she did not meet 
anyone black until she went to college, but the thought of that sign, which 
wasn't removed until she was 10 years old, was hard to erase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that just never made any sense to me," Gardner says. "I 
started having black friends in college, and seeing the racial prejudice, 
seeing it firsthand. I had a black lover about a year ago and experienced it 
again. Even in L.A., which I believe is more progressive than other parts of 
the country, there is still a lot of prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
 Then her best friend for 12 years, from college days, started dating a man who 
is half-black, half-white, and when her friend had a child, Gardner started 
thinking in terms of a plot for a play. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reasoning was," she says, "I wanted to show how it was in 1958, and how 
much it hasn't changed. It's a timeless thing. The interracial love story has 
been told before, but I wanted to take it from the female perspective, which I 
haven't seen yet. Then I juxtaposed a subplot of a lesbian to show how society 
always dictates who we can and cannot love, and how unfair it is in each 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of her cast members have memories that help to inform their 
characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Bearden, who was in the film "Working Girl" and had a recurring role on 
"One Life to Live," was born and raised in Natchez, Miss. She doesn't remember 
prejudice in her home, particularly concerning Mary, the black woman who worked 
for the family and who practically raised her. But she does remember her shock 
and disbelief when she realized that she and Mary couldn't sit in the same 
waiting room for doctors' visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearden says, "Always the glaring issue in the South was black-white. 
Sometimes people didn't like Catholics, people didn't like Jews, but it really 
was a black-white thing. I was taught by my mother to say 'colored.' In those 
days they were called three things, and the nicest was 'colored.' That was a 
sign of respect." She also remembers the civil rights movement coming in 1964, 
but says it was slow in taking hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Antwine, who plays Henry, the daughter's boyfriend, has appeared on 
"I'll Fly Away" and "In the Heat of the Night." He too was raised in the South, 
in Louisiana. Although he was born at the end of the '60s, he doesn't think 
much changed after the passage of the Civil Rights Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an unsaid code," he states. "You know you shouldn't do certain 
things. You know you shouldn't join certain organizations because you actually 
don't belong. You tend to follow that code that's unsaid, and everybody tends 
to deny it. It's going on here in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Do Henry's character and his situation sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 Antwine says, "Henry Davis reminds me so much of myself, in that he doesn't 
want to be a part of what's going on there in Mississippi. Not wanting to be a 
part of the old school, wanting to break away from that. He's tired of the 
bowing down, the back-seating, the humbleness. He wants so much to be accepted. 
And respected. I can relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright and her actors agree that it is the same kind of socially 
dysfunctional thinking of people who hate everyone who is different. As Gardner 
says, "I'm trying to point out the irrelevancy of it all. I guess in this play 
it's love versus fear. But love is good. Who cares, as long as you're loving, 
truly loving?" WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; ACTORS GET PERSONAL IN 'LIFE TIME'; DRAMA BUILDS ON A COLLAGE 
OF EXPERIENCES. BUT THE TALES ARE SO TROUBLE-FREE, THEY DON'T SEEM REAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes frequently about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any lab, lab theater requires its visitors to enter with caution. As the 
term im plies, it's hatched by the theater's resident artists. The material 
stirred up in the dramaturgical vials is often personal, perhaps 
autobiographical, and even more often raw -- as in first-draft raw. 
</P>
<P>
 By this standard of lab theater, Two Roads Theatre's current experiment, "Life 
Time," is perfectly fine. It is so uncongealed that the actual author credits 
go out to, well, everybody. The writers are Mark York and Darrell Rooney, but 
the program informs us that the show was "conceived" by York (who is also 
credited as director), while it was also "created" by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life Time" is a case of everyone tossing their favorite ingredients into the 
brew, which is simmered and stirred slowly. It takes the form of a collage of 
moments from the lives of seven people (plus glimpses of a few offstage), from 
birth to death. While they all eventually grow out of childhood, Rooney's set 
of child's toy blocks suggests that they never quite leave childhood behind. 
</P>
<P>
 This, alas, may be the most interesting idea in "Life Time," which is badly 
split between an urge to lampoon a rosy "Ozzie and Harriet" view of Americans 
growing up and the urge to promote it. The clues are laid early on that these 
lives will be generally ones of upward mobility, personal fulfillment, 
tranquillity and general satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, there are a few blips along the way -- kid sister is a pain, the booze 
gets out of control. But the lives in "Life Time" are generally so untarnished 
that they cease to resemble real life at all and begin to resemble television 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 So, whose lives are these? Another program note states that "while much of 
what you see in 'Life Time' is based on truth, it is not always the truth of 
the actor who speaks it." Thus, the lives of ensemble members Rooney, Johnny 
Cann, Karen Getz, Steve Lanza, Julia Rogers, Sam Williams Neukom and G. Charles 
Wright aren't exactly on view here, even though the characters they play share 
their first names. 
</P>
<P>
 These people come of age in what sounds to be the '60s and '70s and, yet, 
there's no sense of the era's cultural upheavals. The widest range we hear is 
on the subject of spiritual belief, ranging from devout Christianity to 
atheism. Nobody dies prematurely; nobody gets pregnant at the wrong time; 
nobody, in fact, suffers any dramatic loss, except of offstage acquaintances 
whom we never meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's much to be said for putting decent people on stage; Wendy 
Wasserstein has been making a career of it. But uniform decency is as bland as 
uniform nastiness. Lanza, for instance, is a born skirt-chaser, but ends up as 
loyal and monogamous as everyone else. Only Wright, as a film student, projects 
an air of irony, which this lab experiment is deeply in need of. That, and a 
lot more time behind closed doors, before the public is let back in. WHERE AND 
WHEN

THE BRITS ARE BACK; BARRY WHITWAM OF HERMAN'S HERMITS SAYS THE BAND HAS MADE 
MORE THAN 60 AMERICAN TOURS. NEXT STOP IS NORTH HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The British Invasion of the mid-1960s didn't last long. By 1970, the Beatles 
were gone. The Who never made it past the '80s. And now only the Rolling Stones 
and the Kinks still release albums with any regularity and fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say other survivors of the U.K.'s capture of the American pop 
charts haven't kept busy. Take Herman's Hermits, whose massive hits "I'm Into 
Something Good," "There's a Kind of Hush" and "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely 
Daughter" still echo on oldies stations all over the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never stopped touring," says drummer Barry Whitwam, an original member 
of Herman's Hermits, who emerged from Manchester, England, in 1964. "I think 
this is the 67th tour of America." 
</P>
<P>
 The band's current road trip lands them at the Palomino in North Hollywood for 
two shows at 9 and 11 tonight. And for most of each set, the quartet will focus 
on the old songs, smooth pop from "Silhouettes" to "I'm Henry VIII, I Am," that 
made them regular visitors to top-10 singles charts. in the U.K. and America. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first recorded (the songs), we were frightened to death to go into 
the studio," says Whitwam, 48. "Now we're confident, 30 years on. We enjoy 
playing them, as authentically as we can." He laughs. "There were mistakes on 
the records, but now there's no mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The sort of audience Herman's Hermits now find during tour stops at state 
fairs, clubs, casinos and other venues is also a bit more mixed, crossing 
generational boundaries, than the throngs of teen-age girls that greeted them 
in the early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen kids of 5 years old singing 'I'm Henry VIII' and 'Mrs. Brown,' and 
I've seen their grandparents singing along," Whitwam says. "If you get a few 
thousand people singing the songs you made, it's a tremendous atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Until last May, Whitwam was sharing that experience with founding guitarist 
Derek (Lek) Leckenby, who died June 4 of non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Leckenby, who 
was 51, battled the disease for two years. "It seemed stable, but about four 
months ago he was getting a bit more ill," Whitwam says. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final show May 29 at an outdoor festival outside Seattle, Leckenby 
played his guitar while sitting on a folding chair, too weak to sing. But he 
still earned a standing ovation, according to band manager Julie Smith. "He was 
a brilliant guitar player who never got the attention he deserved for the 
simple reason that Herman's Hermits were known for softer pop," Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another original member of the band, guitarist Keith Hopwood, is set to rejoin 
Herman's Hermits and fill Leckenby's spot after the summer tour. In the 
meantime, Paul Downing, 48, is filling in. (Others performing in Herman's 
Hermits on this tour are singer-guitarist Rod Gerrard, 48, and singer Keith 
Roberts, 38.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before he died, Leckenby had helped Herman's Hermits finish a new album of 12 
songs in a Liverpool studio. Like their never-released "Whale of a Tale" album, 
the new project reflects the band's current interest in country music, with 
such new titles as "After the Rain" and "Ghost Town." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more country rock than the old Herman's Hermits kind of groove," Whitwam 
says. "Before we actually formed Herman's Hermits, we had a country-rock sort 
of feel. But when we did our first record, 'I'm Into Something Good,' that was 
the direction we were advised to go in. It made sense, really. You have a hit 
record, go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 That record was just the first of 22 singles and nine albums released by the 
band, selling more than 60 million throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our image was very clean, the boy-next-door kind of image," Whitwam adds. 
"That's possibly why it came off in America, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The original lineup, led by singer Peter Noone, started to break apart in late 
1971, when Noone left to pursue a solo career. Hopwood followed in 1973 to 
build a sound studio. Bassist Karl Green left in 1983 to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Noone's departure that signaled the end of the band's string of pop 
hits. "It's a shame, really," Whitwam says now. "Because when you break a 
successful combination up, it's usually that none of the two parties will see 
the same kind of success that you had together. He never had another hit record 
of his own after that, and we've not." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without any new chart-toppers, Whitwam says the lifestyle he is enjoying 
now with Herman's Hermits, taking their music on the road for 200 shows a year, 
is ultimately satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to this age, you can have some fun with it. There's no pressure. You 
just do what you enjoy. If I wasn't doing it with Herman's Hermits, I'd be 
doing it in another kind of band. The road is in my blood." WHERE AND WHEN

MUSIC MAN AGAIN; STEPHEN GEYER QUIT AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS SONGWRITING CAREER TO 
PEN FOR TV. HE FOUND SUCCESS THERE, TOO. NOW HE'S BACK, MIXING JAZZ AND POP AT 
LE CAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crouched over his guitar, his voice a mixture of Glen Campbell's honey tones 
and B. B. King's ironic grit, Stephen Geyer entertains a small crowd at the 
Room Upstairs at Le Cafe with his sometimes strikingly original songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The selections, from "Dreams," which was recorded by John Denver, to the 
pulsating instrumental "Django Bango," move easily between the worlds of pop 
and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Geyer, although not a major name, has enjoyed major success as a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Believe It or Not," the theme song -- co-written with Mike Post -- from 
the ABC network TV show "The Greatest American Hero," hit No. 2 on the 
Billboard pop charts in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Geyer also wrote hits for Campbell, Denver, Kenny Rogers, Smokey Robinson and 
others, and consistently contributed songs to various TV shows, from NBC's 
"Blossom" to ABC's "Hardcastle & McCormick." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this, in 1987, with his 15-year career in full roar, Geyer pretty 
much dropped out of the music business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got burned out," he says. "I was making a very good living writing songs on 
assignment, but I wasn't writing for my own needs. I had forgotten why I had 
become a songwriter in the first place, which was to express my own feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 So the multitalented Geyer, who returns to Le Cafe on Wednesday, retreated to 
his home in Newbury Park and taught himself to write scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I studied fine art in college, then I wrote songs and played music," says 
Geyer, 43. "So it was natural that I seek another creative venue, and that 
turned out to be writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Though in the interim he contributed some tunes to TV shows such as "Cop 
Rock," since 1988 Geyer has focused on script writing. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, using connections established in his songwriting days, Geyer landed 
a job as a staff writer for the series "Sonny Spoon," produced by Stephen J. 
Cannell, writer and producer of "The A-Team" and "The Rockford Files." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Geyer has continued to write for episodic TV and is now pursuing 
writing for feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in spite of the favor he found in his new field, Geyer felt that 
something was missing, and late last year was drawn back to songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music finally grabbed me again," he says. "I started hearing it inside, 
and I started writing it down." 
</P>
<P>
 The first song he wrote was called "Night Train," which was inspired by the 
horrors of the civil war in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching the TV footage, and it affected me emotionally," he says. "I 
was watching a holocaust, and I thought that maybe it would mean something if I 
wrote a song. It's a mixture of social commentary and jazz meter and, I feel, 
it says something that needs to be said." 
</P>
<P>
 Geyer uses the image of a train because "it's a powerful, dark image that 
symbolizes the malevolent energy that runs through the events from Dachau to 
Sarajevo to Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sample lyric: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumble of iron, the hissing of hate, Lambs to the slaughter on the engine 
of state, The victors and victims just links in a chain, A passage from 
pleasure to pain on the night train. "  
</P>
<P>
 Other songs followed "Night Train" and, earlier this year, Geyer decided that 
it was time to perform the new material. 
</P>
<P>
 He formed a rehearsal band with the crew that appears with him at Le Cafe: 
guitarist Rick Illejay, bassist Osama and drummer Gary Gibbons. That ensemble 
began performing at the Room Upstairs in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephen brings a fresh take to songs," says Dale Jaffe, who owns Le Cafe. 
"There's something strong and appealing about what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Geyer has played Southern California in the past as a 
singer-guitarist -- he's also worked as a studio session guitarist and as a 
conductor for pop acts -- he says the Le Cafe dates are the first that blend 
his fondness for jazz with his pop bent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see if I do a jazz-pop synthesis and have it mean something 
commercially," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Lima, Peru, the son of a CIA officer, Geyer lived in Okinawa, England, 
the Philippines and then Rockville, Md., where he began his performing career 
as a folk and rock guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to California in 1972, after graduating from Towson State College in 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, Geyer says, "the road I had been on didn't take me to where I 
thought it would. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm on that road." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>

 Epigram: 
</P>
<P>
 -- April 23, 1994, 4:32 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "Katie lied to me, too. Minnie told me that Katie and Matt DID get together 
last weekend. I got mad at her, but things are fine now, although I still am a 
little hurt because I know I never would've found out if Min hadn't said 
anything. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 -- From the diary of Ashley Anderson, 16, of Westlake Village 
</P>
<P>
 From the vantage point of a teen-ager, life can seem pretty forbidding -- a 
web of Byzantine social codes, parental judgments and looming responsibilities. 
But in the midst of all the Angst , some find comfort in a friend who won't 
criticize or talk back: their diary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things happen in my life that I can't share with anyone," says Leslie Jay 
Griffith, 15, who recently completed her sophomore year at Notre Dame High 
School in Sherman Oaks. In times of crisis, she reaches for a bound book with 
blank pages and a combination lock that she writes in almost daily, especially 
when she's troubled. "I write to figure out how I feel about a situation," she 
says, "and how I feel about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 A mix of confidant, running biography and social record, the teen-age journal 
has long been a standard icon of the tumultuous passage from youth to 
adulthood. But unlike the cliche of the carefree, 1950s-era adolescent lounging 
on a chenille bedspread writing "Dear Diary," today's young journal-keepers may 
face a level of stress unimaginable to their elders. 
</P>
<P>
 For those coping with the lure of early sex or drug use, living in fragmented 
families or going to violent schools, a diary can be a lifeline amid the 
confusion, a means of sorting out the conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's horrendous being a kid today," says Carol Walters, an eighth-grade 
English teacher at Holmes Middle School in Northridge. "Many have no one they 
trust to talk to. But getting your thoughts on paper can be cathartic." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Walters' regular in-class assignments involves journal-writing to taped 
music. "(Students) write whatever they want as they listen -- whatever comes to 
mind," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Although her pupils tend to steer away from the overly personal and to 
free-associate, Walters says, there are times when the exercise evokes a flood 
of feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Alyse Wax, 14, of Northridge, for example, has occasionally been bored with 
Walters' class-time journal and usually sticks to musings on "shopping and fine 
guys." After the suicide of rock star Kurt Cobain, however, she "wrote and 
wrote. Miss Walters would say, 'Put your pencils away,' and I'd still be 
writing." The process eased her obsessive brooding, she remembers, and even 
helped her to sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Anderson, 16, of Westlake Village has found similar relief in the 
discipline of personal writing. Since beginning a journal two years ago, she 
reports, "I don't have as many problems on my mind -- with my parents, with my 
friends, with anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to its supportive role, she sees her diary as a detailed 
record of her childhood, which she and possibly others will someday read "to 
find out what really happened." Because of this, and because she is considering 
becoming a writer, she composes her entries carefully, to impress her future 
public. Which may be why, although she hides her journal, she isn't worried 
about discovery. "I'd be embarrassed, but I could handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are more concerned. Leslie, besides keeping her diary locked, has 
inscribed the front with a warning: "If I ever die and someone finds this, 
don't read it and don't publish it." 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that her deepest thoughts stay buried, Leslie sometimes illustrates 
them in a sketch pad instead of voicing them in her journal. She did this a 
year ago when a friend died. "If something happens that's so bad I don't want 
to write it out, I'll draw it out," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 As secret but permissible as diary-writing is for girls, it seems verboten for 
teen-age boys. "If they do keep one, they don't talk about it," Leslie 
speculates. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly, says R. J. Comer, a 30-year-old law student and editorial consultant 
for Caffeine magazine in Woodland Hills. Comer, who has kept a journal for 15 
years, recalls that when he first started, "I would never tell my school 
friends about it. It was a girl thing to do!" 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that many teen-age boys keep notes on their lives, although 
perhaps more haphazardly than girls.  
</P>
<P>
 His own journal-writing arose out of "a compulsion to make order out of 
experience" -- the same need that moves him to write poetry and fiction. 
Indeed, many of his finished literary works owe their existence to journal 
entries. "A diary," he says, "is a refrigerator full of writing. You can 
combine things from it and make dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 His journal is a habit that he couldn't break if he tried. "I discover things 
about myself in it," he explains. "I can read back and watch myself mature. 
Somewhere along the line, I got what Socrates meant when he said an unexamined 
life is worthless."

 "A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America," by Ronald Takaki. 
</P>
<P>
 "Takaki looks at a variety of groups -- Irish, African Americans, Asians -- 
primarily from their own voices. It looks at their perspective of American 
history in a way that's lively and emotional and also reminds us of some of the 
shameful episodes in our history. I think that, in L.A., it is a particularly 
great book for people who are conscious of the ethnic diversity around us."

times. He used to hang out with Eddie Cochrane. He was really a rocker at

 "This is the newest in a series of murder mysteries. The first one was called 
'Rules of Prey,' with a serial murderer who had these rules he'd follow, like 
'Never murder anybody you know.' That caught my attention. The investigative 
work in Sandford's books is very good. Even though this is my job, it's an 
escape because I don't get so wrapped up in the cases." "Night Prey," an 
excerpt 
</P>
<P>
 At three in the morning, the apartment hallways were empty, silent, smelling 
of rug cleaner, brass polish, and cigarettes. At the eleventh floor, he stopped 
a moment behind the fire door, listened, then went quietly through the door and 
down the hall to his left. At 11:35, he stopped and pressed his eye to the 
peephole. Dark. He'd greased the apartment key with beeswax, which deadened 
metal-to-metal clicking and lubricated the lock mechanism. He held the key in 
his right hand, and his right hand in his left, and guided the key into the 
lock. It slipped in easily.  
</P>
<P>
 Koop had done this two hundred times, but it was a routine that clattered down 
his nerves like a runaway freight. What's behind door number three? A motion 
detector, a Doberman, a hundred thousand in cash? Koop would find out . . . He 
turned the key and pushed: not quickly, but firmly, smoothly, his heart in his 
mouth. The door opened with a light click. He waited, listening, then stepped 
into the dark apartment, closed the door behind him, and simply stood there.  
</P>
<P>
 And smelled her.

COVER STORY; THE SOUND OF WATER; BURBLING FOUNTAINS, WITH THEIR COOLING MISTS, 
ARE THE FOCAL POINTS OF MANY VALLEY PARKS, PLAZAS AND MALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The architects employed to resurrect the earthquake-ravaged Northridge Fashion 
Center have based their rede sign around a series of airy courts, each 
accentuated by a burbling fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attention it draws and the entertainment it provides -- people respond to 
water," said Mark Lauterbach, a project designer for RTKL Associates Inc. in 
Dallas, which has finished initial plans for the center. "If you go into any 
shopping mall that has a fountain, you always see kids sitting around and 
playing with the water." 
</P>
<P>
 This fascination with jets and streams, cascades and bubbles, reaches back 
thousands of years. It is the stuff of history, myth and religion. It is a 
bewitchment that incites men in business suits to try their luck at sprinting 
between the watery jets of a ground-level fountain at CityWalk in Universal 
City. Or incites grown-ups to close their eyes and toss a coin in the fountain 
at Encino Place. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many coins that it jams the filters in the fountain. We have to clean 
three times a week," said Tom Pashaie, the mall's co-owner. "What can you do? 
People want to make wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 And, on a smothering summer day in the San Fernando Valley, they want to feel 
a little cooler. Waiting for an audition at the Academy of Television Arts & 
Sciences in North Hollywood, Barbara Piniero found herself drawn to a fountain 
in the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a desert so the presence of water is essential," the Santa Monica 
woman said. "It's the sound. Very calming." 
</P>
<P>
 The first fountains were natural springs often thought to harbor spirits. 
Ancient Greeks built statues of gods and goddesses around these sites. 
Christians called their Lord "the fountain of living waters" while, in Islam, 
fountains were associated with paradise. And the myth of the Fountain of Youth 
sent Juan Ponce de Leon searching the New World.  
</P>
<P>
 But gushing waters nurtured more than spiritual life. Whether natural or 
engineered, the fountain served as a source of survival, a place where 
villagers could fill their buckets each day. At the same time, they could pour 
out gossip. So fountains became a social gathering place, said Kenneth Nakaba, 
chairman of the Landscape Architecture Department at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern designers have not lost sight of this. In Los Angeles, they have placed 
fountains in parks and public squares, in commercial plazas and shopping 
centers.  
</P>
<P>
 At Encino Place, for instance, the fountain serves as a focal point for rows 
of shops. A sculpted muse rises from the splashing water, peering from tiptoes 
at the passing rumble of Ventura Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 The attraction of such a feature is two-fold, architects say: Some people 
watch the fountain, others watch the people watching the fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers look on as children reach for water that glides down granite panels 
in the Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park. At CityWalk, visitors who race through the 
fountain are often cheered by others standing at a safe, dry distance. 
Lauterbach hopes for a similar dynamic at the Northridge mall.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're creating an environment that's entertaining," he said. "Fountains 
provide a background sound, noise and animation." 
</P>
<P>
 These aesthetic considerations arose mainly after the advent of plumbing, when 
there was no longer a need to visit the main square for fresh water. In the 
great cities, waterworks such as Rome's Fountain of the Four Rivers served as a 
soft element of nature amid hard-edged masonry. On private grounds, they became 
a status symbol.  
</P>
<P>
 Romans adorned their gardens with waterworks. King Louis XIV decorated the 
Palace of Versailles with tiered fountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of how many fountains can you have in your garden, how big 
can they be and how many splashes can they make," Nakaba said. 
</P>
<P>
 This tradition carried to the 18th Century and North America, where Eastern 
architects borrowed from their European background while Spaniards decorated 
the Western missions with fountains.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Valley's first fountain was the one at San Fernando, Rey de Espana 
in Mission Hills. Of simple brick design, it was copied from an existing 
fountain in Cordoba, Spain, and fed by waterworks constructed in the early 
1800s. Today, the fountain sits dry in Brand Park while a replica flows in the 
refurbished mission's east garden.  
</P>
<P>
 Not far south, the Burbank City Hall offers a water feature from a much later 
period. The Depression-era building features an Art Deco, black-and-turquoise 
fountain. Set between staircases, it cannot serve as a gathering spot. But its 
colors, its jets and falls accentuate the massive structure that rises in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly striking fountains adorn Forest Lawn in Griffith Park. In Sherman 
Oaks, The Grand complex has a waterfall in its lobby. In North Hollywood, the 
Television Academy's fountain serves as an homage to the Emmy Award. A replica 
of the statuette stands on a black-tile pedestal with water cascading all 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the concentric circles," Piniero said. "The symmetry is very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most grandiose fountains maintain an aspect of function. The 
sound of running water can have a soothing effect on the psyche, said Achva 
Benzinberg Stein, an associate professor of architecture at USC. Experts also 
say the evaporation of splashing water cools surrounding air. 
</P>
<P>
 This effect was prized in the Middle East, where fountains were thought to 
originate. The look and sound of water softened the surrounding desert's 
harshness. Fountains provide similar respite in Los Angeles centuries later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water is the soul of the Southland," architecture critic Leon Whiteson opined 
in a 1993 article in The Times. "Without it, the vast metropolis would have 
remained a small town lost in a semidesert, instead of a good, green place 
rich, first in orchards and now in lawns and gardens." 
</P>
<P>
 So, on a recent weekday, Bruce Lerner emerged from the Nestle building in 
Glendale and stooped to hold his hand over the spurts of water that shot from a 
low, star-shaped fountain. And, across town, Mashariki Walker, 14, pushed her 
2-year-old brother, Bahati Usafi, in a stroller to the edge of the Television 
Academy's fountain. They sat sharing a Popsicle.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he would like it," Walker said, pointing to the fountain's 
splashes. "It's kind of refreshing." A Dry Approach 
</P>
<P>
 The splashing of an elaborate fountain does not cool Achva Benzinberg Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 An associate professor of architecture at USC, Stein grows hot under the 
collar when discussing much of the waterworks she sees in Southern California. 
To her, several jets and walls of cascading water seem ludicrous in a semiarid 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything you design that does not teach about the natural environment, in my 
opinion, is not desirable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, after all, is a city that has always grappled with the scarcity 
of water. Great aqueducts have been built. Seasons of rationing have been 
enforced. While Stein does not oppose the use of water in architectural design, 
she believes that such use should express the reality of the setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to have reflective pools or large fountains," the professor 
said. "Everywhere you go in California, you see places where there is only a 
little water or water only occasionally. In some gardens, they have dry creeks 
to remind you that there may be water." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the human desire to feel cool on a hot day, the professor suggests that 
tree shade goes further to reduce the temperature than minor evaporation or the 
sound of splashing. In that respect, she fears that most fountains are designed 
primarily to soothe the egos of their designers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just for looks and sound, I mean, we are not the children of Louis 
XIV." 
</P>
<P>
 All it would take to stem the tide of elaborate waterworks, she said, would be 
a few innovative designers. Stein is not holding her breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. landscaping starts at the end of the hose," she said. "I think it's 
crazy. And I don't think it is beautiful when it's just splashed everywhere. We 
have overdeveloped eyes and underdeveloped brains."

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: BIG COMFORT, SMALL PRICE; NANCY B.'S FACTORY OUTLET IN 
SUN VALLEY OFFERS LARGE-SIZED FASHIONS FOR THOSE ON A BUDGET.

<P>
 Cool and comfortable. That's what we all want to be on warm summer days. So 
when it comes to apparel, nothing snug will do. Let the air circulate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trade, dresses that do this are called "floats." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy B. has designed and manufactured floats and other apparel for larger 
women -- or women who simply like the loose look -- for more than 24 years. 
Physical Attraction is the main label. It can be found in all 250 shops of a 
major chain. But the manufacturer asked that we not identify the chain. Some of 
the same styles are sold under the private labels of several other Southland 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The average retail prices for Nancy B. separates range from $25 to $45. But at 
Nancy B.'s Factory Outlet in Sun Valley, expect to pay wholesale or sometimes 
much less. The outlet inventory includes manufacturer's overruns, samples and 
some seconds of the current or last season's designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds are on racks in the foyer, with bits of tape placed next to the flaws. 
Examine all these items carefully, because some have major flaws. Dickeys and 
tank tops were $2, and other tops, pants, skirts and jackets were $4. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop's main room is small but filled with Physical Attraction merchandise. 
The "One Size Fits Most" line attracts women who regularly wear sizes 10 to 20, 
soon-to-be mothers and almost anyone who is into camouflage and comfort. There 
is an abundance of oversized, polyester-cotton interlock T-shirts sized in this 
fashion. These retail for about $36, but the below-wholesale price was $15. A 
few solids, plaids and stripes in summer shades were on the rack, but most were 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall women will appreciate the rack devoted to those 5-foot-8 and taller. 
Pants and skirts that retail for $32 to $35 were marked at $8.  
</P>
<P>
 Another rack was crammed with muumuus in a polyester-cotton fabric for $10.  
</P>
<P>
 We spotted some cutoffs we liked for $8 that founder Topper Blumberg said sold 
wholesale for $14. There were also hand-painted tops with pants to match that 
he told us sold in retail stores for about $60. The price here was $12 for the 
tops and $8 for the pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumberg started Nancy B. -- named after his eldest daughter -- about 28 years 
ago and has kept it a family business. He is pleased that his son, Bruce, has 
taken enthusiastically to the business, and both father and son are proud of 
the fact that all of their merchandise is made in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the thread is made here," the senior Blumberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a true factory outlet, located on the premises of the manufacturing 
plant. There are no dressing rooms and credit cards are not accepted. They take 
cash only. It's important to make decisions carefully, too, since there are a 
few other "noes": No exchanges, no refunds, no exceptions. WHERE TO SHOP 
</P>
<P>
 What: Nancy B.'s Factory Outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 11759 Sheldon St., Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cards: None. Cash only.

 Despite the convenience of being in a shopping center with a Kinko's and a 
self-service laundry next door, Common Grounds in Northridge is more than just 
a coffeehouse to visit while your term paper is being bound, or your clothes 
are on the spin cycle. There is no cover charge, but there is a $2.50 minimum 
at the tables during live performances, which pack in the college crowd seven 
nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: Tables and chairs fill a medium-size room, with a tiny stage on one 
side of the entrance and a large sofa on the other. T-shirts of jazz greats 
such as Miles Davis and Dexter Gordon line the walls and also are for sale. In 
addition to coffee, the place offers tea, sandwiches, salads, pastries and 
bagels, but no alcohol. Trivial Pursuit, Scrabble and other board games are 
available for customers to play. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Almost strictly CSUNers, with a smattering of high school students 
and baby-boomers mixed in. Lots of shorts, T-shirts, backward baseball caps, 
flip-flops and sneakers. A card game was in full gear at one table, while two 
guys were engrossed in their chess match at another. Owner Paul Solomon says 
crowd size depends on the act performing, but swells to standing room only most 
nights during the school year. "The people are nicer here," JoAnna Gadeke, 20, 
of Northridge said while waiting for her laundry. "I went to Ground Zero in L. 
A. near USC and the people there weren't that friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Wednesdays are open-mike nights, with host Scott Edwards. Sign-up 
acts get a limit of two songs or 10 minutes. Open poetry is featured on the 
last Thursday of every month. Other nights, there's an eclectic mix of live 
alternative rock. By popular demand, jazz bands will be featured during August. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: The variety of music and the good coffee are cited by customers as 
the main attraction. "There's no other place like this in terms of the people 
and the laid-back atmosphere," said Valery Vargas, 18, of Van Nuys. Scott 
Stanley of Northridge has been to Common Grounds from Day One. "This is the 
kind of place where you can just hang and be cool," Stanley said. "Nobody cares 
how you dress, the music is different every night, the coffee's great and, 
during the school year, this place just fills up with college babes." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "I'm a smoker," Stanley added. "I wish I could smoke in here." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "Please excuse my fingers, they don't do anything I want when I'm 
nervous," prefaced a woman to the audience before her vocal and guitar 
performance at open mike. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Grounds, 9250 Reseda Blvd., Northridge, (818) 882-3666. Hours: 8 a.m. 
to midnight Mondays through Thursdays, 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. Fridays, 9 a.m. to 1

RELUCTANT NOVICE: STAYING IN STEP; STOMPING COMES EASILY, BUT IT'S THE FANCY 
FOOTWORK THAT TANGLES THE TOES IN COUNTRY LINE DANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems like a good omen that the first song I hear entering the cowboy bar 
has the refrain, "If Bubba can dance, then I can, too." I am ready to try 
country line dancing, where everyone queues up and, precise as a chorus line, 
kicks their feet, stomps their heels and twirls in syncopation. 
</P>
<P>
 My country music epiphany came at a company picnic, when an office secretary 
taught the Tush Push line dance. She looked adorable in her tight jeans, and 
appeared to be getting nearly as much exercise doing the three-minute dance as 
I do in an hour of aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two major advantages to line dancing: It's great exercise and you 
don't need a partner -- a distinct plus when your husband would rather sing 
than dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Country music has become less twangy and more rock 'n' roll since I scoffed at 
it in college, when Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones were staples on 
my stereo. (Although it is disconcerting to hear Janis Joplin's bluesy "Piece 
of My Heart" rendered country.) 
</P>
<P>
 Corralling two friends for moral support, I struggle into jeans, pull on boots 
and gallop off to the Cowboy Palace Saloon in Chatsworth for their free dance 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructor Charlotte Millerd, a bubbly blonde wearing a short red, tiered 
skirt, matching fringed shirt and white boots, jokingly warns that she has two 
"right" feet -- she confuses her right and left when calling out the steps. 
This is my kind of dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Boot Scootin' Boogie" is the first lesson -- a relatively simple dance with 
about two dozen steps done to a catchy Brooks & Dunn tune of the same name. The 
trick is remembering all the steps, and in the right order. I am nearly lost 
from the first beat, when we step forward, turn halfway round and back again. 
(Is the room spinning or is it me?) 
</P>
<P>
 Learning the steps, I am all thumbs, which is even worse than having two left 
feet when trying to dance. But patient Charlotte reviews each step before 
moving on. The "grapevine" is next . . . whew, something I remember from 
aerobics: a simple step to the right, cross behind with the left foot and 
repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 My toes tangle a bit when I try to do a sort of hop-skip-scoot forward, but I 
get the kick OK, and I am great at the stomping part. Putting the steps 
together requires my total concentration; if my mind wanders, so do my feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now turn around and face the 'outhouse,' " drawls Charlotte. I immediately 
lose my bearings trying to dance facing the opposite direction. We do one 
repetition, then two. Then whaddaya know -- we've done the entire dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Crank up the jukebox, Roy, I'm ready to rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa! The music is much faster than the way we practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 But within a couple of beats, with Charlotte shouting instructions, we're 
dancin' and stompin' and even having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, we mosey over to the larger and more upscale Denim & Diamonds 
in Woodland Hills, which boasts two bars, a free happy hour buffet and two 
dance floors -- a large one in the middle and a smaller one where folks can 
practice or learn new steps. 
</P>
<P>
 I've even bought one of those short, swirly skirts. (My teen-ager made gagging 
noises and made me swear not to wear it around her friends.) 
</P>
<P>
 At D&D, we're in luck -- the class is a beginning two-step, one of the most 
basic of the couples dances. If you don't have a partner, don't worry, 
instructor Paula Benedetti will coax the cowboys from the bar stools and match 
you up. 
</P>
<P>
 She teaches the gals their moves first, then the guys, then we put our steps 
together. There is momentary panic as I seek my partner. (What if I don't 
remember what he looks like? What if he's left?) But we connect as Paula tells 
the men where to put their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right hand is your turn signal," she says, demonstrating how he uses it 
like a tiller to guide his backward-moving partner around the floor, guiding 
her deftly around corners and avoiding collisions with other couples. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paula also explains dance floor etiquette -- slower dancers move inside, 
preserving the outer circle for the movers, twisters and twirlers. We try 
two-stepping to music. You can spot the newcomers -- we look very serious and 
don't engage in small talk. Our lips move as we count off the steps -- slow . . 
. slow . . . quick-quick . . . slow . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My partner and I actually two-step our way through a song and are doing fine 
until the music gets faster. After I crush his Tony Llamas for the fourth time, 
he thanks me and leads me off the floor mid-song. 
</P>
<P>
 After the lessons, the serious dancers come out. I watch enviously for awhile, 
and when the DJ announces the Boot Scootin' Boogie, I feel cocky enough to 
sashay onto the floor. Tappin' my boots to the opening beat, wondering just how 
far my skirt will swirl, I move on the first note -- left foot out, turn, turn 
. . . . Yikes! I turn right into my neighbor, who was grapevining while I was 
pivoting. What's wrong here? 
</P>
<P>
 I scoot my boots right off that floor and watch, frustrated: They're doing the 
new, improved Boogie with fancier footwork and different moves.  
</P>
<P>
 But redemption is only a song away. Ah, the Electric Slide, a dance so easy 
even my mother could do it. This time, I turn on time, grapevine with aplomb 
and even add a fancy spin and some good ol' country "attitude" when I stomp my 
boots. 
</P>
<P>
 When the music stops, I'm breathless and sweaty and ready to dance again.

A 1908 WONDER IN WOOD; THE THREE-STORY GAMBLE HOUSE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS 
VISITORS, INCLUDING STUDENTS OF ARCHITECTURE AND HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its dark Burma teak paneled walls, Douglas fir beams, white oak floors 
and Port Orford cedar porches, the 86-year-old Gamble House carries out what 
its admirers call "a symphony in wood." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a five-bedroom, three-story mansion that elicits "bravos" from assorted 
students of architecture and history, among countless other visitors, who are 
asked by volunteer docents to "look at, but not touch" the painstakingly 
handcrafted woodwork and built-in furniture and cabinetry that dominate its 
6,100 square feet of living space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gamble House -- built in 1908 for David and Mary Gamble of the Procter & 
Gamble Co. and custom-designed by renowned architects Charles and Henry Greene 
-- stands as both a National Historic Landmark and an internationally 
recognized showplace of America's version of the turn-of-the-century Arts and 
Crafts movement, which stressed that function and form go hand in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, it represents a breakthrough in design -- the architects allowing 
not only Swiss and Japanese wood-crafting but also nature to inspire many of 
the Gamble House's appointments: dark-shingled siding, lush landscaping, wide 
terraces, open sleeping porches, cross-ventilation and thick, overhanging eaves 
that offer shelter from the swelter of Southern California's summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Its original price -- cheaper than some of today's luxury cars -- was $50,400, 
at a time when three-bedroom houses sold for an average of $1,200, docent Nancy 
Marino tells visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no budget for this house," she adds. "Just do it!" 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Gamble family heirs turned over the house and furnishings to the city 
of Pasadena in a joint arrangement with USC's School of Architecture. Together, 
they operate and maintain the Gamble House as both a tourist attraction (guided 
tours begin from noon to 3 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays) and a proud example 
of cultural and historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, however, the tours and worldwide recognition almost didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino tells a story of David and Mary Gamble putting the house up for sale 
during the 1940s and of a prospective buyer complaining about the all-wood 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so dark in here!" he told his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, don't worry -- we'll paint everything white ," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Horrified, the Gambles spared their beloved house such a fate, abruptly 
pulling it off the market. The rest, as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
 3 p.m.: The tour begins in the spacious entry hall, its main doors in three 
panels (inspired by the Japanese) and crafted with Tiffany art glass inlaid 
with renditions of California oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworking here, as throughout the house, is hand-polished -- distinguished 
by rounded edges and corners and by pegs that cover all nails and screws. 
</P>
<P>
 Some walls, however, contain no nails or screws. Their panels are wedged 
tightly together by scarf joints, which resemble a long, flat "Z." They are 
said to be used in shipbuilding and stabilize the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had almost zero damage here," Marino says, "and this house has been 
through a lot of earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 3:10 p.m.: In the living room, afternoon sunlight streams through an expanse 
of windows on the northwest corner, illuminating space otherwise darkened by 
paneled walls, posts and beams of Burma teak. Built-in benches and cabinets 
with opaque-glass doors flank the tile fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 When electricity arrived in the early 1900s, many homeowners, including the 
Gambles, complained that lighting was too harsh. Mary Gamble softened the glare 
by setting a Tiffany lamp (one of many throughout the house) atop a Honduras 
mahogany table, which, like all furniture inside the Gamble House, was designed 
by Greene and Greene. A hanging light fixture, also designed by the Greenes, is 
turned upward -- to bounce light off the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 3:15 p.m.: The dining room table, fashioned of Santo Domingo mahogany, seats 
as many as 14. 
</P>
<P>
 A glass doorway (again, in three panels) opens to the large brick terrace. At 
the southwest corner, a window of Tiffany glass picks up the Greenes' recurring 
theme of nature, changing colors -- from bright amber to pinks, greens, blues 
and purples -- as daylight brightens, then fades. 
</P>
<P>
 3:25 p.m.: The bright, airy kitchen contains a 1938 Magic Chef stove (the 
original stove was wood-burning) and opens to a porch where servants had their 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the Gamble House ever more functional, Greene and Greene designed the 
countertops to be built of sugar pine, a soft wood that can avert breakage if a 
glass object is dropped onto it. In the pantry, they angled the cabinet and 
counter -- again rounding off the edges and corners -- to reduce the chance of 
someone accidentally getting hurt by bumping a head or hip. 
</P>
<P>
 3:35 p.m.: A rich, shiny teak banister -- the only object visitors may touch 
-- is splined and pegged with mahogany, flowing with the gentle incline of the 
stairwell to the second floor. A 12-foot-long window seat runs the length of 
the window in the landing; it also lifts on hinges to reveal a storage 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the landing, too, is a doorway to servants' quarters (now two bedrooms 
occupied by architecture students who help provide security during hours when 
the facility is closed). 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby bedroom shared by two of the Gambles' three sons during their teens 
contains a fireplace and opens to a screened porch. Mounted on the walls are 
replicas of fixtures with carbon-filament bulbs -- again, to soften lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the hallway is a guest bedroom with a built-in sink and mirror, the 
only bedroom in the Gamble House without its own bath. 
</P>
<P>
 3:40 p.m.: The master bedroom occupies the northwest corner, contains a bath, 
sleeping porch, fireplace, built-in daybed, a writing desk and dressers built 
of black walnut (with pegs of ebony and inlays of fruitwood and semiprecious 
stones), the drawers arranged asymmetrically but in a way that exudes balance 
just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Other features: indirect-lighting fixtures made of cedar and a wall panel that 
hides a compartment that once stored jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 3:50 p.m.: On the southwest corner sits the bedroom of Julia Huggins, Mary 
Gamble's youngest sister. "Aunt Julia" didn't want a fireplace, so the Gambles 
replaced it with a tile fire wall for her Franklin stove. As it turned out, 
Pasadena's winters weren't as scathing as those Aunt Julia had experienced back 
home in Cincinnati, so she never bothered to send for the stove. 
</P>
<P>
 4 p.m.: On the top (third) floor is a single room, with daylight and views on 
all four sides, as well as beams and ceiling panels made of Douglas fir, 
encased in Port Orford cedar. The room today provides space for lectures and 
seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenes designed it as a "billiards room," but the teetotaling Gambles 
would have nothing of the sort. They used it simply as an attic to store junk. 
</P>
<P>
 4:05 p.m.: Downstairs again, our tour takes us to the smallest room in the 
house: David Gamble's study, comfortably equipped with brick fireplace and 
recliner called a Morris chair. Here, too, are 1906-vintage photos of Charles 
and Henry Greene, then architects in their 30s, whose vision lives on at the 
Gamble House. 
</P>
<P>
 4:10 p.m.: About 100 feet north of the Gamble House sits the bungalow-like 
garage, which today serves as a bookstore (with a focus on architecture), where 
tour tickets may be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 The garage's massive oak doors, with Gothic hinges, remain. So do adjoining 
day rooms once used by the Gambles' chauffeur and gardener. Fastened into the 
ceiling are two large hooks shaped like question marks -- perfect for hoisting 
engines while making car repairs back in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 4:45 p.m.: It makes no sense reflecting on the Gamble House and its grandeur 
on an empty stomach. So catch an early dinner at Chopstix (46 W. Colorado 
Blvd.)., which serves up moderately priced Chinese cuisine. It's among the 
numerous eateries and shops of Pasadena's famed Old Town, just a few minutes' 
drive from the Gamble House and reputedly one of Greater Los Angeles' best 
areas for walking. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: Public tours of the Gamble House. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: 4 Westmoreland Place (parallels the west side of the 300 block of 
North Orange Grove Boulevard), Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Noon to 3 p.m., Thursdays through Sundays. (Groups of 10 or more 
require reservations arranged at least one month in advance.) 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $4 adults, $3 people 65 or older, $2 full-time students with ID, free 
admission to children 12 and younger.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; BACK IN THE U.S.A.; MONTANAS BAR AND GRILL REPLACES FRENCH 
BISTRO L'EXPRESS WITH A REFRESHINGLY AMERICAN MENU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 French is out and American is in. So say the culinary seers of upper Cahuenga 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroll into the building that once housed the French bistro L'Express and 
you'll observe the trend. The site now houses a refreshingly American bistro 
called Montanas Bar and Grill. Amazingly, not a bit of chic has been lost in 
the transition, though you'll have to order that espresso sans croissant. 
</P>
<P>
 Montanas Bar and Grill (not affiliated with Cafe Montana in Santa Monica) 
isn't what you'd term a daring restaurant, but a solidly competent one. 
Everything coming out of this kitchen is at least modestly successful; some 
items border on terrific. The menu is composed mainly of comfort foods such as 
potpie, meatloaf and California-style grilled dishes, plus several good pizzas 
and pastas. (Pastas and entrees are available in half portions, by the way -- a 
good idea.) 
</P>
<P>
 The room has been thoroughly renovated in what you might call Late Grunge 
style, punctuated by hints of both the Pacific Rim and your local swap meet. 
Enormous pillars dominate the room, offsetting a black, T-bar ceiling that 
suggests an unfinished disco. You'll sit on straight-backed wooden chairs and 
dine at wooden tables. Throw in a bare cement floor, lots of red brick plus two 
floor-to-ceiling ficus that give off an ersatz tropical flair, and you get pure 
casual chic, circa 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The new restaurant retains the all-glass front that was a trademark of the old 
L'Express, and it adds to the illusion of spaciousness. Incidentally, it seems 
that everyone wants to sit near these windows. I can't fathom why. The view is 
hardly a doozer, just a panorama of the auto dealership across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetizers are hearty and good. I didn't try the nachos du chef, but I do 
acknowledge that the dish has one of the great names of our time. For the 
record, the nachos are topped with guacamole, salsa, melted Cheddar and sour 
cream. I did have the mini-rack of baby backs, glazed with an oddball 
fruit-flavored barbecue sauce. The meat is so tender you can't help but like 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Montanas makes some of the best Buffalo wings I've had in Los Angeles. The 
chicken is tender, the sauce complex and hot, the Ranch / blue cheese dressing 
creamy and cooling. The restaurant's crab cakes have a finely minced texture 
that a purist would object to, but these crusty cakes are undeniably tasty and 
the accompanying lemon butter sauce would please the most demanding chef 
saucier.  
</P>
<P>
 The shrimp and chicken spring rolls have flavorful fillings and a spicy 
Thai-style dipping sauce, but they'd be better if they were less doughy. 
There's a workmanlike Chinese chicken salad that could use more sesame oil in 
the dressing, and a chopped salad that's fresh and clean-tasting, though 
perhaps with too much cheese and not enough turkey and ham. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-working waitresses are not afraid to make recommendations. One 
insisted that we try a goat cheese pizza, and earned her stripes in one shot. 
It's terrific: the crust perfectly crisp, the topping designed with a good 
balance of spinach, goat cheese and fresh tomato, and everything sprinkled with 
lightly browned pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastas are chewy and interesting. Smoked chicken spaghetti is rich with 
fresh peas, smoky chicken breast, cut-up mushrooms and garlic, in an intense 
broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Most entrees come in half portions, and they're probably sufficient unless you 
come really hungry. One that understandably is not sold by halves is turkey 
potpie, a stupendous version with a crusty pastry hat. The filling is like a 
rich mushroom veloute loaded with chunks of soft turkey meat.  
</P>
<P>
 The meatloaf, smothered in a rich brown gravy alongside a hill of creamy 
whipped potatoes, is of the grainy country-style type. Pork chops come with the 
same thick gravy and a choice of potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, Montanas desserts are both less simple and less enthusiastic. I found a 
hazelnut torte to have a stale flavor, and the chocolate mousse cake was mushy 
and insipid.  
</P>
<P>
 The best dessert bet is actually a throwback to L'Express: a flat, crusty 
apple tart served with a scoop of Haagen-Dazs ice cream. It's nearly perfect, 
and an ideal companion for the restaurant's good espresso. French may be down 
on this stretch of Cahuenga, but it is not, dare we say, completely out. WHERE 
AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Montanas Bar and Grill, 3575 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Universal City.

EXPULSIONS FOR WEAPONS IN L.A. SCHOOLS DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of Los Angeles students recommended for expulsion for bringing guns 
and knives to school dropped last year, returning to the level reported before 
a dramatic jump in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the number of high school and middle-school expulsion 
recommendations fell from the previous school year, the number for all offenses 
among elementary school students stayed the same in 1993-94, according to a 
review of expulsions in the Los Angeles Unified School District obtained 
Thursday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The review shows that the number of students recommended for expulsion for all 
offenses, including weapons, drugs, vandalism, assault and other reasons, 
dropped to 800 from 936 the year before -- a 15% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers had climbed by one-third in the previous half-dozen years, from 
697 in 1986-87 to 936 in 1992-93. Weapon possessions continue to be the single 
most common reason for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall in the number of weapons-related expulsions has raised hopes that 
campus violence -- and students' fear of it -- may be declining, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley over the last two years, the number of students 
recommended for expulsion has remained about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In Julie Korenstein's school board district, which includes most of the 
Valley, 109 students were recommended for expulsion in the in 1993-94 school 
year compared to 107 in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 In board President Mark Slavkin's district, which includes parts of the 
northwest Valley, the number of students recommended for expulsion fell from 
181 in 1992-93 to 137 in the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the report's main findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of students recommended by school principals for expulsion 
increased 34% from 697 in 1986-87 to 936 in 1992-93.  
</P>
<P>
 * More middle school students -- 94 -- were expelled last year for bringing 
guns to school than were high school students, who accounted for 75 expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expulsion referrals for elementary school students jumped from eight in 
1986-87 to 54 in 1993-94. Most of those were students who carried knives or 
guns to school. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of students who were kicked out of the school district -- known 
as straight expulsions -- increased significantly during the eight-year period, 
from 17 in 1986-87 to 166 in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most students whose principals recommended them for expulsion were 
transferred to alternative campuses within the district -- a trend that has 
remained fairly constant during the eight years, from 494 in 1986-87 to 404 in 
1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the escalating numbers of children who bring weapons 
and violence to school mirrors the troubles in their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reflection of what's going on in society," said Hector Madrigal, the 
district's director of student discipline proceedings, who wrote the report. 
"Kids are acting up more seriously and administrators in turn are feeling the 
need to take stronger action." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Board of Education strengthened its expulsion policy three times in 
as many years, the report shows that the majority of students whose principals 
recommend them for expulsion are transferred to a different campus rather than 
being expelled outright from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's expulsion policy requires students -- regardless of their age 
-- to be expelled for bringing firearms -- even replica or toy guns -- to 
school. Students who are caught with knives or drugs typically are assigned to 
alternative campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows that 53 students were actually expelled from the district in 
1986-87, a period when 92 students were caught with guns. But 166 students were 
expelled outright in 1993-94 when 191 students had guns on campus. Not all 
students are expelled because their cases were dropped for a variety of 
reasons, including in some cases expiration of the time limit for making a 
decision. Others became involved in criminal activity and were no longer in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students caught with knives are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The report 
shows that 139 students were caught with knives in 1986-87 compared to 229 in 
1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals initially make the expulsion recommendations and a hearing is held 
with a district panel. Ultimately, the school board reviews each expulsion 
referral and makes the final decision on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are recommended for expulsion for bringing weapons or drugs to 
campus, for vandalism or for assaulting or threatening to assault either 
students or school staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Jeff Horton, who requested the expulsion data and who opposes 
expelling students under 16, said he believes the alternative programs often 
are the best places for these students, many of whom do not have prior 
discipline problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just put a kid out on the street with nothing to do . . . it's just asking 
them to hang out with gang members or with kids who have dropped out," Horton 
said. "It's bad for the neighborhoods and it's bad for the kids. I think we 
need to take more steps to reduce the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the board recently stipulated in Supt. Sid Thompson's new 
contract that crimes on school campuses that lead to expulsions should be 
reduced by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying this is important and that there should be specific help for 
specific kids who are getting into trouble," said board President Slavkin. "To 
me, the missing piece has been prevention." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Barbara Boudreaux said she believes the policy needs to be even 
tougher so that students caught with knives are expelled outright rather than 
being transferred within the system. "Knives, guns, firecrackers, any kind of 
weapons . . . should have expulsion attached to it," Boudreaux said. "Guns are 
not the only weapons that can kill." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the alternative campuses -- such as continuation 
schools -- provide smaller classes and more individualized attention. "We're 
not always talking about kids with hard-core criminal records -- many of them 
are decent kids who are making errors in judgment," Madrigal said. "Basically, 
we're giving them another chance to demonstrate they can be rehabilitated." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, the district has instituted a variety of measures to 
curb guns and weapons on campus. Following two fatal shootings last year, the 
district began requiring administrators to conduct daily, random searches for 
guns and weapons using metal detectors. A confidential telephone tip line was 
created and posters advertising the board policy on expulsions were prominently 
displayed on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in expulsion referrals last year has provided some officials with 
hope that the trend could be reversing. "It's too early to reach conclusions," 
Madrigal said. "But hopefully these messages and signals are curbing some of 
these incidents. The awareness of the penalties has gone up." Students Expelled

WEAPONS-RELATED EXPULSION CASES DROP FROM 1992-93 PEAK; SCHOOLS: DECLINE IN 
L.A. DISTRICT RAISES HOPE THAT CAMPUS VIOLENCE MAY BE FALLING.

<P>
 The number of Los Angeles students recommended for expulsion for bringing guns 
and knives to school dropped last year, returning to the level reported before 
a dramatic jump in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the number of high-school and middle-school expulsion 
recommendations fell from the previous school year, the number for all offenses 
among elementary school students stayed the same in 1993-94, according to a 
review of expulsions in the Los Angeles Unified School District obtained 
Thursday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall in the number of weapons-related expulsions has raised hopes that 
campus violence -- and students' fear of it -- may be declining, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The review shows that the number of students recommended for expulsion for all 
offenses, including weapons, drugs, vandalism, assault and other reasons, 
dropped to 800 from 936 the year before -- a 15% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers had climbed by a third in the previous half-dozen years, from 697 
in 1986-87 to 936 in 1992-93. Weapon possessions continue to be the single most 
common reason for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the report's main findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 800 expulsion referrals by school principals throughout the system 
last year, 466 students were expelled or sent to alternative campuses for 
bringing guns, knives or other weapons to school, compared to 600 out of 936 in 
1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expulsion referrals for elementary school students jumped from eight in 
1986-87 to 54 in 1993-94. Most of those were students who carried knives or 
guns to school. 
</P>
<P>
 * More middle-school students -- 94 -- were expelled last year for bringing 
guns to school than were high school students, who accounted for 75 expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of students who were kicked completely out of the school district 
-- the so-called straight expulsions -- increased significantly over the 
eight-year period, from 17 in 1986-87 to 243 in 1992-93, in large part because 
of stricter policy. That number fell to 166 in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 * But most students whose principals recommended expulsion were transferred to 
alternative campuses within the district -- a trend that has remained fairly 
constant during the eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the numbers of younger students carrying weapons to school, 
board President Mark Slavkin said, "I think this is part of a larger trend in 
society where you see younger and younger kids being arrested for brutal and 
heinous acts. It seems anecdotal that kids are being caught committing more 
serious offenses." 
</P>
<P>
 And the escalating numbers of children who bring weapons and violence to 
school mirrors the troubles in their own communities, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reflection of what's going on in society," said Hector Madrigal, the 
district's director of student discipline proceedings, who wrote the report. 
"Kids are acting up more seriously and administrators in turn are feeling the 
need to take stronger action."

when 92 students were caught with guns. But 166 students were expelled outright 
in 1993-94 when 191 students had guns on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all students are expelled because some cases were dropped for a variety of 
reasons, including an expired time limit for expulsion. Other students either 
dropped out or went into custody for committing crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to knives, student violations are reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis. The report shows that 229 students were caught with knives in 1993-94, 
compared to 139 students in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>

Discipline 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Los Angeles Unified School District students recommended for 
expulsion decreased this past school year, although the total remains 
significantly higher than seven years ago. Although many of the students were 
expelled because of weapons, other factors--such as drug use and 
vandalism--also contributed. And not all of the students expelled from their 
campuses are kicked out of school. Some are sent to continuation schools or 
they leave the campus before the matter is concluded.

GETTING BURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1973, the rate of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, has 
increased by 4% each year, according to the American Cancer Society. The most 
recent state figures available show that 802 Californians -- including 185 
people in Los Angeles County -- died of melanoma in 1991. Aside from melanoma, 
people can also contract basal cell or squamous cell cancers, which are highly 
curable, but usually with surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the depleted ozone layer is placing everyone at greater risk for skin 
cancer, there are some precautions that can be taken. Tips on Sun Exposure 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when the rays are the 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or stronger; and one 
that protects against both UV-A and UV-B rays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a waterproof sunscreen if you plan to be in the water or expect to 
perspire heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunburns received from infancy to teen years can increase the risk of 
contracting melanoma as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear a wide-brimmed hat and clothes with a tight weave. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you've been using a self-tanning product, you still need to use sunscreen 
when you're in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 * Temperature has little to do with sun exposure. Ultraviolet radiation is 
strong on relatively cool days and can penetrate clouds. Warning Signs 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in moles can be an early warning sign of skin cancer, so the American 
Cancer Society recommends that adults examine their skin once a month. People 
who have atypical moles are considered to be at a higher risk of getting 
melanoma. Check the "A,B,C and D" of moles: 
</P>
<P>
 * A is for asymmetry, when both halves of the mole don't match each other. 
</P>
<P>
 * B is for border, when the border is ragged, blurred or irregular. 
</P>
<P>
 * C is for color, when the color of the mole is not the same throughout or has 
shades of tan, brown, black, red, white or blue. 
</P>
<P>
 * D is for diameter, if the diameter of the mole is larger than a pencil 
eraser. Changes in moles should be reported to a dermatologist. Skin Cancer

</P>
<P>
 *Other, less common cancer types are included in the total, but not listed 
specifically. Treating Sunburns 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment of sunburns is the same for all first-degree burns: 
</P>
<P>
 Soak the affected area for 15 minutes in cold water (not ice water) or apply a 
cold compress. Applying aloe vera will cool the burn. Anti-inflammatory pain 
medicine, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, may also help, as well as 
hydro-cortisone creams. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other topical creams available, but some people can develop 
sensitivities to them. If you are sunburned all over, consider taking a bath 
with a cup of dry instant oatmeal scattered in the water. Other physicians have 
recommended adding vinegar or milk to the water. Second-degree sunburns result 
in blisters, which might mean a trip to the dermatologist's office if pain 
persists for more than a day. How the Skin Tans 
</P>
<P>
 1. The epidermis is penetrated by rays, reaching the underlying dermis. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Blood vessels dilate and more blood flows to near the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Rays stimulate certain cells to produce more melanin, the skin pigment that 
darkens the skin.

FAIR REPRESENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Sen. Frank Hill, after delays of several years, was convicted on corruption 
charges. He "resigned" his state Senate seat but stonewalled his departure so 
as to gain the interim income from a position he cannot serve and prevent 
replacement by an honest representative. 
</P>
<P>
 His actions demonstrate the arrogance and ethical violations of some of our 
public officials that unfortunately escalates public scorn of our government 
and weakens democracy. Even worse is the attitude of GOP leader Sen. Ken Maddy, 
who said of Hill: " . . . He was more of a victim of circumstances and the 
venue than he is of committing a crime." That rationale would excuse almost all 
law violators. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the 29th District residents went without representation during the crucial 
period of state budget development and adoption? So, we ordinary voters are 
supposed to accept a different criminal code for legislators? Or, does this 
case just fit the pattern of more lenient treatment for white-collar crimes? 
</P>
<P>
 Now I understand the point of the cry "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to 
take it anymore." Hill should go!

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A WARNING FLAG ON MARINA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly three years ago, we concluded that there was every good reason for the 
county to go out to bid on the leasing of Sunset Marina Park, one of several 
lucrative county marina operations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, there was enormous pressure within county government to grant the 
private operator, Goldrich & Kest Inc., a new 30-year deal. But there were good 
reasons not to rubber-stamp an extension: County inspectors had repeatedly 
cited maintenance deficiencies in the operation, and The Times reported that 
the firm had employed Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's son to work with county 
staff during lease negotiations from 1989 through mid-1990. And there was the 
possibility that the county might get a better deal from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed since that time?  
</P>
<P>
 The county Harbors, Beaches and Parks Commission this week granted a new 
contract to G & K for a 35-year lease extension with the explanation that the 
company had cleaned up its act, that Wieder's son no longer was involved and 
that the county could get a better low-interest state loan now to pay for 
improvements. But there is no escaping the conclusion that this deal doesn't 
seem quite right even now. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should the county violate its own stated policy of allowing such contracts 
to expire and then putting them out for bid? With such a long lease extension, 
what guarantee is there for the county that the maintenance problems will not 
return after a couple of years good behavior? With five years to go on the 
current contract, why didn't the county continue holding the operator's feet to 
the fire? 
</P>
<P>
 And still the question: Despite some assertions to the contrary, what harm in 
looking to see if there was a better deal out there to be had from someone 
else? 
</P>
<P>
 The county doesn't have many more chances to do the right thing; the Board of 
Supervisors can and should turn this deal down. If not, it's time for an 
independent inquiry. The Orange County Grand Jury may need to look at this 
situation to find out exactly how and why the deal was put together the way it 
was.

MIKE PENNER: THRILL IS GONE FOR SOCCER FANS 
</P>

 "Catch Pro Soccer After The World Cup" -- that's how the ad copy reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Except there's a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 No Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 No Bebeto. 
</P>
<P>
 (Though there is a Paulinho, a midfielder from Criciuma, Brazil, who once 
played in the same league with Romario and Bebeto). 
</P>
<P>
 No Alexi Lalas. 
</P>
<P>
 No Tony Meola. 
</P>
<P>
 (Though there is Jeff Agoos, a defender from the University of Virginia who 
used to play with Lalas and Meola before he was cut from the 1994 U.S. World 
Cup team.) 
</P>
<P>
 No Brazilian samba drums beating in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 No blue-and-yellow painted Swedish faces beaming in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much of anything, or anyone, in the stands. Just an announced gathering of 
2,564 die-hards and/or motorists who happened to be driving by Cal State 
Fullerton Thursday night and wondered why the lights were on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Legacy Continues," the ad copy teases, "With The . . . L.A. Salsa." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 The action at Titan Stadium this evening was lively enough; the Salsa erased a 
2-0 deficit with goals in the 87th and 89th minutes to force overtime and a 
shootout, a running-start version of the World Cup's penalty-kicks decider. And 
on this, the American Professional Soccer League has the World Cup beaten 
no-hands down. By forcing the kickers to start dribbling from 35 yards out, the 
goalkeepers actually have a fighting chance in this mano a mano . 
</P>
<P>
 Ten shots were taken, nine failed and Ft. Lauderdale won the shootout, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither goalkeeper had to be outfitted with a cigarette and a blindfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, from an atmosphere aspect -- and this leads directly to the survival 
aspect -- the post-World Cup APSL looks no different from the pre-World Cup 
APSL. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Soccer Nation -- the swelling World Cup fever that was 
supposed to leave the newly addicted panting for a corner-kicks fix once Brazil 
and Italy split Pasadena? 
</P>
<P>
 Where did the house of Hagi go? The cult of Baggio? The Valderrama wanna-bes? 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't the most popular, most wildly successful World Cup in history supposed 
to lend a healthy bounce to those lagging APSL attendance totals -- at least 
until Alan Rothenberg's MLS steps in to fill the gap, if and when? 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup didn't help us," said Dr. William De Le Pena, owner of the 
Salsa. "We never expected it to. I think that was a misconception about the 
World Cup. There was not going to be any big bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the World Cup was going to help us, it was going to do it in two ways -- 
stimulate sponsors to come in and help us get us a TV contract. If not, it was 
going to be the same as it always was -- with us working from the ground level 
up and building patiently for the five or six years." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bolton, the Salsa's director of communication, thinks the World Cup 
actually worked against his team in the ticket-count department. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the World Cup, people are soccered out," Bolton said. "It's tough. 
We've got the (indoor soccer) Splash playing right down the street. We just had 
52 World Cup soccer games. Right now, it's a saturated market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup was great for exposure, but again, you had 52 games in a month. 
Suppose you went to the beach every day for a month. After a while you say, 
'Give me a break.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One other point, as Salsa ticket manager Al Mistri made outside the gates 30 
minutes before Thursday's game: 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, that's not gonna be Argentina-Romania out there." 
</P>
<P>
 That's Problem 1 with post-World Cup Syndrome: Our newly awakened taste buds 
have been spoiled rotten. For five weeks, the best soccer players on the planet 
invaded our shores and we surrendered, gladly, blissfully seduced by 
gravity-bending bicycle kicks and kamikaze headers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Stoichkov and Klinsmann are gone and what are we left with? The Salsa and 
the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 How good is the caliber of play in the APSL? A sampling of expert opinion: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played maybe 10 games against Mexican first-division teams," De La Pena 
said, "and we won half and lost half. So I'd put us somewhere in the middle of 
the Mexican first division." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton pegged the level of play closer to a "competitive second-division 
squad" in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mistri, who also is the head soccer coach at Cal State Fullerton, places 
the APSL "somewhere between the second and third divisions in Europe. My dad 
saw a game last year and said it reminded him of a good third-division game in 
Italy. I think that's a good opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 But is that good enough to drag more than a couple thousand through the 
turnstiles on a mid-summer weeknight? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the issue," Mistri said. "We know what the level of play is. The 
issue is: What else is going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best this country has in outdoor soccer," De La Pena said. 
"Paulinho was one of the leading scorers in Brazil three years ago. He led 
Botafogo to the Brazil championship. We beat the Cameroon national team in a 
friendly before the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of play is quite good. And we're doing something for soccer here. 
We're keeping it going in this country. And we're going to keep on playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, somebody just needs to notice.

ROGERS IS PERFECT -- WITH A CATCH; BASEBALL: TEXAS LEFT-HANDER WHO ASKED OUT OF 
THE ROTATION LAST SEASON MOWS DOWN ANGELS, 4-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers' Kenny Rogers stood dazed on the mound Thursday night, 
completely confused, trying to remember how former teammate Nolan Ryan reacted 
during his no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, was of no use. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Ryan ever pitched a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers could only turn around, watch center fielder Rusty Greer jump up and 
down with the ball in his glove, and by the time he looked up, he was mobbed by 
his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, with help from Greer's diving catch two batters earlier, had just 
become the first left-handed pitcher in American League history to throw a 
perfect game -- and only the 12th in the major leagues since 1900 -- defeating 
the Angels, 4-0, and sending the crowd of 46,581 at the Ballpark in Arlington 
into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the perfect game by the imperfect pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers is a son of a strawberry farmer in Plant City, Fla., who never even 
played organized baseball until he was a senior in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 He was drafted merely because Ranger scout Joe Marches liked the way he took 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't become a full-time starter in the Ranger rotation until last season, 
and was going so poorly at one point that he asked out of the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even tell you what no-hit stuff is," said Rogers, who had been 
bothered by a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is part of baseball folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe it," Rogers said an hour after the game ended, hugging 
his 8-month-old daughter. "It probably won't hit me until I go outside tonight 
and wake up my neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I won't go to sleep. I'm going to get that tape and watch it over and 
over all night. I'm going to watch every single pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm late to the game tomorrow, it probably means I'm sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only left-handers to throw perfect games were Cincinnati's Tom Browning on 
Sept. 16, 1988 against the Dodgers and the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax on Sept. 9, 
1965 against the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows, maybe now he can believe he can get people out when he wants to," 
said Ranger pitching coach Claude Osteen, a teammate of Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, if Rogers faces the Angels more often, he might start thinking he's the 
second coming of Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (40-59), who have scored in only two of their last 30 innings, hit 
only seven balls out of the infield through the first eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the ninth. The fans, who had wildly cheered every strike beginning 
in the seventh inning, now were standing, giving him a rousing ovation when he 
took the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who for a few innings actually had forgotten that he had a perfect 
game, looked up in acknowledgment. It was a feeling that he might never attain 
again, so he decided to soak in the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to stay composed the whole time," said Rogers, who threw 98 pitches, 
striking out eight. "I figured if I got nervous, I had no chance. I didn't 
really get into what I was doing until I got the last out, because I didn't 
want to be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Hudler, who was no-hit by Fernando Valenzuela in 1990 when he was with the 
St. Louis Cardinals, was the first batter.  
</P>
<P>
 On an 0-and-2 fastball, Hudler hit a dunker into the gap in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler and Rogers kept watching, and there was Greer, running as hard as he 
could, diving, and with his outstretched glove, caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd screamed in disbelief. Hudler muttered obscenities. And Rogers 
merely closed his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that happened," Rogers said, "I thought, 'I guess somebody wants me to 
have it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Next up, Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers fell behind 2 and 0, and then came right back and struck him out on 
three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina, who never had a hit off Rogers in 16 career at-bats, was the 
last one to stand in the way of Rogers' perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
 He swung and missed the first pitch. DiSarcina then swung, and hit the second 
pitch to center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just waiting for it to come down," Greer said. "It seemed like it took 
forever. And I gave it a little extra squeeze." 
</P>
<P>
 It was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just saw the greatest sports feat in history," Angel starter Andrew 
Lorraine said. "I would never say I wanted him to do it, but you know, this is 
something we'll all remember as long as we live." A Perfect Dozen 
</P>

CLIPPERS SCRATCH THE ITCH OF FITCH; PRO BASKETBALL: IT'S A PERFECT FIT -- HE 
WANTED TO COACH AGAIN AND THE TEAM DIDN'T HAVE ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Fitch thought he would never coach again after being fired by the New 
Jersey Nets in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said to guys who told me they want to coach to lay down until the 
urge passed," Fitch joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, 60, retired to his home in Montgomery, Tex., and his biggest choice 
each morning was whether to play golf or fish at a nearby lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think that I'd even want to coach again," Fitch said Thursday after 
being named coach of the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun. Every morning, you get up and there's 14 yellow cabs waiting to 
take you to the golf course and some guy waiting to take your money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fitch, who has coached more games than any NBA coach -- 1,722 -- in his 
21-year career, led a team of college players in an NBA pre-draft tournament at 
Phoenix in April and realized he missed being courtside. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when the Clippers offered him the chance to return to coaching, he jumped 
at the opportunity, signing what is believed to be a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be here," Fitch said at a news 
conference at a downtown hotel. "Nobody forced me into doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's the Clippers' ninth coach since they moved here in 1984, Fitch 
said he wasn't scared away by the club's troubled past. He said he has been in 
tougher situations during a career that has included stops in Cleveland, 
Boston, Houston and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what's scary?" Fitch asked. "I was the first outsider in Boston (to 
coach the Celtics). That's scary. . . . It really doesn't bother me. I think I 
have just as good a chance of winning here as anyplace I've been." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch was the NBA's youngest head coach when he was hired by the Cleveland 
Cavaliers in 1970, but he's now the league's second-oldest coach behind Dick 
Motta, 62, who was recently rehired by the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fitch is the fifth-winningest coach in NBA history, some have 
criticized the Clippers for hiring a retread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, number one, a retread -- I don't know what that means," Fitch said. "I 
don't understand what a retread is, but I guess, obviously, it's negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're either not good enough, you don't know enough about the game or you're 
too old. When I came in, I was the youngest coach in the league. The only thing 
you're really gauged on is the number of games you win and lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch doesn't think he'll have difficulty bridging the generation gap with his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had more young players than I've had old players," Fitch said. "The 
biggest change has not been young players or old players, it's been the amount 
of greed that's come into the game because of the amount of money that's paid. 
. . . I've had words with every player I've ever coached, including (former 
Boston Celtic star Larry) Bird." 
</P>
<P>
 Bird, who played for Fitch during his first three seasons in the NBA, thinks 
Fitch will do a good job for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Fitch always gave his best and gave every player the benefit of his 
experience and knowledge of the game," Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resurrecting the Clippers will not be easy, but Fitch thinks it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in situations where we started at the bottom and were very 
fortunate to get all the way to the top," Fitch said. "I've been in tougher 
situations."

MIKE DOWNEY: HE'S THE NEW MAN OF THIS OLD HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Harris, 56, is no longer the oldest NBA coach in Los Angeles. Bill Fitch, 
60, is. Our two new sunshine boys coached against one another in the NBA finals 
of 1981, although regrettably we must presume that neither will be involved in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch has been around so long, he once drew X's and O's on a chalkboard to 
instruct his Cleveland Cavalier players on how to keep Elgin Baylor from 
scoring. Baylor, who is four months younger than Fitch, introduced him Thursday 
as the new coach of the Clippers, who along with the Lakers must have been 
crushed to discover that neither Red Auerbach nor Red Holzman was available. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Fitch is a fine fit for the Clippers, who could have done worse (and 
have in the past). Bill has done more rebuilding than Tim Allen. Granted, he 
was fortunate enough to have Austin Carr as a rookie in Cleveland, and to have 
Larry Bird as a rookie in Boston, and to have both Ralph Sampson and Hakeem 
Olajuwon as rookies in Houston, and to have Mookie Blaylock and Kenny Anderson 
as rookies in New Jersey, so in fairness it should be observed at this point 
that it is considerably easier to remodel when somebody gives you tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch stated his intentions to beautify the Clip joint, given time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to promise to do it tomorrow ," he added, wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow. It is eternally only a day away with the Clippers, who are once 
again back at the old drawing board. I do not know how much truth there was to 
the gossip that Pat Riley demanded 20% of the team (I doubt it) or that John 
Thompson wanted $3 million (I believe it) or that the Clippers wanted Randy 
Pfund more than he wanted them (I am so mixed up) or that Larry Brown is still 
interested (I love trouble). What I do know is that Bill Fitch's teams have 
historically done quite well in the NBA drafts, so it's a shame he didn't have 
a say in this last one. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch is known around basketball as a take-no-guff coach and occasional 
martinet. He stood his ground in the Meadowlands with mister me-me-me himself, 
Derrick Coleman, who thinks he is bigger than the team, and probably would do 
the same with Ron Harper, who, should he choose to stay, probably will want to 
shoot the basketball every time he touches it now that Danny/Dominique is gone. 
Harper is a star player who considers himself a superstar player and can't 
understand why anyone would disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 Clippers, whoever they are, open this season with two games in 
Japan and also have six dates in Anaheim, barnstorming with an act many 
consider funnier than the Globetrotters'. Oh, and soon we should see 
advertisements promoting visits to Los Angeles by some of the NBA's top stars, 
including Dominique Wilkins and the Boston Celtics, Mark Jackson and the 
Indiana Pacers, Reggie Williams and the Denver Nuggets and Don MacLean and the 
Washington Bullets, not to forget Manning and Harper of the (fill in blanks). 
The NBA -- we love this game! 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Fitch, our fingers are crossed for you. 
</P>
<P>
 He took this job, he swore, eagerly and willingly. Fitch said: "Nobody took me 
prisoner. Nobody coerced me. I look at this as a fine opportunity. I've been in 
tougher situations than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam? Korea? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, bad joke. But I must admit Fitch is accurate, in basketball terms, that 
running the first NBA club in Cleveland or being the first "outsider" brought 
in to coach Boston, these were no picnics. Fitch coached one clumsy bunch of 
Cavaliers who won 15 games. He coached another bad bunch in Jersey that won 17 
games. The man knows how to lose. He has lost 877 NBA games in his career, plus 
51 playoff defeats. The Clippers should put him over that magic 1,000 mark in 
no time. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, though, this is a guy you call in an emergency, like Red Adair to an 
oil fire. If you give Fitch some players, he can win. He added Bird to a bad 
team in Boston and immediately went 61-21. He added Olajuwon to a 29-victory 
team in Houston and immediately won 48. He might have done similarly in New 
Jersey had his superiors drafted from need rather than pitting Anderson against 
Blaylock in camp, dueling point guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing whom to draft is the key to everything. Consider 1989, for example -- 
that infamous year when Danny Ferry was so thrilled about being drafted by the 
Clippers that he grabbed his passport and left the country. Later in that 
draft, Fitch's Nets drafted a good man, Blaylock. In so doing, however, both 
teams passed up Tim Hardaway, Shawn Kemp, B.J. Armstrong, Vlade Divac and 
Clifford Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 In referring to Baylor as "one of the most maligned" executives in the game, 
Fitch contended that far too many people overlook "how smart he really is." 
</P>
<P>
 What Fitch undoubtedly understands is that Baylor is just fine at finding the 
right players. He simply isn't very good at keeping them. For all we know, 
Lamond Murray was the steal of the 1994 college draft. The question is, for 
which team will Lamond Murray be playing come 1996? Had the Clippers kept 
everyone they ever drafted, they would be kicking the Houston Rockets' butts by 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher situations? Not many. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Bill Fitch to be a suitable choice for the Clippers, but I hardly 
envy him in the months ahead. I predict by Christmas, latest, his hair and Del 
Harris' hair will look exactly the same.

PLAYERS CALL FOR AUG. 12 WALKOUT DATE; BASEBALL: WITH SEASON IN JEOPARDY, 
PLAYERS HAVE $175-MILLION STRIKE FUND, AND OWNERS FACE LOSS OF $140 MILLION IN 
POSTSEASON REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Major League Players Assn., in a conference call among union leaders and 
the 28 player representatives Thursday, set a strike deadline of Aug. 12, 
meaning the 1994 baseball season could end in 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no agreement in the collective bargaining negotiations that have 
polarized the two sides, there will be no games played after Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-term work stoppage could also erase the postseason, during which the 
owners have $140 million in TV revenue at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the Aug. 12 date maximizes the chance of successfully 
negotiating an agreement without a work stoppage," said Don Fehr, the union's 
executive director. "The purpose of setting the strike date earlier rather than 
later (in the season) is to attempt to focus and accelerate the negotiations 
now to see if we can get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike is a last resort. No one wants to play more than the players do, but 
the owners continue to insist on a salary cap that would place artificial 
restrictions on the free market, transfer millions of dollars from players to 
owners, destroy free agency, eliminate arbitration and damage competitive 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moreover, the owners have made it clear that they are prepared to 
unilaterally implement a salary cap without the players' consent after the 
season ends, which leaves us with no choice. (Owners' negotiator) Dick Ravitch 
has said that strikes only occur when one side underestimates the leverage of 
the other. Sometimes they occur because somebody wants them to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 A strike would be baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972. It would not 
prevent the owners from declaring an impasse and unilaterally implementing 
their salary-cap system, but it would deal a blow to their wallets, threatening 
the final seven weeks of a season that finds at least half of the 28 teams 
still involved in the new division races, not to mention the revenue from the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also be costly for the players, however. They would lose three 
paychecks and a portion of a fourth if an Aug. 12 stoppage wiped out the 
season. The union, for the last four years, has been retaining a portion of 
each player's licensing check -- which averages between $70,000 and $80,000 
annually -- while accumulating a strike fund of about $175 million, or about 
$150,000 for every player with four' years experience. Union officials refused 
to reveal how that money -- there would be less, of course, for players with 
less experience -- would be disbursed in the event of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how either side could hold out more than 30 days," said an 
attorney involved in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said he wasn't sure how many days 
would have to be lost before it became impossible to play the postseason, but 
the union, in an attempt to put more pressure on the owners, has instructed 
players not to work out collectively during a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig acknowledged that the sides are far apart but that the setting of a 
strike date merely "raises the anxiety level of the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said: "I regret that the union has such disregard for the fans. As 
I've said repeatedly, the only way to resolve bargaining differences is at the 
table, and that doesn't change, strike or otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he shares Fehr's hope that the talks will now accelerate, but "we 
still await the union's response to the problems of the game. If the players 
are determined to test the will of the owners, they'll find out soon enough 
that the owners are not going to settle for anything less than a system that 
will allow them to fix costs. History would indicate (that the owners) have 
given in in the past, but in my judgment it won't happen this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but many in baseball believe Ravitch's most difficult task will be 
holding the big and small markets together. Meanwhile, in an interesting break 
from his normal posture, Ravitch suggested that a new system does not have to 
be based on a salary cap, but he refused to elaborate and said there has been 
no cooperation from the union in formulating a new approach and no indication 
that it recognizes the economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, is at the heart of the debate. The union does not accept 
Ravitch's contention that 19 teams will lose money this year. Nor does the 
union believe that an industry with revenue of $1.8 billion and projected 
attendance again of more than 70 million is having financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We accept that revenue streams change and different clubs may have different 
problems from year to year," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless, if the owners feel the need to change their revenue-sharing 
formulas, we'll be happy to work with them on that, but don't ask the players 
to pay for it with a salary cap. We'll fight that for as long as it takes."

RAIDERS' FEUD GOES DISTANCE; PRO FOOTBALL: YES, THEY GET THE BRONCOS AGAIN AND, 
NO, THEY STILL DON'T LIKE THEM, EVEN IN SPAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have traveled thousands of miles, across a continent and an ocean and 
then into Europe, moving nine hours ahead in time. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, they can't get away from the Feud. 
</P>
<P>
 It has followed the Raiders and the Denver Broncos here to the Mediterranean 
shore of Spain, where they'll open their NFL exhibition season Sunday in 
American Bowl '94. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and the Broncos don't like each other. Plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 A heated rivalry has grown hotter here in the broiling summer sun that bakes 
this city of the Catalans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and Broncos have played many tight, fierce games over the years, 
often with the AFC West title at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, they outdid themselves, playing three times. The Raiders won them 
all -- the first, 23-20, at Denver's Mile High Stadium on Jeff Jaeger's 53-yard 
goal with 16 seconds to play; the second, 33-30, on Jaeger's 47-yard field goal 
in overtime at the Coliseum on the last weekend of the regular season to send 
the Raiders into the playoffs, and finally, in postseason play back at the 
Coliseum the next week, 42-24, ending the Broncos' season. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, bitterness was mixed with the fierceness. A block by Denver guard 
Brian Habib resulted in a broken leg for Raider defensive lineman Chester 
McGlockton. Although McGlockton appears fully recovered and hasn't made any 
public threats, Habib said he has heard McGlockton is out to get him. 
</P>
<P>
 The rivalry between these teams even continued into the off-season, where the 
Raiders won a fourth victory, this one of a monetary nature. The Broncos got 
Tim Brown's name on an offer sheet last spring, only to have the Raiders match 
the 4-year, $11-million deal and keep their star receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 On a visit to Denver while still a free agent, Brown said that was where he 
wanted to play. Bronco Coach Wade Phillips said that if he was in the Raiders' 
situation, he wouldn't want a player who didn't want to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 And Raider Coach Art Shell responded angrily by saying he couldn't believe 
anybody would question the Raiders' resolve to hold onto their key players. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Raider owner Al Davis got into the act, making a rare public comment 
about an opponent. "We beat them both on the field and off," he said after 
matching the Brown offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, the NFL has sent these teams to another part of the world 
to act as ambassadors of goodwill for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are acting as if the cold war were still raging -- their own 
cold war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are those guys here?" Phillips said, referring to the Raiders, reminding 
his listeners that this was supposed to be a goodwill game. "Nobody even likes 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly added that he was kidding. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phillips also downplayed the Raiders' three victories over his team last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders made a big deal out of it," he said. "They were lucky a couple of 
games. That will change this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are not making any similar statements. But they are also not going 
out of their way to extend an olive branch, or even the use of their practice 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking with an American Bowl tradition in which rivals for these games work 
out together in the days before the game, the Raiders are practicing on a field 
adjacent to Olympic Stadium, site of Sunday's game. Denver is practicing about 
20 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we found out we were going to Barcelona," Shell said, "we were ecstatic. 
When we found out we were playing the Broncos, it was different. We are tired 
of seeing these guys. We are tired of chasing (quarterback John) Elway." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shell wasn't about to fan the flames rekindled by Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Broncos are a great football team," Shell said. "We have the utmost 
respect for them. But I asked my coaches and I asked my players if they wanted 
to practice against the Broncos. They all said, 'We are tired of working 
against them. We've seen enough of them. Let's stay away from them until we 
play them on Sunday.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One gets the feeling that considering the emotional level on both sides, 
practice sessions between these teams might get as rough as the games, with 
referees and penalty flags required. 
</P>
<P>
 All this familiarity may breed contempt for some, but it also breeds knowledge 
that can be reassuring heading into battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know them so well," Elway said, "that we don't even have to look at film 
of them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shell: "We don't have time to hold grudges. We are too busy trying to win 
football games. There is a system in place. Tim Brown worked within that 
system. So did the Broncos. There is no grudge." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also no chance these two teams are about to come together, even 
on the practice field, and tone down the ferocity of a rivalry that has 
stretched from the field to the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't happen in Denver. Or Los Angeles. Or even in Barcelona.

HE'S SET FOR ALL-PRO ONSLAUGHT; RAMS: CORNERBACK ISRAEL KNOWS HE WILL FACE THE 
LIKES OF RISON, SHARPE AND RICE, BUT SAYS HE IS READY FOR THE CHALLENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Steve Israel has studied the Rams' schedule. He knows they are out there . . . 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Rison. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 All are just waiting for their shot at Israel, the Rams' cornerback who has 
started only 13 games in his three-year pro career and has yet to intercept a 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel just shrugs and asks: "What more could a young cornerback want? 
Andre Rison, Sterling Sharpe, Jerry Rice. I love it. Each one of those guys 
will make me a better player. I'm playing at a competitive position, and you 
want to be in competitive situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel was in plenty of those situations last year as one of only a few 
healthy defensive backs in an overmatched Ram secondary plagued with injuries 
and problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israel, it was on-the-job training, an education, NFL-style. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting only two games as a rookie, he started 11 games last season, 
leading the team with 12 passes defensed. 
</P>
<P>
 His progress toward the end of last season, combined with off-season training 
to improve his already-flashy 4.3 speed, prompted Ram coaches to start him 
opposite Todd Lyght this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve had a tremendous off-season," said Joe Vitt, Rams' assistant head 
coach. "He was in there (the weight room) four or five hours a day, six or 
seven days a week. He's committed himself to greatness. And when you have a 
person who's intelligent, athletic and has great work habits, you have someone 
with star quality." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the potential the Rams saw in Israel when they selected the former 
Pittsburgh standout in the second round of the 1992 draft. It has just taken 
some time for him to realize it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Israel has been watching two-a-day workouts at UC Irvine from the 
sideline. He re-injured a quadriceps muscle in practice last Monday and hasn't 
worked out all week. But he expects to return sometime next week, and is 
counting the days until the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be a chance for redemption for a Rams' secondary that accounted for 
only seven interceptions last season, a total matched by Atlanta cornerback 
Deion Sanders. In fact, five other NFL defensive backs had seven or more 
interceptions, led by Seattle's Eugene Robinson with nine. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was no wonder that quarterbacks and receivers were chomping at the bit 
to get their shot at the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to make every season-highlight film? Just stop by Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Footage of Rice's one-handed grab over Ram cornerback Wymon Henderson gets 
more air time than Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to set an NFL record? Just stop by Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's Vinny Testaverde, no world-beater by any means, broke the league's 
single-game pass percentage record by completing 19 of 21 passes for 195 yards 
and two touchdowns in a 21-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The secondary started the season in great shape, with Lyght and Darryl Henley 
as the starting cornerbacks and Israel and Robert Bailey as the backups and 
nickel backs. Many on the Rams' coaching staff thought Henley was approaching 
All-Pro status, and Lyght was looking as good as he had since the team drafted 
him with the fifth pick in the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But every week, Israel remembers, there was another disaster to contend with: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Week 6. Henley, under investigation by federal agents for alleged 
involvement in drug trafficking, was granted a leave of absence by the team. 
Henley was later indicted and cut by the team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Week 9. Bailey was lost for the season after injuring his left knee in the 
second quarter of a 13-0 loss to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Week 10. Lyght, the team's top defensive back, suffered a season-ending 
knee injury during warm-ups of the Washington game. 
</P>
<P>
 With each situation, the Rams were forced to look elsewhere for depth. They 
wound up pulling guys off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Castoffs Sam Seale and Mitchell Price were signed for depth. Dexter Davis and 
Henderson, released by Phoenix and Denver, respectively, became part-time 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
 With Henley out, Israel stepped in at right cornerback and opposing teams took 
note of his inexperience -- he started only two games as a rookie -- and 
regularly sent some of their best receivers at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Israel played well enough with 35 tackles (31 solo) to prompt Ram 
coaches to start him this season opposite Lyght, whose knee has fully healed 
and is banking on a breakthrough season.

 Wouldn't you know it? 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell attends a news conference in Barcelona and the first 
thing he's asked is if he hopes the Raiders might still return to Oakland some 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a subject the Raiders can't leave behind no matter how far they go. 
Playing the part of international diplomat Thursday, Shell said he "appreciated 
the fans in Oakland, but we are not looking to return as of now." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he added: "We appreciate the fans of Los Angeles. L.A. is where we are 
and where we plan to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 At least nobody asked him if the Raiders might move to Barcelona.

 In the Raider traveling party are 40 former players, guests of owner Al Davis. 
. . . The last time the Raiders and the Denver Broncos met in an exhibition 
game, the site was Portland, Ore. That was 1968, when the Oakland Raiders won, 
23-7. . . . This is the third time the Raiders have appeared in the NFL's 
international series known as the American Bowl. They previously played in 
London against the New Orleans Saints in 1990 and in Tokyo against the Miami 
Dolphins in 1991. STEVE SPRINGER

STRICKEN WITH CANCER, POMONA'S MAY RETIRES; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: AFTER 20 YEARS 
OF SUCCESS, COACH SAYS SHE WANTS TO FOCUS ON FIGHTING HER DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal Poly Pomona's Darlene May, the winningest coach in NCAA Division II 
women's basketball, is suffering from cancer and will retire. 
</P>
<P>
 May's condition was diagnosed as breast cancer, but has spread to her liver. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Because) of what has happened to my health recently, I realize that there is 
no possible way I can continue to do my job effectively," May, 53, said in a 
statement released Thursday. "I cannot compete in two different games, and I 
need to fight this battle now." 
</P>
<P>
 May, who plans to live in Oregon,had a 519-119 record in 20 seasons. She was 
voted national coach of the year by the Women's Basketball Coaches Assn. twice 
and was California Collegiate Athletic Assn. coach of the year five times. 
</P>
<P>
 In two decades, all at Cal Poly Pomona, May won three national championships 
-- in 1982, '85 and '86 -- and at least a share of 18 conference titles. In the 
two seasons that her teams failed to win conference titles, Pomona was not 
affiliated with a league but had a combined 36-12 record. Her conference record 
is 195-8. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, May became the first woman to referee women's basketball in the 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my eyes, she's a legend," said Paula Tezak, who played on two of the 
national championship teams. "She demands a lot from her athletes, but also, 
she would do anything she can for her players. She really cares about the 
players and the teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Kerzie, a junior guard for Pomona, said the team is trying to remain 
upbeat after learning about May's illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all thinking positive thoughts," Kerzie said. "She's strong and 
stubborn -- she's not going to let this get to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Paul Thomas will be interim coach for the 1994-95 season.

PREP STAR CONVICTED IN INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a Ventura County jury less than three hours Thursday to convict former 
Newbury Park football standout Leodes Van Buren of firing a gun into the home 
of his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, the state's all-time leading pass receiver who was headed to the 
University of Colorado on a football scholarship before the shooting, could be 
sentenced to a maximum of seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark set sentencing for Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren was charged with shooting into an inhabited dwelling after his 
girlfriend, Marcie James, 20, told authorities that he fired a bullet through 
the back door of her family's home April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 James and Van Buren, who are now married, later denied he fired the gun, 
saying one of his acquaintances from Los Angeles did it. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the three-day trial, a prosecutor played to the jury audio tapes of 
Van Buren and James both identifying Van Buren as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 In his argument Thursday, James Grunert, deputy district attorney, contended 
that Van Buren decided to deny firing the gun a day after the incident in an 
effort to salvage his scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney John B. Miller countered that the prosecutor had failed 
to prove Van Buren fired the shot that broke a glass pane on the door but did 
not injure anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also claimed the real gunman is a Los Angeles gang member whose 
identity Van Buren cannot reveal for fear of retaliation.

TIME FOR DE LA HOYA TO STOP THE CLOWNING; BOXING: FIGHT AGAINST PAEZ CONSIDERED 
KEY FOR FORMER OLYMPIC STAR. TONEY FACES WILLIAMS.

 James Toney and Oscar De La Hoya, two of boxing's prized and pampered 
prodigies, go up for examination again tonight against a backdrop of vast 
expectations and against older, less-wealthy former champions. 
</P>
<P>
 For Toney, the International Boxing Federation super-middleweight champion, a 
main event against a fighter as respected as former light-heavyweight champion 
Prince Charles Williams is old hat. 
</P>
<P>
 But De La Hoya has made millions, done commercials and won a minor title 
without meeting an opponent nearly as savvy and experienced as former 
featherweight champion Jorge Paez, whom De La Hoya fights tonight at the MGM 
Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 The bouts will be televised by HBO, starting at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty months into his post-Olympic gold-medal career, De La Hoya is moving up 
to the lightweight division and facing the most important, and scrutinized, 
bout since his professional debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the so-called critics say, that Paez is going to be my toughest 
opponent," De La Hoya said. "But they've been saying that since I fought maybe 
Troy Dorsey (in June 1993). Paez fought Troy Dorsey (in July 1990), took him 12 
rounds to win a decision -- and I stopped him in one round. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I'm not sure what to think, I'm just going to believe in myself. If that's 
what the people want to see, then I'm going to give it to them. They want me to 
go up against a fighter who has a big name, and that's Paez." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya (13-0, 12 knockouts), who is being paid $800,000, and his trainer, 
Robert Alcazar, have been vocal about their confidence going into this fight 
for the vacant World Boxing Organization lightweight belt. At one point, 
Alcazar said that the 28-year-old, less-than-powerful Paez, who is making 
$175,000, would be De La Hoya's "easiest fight yet." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya said Paez, known for his goofy showmanship and stiff left hook, is 
"basically a clown, and that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But De La Hoya, 21, has suffered first-round knockdowns in two of his last 
three bouts and was not especially impressive in the third, when he knocked out 
Jimmi Bredahl in 10 rounds last March for the WBO junior-lightweight belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Narciso Valenzuela knocked De La Hoya down in October, before being knocked 
out. Giorgio Campanella knocked De La Hoya down in May, also before being 
knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Paez (53-6-4, 35 KOs), who has fought the likes of Pernell Whitaker, 
Freddie Pendleton (both decision losses) and Rafael Ruelas (his only knockout 
defeat), do what three previous journeymen could not? 
</P>
<P>
 "De La Hoya has never been taken into the deep water where we can see if he'll 
sink or swim when it gets tough," said Paez's trainer, Alex Shearer. "He's 
never been in a fight, even the knockdown fights, where he's had to go 
head-to-head, fist-to-fist, fighting for survival late in the fight. He hasn't 
fought anybody who could do that to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what Paez has to do, and I think will do." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, who sacrificed meals to make the 130-pound junior-lightweight 
limit, said he feels far stronger and more comfortable at the lightweight limit 
of 135. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question in my mind, Oscar's going to knock him out," Alcazar said. "In 
how many rounds, who knows? It all depends how many rounds it's going to take 
Oscar to catch him with a clean punch. That's as long as the fight's going to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya lost a coin flip, so Paez will get the traditional champion's right 
to enter the ring last. "Oscar's coming out first," Alcazar said, "and he's not 
happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the main event, Toney (43-0-2, 28 KOs), accepted as one of the two best 
fighters in the world, clearly considers Williams, 32, merely another man in 
his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, who could have a showdown with IBF middleweight champion Roy Jones in 
November and who eventually hopes to win the heavyweight championship, is being 
paid $1.2 million and has disparaged Williams as an old man about to be 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (36-5-2, 27 KOs), whose purse is $250,000, has made less than $1.2 
million total in his 16-year pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prince Charles, four or five years ago, was a great fighter," said Toney's 
trainer, Bill Miller. "But you can't cook with old grease. Joe Louis, Sugar Ray 
Leonard, they used to be great fighters. Charles is in that category: used to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, was 
with Robert Wangila in the hospital before the fighter died Sunday in Las Vegas 
and was shaken by the incident. But Ratner said a review of the situation shows 
that there was nothing more the commission could have done to prevent the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor checked him between the eighth and ninth rounds, he said he was 
fine," Ratner said. "After the fight, Dr. (Robert) Voy spent 10 minutes with 
him in the dressing room, there was not a clue that this could have happened. 
If you had watched the fight, you would have thought nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevada commission could have a difficult decision on the heels of this 
incident, if, as expected, Evander Holyfield seeks reinstatement of his 
license. Holyfield retired after his loss to Michael Moorer in April when 
doctors discovered congenital heart problems. Boxing Calendar

THE PITCHER IS PERFECT, BUT GREER GETS THE SAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel second baseman Rex Hudler stood in the on-deck circle in the eighth 
inning, leaned over into the stands, and calmly told the Texas Ranger fans that 
he was going to ruin their night. 
</P>
<P>
 In an act of braggadocio, or perhaps stupidity, Hudler vowed he was personally 
going to ruin Ranger pitcher Kenny Rogers' perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was telling the fans in the first five rows that I was going to get him," 
Hudler said. "I wanted him bad. I was going to hit an ugly bleeder that would 
(tee) off everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers had cruised all evening, throwing only 59 pitches through six innings 
without so much as a hard-hit ball. He teased the Angels with his curveball. 
Threw his 90-m.p.h fastball past them. He never gave the Angels a chance to 
draw so much as a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler led off the ninth. On an 0-and-2 pitch, he guessed fastball and got it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hit it, I said, 'Way to go. You did it,' " Hudler said. "Then I 
started looking up, and the ball kept hanging up there. Then the guy dives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe what I saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just set him up with the highlight play of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Rusty Greer, getting a great jump, sprinted toward the 
right-center gap, dived, and caught the ball, preserving the perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to get a good jump on it," Greer said. "I didn't really know I'd 
get it when it left the bat, but I was just glad I was able to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "My adrenaline was flowing. I didn't realize how important it was until there 
were two outs. Then I had to calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rogers: "I thought it was a hit for sure. I said, 'He's not catching that 
ball. That ball's a hit.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know he caught it until he got up, and threw the ball back in. 
It was spectacular. There's no other words to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson struck out for the second out. Two pitches later, Gary DiSarcina 
hit a fly ball to straightaway center, and Greer caught it, jumping up and down 
along with everyone else at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I hit it pretty good," said DiSarcina, now 0 for 17 against Rogers 
in his career. "I took two, three steps out of the box, saw the guy wasn't 
moving, and said, 'Wow! He did it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I never have got a hit off the guy, so I guess it was his fifth no-hitter 
against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hudler: "I'm embarrassed I took an 0-for-3 off him. I'm embarrassed we 
lost seven in a row. But I'm not embarrassed what he did against us. We ran 
into a buzz-saw man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I was embarrassed when we got no-hit by Fernando (Valenzuela) when I 
was with the Cardinals because he was getting up in age, but not tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I was honored to be in the lineup."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CLUB WON'T PLAY IN TRIPLE-A PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels could have been part of major league history. They could have been 
brought back to their roots. They could have stepped back in time, playing in a 
small ballpark, with cramped clubhouses, playing all day games. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Angel front office filed a letter of protest and the players 
complained loud and hard to the Major League Players Assn. that they didn't 
want to play their three-game series against the Seattle Mariners at Cheney 
Park in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wanted to go there," Angel pitcher Phil Leftwich said. "It's a dump. 
When we (triple-A Vancouver) played there last year, the outfield was a swamp." 
</P>
<P>
 The players' association listened and Thursday told the American League office 
that the Seattle Mariners would have to play their upcoming nine-game home 
stand in their opponents' ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Angels gained three home games on their schedule and will play the 
Mariners on Tuesday through Thursday at Anaheim Stadium. The games will be 
played at 7 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday and at 5:30 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All seats will be half price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just weren't going to play in a minor league facility," said pitcher Mark 
Langston, Angel player-representative. "It's never been done in the history of 
the game, and we weren't looking for a precedent in this situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I was vehemently opposed to major 
league players in minor league ballparks. It wasn't just to get the games here, 
but any major league facility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels won't allow the strike date to deter their plans to acquire a 
closer, Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have focused their attention on Minnesota Twin closer Rick 
Aguilera, who has a contract through the 1995 season with an option for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still have keen interest in Randy Myers of the Chicago Cubs, but 
they now appear to be giving up hope on acquiring John Wetteland of Montreal. 
Jeff Montgomery of Kansas City is no longer is available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels not only will receive the 77% home-gate receipts during the 
three-game series but also save about $34,800 in expenses by not traveling to 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Angel owner Jackie Autry's statement on the Aug. 12 strike date: "I am 
disappointed the players choose to strike a time when they are all making more 
money than ever before. Additionally, to deprive the fans of postseason play 
merely because they feel they will be hurting the owners the most is 
shortsighted on their part." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angel players had approved playing their three games at Cheney Stadium, 
the players association said the Texas Rangers and Chicago White Sox also would 
have played at the triple-A stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," Ranger General Manager Tom Grieve said. "I figured we were 
going to Tacoma. I don't know why they changed it, but I'm glad we're playing 
here." BOB NIGHTENGALE

O'BRIEN NEARING DECATHLON RECORD; GOODWILL GAMES: EVEN WITHOUT BEING PUSHED BY 
TOP COMPETITION, AMERICAN'S FIRST-DAY SCORE IS ALMOST A PERSONAL BEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun was out in full force. The crowd was not. Feeling too much heat and 
not enough inspiration, Dan O'Brien figured Thursday that he would settle for a 
credible performance instead of an incredible one in the Goodwill Games 
decathlon competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first two events, I was thinking, 'No world record. I'm just going 
to go steady and win this thing,' " he said. "But when I was high jumping, I 
said, 'Hey, I can get back in this thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he had finished the high jump, fourth of the five events scheduled 
on the first day, he had cleared a personal best of 7 feet 2 1/2 inches, tying 
the American decathlon record, and was only 21 points off his own world-record 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 When the seven decathletes returned to the track for their final event of the 
day, the 400 meters, the public address announcer tried his best to stir the 
crowd. Considering that there were no more than 5,000 spectators in the 
28,000-seat Petrovsky Stadium, he could almost have given each of them a 
private pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he used a microphone to inform them that O'Brien ran the 400 in 48.51 
seconds when he set his most recent world record in 1992 at Talence, France. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means Dan has a wonderful opportunity to improve his points," the 
announcer said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was thinking the same thing when he reached his starting blocks. Seven 
minutes later, he was still standing beside them as officials refused to start 
the race until they received the go-ahead from their liaison to the television 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer I waited, the more nervous I got," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the race started, O'Brien put it behind him quickly, finishing in a 
respectable 47.73. That gave him 4,736 points, 16 ahead of his world-record 
pace and only two points off his best first-day score ever, entering today's 
final five events. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his chances of surpassing the record, O'Brien, who will never win 
an award for positive thinking, said, "Fifty-fifty." 
</P>
<P>
 The odds would improve in his favor, he added, if he had someone to challenge 
him other than himself. O'Brien, who leads runner-up Steve Fritz of the United 
States by 623 points, finished first in all five events Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no Eduard Hamalainen nipping at my heels," O'Brien said, referring to 
this year's world leader from Belarus. "It's kind of an easygoing competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Heike Drechsler could relate to this after her close friend and 
closest rival, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, withdrew from the long jump. Drechsler's 
five best jumps were the five best in the competition, including the winner of 
23-4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed Jackie Joyner," Drechsler said of Joyner-Kersee, whose coach, Bob 
Kersee, discouraged her from competing after she won the heptathlon Tuesday. 
"When there is no one else who can beat me, it isn't a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee and Drechsler are scheduled to meet several more times this 
summer in the long jump. Then, Drechsler said, she will test herself in a 
heptathlon in September at Talence. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. sprinter Michael Johnson did not have the luxury of a lesser field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked among the top four in the world in the 200 meters for the last four 
years, Johnson entered that race Thursday with world champion Frankie 
Fredericks to his left, Olympic champion Michael Marsh to his right and world 
silver medalist John Regis in another lane. Johnson won in 20.10 seconds, with 
Fredericks second in 20.17, Regis third in 20.31 and Marsh fourth in 20.48. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said he hopes to peak this year at Talence. He probably will need to 
be in top form because Hamalainen is also scheduled to compete there. 
</P>
<P>
 One of O'Brien's coaches, Rick Sloan, said the decathlete from Moscow, Ida., 
is physically ready to break the world record today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each one of those is a very easy mark to come back and get," he said, 
referring to O'Brien's record-breaking performance in the final five events two 
years ago. "When we come to the 1,500 meters, we want to be in a position to 
run a relative time to what he ran at Talence to get the record," That would be 
4:42.10. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that might not sound like an insurmountable challenge for a 
world-class decathlete, O'Brien more often than not has too little to give by 
the time he reaches the 1,500, the 10th event. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer in the national championships at Knoxville, Tenn., needing 
a 4:42 to break his record, he jogged to a time that was a half-minute slower. 
</P>
<P>
 His coaches claim that the 1,500 is a mental barrier for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive thinking, he counters, does not make the race shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a hot day like today, I'm going to be tired when I get to the 1,500," 
he said Thursday. "I've come to the conclusion this season that I'm not a 
distance runner." 
</P>
<P>
 So less than half an hour after leaving the track, he already had talked 
himself out of a potential world record. His coaches had about 18 hours to talk 
him back into it.

POSTCARD / ST. PETERSBURG; HE CRIED WOLF WITH THIS 'CRIME' REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This city's mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, blames the Western media for St. 
Petersburg's image as a burgeoning crime capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the most graphic report of crime here, as well as in other Russian 
cities, came in the form of a U.S. State Department advisory to Americans 
living in or visiting the country. 
</P>
<P>
 It warned: "Pickpocketing, assaults and robberies occur both day and night, 
and most frequently on city streets, in underground walkways and the subway; on 
inter-city trains, especially the Moscow-St. Petersburg overnight train; at 
markets, tourist attractions and restaurants, and in hotel rooms and 
residences, even when locked or occupied." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, danger lurks everywhere except church, the police station and 
Sobchak's office. 
</P>
<P>
 While the mayor attempted to gloss over the problem, local law enforcement 
officials prepared for the worst. Recognizing that a crime wave during the 
Goodwill Games would provide even more fodder for the Western media, they 
recruited 3,000 policemen from other regions to join the 10,000 who are 
normally on the streets and increased patrols in the city by 65%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps we can't protect our guests against a Martian invasion, but we are 
well prepared to cope with any serious trouble which could break out in a 
public place," Col. Viktor Kuznetsov, Goodwill Games security chief, told the 
St. Petersburg Press. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the newspaper, Kuznetsov even revoked the special license that 
allows Sobchak's driver to disobey certain traffic regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus assured, those of us here for the Goodwill Games went about our chores 
without any more than the usual amount of paranoia that comes with being in a 
city of 5 million residents . . . until a reporter for another newspaper 
informed us that his laptop computer had been stolen from his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about that, Mr. Sobchak?" we asked as we hurried to our rooms to hide 
our laptops, either in locked suitcases or closets or under a mattress. 
</P>
<P>
 We then knew that the reports were true. The saint in Petersburg was 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, the reporter sheepishly told us that he received a call the 
night before from Goodwill Games officials informing him that his computer had 
been returned to lost-and-found. Apparently, he left it on a bus, and the 
driver, at the end of his rounds, turned it in. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter called the bus company and offered a reward to the driver, but he 
rejected it. Just doing his job, he said. RANDY HARVEY

HE CAN'T RESIST THE LURE OF THIS OPEN ROAD; CYCLING: FORMER AIR FORCE PILOT 
DAVIS, 62, WILL RIDE FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO GEORGIA WITH THREE TEAMMATES IN 
ANNUAL RACE ACROSS AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simply put, cyclist Jim Davis is 62-years young. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some men his age contemplate retirement, Davis, who works for TRW, 
isn't interested in slowing down. He is too busy training, trying to figure out 
how he and his three teammates can complete the 3,000-mile Race Across America 
in roughly seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing this race is an amazing feat in itself, but the RAAM is old hat for 
Davis. He finished the race as part of an eight-rider team in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th annual RAAM begins today from the Holiday Inn in Irvine, with the 
solo riders and tandem teams starting at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at 9 a.m., Davis and three of his friends will start with the other 
four-rider teams, beginning a 2,905-mile journey that will take them through 
Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, before finishing in Savannah, Ga. 
Finishers should begin to arrive in Savannah on Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Grueling as RAAM is for the cyclists, the race is not as formidable as it 
would appear for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys testing his physical and mental limits, and an 18-year career in the 
Air Force from 1955-73, including missions in Southeast Asia, keeps the race in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, riding a bicycle past a sleeping rattlesnake in the middle of 
the desert is nothing compared to flying an F-86 during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, the race is not as difficult as it sounds," Davis said. "It does 
closely simulate some survival situations you might see in the military. The 
biggest part of the race is what you do off the bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's that special feeling you get in a team environment; the feeling that 
you won't ever get it done just by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' team is the SCOR Antiques, and they will compete in the masters (age 60 
and older) division. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name is perfect," Davis said. "You know, we're something valuable, yet 
old." 
</P>
<P>
 SCOR, which stands for Specialized Coronary Outpatient Rehabilitation, brought 
together Davis of Huntington Beach and teammates Chuck Hanson of Bellflower, 
Jewett Pattee of Long Beach and Bill Rider of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Davis hasn't had any heart problems, he had a high cholesterol level, 
hypertension, and was 40 pounds overweight when he hooked up with SCOR. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw them when they were riding at one of the Solvang Century races, a 
100-mile ride held every March," Davis said. "Then I saw them in a local race 
in Huntington Beach and slowly got involved. We all ride together Saturday 
mornings in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, 64, is the leader of the group. He will be riding in his second RAAM, 
just six years after undergoing double bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to finish that race was a great experience," Hanson said. "For this 
year's race, we finally found four people who were willing to try it and we 
just wanted to see how we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pattee, 70, whom Davis calls the "old man" of the group, and Rider, "the 
youngster" (he turns 60 in August), round out the Antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny," Davis said, "but some of the guys are already worrying about 
'What if the weather is really hot or if it's rainy?' 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it, no one tells you what your day is going to be like when 
you wake up in the morning. Things come up, you make adjustments . . . you deal 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has a gift for simplifying matters.  
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After finding out this year's route would take them through Wolf Creek Pass 
in Colorado which reaches altitudes near 11,000 feet, there were grumblings 
about how the team would approach that difficult leg of the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Davis: "Why worry about it? When you're on the bike, you shouldn't be 
concerned about where you are. Just ride for an hour or so and then your shift 
is over.  
</P>
<P>
 "So I joked with them, 'I just won't ride that part of the race.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Davis' description of RAAM: 
</P>
<P>
 "You have two to three days where you're getting used to the whole cycle of 
riding, resting, sleeping and eating on the road. Then you have two to three 
days where you're in the groove and feeling pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the last two days, well, let's just say you aren't taking pictures of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Like any other RAAM rider, Davis had problems describing why he would want to 
cycle 3,000 miles in one week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, it's like climbing the mountain that's there," Davis said. 
"It's a 3,000-mile challenge and I want to see what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude inadvertently helped Davis qualify for the cycling time trials 
event at the 1993 Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In June two years ago, I heard about these qualifying trials for the Senior 
Olympics down in San Diego," Davis said. "I thought I'd just go down and watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I thought, 'What the heck, maybe I ought to ride in it?' So I sent in an 
application and entered, raced with an old bike of mine, and actually qualified 
for the Senior Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Davis didn't fare well at the Senior Olympics in Baton Rouge, La., he 
won't forget his experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There I saw a 92-year-old man running in the 200 meters," Davis said. "I 
don't think you can define people by their chronological age. Seeing that man 
compete, that was what it was all about for me." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Davis have anyone telling him he should act his age and start doing 
grandfatherly things? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anyone like that," Davis said, laughing. "Man, this is Southern 
California. I left all of that back in Hackensack, N.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Davis said he's not sure how his wife of 37 years, Glennor, and their 
four children feel about his cycling passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought about if she liked or disliked it," Davis said. "I 
guess with me having been a pilot with the Air Force and always putting the 
family on the go, they all just look at it and say, 'Well, there he goes 
again.' "

AMERICAN LEGION AREA 6 BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; WESTLAKE-ROYAL BATTERS PITCH IN, 
COLLECTING 14 HITS IN 14-6 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal Coach Mike McClure has publicly billed his American Legion team 
as one with great pitching depth but little offensive punch. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who were the guys he was coaching Thursday night as Westlake-Royal beat 
Westchester, 14-6, on the first day of the double-elimination Area 6 playoffs 
at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium?  
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal (26-5-1) pounded out 14 hits. Keith Loitz had three hits, 
including two doubles. Bryan Fernandez had a double and a triple. Kevin 
Mellinger and Scott Morris each had two singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Loitz said the team had been winning, but struggling to meet its potential in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to get the monkey off our backs," Loitz said. "So we brought a (toy) 
monkey to practice and we burned it." 
</P>
<P>
 McClure chose to start Loitz, a reliever who pitched only 9 1/3 innings all 
season, to save his top starters for today's game, at 6 p.m. against Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach wanted to see if he could sneak me by in the beginning and then bring 
in our big guns," Loitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loitz (2-0) pitched well for five innings, giving up just one run and three 
hits, but tired in the sixth. Chuck Hirsh then came in and was not much relief. 
He allowed all three inherited runners to score and Westchester pulled to 
within 14-6. 
</P>
<P>
 McClure brought on Jay Kenney, one of his top four starters. Kenney pitched 
three innings and picked up a save. He gave up one hit and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 McClure will start Todd Singleton (6-0, 0.96) in today's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal scored seven runs in the first two innings against Rich Sturm 
(5-2), and seemed on its way to ending the game early because of the 10-run 
rule, but reliever Paul Lopez held the team at 14 runs from the fifth inning 
on. Westchester (16-8) will play Camarillo at 2 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia 17, Valley North 3 -- Arcadia (31-7) hit five home runs and had 17 
hits in a game called after seven innings because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Farzaneh (3-2), Valley North's No. 3 pitcher, lasted only one-third of an 
inning, allowing six runs, including two homers. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning last week's grueling District 20 tournament, which ended Sunday, 
Valley North (19-9) went through all of its pitchers. The team's top two, Jim 
DeBiase and Ray Daryabigi, were not ready to pitch Thursday, Coach Pete Redfern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase will pitch against St. Bernard in an elimination game at 10 a.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia's attack was led by center fielder David Janssen, who hit two home 
runs. Justin Stewart added a grand slam. Pete Paciorek and Ryan Baderian also 
homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan LaCour led Valley North with two doubles. Five of the team's eight hits 
were doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 5, St. Bernard 2 -- Brian Garretson might not have been Camarillo's 
consensus No. 1 starter before the game, but he is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson was forced to start because Dan Martinez and Richard Soliz, the 
team's winningest pitchers, told Coach Ron Regalado they want to save their 
arms for the Area Code Games tryouts Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Soliz and Martinez attended the game against St. Bernard (14-6) and say they 
won't pitch the rest of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson, a right-hander from Moorpark, responded with a five-hitter. He 
struck out 13 and both St. Bernard runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure he's not our best pitcher," Regalado said, "but he was all we 
had today. He's very composed out there. He matches up with anyone in our 
league." 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson's teammates gave him a 3-2 lead in the fifth when Rodell Desamparo 
doubled home a run and scored on an error. Camarillo (26-7) added two insurance 
runs on a pinch-hit homer by Jason Adamson in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson, who singled in the eighth, was the only Camarillo player with more 
than one hit.

STILL A GO-GETTER; '59 WIMBLEDON CHAMPION ALEX OLMEDO KEEPS A FAST PACE AS 
TEACHER AND PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alex Olmedo had forgotten his tennis racket and needed one as a prop for a 
newspaper photograph. So without hesitation he walked to the small tennis 
office of the public park near his home and asked the attendant if he could 
borrow one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got any ID?" asked the young man as Olmedo pulled a racket from a shopping 
cart filled with green balls. 
</P>
<P>
 The question seemed to irritate Olmedo, 58, a former Wimbledon champion and 
well-known teaching pro. 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to tell whether Olmedo, an affable man with a ready smile, 
was more annoyed at the mistrust or the attendant's failure to recognize him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, Kid," said Olmedo, who promised not to venture far with the racket. But 
then Olmedo noticed a racket manufactured by his sponsor and asked to borrow 
that one instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," came the response. "I need it to give a lesson. I'm late as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was the attendant's cockiness, or his unwillingness to take Olmedo 
seriously, but the old champion had had enough. He returned the original racket 
with some parting shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a bad racket, Kid," he said. "I'll just go home and get mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The counterattack was vintage Olmedo. As he did on the court, the man who was 
inducted into the international tennis Hall of Fame in 1987 found a way to 
disarm his opponent. This was no journeyman the young man had encountered, 
especially with verbal volleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Once one of the world's best players, Olmedo spent nearly three decades 
teaching the sport before returning to competition two years ago. Now, he is 
virtually unstoppable in age-group tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he advanced to the final of the U.S Tennis Assn.'s 55-and-over 
national singles hardcourt championships at Huntington Beach but lost to Larry 
Dodge of Piedmont, Calif., 6-4, 6-4. Olmedo was the two-time defending champion 
in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my hero," Dodge said before the match. "He's the class of this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the late 1950s, that was a standard comment about Olmedo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Olmedo was born in Arequipa, a city in the southern Peruvian Andes, 
and was introduced to tennis by his father, the resident pro and caretaker at a 
local club. 
</P>
<P>
 By his early teens, Olmedo had developed into a promising player and caught 
the eye of Stanley Singer, an American coach in Lima, Peru's capital. When 
Olmedo was 18, Singer sent him to live with a friend in California, where the 
youngster spent several months in night school learning English. He later 
attended Modesto College and then transferred to USC on scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, Olmedo won the NCAA men's singles titles in 1956 and 1958. By then, he 
had met Perry Jones, the septuagenarian who ruled organized tennis in 
California in those days and who became one of Olmedo's staunchest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jones was the czar of tennis in Southern California," said Olmedo, who was 
nicknamed "Chief" because of his Inca heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was strict and wouldn't allow stuff like you see today. He made players 
wear white and cut their hair short. When he sent us out to give clinics at 
schools you had to be dressed properly. If your shirt was hanging out over your 
shorts, that was a big no-no." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Jones became captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team and selected Olmedo 
for the squad. Many in the American tennis community, however, questioned why a 
non-citizen was awarded a berth. But Jones held firm. Peru, he said, didn't 
have a team and Olmedo deserved the chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States breezed through the preliminary rounds with 5-0 victories 
over Venezuela, Canada, Argentina and Italy before meeting three-time defending 
champion Australia in the finals at Brisbane. There, Jones slipped Olmedo into 
the No. 1 singles slot and reserved Ham Richardson, the top-ranked U.S. player 
at the time, for the doubles competition in another bold move that raised 
eyebrows back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be 110 degrees and very humid (in Brisbane)," Olmedo said. "Ham 
had diabetes and Jones was worried he wouldn't last three days in a row in that 
heat, so he gambled." 
</P>
<P>
 It paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of the three-day match, Olmedo defeated Mal Anderson in four 
sets, but Ashley Cooper, then the world's top player, got Australia even with a 
four-set victory over Barry MacKay. The next day, Olmedo and Richardson beat 
Anderson and Neale Fraser in a marathon 10-12, 3-6, 16-14, 6-3, 7-5 match that 
put the United States ahead, 2-1. The 82 games in that match rank sixth in 
Davis Cup doubles competition. 
</P>
<P>
 That set the stage for one of Olmedo's biggest victories. 
</P>
<P>
 With the United States needing only one victory to clinch the Cup, Olmedo took 
the court on the final day of the match to face Cooper. When it was over, 
Olmedo had a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 8-6 victory and established himself as an 
international tennis power and a national hero in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Lima Lawn Tennis Club, once off-limits to Olmedo because of his 
socioeconomic background, made him an honorary lifetime member, and Peruvian 
President Manuel Prado awarded him the "Sporting Laurel of Peru." The president 
should have waited a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After his magnificent play in Australia, Olmedo continued his rise to stardom 
with a superb performance in 1959.  
</P>
<P>
 He won the Australian Open and lost to Fraser in the U.S. Open but left his 
mark forever at the most prestigious tennis championships -- a three-set 
victory in the Wimbledon final Australian Rod Laver, who later won the 
tournament four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Olmedo attended Wimbledon with longtime friend Pancho Segura, the 
Ecuadoran who was a top pro for many years and a former coach of Jimmy Connors. 
The two sat in the Royal Box. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at me," Olmedo said then, "I won it 34 years ago and I get treated like 
a king. You go to any other tournament I won and you have to get in the line to 
get a ticket. . . . winning Wimbledon was a great feeling, a great honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he completed college in 1962, Olmedo signed to play on a new 
professional tour controlled by Jack Kramer, but he quit after one year because 
he grew tired of the travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, we were playing indoors and on canvas and the fast conditions 
were not suited for my game," he said. "I had to play against (Pancho) Gonzales 
and (Ken) Rosewall and Segura, who had great ground strokes. The whole thing 
was more or less a circus. . . . That year took a lot out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Olmedo wanted a job closer to home to spend more time with his wife Ann and 
their three children. He became the head pro at the Beverly Hills Hotel and 
worked there for 27 years until it was closed for restoration two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The famous pink hotel, a veritable landmark in Los Angeles, might be 
undergoing cosmetic changes to conceal the scars of time, but the years have 
been kind to Olmedo. 
</P>
<P>
 Still svelte and energetic, with only a slight touch of gray at his temples, 
Olmedo stays trim by running several times a week, teaching tennis in his 
Encino back-yard court and playing in age-group tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournaments, Olmedo said, are particularly enjoyable because he renews 
ties with players he faced or played with in doubles matches years ago. Among 
those Olmedo beat on his way to the title match with Dodge was Alan Roberts, 
one of his old foes, in two sets in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was cat-quick and he was always balanced," said Roberts, a semi-retired 
Beverly Hills orthopedist and former U.S. junior champion. "He's still very 
fluid. He's like a panther. I tell him, 'Chief, we are going to have to put 
some weights on you to slow you down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Slim chance. Whether teaching, playing, running or getting in a few rounds of 
golf, Olmedo likes to stay active. It has been his way of life and Olmedo 
refuses to sit idly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tournaments keep me a little busy," Olmedo said. "I used to rely on 
trying to force my opponents into errors. Now I rely on the same thing, but 
with more patience and slower motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I enjoy teaching. My method is very simplified. Just the basics. The game 
has become so powerful that all the players rely on the topspin. But I think 
they abuse it. I see guys teaching the topspin even to little old ladies and I 
think it's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 He could have told that to the attendant at his neighborhood park, but he 
probably would have been asked for his credentials.

LOOKING UP WHILE HE'S DOWN; STILLWELL TOILS IN MINORS, HOPING FOR ANOTHER 
CHANCE AT THE BIG SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has seen an ivy-covered brick wall in center field before, and Bush Stadium 
certainly sounds familiar. But something just isn't right as Kurt Stillwell 
trots toward the outfield for pregame stretching. 
</P>
<P>
 He is stopped by the plea of a youngster who wants an autograph. The cry 
echoes throughout the 103-year-old stadium, a relic that reminds Stillwell of 
baseball's ability to paint the black with a nasty curve. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, that's not Wrigley Field ivy in center. You have to head north 
about three hours on Interstate 65 to see that. And this Bush Stadium is a far 
cry from that Busch Stadium in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now this is home for Stillwell, who played shortstop in a major league 
All-Star game at 23 but today is a 29-year-old infielder for the Indianapolis 
Indians, the triple-A affiliate for the Cincinnati Reds. After being released 
twice in two months last season, Stillwell is left dreaming of a journey 100 
miles south to Cincinnati, whose fans once adored his boyish charm as if he 
were a slick-fielding Opie Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 But that dream ends these days with 5 a.m. wake-up calls at the Holiday Inn 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of things that run through your mind, especially when you wake 
up and you're in the minor leagues," said Stillwell, who came into organized 
baseball out of Thousand Oaks High. "You're not really where you want to be, 
and it really makes you wonder what's in store for your future. Not because I'm 
too good to be here; it's just that I'm still young and I still got a lot of 
life ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell hasn't lost faith, despite consecutive pink slips issued in 1993 by 
the San Diego Padres and the Angels. Stillwell's contract was too expensive for 
the frugal Padres. He was a victim of budget cuts that also sent Gary Sheffield 
and Fred McGriff packing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stillwell signed with the Angels three days later, he was hampered by 
nagging injuries and was the odd man out during a player shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego was a great place to play," said Stillwell, who resides in Poway 
during the off-season. "My family could come down and watch me play and I was 
making good money. But it didn't matter if I was hitting .200 or .400, I wasn't 
going to be part of their plans. I hooked up with (the Angels), but I got hurt 
and they were running a lot of players in and out. Next thing I knew, I was 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell accepted a one-year deal with the Reds in November, returning to the 
team that made him the No. 2 overall pick in the 1983 draft. One day he's 
smashing Marmonte League fastballs at a .552 clip and leading the Lancers to 
the league title, the next day he's playing pepper with Manager Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 At 21, he was the Reds' everyday shortstop. Two years later, he played in the 
All-Star game in his first of four seasons with the Kansas City Royals. After a 
year with San Diego came the cuts by the Padres and Angels in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Then -- be it injuries, politics, or fate -- he suddenly couldn't find a job 
in the major leagues. When Stillwell failed to make the Reds' roster this year 
in spring training, he accepted an assignment with Indianapolis and finds 
himself starting at shortstop and batting fifth for a team that leads the 
American Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of failures in baseball," he said. "But I'm too young to hang 
it up. I've decided to keep playing until they tell me I can't play anymore -- 
and it's gotten real close to that." 
</P>
<P>
 If it's any consolation, Roger Maris and Harmon Killebrew once wore 
Indianapolis uniforms. And George Foster and Ken Griffey stopped here en route 
to the Big Red Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only mildly comforting to Stillwell, an eight-year major league 
veteran who has become a $135,000 insurance policy for all-star shortstop Barry 
Larkin. Stillwell is virtually assured of a September call-up, but his contract 
can be purchased at any time by a club looking for a veteran down the pennant 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any doubt that Kurt can still play," Indianapolis Manager Marc 
Bombard said. "He's had some productive years in the big leagues and he's still 
not that old. He hasn't had his full arsenal because of injuries, and I know 
that's been frustrating to him. But the skills are still there. He swings the 
bat consistently from both sides of the plate and he's a smart player who's 
been a great leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Stillwell's skills are still apparent. In 75 games through Wednesday, 
he was batting .273 with 40 runs batted in and 29 extra-base hits, including 
five triples. 
</P>
<P>
 And, without a doubt, Stillwell is one of the most popular Indianapolis 
players. He speaks to Christian youth groups and politely obliges most 
autograph requests. There's something about that big smile and polite demeanor 
that plays well in the Midwest. But there's also something about playing down 
the street from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas 250,000 people turn out to watch qualifying at the Brickyard, the 
Indians, who are 20 games above .500 and in first place in the American Assn., 
average 4,378. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a huge baseball town with the Indy 500 and the (Indiana) Pacers, but 
I've been enjoying myself to a certain degree," Stillwell said. "We have a 
winning team here and I've played fairly well. It's been a good experience for 
the most part. The perks aren't here, that's for sure. It's not very glamorous, 
but that's just the way things are in the minor leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell and his wife, Angie, have adapted to the new lifestyle -- in which 
his monthly salary equals his daily salary of a year ago -- in part because of 
their Christian faith. But he hasn't decided how much longer he will wait for 
major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel very fortunate to have gotten eight years in," he said. "The 
Lord blessed me with those eight years, and that's really what it comes down 
to, my faith. I'm not real outward about it, but that's the foundation of my 
life. That's what keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 Some players might try to find answers in batting cages, but Stillwell turns 
to the pages of a Bible that sits in his locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a crutch, I know," he said. "But I really believe God has a 
plan for me and I know that what's happened the past couple of years has been 
part of that plan." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the type of mental strength Bombard first witnessed as manager at 
Billings (Mont.) in 1983. Stillwell, fresh off a senior season at Thousand Oaks 
in which he was named Southern Section player of the year, was a $135,000 bonus 
baby -- a fact trumpeted in headlines when Billings opened the season in Idaho 
Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell responded to the jeers with a 4-for-5 night that included his first 
professional home run. Then he homered from the other side of the plate the 
next night.  
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, here's a 17-year-old kid under a ton of pressure, and he just goes up 
there and does his job like it's a walk in the park," Bombard said. "It didn't 
even faze him. And you know what? He's the same person today that he was in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to stay the same, especially when you've been in the big leagues 
eight years, but Kurt has always managed to stay humble. He's always trying to 
learn, that's why he's a valuable commodity as a player and as a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Such praise consoles Stillwell, but he would rather hear it at the major 
league level. Preferably in the form of a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I don't wake up thinking, gosh, I hate this place, I gotta get back 
to the big leagues before I go nuts," Stillwell said. "If it happens, it 
happens. In this game, there's no guarantee that you'll even be around the next 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, he carries a tender hamstring and stiff knee onto the outfield 
grass. The injuries are at least two reminders of his attempt to extend his 
career. But the hamstring feels good tonight. The knee is getting there. He 
grins when he thinks of recent, premature reports that his season ended with a 
collision at second base May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of baseball's many curves. 
</P>
<P>
 Just then a young boy hangs over the railing, flashing a pen, a game program 
and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have time, Mr. Stillwell?" he squeaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwell grins again. He has all the time in the world, kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurt's the kind of guy who knows that the game doesn't owe you anything," 
Bombard said. "You owe it all to the game."

SOFTBALL / PAIGE A. LEECH; LECOCQ, 12, SHOWS STUFF, NOT HER AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maureen LeCocq is five years away from competing at the college level, but she 
is already commanding the attention of one of the top collegiate coaches in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Mike Candrea had trouble believing his eyes at his softball camp 
last December in Tucson. There on the pitching rubber stood LeCocq, throwing 
rise balls at speeds in the mid- to high 50s. The aftershock came moments 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when he found out she was only going into the eighth grade, he took her 
father aside and said, 'Now, don't let her go to UCLA,' " said Don Harris, 
coach of the Woodland Hills-based Southern California Stealth, a 12-and-under 
Amateur Softball Assn. fast-pitch travel team that includes LeCocq. 
</P>
<P>
 But keeping LeCocq away from perennial power UCLA might be more difficult than 
Candrea thinks. LeCocq's pitching instructor is Samantha Ford, who pitched for 
Hart High and UCLA (1986-89). 
</P>
<P>
 While LeCocq, 12, is making a name for herself with college coaches, Stealth 
is reaping the benefits of her talent. Pitching against players her age this 
summer, LeCocq is 30-7 with 336 strikeouts in 232 1/3 innings and a 0.51 
earned-run average. Her numbers are staggering despite pitching as many as five 
games in a day and sometimes eight games during a weekend tournament. Stealth, 
like other ASA travel teams, competes on the weekends in tournaments in and out 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
 LeCocq, who is batting a team-high .357 with 32 runs batted in, and her 10 
Stealth teammates are bound for the 12-and-under ASA national tournament in 
Greenwood, Ind., Aug. 10-14. 
</P>
<P>
 This year marks the first national appearance for the four-team Stealth 
organization that Harris developed four years ago. The 18-and-under and 
16-and-under Stealth teams also qualified for nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-and-under team is led by pitchers Jamie Johnston (Paraclete High), who 
has accepted a scholarship to Central Michigan, and Lindsay Harris of 
Louisville High in Woodland Hills, the eldest of Don Harris' three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Gillies, the 1993 Southern Section Division II pitcher of the year from 
Saugus, leads the 16-and-under team. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be little rest for Stealth when the teams return from the national 
tournaments. The 18-, 14- and 12-and-under teams will compete in the Junior 
Olympic Invitational in Honolulu, Aug. 16-25. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Up and at 'em: Sleeping late on Saturday mornings is a luxury Bill Holt, coach 
of a 16-and-under ASA travel team based in Valencia, forgoes nine months a 
year. Too much work to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt is on a crusade. While most ASA travel teams play during only the summer 
months, the Raiders also compete in winter, September through February. Holt's 
mission is to train softball players and prepare them for college competition 
-- preferably with an athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year you get a new crop to train and the goal is to get them into 
college," said Holt, who is in his sixth season with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Those weekend days must seem an eternity. The Raiders (51-12), who have 
qualified for the ASA national tournament, Aug. 10-14, at Illinois State in 
Normal, Ill., have played 63 games in 10 weekends. That's an average of more 
than three games a day -- six a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Holt has helped several players hone their skills and earn 
scholarships -- Arizona's Nancy Evans (Hoover) and UCLA's Nicole Odom (South 
Torrance) are two -- he refuses to take credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls are great," Holt said. "They are the heroes. They give up their 
boyfriends, their lives, for this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders qualified for the nationals nearly two weeks ago by winning the 
Southern California ASA regional tournament in Mission Viejo behind the 
pitching of Tina Kinney (Hoover) and Jessie Davenport (Thousand Oaks). 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport (14-6), who has 80 strikeouts and a 0.79 ERA in 115 2/3 innings, did 
not allow a run in four appearances -- including three complete games -- in the 
Southern California tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney (14-3) has given up only 62 hits in 121 innings and has 77 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Jessica Ziese leads the Raiders with a .347 average and 20 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who finished third in the national tournament last year, are 
making their fourth consecutive appearance. Holt hopes the fourth is a charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 74 teams in the tournament, anything can happen," he said. "If you get a 
good draw and don't have to play some hot team right off the bat, who knows. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take a bow: Need proof that this region produces a surplus of softball talent? 
Consider: Five of the 12 women on the 1994 Women's College World Series 
all-tournament team played at area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's Amy Chellevold (first base) and Jenny Dalton (second base) played at 
Thousand Oaks and Glendale. UCLA walk-on Ginny Mike played for Camarillo. And 
Cal State Northridge outfielders Jen Fleming and Beth Calcante played for El 
Camino Real and Newbury Park.

BOWLING / DANA HADDAD; GRANT CLASSIC STILL ALLURING AT THE AGE OF 42 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The odds in favor of hitting the big prize are a little long. In fact, they 
were 1,709-to-1 last year. But the prospects are still very tempting for an 
amateur bowler. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay $70 to enter. Bowl eight games. Winner collects $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why the Grant Classic has thrived in the Valley for 42 
consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dollar for dollar, it's the best deal in town," said Harry Grant, who started 
this tournament for men and women, scratch and handicap players in 1953 and 
continues to run it at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
 It is by far the most-popular tournament in the area, thriving despite having 
moved seven times and having survived the closure of three facilities -- 
Victory Bowl, Encino Bowl and, most recently, Brunswick Granada Lanes, which 
was destroyed in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With Grant and his tournament rendered homeless, AMF Bowling, Inc., stepped 
forward with a three-year contract and moved the tournament to Rocket Bowl in 
Chatsworth. The 1994 Grant Classic kicked off July 1 and will continue each 
weekend and on holidays until Dec. 11. A bowler can enter at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 players (roughly one in eight) won prizes of $25 or more last 
year. Five scratch division winners took home $1,600 last year, including Billy 
Bumacop of Oxnard, who had an eight-game total of 1,610 in Class D, 165 
average-and-under. 
</P>
<P>
 The big cash went to the top three scorers in the handicap division: $17,500 
divided three ways. Dennis Bowman of Los Angeles hit the $10,000 jackpot (he 
actually pocketed $10,450 after winning some bonus prizes) with a 1,926 series. 
He produced games of 238, 267, 241, 216, 214, 215, 184 and 247. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman's success should provide incentive for any good league bowler. He 
carries a 190 average and doesn't play many tournaments. His scratch score was 
1,822. His 104 handicap put him over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of handicap, Bowman, 24, is only one pin better than the venerable 
Grant, who carries a 189 average. But Grant has never bowled in his own 
tournament, nor have any employees of the center at which it was staged. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 100 bowlers came from San Diego to play the Grant Classic last 
year, 80 from San Francisco and 60 from Las Vegas. Yet bowling in Southern 
California is not nearly as popular as it is back East or in the Midwest 
because, said Grant, "There's too much action here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Grant Classic has nonetheless secured a position as one of the 
longest-running bowling events in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the oldest on the West Coast," Grant said. "I would venture to say the 
Peterson Classic in Chicago, which is 75 years old, and the Hoinke Classic in 
Cincinnati are the only ones older. The Hoinke is about 52 years old. I bowled 
in it. That house in one year will run easily 40,000 to 60,000 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you throw a pebble in Cincinnati, you'll hit a thousand bowlers. Out 
here, you'll hit 10. We're miles from everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 A core of local bowlers each year enter the Grant Classic as squad leaders. 
They recruit sometimes as many as 100 players for their squads. For 30 years, 
Felix Mejewski of Hollywood has received bonus cash for being a squad leader.  
</P>
<P>
 Grant jokes about how Mejewski will never win his tournament because he's not 
good enough -- and he doesn't need the bonus money, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mejewski) won the lottery three years ago," Grant said. "Six million. We 
tell him this ain't the lottery." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Matador to reopen: Matador Lanes, one of four Valley area centers owned and 
operated by the Brunswick Corp., is being rebuilt. It was one of three 
Brunswick houses damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will have a completely different look, it'll be completely redesigned," 
said Warren Flanigan, Brunswick regional vice president. "It'll be a 
state-of-the art place for a small bowling center. We've made quite an 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan said Matador will have 28 lanes, four more than before, new color 
automatic scoring machines, bumper bowling for young children and a play area 
for toddlers resembling those at McDonald's restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will cost an estimated $2.5 million, but Flanigan plans to have 
the center up and running on Oct. 1, which is about three weeks after the start 
of fall leagues. Before the earthquake, Matador featured more than 25 leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan said Brunswick will not reopen its Granada Lanes, in part, because 
its lease expires at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves three Brunswick centers still running. Flanigan said his company 
has not been successful in finding a location to replace Granada Lanes. The 
space is either too expensive or the property owner doesn't want bowling. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Hobo is No. 1: Hobo Boothe of Canoga Park currently leads the PBA Senior Tour 
in earnings at $42,323, most of it coming when he won the $225,000 American 
Bowling Congress Senior Masters tournament in Greenacres, Fla. March 30. It was 
his first title.

 Curbs Sought on Redwood Logging: Mendocino County supervisors approved tough 
curbs on annual tree harvests.State approval is pending on the action by the 
county, home to half of California's redwood trees. Under the rules, timber 
companies owning at least 5,000 acres would be prohibited from cutting more 
than 2% of the trees on their land each year. Logging in areas supporting Coho 
salmon spawning streams also would be restricted. Rapidly shrinking timber on 
Mendocino County's 1.3 million acres of forest land was a driving force behind 
the logging limit, said Hans Burkhardt, a botanist who did a study for the 
county.

FINANCIAL MARKETS: DOLLAR RALLIES AGAINST YEN; STOCKS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar soared above the psychologically important 100 level against the 
Japanese yen for the first time in a month on growing expectations of a 
breakthrough in trade negotiations between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks, meanwhile, got a boost from falling bond yields, which benefited from 
the dollar's rally. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Japanese negotiators were scheduled to meet today for talks, ahead of 
the July 31 deadline Washington set for deciding whether to take steps toward 
trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a suspicion in the market that there will potentially be an 
agreement before the deadline," said Peter Gloyne, vice president and manager 
of institutional trading at First National Bank of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A trade accord would help the dollar, which has suffered because of widespread 
belief that a cheaper U.S. currency would be the sole means of reducing the 
huge U.S.-Japan trade gap should other methods fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency dealers also attributed the dollar's new strength to technical 
factors in an otherwise thin market. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar rose to 100.10 yen, up from 98.55 yen on Wednesday. It 
was the dollar's first close above the 100-yen mark since June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also finished stronger against the German mark than it did 
Wednesday, closing at 1.591 marks, up from 1.574. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average finished higher, although a 
strong rally faded near the end of the session as investors became nervous 
about today's release of gross domestic product data. The Dow closed up 10.36 
points at 3,730.83, having pared a 21-point gain posted earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues edged out decliners by 1,073 to 1,003 
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 246.56 million shares changing hands, down 
from 251.76 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are pretty much sitting on their hands waiting to see if the GDP 
number is at the blowout end of the range," said James Volk, head of equity 
trading at Jensen Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists had been predicting a 3.8% increase in the nation's second-quarter 
GDP, but Bob Walberg, a stock analyst at MMS International in Chicago, said 
some now fear it could be more than 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are afraid that if the numbers exceed expectations, that will lead 
Federal Reserve to tighten" interest rates, Walberg said. Investors fear higher 
rates could choke off the economic recovery and jeopardize corporate earnings 
for the third and fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks dipped at the open after the Labor Department said new unemployment 
claims for last week fell 59,000. Most economists had expected a more modest 
decline of 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But that data, which showed that the economy is unexpectedly robust, did not 
faze the bond market, where the rallying greenback helped Treasurys recover 
after a weak start. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond yield finished the day at 7.55%, down from the previous 
session's 7.61%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 9/16 
point, or $5.63 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's strength was seen as positive for bonds because a stronger U.S. 
currency tends to help keep inflation pressures in check. In addition, foreign 
investors are more likely to buy dollar-denominated investments such as 
Treasury bonds in a rising-dollar environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also lending a degree of support to the fixed-income market was a report by 
the Conference Board that help-wanted advertising fell in June, apparently an 
indication that employment was not as strong as indicated by the Labor 
Department report. 
</P>
<P>
 The advance in Treasury prices, in turn, set off a rush to buy bonds from 
speculators who had placed bets on a further decline in bond prices. These 
traders, called short sellers, had borrowed bonds early Thursday and then sold 
them immediately, hoping their value would decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing was up 1 1/8 at 52 1/2. The company had 
reported record second-quarter profits on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors record $1.9 billion second-quarter profits beat analysts' 
forecasts. Its shares rose 3/8 to 50 1/4. Ford Motor Co., which reported solid 
earnings Wednesday, gained 5/8 to 31. Chrysler edged up 1/4 to 47 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., which posted disappointing second quarter profits 
Wednesday, dropped 3 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * LDDS Communications gained 1/4 to 19 on a report that it was close to 
acquiring the Williams Cos. WilTel long-distance telephone business for $2.5 
billion. Williams Cos., whose stock was up 1 5/8 to 32 7/8, declined comment on 
the report.

DON'T WRITE CHATTERTON'S FINALE YET; LANDMARKS: THE BOOKSTORE MAY HAVE FALLEN 
ON HARD TIMES, BUT FANS AND EMPLOYEES REFUSE TO GIVE UP. 
</P>

<P>
 At its zenith, it was dubbed many things: City Lights South, Papa Bach East. 
As alternative bookstores go, a veritable shower of supreme bohemian accolades. 
But of late, Chatterton's Bookstore in Los Feliz rests precariously on its 
hard-earned laurels, cushioned only by its memories. Loyal customers have been 
polite enough to ignore the empty shelves, the scaled-down staff, the quiet 
deterioration. Community commentary is often succinct, rhetorical: "Seen 
Chatterton's lately?" a waif in granny dress and monkey boots asks her 
dreadlocked lunch date over a pot of jasmine tea at the neighboring Onyx cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 In a neighborhood that in the early- to mid-'80s threatened to metamorphose 
into a scaled-down, west-of-the-Mississippi version of Greenwich Village -- a 
string of cafes, restaurants, flower shops, a live theater space and movie 
house -- Chatterton's Bookstore sat at its heart. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a jam-packed treasure trove on the northern stretch of Vermont Avenue 
at the foot of the Los Feliz hills, brimming with everything from hard-to-find 
Zen volumes and little-house presses to underground self-published pre-'zines. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last decade it began to take that hairpin turn many independents 
have had to negotiate. Stock began to slim around the middle. A receding 
magazine rack, vanished bookcases and grimy floors began to show for the world 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Persistent signs of life suggested otherwise. From 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. familiar 
faces still offered spirited repartee from behind the counter just as they had 
for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest blow to Chatterton's was the passing last Saturday of its 
founder-owner, William Koki Iwamoto, after a long battle with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to start an alternative bookstore like Papa Bach (a now long 
defunct Westside bookstore and gathering place founded by John Harris). He felt 
we needed one over here," says a longtime clerk who wished to remain anonymous. 
"He wanted to make it more than a retail venture. He wanted it to be a 
community thing. For a while we had live music here, readings. Coffee and tea. 
There were always lots of people. It really was a part of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 And that it still is. But now with that stretch of Vermont in the throes of 
its own transition of sorts, Chatterton's serves the community in a different 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, visitations begin early. A longtime customer drifts in, 
asks for the time and place of Iwamoto's memorial service, then requests a 
piece of string -- for one of the homeless men outside. "He's having a time 
keeping his pants up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another transient wanders in, picks up a free newspaper and then doubles back 
to reveal his true purpose: a request for the keys to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Other customers slip inside to browse the spare shelves. A woman, 
runway-model-tall, in a blue sun dress and blue lace-up sneaks, asks for "L.A. 
411." None in stock, the clerk politely informs her, but suggests another shop 
where she might explore, including precise directions. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while the phone rings incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a testament to the Chatterton's staff, many customers and locals agree, 
that the store has survived this long. As one independent bookseller after 
another has taken a fall -- victims of a plummeting economy, superstores such 
as Crown, Bookstar and Barnes & Noble or just plain fatigue -- Chatterton's 
valiantly pushes on, has brave designs on going the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who frequented the store in its scenester heyday, it is mere slip of 
its younger, uber-hip incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Ginsberg once rested his black Danish school bag on these floors, before 
signing copies of collections of poetry and, later, photographs. Other literary 
luminaries in for a signing or a reading or out on a browse: Hubert Selby Jr., 
Diane DiPrima, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Richard Price, John Rechy, Anais Nin. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well I don't think Anais Nin actually came in," says Elizabeth Berlot, a 
20-year-plus customer who ritually stops in to pass some time, visit with 
friends. "She was too old at that time, sort of frail." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I heard she came in sometimes," the clerk says. It's an old argument 
gathering steam once more. Just like the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that nurtures many distractions, it's a miracle anything survives. 
Through the cruel whims of economy and nature (the store was flooded during a 
freak summer storm a few years ago), Chatterton's clientele has remained loyal 
for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: a selection that caters to customers' wide-ranging tastes -- 
university presses, self-published self-help or poetry, alternative magazines. 
But, admits a staffer, "The last couple years have been real slow. I'm sure the 
chains did have some impact. The (Los Feliz) theater closed for a year. That 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 And the renaissance that was to remake this neighborhood, complete with a 
string of interested merchants cruising the Avenue, architectural visions? 
Well, the merchant says, "The economy. That took care of that." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were known as Chatterton's West in the old, old days," says Margie Ghiz, 
owner of Santa Monica's Midnight Special Bookstore. "Chatterton's was an 
amazing store. In the '70s, maybe, I went in for an event put on by a gay 
political group. I knew very little about that section of society at the time 
and that was very enlightening. I was very proud of Chatterton's for doing it. 
It opened my mind to a lot of things. For any bookstore to give that to someone 
. . . they've accomplished a great thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the family is working to keep the store alive, "In the spirit of 
his love for literature," says Iwamoto's companion of 6 1/2 years, Jack 
Englebrecht. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons the store started to deteriorate was that Koki was so 
sick," he explains. "He tried to do what he could to revive it. He tried to 
keep an active part working there. And when he didn't have the energy, he would 
keep in contact over the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 But the last three years were hard on Iwamoto as well as his staff, 
Englebrecht says: "They could have left a long time ago, but they continued 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Iwamoto was born in 1947 in Chicago. At 7, he moved to Los Angeles with his 
family. They settled in the Los Feliz-Silver Lake area, and he attended high 
school at John Marshall -- not five minutes from where he would later open 
Chatterton's. 
</P>
<P>
 A love of literature catapulted him into the book business, and after 
graduating from UCLA, he took a part-time job at Papa Bach Bookstore in West 
L.A. Stitching together funds and support from friends, he dreamed of becoming 
the proprietor of his own space. Chatterton's opened in the early '70s, 
Iwamoto's present to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose the name from the poet Thomas Chatterton -- not because he was 
particularly fond of his poetry but because of his tragic end: The distraught 
scribe drank arsenic after receiving a rejection. No sentiment beyond that. 
Just a good name for a commercial bookstore, friends maintain. Recalls one 
clerk with a laugh: "He would sometimes fly into a rage if someone asked for 
'Mr. Chatterton.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he felt pride. He had really done what he set out to do -- providing 
a much-needed literary service. He never really asked for very much in return," 
Englebrecht says, "and his passion for making quality literature and 
information about Zen Buddhism available was important to him." 
</P>
<P>
 But for all walks of life, Englebrecht stresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not just high-brow, but poetry, children's books, and for people -- like me 
-- looking for Jackie Collins. He was such a renaissance man. He had a passion 
for good conversation, good food, for making sure that everyone who was around 
was comfortable . . . and well fed." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for William Koki Iwamoto will be held Saturday at 10:30 a . 
m . at the Shuji Soto Mission , 123 S. Hewitt Street.

BONES OF CONTENTION; IT HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A WESTERN: A RANCHER, A 
BIG-CITY INTERLOPER AND A RANGE WAR. BUT THIS SKIRMISH OVER EVOLUTION DOESN'T 
STAR CATTLE. IT'S OVER DINOSAURS.

<P>
 Here's an idea for a dinosaur movie: 
</P>
<P>
 A big-city paleontologist discovers dinosaur bones on a Wyoming ranch. Maybe 
millions of bones, adding up to a herd of perhaps 8,000 giant duckbill 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, there's a catch. The duckbill graveyard is on land owned by a 
Christian cowboy so opposed to evolution he won't even let anyone lecture about 
it on his ranch. Despite their differences, the scientist and the rancher 
become friends. Both are fascinated by the fossils and both want to build an 
educational field station. But neither will budge on how life began. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientist won't be a party to teaching creationism; the rancher threatens 
to turn the whole dig over to a "creation paleontologist." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a high-plains version of "Inherit the Wind." In the Wyoming version, 
no one is threatened with jail over evolution, but the future of a major 
scientific discovery is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet paleontologist Kraig Derstler and rancher Glenn Hanson, the ontological 
odd couple who are living the movie in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler discovered the Dragon's Grave bone bed on Hanson's ranch last summer. 
But if the two men can't agree on a lease for the site by Aug. 12, Derstler 
might lose the right to dig the bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler, 40, is a professor of paleontology at the University of New Orleans. 
His prematurely gray hair gives him the distinguished, academic look you'd want 
for the movie. On a dig he favors blue jeans, running shoes, T-shirts and a 
blue bandanna. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, 77, has lived all his life on the ranch his father homesteaded in 
1908. His jeans aren't as faded as Derstler's, but his belt buckle is much 
bigger. At 6 feet, 2 inches tall and 180 pounds, wearing a beat-up cowboy hat 
and battered cowboy boots, Hanson is right out of Central Casting too.  
</P>
<P>
 The cowboy and the scientist met in 1990, when Derstler began exploring the 
Lance Formation in eastern Wyoming. The Lance is a crescent-shaped sandstone 
outcropping, one of the most fertile dinosaur fields on Earth. It runs 100 
miles from Lance Creek in the south to the Montana border in the north and is 
20 miles across at its widest point.  
</P>
<P>
 Paleontologists first found bones here in 1888 (the Triceratops horridus is 
the most common Lance specimen), but in 1900, just two miles southeast of the 
Hanson ranch, Barnum Brown discovered the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex 
skeleton. It is still on display in the British Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanson ranch is smack-dab in the middle of the Lance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister and I used to gallop around these hills and see these bones 
everywhere," Hanson says, although he admits he was more interested in the 
buffalo skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Hanson led Derstler to a rugged system of gullies that Derstler 
would later name Dragon's Grave. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just tons of bones on the surface," Derstler says. "That means 
there's hundreds of thousands beneath the surface, and more likely millions." 
Most of the bones belong to one species, the three-ton, plant-eating 
Edmontosaurus annectens , commonly known as the duckbill dinosaur. By 
Derstler's conservative estimate, the remains of 300 duckbills lie buried here. 
His reasonable estimate is 3,000. His liberal estimate is 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler says it will take a decade to excavate this site. He wants to set up 
a field station to support a long-term dig and to teach paleontology. Some 
bones would be displayed at the site. Others would go to a Wyoming museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But first he needs a lease from Hanson. That's a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Hanson flat does not believe in evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think God created everything," he says. "You look at the flowers, the 
grass, the sun coming up every day. I just do not believe all that happens by 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of "all that" happens here. The 8,000-acre Hanson place is in big 
country, right out of a John Ford Western. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Hills of South Dakota loom on the eastern horizon, 35 miles away. On 
a clear day, you can see the Laramie Mountains 50 miles south. Prairie dogs, 
horned toads, rattlesnakes, deer, antelope, coyotes, foxes and golden eagles 
live here. Hanson's father cleared out the last den of gray wolves in 1913, but 
mountain lions are making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 A newcomer might call the ranch desolate, with its sagebrush, prickly pear 
cactus and barren gullies. Hanson would disagree. He says the native grasses 
are rich in protein: "It's almost like feed grain." And the Cheyenne River, 
which runs through the ranch, provides bottomland for hay. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch offers history lessons too. There are remains of tepee rings and a 
homesteader's dugout. Hanson collects Native American artifacts, and an 
archeologist told him one of his lance points was 8,000 years old. Hanson 
believes it, although some creationists put the age of Earth at 6,000 years. 
"This Bible's been translated from several languages, so there's room for 
error," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But not much error. Hanson refuses to believe dinosaurs are millions of years 
old. He thinks man and duckbill coexisted only thousands of years ago. "I 
absolutely do," he says. "They all went together." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson is an odd sort of creationist. For example, he has never been a regular 
church-goer. The nearest town, Newcastle, Wyo., is 40 miles north. When he was 
a boy, that meant a six-hour ride on horseback. "Five, if you didn't think too 
much of your horse." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he never worried much about creation or evolution. He was too busy 
breaking horses for $5 a head. "When I started getting $10 a head, boy, I was 
in the money." He married his wife, Phyllis, in 1939, and they raised five 
kids. Today, a daughter runs the ranch, but Hanson helps. 
</P>
<P>
 He also reads the Bible and creationist literature, which claims, among other 
things, that human footprints have been found next to those of dinosaurs and 
that Charles Darwin recanted evolution on his deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start out to be a creationist, but I'm getting to be one more and 
more," Hanson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Paleontologists who visited his ranch in the late 1940s told him the dinosaurs 
were 250 million years old. "Now they are saying 65 million years. They got 
quite a bit younger in the last 45 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson thinks the dinosaurs will continue to get younger. "Ever since Darwin, 
they've been trying to dig up evidence that one kind of animal has changed into 
another kind, and they haven't done it yet. I think Kraig will admit that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler will not admit that. He says there is plenty of evidence for 
evolution, ranging from relationships in the fossil records to observations of 
live animals. 
</P>
<P>
 He also points out that ages of dinosaurs have been established by radiometric 
dating, fission-track dating and thermoluminescence, all of which produce a 
similar conclusion: The dinosaurs disappeared about 65 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hanson, Derstler is fascinated by the natural world. His home in New 
Orleans is a menagerie. Derstler's wife, Debbie Pearson, is the education 
director of the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, and she has permits to keep wild 
animals, including a coyote, a Harris hawk and "tons of snakes, frogs and 
turtles." 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler also shares Hanson's interest in buffalo. He wants to reconstruct 
duckbill dinosaur skeletons near a live buffalo herd to show similarities in 
bone structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler grew up on the edge of Pennsylvania's Amish country, but he doesn't 
belong to an organized religion. He is more likely to read the Tao Te Ching 
than the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find in both of them great beauty and wisdom, but I don't find the truth in 
either one," he says. He regards their stories as "illuminating myths," not 
factual accounts. Derstler's worldview: "It's a big, beautiful, glorious world 
that happened by chance." But that's his opinion. For facts, he turns to 
Dragon's Grave, the ideal dinosaur-dig movie set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dragon's Grave is dominated by five major ridges separated by deep gulches. 
Derstler's crew is digging on Ridge 2-C, which offers a view of the Hanson 
house two miles to the south, the Cheyenne River beyond that and a ridge 15 
miles distant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ranchers around here call this 'rough country,' " Derstler says. In fact, the 
bone crew had to camp half a mile away. They haul most of their equipment in on 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lance Formation sandstone is so soft you can carve your initials in it 
with a dull knife, which makes it perfect for digging fossils. The crew had 
found more than 200 bones by mid-July, including a large duckbill jawbone. But 
Derstler says the eggshell fragments they found and the tiny jawbone from a 
baby duckbill are even more exciting. Some experts think that duckbills hatched 
their young on higher ground, near Canada, then moved into the swampy coastline 
that later became the Hanson place. The egg and the baby's jaw could change 
that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson would throw out the entire theory. He insists creationism is science 
and evolution is wrong. A field station on his ranch would have to represent 
that view, which Derstler cannot abide. 
</P>
<P>
 After an evening discussion recently, both men were pessimistic about the 
future of Dragon's Grave. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't come to a better understanding, I don't think it's going to go," 
Hanson says. "He just said, 'Science isn't based on truths, it's based on 
theories.' " To Hanson, that is paramount to saying evolution is hogwash. 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler says Hanson misunderstood him. "Truth is something that requires a 
God's-eye view of the world, and scientists don't have access to that at all." 
Instead, scientists start with facts and work toward theories. If new facts 
don't match the old theory, they get a new theory. Derstler says creationists 
depart from science because they start with a theory and look for facts to fit 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson won't debate the fine points of creationism. "I'm just a plain old 
cowpoke. That's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But he was disturbed when a group of children visited the site last year. 
"When I saw all those little kids up there, so interested, I just didn't think 
we should teach them wrong." What would be right? "There are creation 
paleontologists who are willing to come in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Derstler says if Hanson brings in "creation paleontologists," real science 
will suffer. Derstler says his own research will be set back three or four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer's dig ends Aug. 12. The two men agreed on that as a deadline to 
settle the future of Dragon's Grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Both insist that they will remain friends, no matter what happens. They have 
come to respect each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson was grateful when the bone crew dropped everything to help put out a 
prairie fire. For his part, Hanson has been a gracious, generous host. His home 
is a message center for the bone crew. And Phyllis Hanson frequently sends 
goodies -- biscuits and home-canned peaches -- to the paleontologists' isolated 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hansons are wonderful people," Derstler says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do get along most of the day," Hanson says. "But watch out in the 
evenings. We're dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But neither man is likely to violate the admonition from Proverbs: 
</P>
<P>
 "He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind," which is where the 
movie might have problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Tracy and Fredric March dueled in a hot Tennessee courtroom over the 
evolution of species. Wyoming is plenty hot in summer, but Hanson owns the land 
and the fossils free and clear. There will be no dramatic courtroom finish here 
-- only silence should the digging stop at Dragon's Grave, where seldom is 
heard an evolutionary word. Edmontosaurus annectens 
</P>
<P>
 * Alias: Duckbill dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weight: Three tons or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Length: Thirty to 40 feet, head to tail. 
</P>
<P>
 * Height: Ten feet or more at the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dining Habits: Plants (remains of conifers have been found in a stomach). 
</P>
<P>
 * Where They Roamed: Lowland woods, bogs and marshes of the Western United 
States.

AROUND TOWN: LONG WAY TO COME TO JUDGE L.A. LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 16 judges took their places at a horseshoe-shaped table in the boardroom 
of the State Bar Assn.'s Downtown offices. They had come to learn about L.A. 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 They listened intently as a public defender, a deputy district attorney and a 
Superior Court judge explained such basic concepts as presumption of innocence, 
plea bargaining and right of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were invited to ask questions. Surely, they would be eager for more 
details about the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. who ? Never heard of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Menendez brothers? Never heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney King? They did see something about him on TV, but details were foggy. 
"It seemed like it was a big case in L.A.," said Judge Wu Hong Qi. 
</P>
<P>
 These judges weren't from Mars. They were from rural China. 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation of 16 from Sichuan, a province of 100 million people in 
southwestern China, spent a week here at the invitation of the Southern 
California Chinese Lawyers Assn. before going on to Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 They observed a criminal trial and, reported Chinese American attorney Wendy 
Huang, a SCCLA board member, were "intrigued about the jury system. There is no 
jury system in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't really understand that you can distinguish between the legal and 
factual issues in a case" and find it "kind of preposterous" that 12 citizens 
with no legal training make life-or-death decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Huang added, they were astounded at the size and formality of the courts. 
In Sichuan Province, she said, a case would typically be heard by a judge in a 
small office, with a few chairs pulled up around a table. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorted by Ken Fang, an L.A. County deputy public defender, the Chinese 
judges also toured County Jail, where they were a bit of a curiosity to inmates 
filing past on their way to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese found the facility "very clean" but were intimidated by its size 
(6,100 average daily population). In China, said Judge Wu, the delegation head, 
an accused goes to jail only after sentencing and, until then, is held in 
another facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they asked why so many inmates were African American. They were told 
many of these men could afford neither attorneys nor bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Scott Dillon, escorting them through the jail, told them how 
trustees "save the county a lot of money" by doing such chores as cooking and 
sweeping. "You don't pay them?" the visitors asked. No, Dillon said, their 
rewards are keeping busy and earning added privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 During the session at the state bar offices, the visitors asked Fang, the 
public defender, if his law firm worked for the government. He explained that 
he is a county employee, paid by the taxpayers. They understood; China, too, 
has a government-funded public defender system. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea of capital punishment as a state-by-state option was new to them. 
In China, it is universal. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a warm welcome for Superior Court Judge Rose Hom, who apologized for 
not being able to address the judges in Southern Mandarin. She left China as an 
infant and has long since lost the language. 
</P>
<P>
 (All of the visiting judges were male, although there are some women judges in 
China.) 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in an interview, the visitors were asked whether justice can be 
"bought" in China. They were astounded when told that a wealthy defendant might 
spend hundreds of thousands on attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In China, they explained, attorneys don't make those big bucks; they talk 
about fees in the hundreds of dollars, not the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the matter of President Clinton -- the sexual harassment lawsuit 
pending against a head of state, the notion of a public defense fund for him -- 
did that seem bizarre to them? 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Wu and the others just laughed. In China, he said, "That would never 
happen." Don't Leave, They're Only Killer Bees 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz: The first swarm of "killer bees" detected in L.A. County arrived 
this month, stowaways on a Dutch cargo ship en route from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 The bees went belly-up after a 90-minute spray bath, and traps were set to 
snare any escapees. 
</P>
<P>
 But, we've been told, more are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The bees are, in reality, Africanized honeybees, descendants of a core group 
imported in the '50s from Africa to Brazil, where they got loose during a 
breeding experiment. Now they're in Arizona, poised to swarm into California as 
early as Fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic time? Or simply the stuff of tabloid headlines? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither, beekeeper David Lofgren, an L.A. County Aboretum horticulturist, told 
a group of the curious and/or apprehensive at a gathering at the arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks more danger lurks in "crossing the street." 
</P>
<P>
 But it pays to be bee-wise. First, let's dispel a myth or two: 
</P>
<P>
 The killer bee is not as big as a bat. It's slightly smaller than an ordinary 
honeybee and its venom is no more lethal. But killer bees breed prolifically 
and, when colonies get crowded, swarm in search of new digs. 
</P>
<P>
 This bee does not go about willy-nilly dive bombing defenseless humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Lofgren said, "They're pretty footloose, and they're very aggressive." 
Threaten their hive and they'll pursue you for half a mile, then "keep 
attacking for maybe a couple of hours" and be aroused and defensive for up to 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
 A killer bee colony posts 30 to 40 guards to pick up vibrations -- from a 
power mower, maybe, or kids playing ball -- and signal the colony to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 If attacked, Lofgren advised: 
</P>
<P>
 Run like crazy, zigzagging. Pull your shirt over your head. Find an enclosure. 
Don't dive into your pool: "If you come back up, they're going to nail you." 
</P>
<P>
 Remove stingers with a dull knife or the edge of a credit card, not by 
tweezing, which will release the poison into you. A healthy person can survive 
up to 1,000 stings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now's the time to bee-proof your house -- trim hedges, cover the woodpile with 
heavy plastic, toss old tires, cover under-eave openings and crawl spaces with 
1/8-inch screening, caulk all holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bees don't like nectarless or nectar-stingy flowers such as petunias, roses, 
hollyhocks, snapdragons and impatiens. Or anything red, Lofgren said: "Bees are 
colorblind and red looks to them like black." 
</P>
<P>
 What are your chances of being stung? "Remote," he said. And, if it's any 
consolation, even killer bees sting and die.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; SHOCKING NEWS ABOUT SEATS, TIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Almost every time I get out of my new Ford Taurus, I get walloped 
with an electrical shock. It doesn't happen every day, but on most days as soon 
as I touch the outside of the door I get zapped. I asked my mechanic what 
caused this and he didn't know. He checked out the electrical system and it was 
fine. He told me the tires could be at fault. What causes these shocks? 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The shock comes from static electricity, which is created in a number 
of ways. The problem occurs when your body has an opposite charge from the car 
or the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The static charges are known to occur in at least two ways, from the car tires 
or the seat fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 The polyester and other synthetic fabrics on seats, when rubbed by your 
clothing, can create a static charge. The charge increases depending on the 
fabric types and builds up as you slide across the seat when you are entering 
and exiting. (Cars with leather seats rarely cause these types of shocks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Often, this charge exists between you and the car's frame. So, you get shocked 
any time you touch metal that is ground to the frame -- which would include 
most of the metal in the car -- either inside or outside the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Tires have long been blamed for static shocks, though tire manufacturers 
denied their tires contributed to or caused the problem. In the past, the tire 
makers were right, but recent technical changes to tires may renew concern that 
tires can cause static buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 As a car moves through the air, it will build up a charge if climatic 
conditions are right, particularly if the relative humidity is low. If static 
builds up faster than the tires can dissipate it, then an electrical charge 
exists between the entire car and the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Tires have traditionally contained carbon black -- in addition to a mix of 
natural and synthetic rubbers -- a form of pure carbon invented in 1912. Carbon 
black, produced by burning natural gas or oil, is used to reinforce and 
strengthen the rubber. The reason tires are black is because of carbon black. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubber is a poor conductor of electricity, but carbon black is a very good 
conductor. So as static electric charges build up, they are dissipated through 
the tires, thanks to the carbon black. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, some foreign tire manufacturers have begun substituting silica 
(the main ingredient in sand) for carbon black. The silica is intended to 
reduce the rolling resistance of the tires. But it also reduces their 
conductivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The shocks caused by this type of static charge usually occur only after a 
driver has put his foot down on the ground and is touching the car. Then, the 
body becomes a conduit for the charge to travel from the car to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there isn't much you can do about the problem, short of changing 
tires, if yours are what are causing your shocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda has acknowledged that its 1994 Accord models caused electrical shocks 
last fall, as the result of Michelin tires. Michelin changed its tire compounds 
earlier this year, which solved the problem, a Honda spokesman said. Honda 
owners may get credit on a case-by-case basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ford uses tires on its Taurus made by every major tire producer, 
including Michelin, though it did not use the same Michelin tire that caused 
the Honda problem. So, it is not clear whether the tire or the seat fabric or 
some other cause is at fault in the Ford's case. 
</P>
<P>
 You ought to contact your Ford factory representative. If the car is under 
warranty, you could say it's not acceptable for the car to cause shocks. You 
might also want to locate and contact the manufacturer of your tires.

THE GOODS; TOXIC DETOX; ARE PAINT OR OTHER CHEMICALS CLUTTERING UP THE PLACE? 
THEN CONSIDER VISITING THE HAZMOBILE TO GET RID OF HOUSEHOLD WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's new HazMobile rolled into Sunland on a recent Thursday and set up 
shop on the Kmart parking lot, ready to accept discards of paint, motor oil, 
pesticides, antifreeze and other toxic substances that lurk in any ordinary 
kitchen, bathroom or garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average American home has about 63 different chemicals in it, from mild 
irritants to nerve gas," says Jackie David, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
City Bureau of Sanitation, which launched the HazMobile program last February. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the makings for a major worry to the Sanitation Bureau, she says. 
Not only are such substances a danger to a household ("One gallon of gas has 
the explosive power of 33 sticks of dynamite," David points out), they are a 
danger to sanitation workers and a threat to the environment if illegally 
dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 To address the problem, Los Angeles, like many other cities, has developed 
various household hazardous waste collection programs, says John Moore, 
assistant project manager for the HazMobile. The new mobile program augments 
the one-day roundups launched in 1989 after a door-to-door collection program 
proved impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 At the roundups, one-day collection events held in various parts of the 
county, residents drive through a collection area and remain in their vehicles 
while trained workers remove the substances from their trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 The roundups have been so popular -- attracting up to 1,000 cars a day -- that 
traffic jams and long waits in line are not uncommon. The county is continuing 
the monthly roundups while the city runs the mobile program, Moore says. 
</P>
<P>
 The HazMobile caravan -- a truck and three trailers -- tours the city on a 
regular schedule stopping for three-day periods at designated sites that are 
announced in advance. The caravan goes to 24 locations and may be used by 
anyone who lives in Los Angeles County. The next stop is the Fairfax District, 
Thursday through Aug. 6 and Aug. 11-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents must call the Hotline, (800) 98 TOXIC, to make an appointment and 
will receive an appointment card for a drive-through, reducing waiting time 
considerably. The ground rules limit amounts that may be transported and list 
materials that will not be accepted, including ammunition, explosives, and 
radioactive and medical waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lee, a city chemist, warns that it's impossible to throw anything toxic 
away because everything goes somewhere. "Even if you rinse a paintbrush -- just 
a little bit -- in the sink, it will show up in the city's water supply," says 
Lee, who works at the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The HazMobile is catching on. Calls have steadily increased since it was 
launched last February, says Peggy Catron, Hotline supervisor. "We're now 
getting about 600 a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do her staffers schedule appointments, they answer questions and 
offer a free comprehensive booklet with information about household toxics and 
lists of nontoxic alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're educating people," Catron says. "When I first started this work, I was 
amazed to learn how many things are hazardous -- such as nail polish and 
makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 The HazMobile collection events are run by Greenfield Environmental, a 
Carlsbad-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do here is set up a temporary waste processing facility," says 
Greenfield's Frank Sanchez. His staff has spread plastic sheeting over the 
ground and lined up rows of tables with plastic bins and dozens of barrels to 
receive household waste. A windsock flutters nearby to determine wind direction 
in case of a spill.  
</P>
<P>
 The Greenfield staff -- in industrial protective suits, steel-toed boots, 
gloves and goggles -- looks ready for germ warfare. As each driver pulls up and 
presents an appointment card, a Greenfield worker removes the toxic load to the 
appropriate container. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenfield Environmental identifies eight main household hazard categories, 
broken down into 23 sub-categories. 
</P>
<P>
 "See the blue bottle? Old windshield cleaner," Sanchez says. If your dog or 
cat drank it, it would be poisoned. The same with antifreeze, which pets like 
it because it tastes sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things are really bad -- pool acid and pool chlorine, for 
example. Also drain cleaners and toilet bowl cleaners can really cause you 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some substances change over time as the liquid evaporates, he says. Others can 
be lethal in combination. "If you mix chlorine bleach and ammonia, you'll 
generate poisonous chlorine gas. Mix brake fluid and pool chemicals, and 
they'll ignite." 
</P>
<P>
 Although paint and used motor oil comprise the largest volume of waste 
collected, there are also unusual offerings, Moore says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten 1920s-vintage nitrate movie film that was so flammable we had to 
call the bomb squad. We've had the cremated remains of a family pet. And the 
garages of amateur chemists are always interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although some people tend to be overly cautious -- one resident called the 
Hotline to inquire if he should bring in cooking oil -- others are extremely 
careless. The staff still talks about the man who drove from Orange County with 
his family in a van so packed with chemicals a moderate bump could have caused 
a toxic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, David of the Bureau of Sanitation says, householders are unruffled 
about having a supply of assorted poisons under the kitchen sink. "Usually they 
don't think about it until they clean out the garage, or remodel the house, or 
when they move. Then they have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the situation of Tom Shishido of Sun Valley, who drives up to the 
collection area with a trunkload of lawn-care pesticides. "I'm moving and I 
don't want to take them with me," he says. "I didn't know what to do with the 
stuff -- this really solves my problem." 
</P>
<P>
 By closing time on Saturday, the Sunland collection event reports that in 
three days, 362 cars have delivered 38,606 pounds of chemicals, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * 650 gallons of motor oil; 
</P>
<P>
 * 58 auto batteries; 
</P>
<P>
 * 150 gallons of antifreeze; 
</P>
<P>
 * 339 gallons of latex paint. 
</P>
<P>
 All this can be recycled. Another 129 drums of other materials will either be 
used for supplemental fuel or will undergo destructive incineration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that sounds like a good haul, the HazMobile is just scratching the 
surface in getting citizens to turn in their toxics, Moore says. "The Bureau of 
Sanitation collects from 720,000 Los Angeles households, and last year about 
15,000 households participated in hazardous household waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still preaching to the choir."

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; WILL A LAWYER-FREE WILL COMPUTE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of it as the final program. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "WillMaker 5" and while there are plenty of shoot-'em-up software game 
programs that simulate death, this one deals with the real thing. "WillMaker" 
allows you to make, in the comfort of your own home and without the expense of 
a lawyer, a legal will for the distribution of your belongings after you go off 
to the big hard disk in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest version of "WillMaker" -- available for about $40 in separate DOS, 
Windows and Macintosh versions -- also allows you to make a "Living Will" to 
specify the extent of medical life-prolonging procedures to be undertaken if 
you are no longer capable of communicating your wishes. And it gives you the 
option of filling out a "Final Arrangements" document to state your preferences 
concerning burial, cremation and whether you want any kind of funeral ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 These are heady matters to be trusted unto you and your computer, but 
"WillMaker" comes with an impressive pedigree. It's a product of the 
Berkeley-based Nolo Press, which has been publishing highly regarded 
do-it-yourself legal texts since 1971 when it debuted with a "How to Do Your 
Own Divorce" book that became a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 And who were the creators of "WillMaker?" 
</P>
<P>
 One is described in the preface to the 277-page book that comes with the 
program as being a yoga teacher, spinner and shepherdess who lives in a place 
called Enchanted Rabbit Mountain. Don't worry, she's the illustrator who did 
the drawings for the book (and did a nice job, too). The authors of the program 
are two lawyers who have been involved in several other self-help legal 
products, and a writer who is also president of the Bay Area Funeral Society (I 
guess that's not a conflict of interest, but it gave me pause). 
</P>
<P>
 The book and the software program, both of which are thankfully free of 
impenetrable legal jargon, make it clear that "WillMaker" cannot be used for 
every situation. If you have a huge estate and want to embark on complex 
tax-saving measures, you will probably need a lawyer and/or a financial 
planner. Also, with this program, you can't make conditional bequests such as: 
My rare soil-sample collection goes to Uncle Jim, only if he stops smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "WillMaker" does, however, allow you a great deal of flexibility in deciding 
what to do with your estate. You can leave it all to one person or 
organization. On the other end of the scale, you can leave detailed 
instructions for who is to inherit specific items (the program allows for up to 
100 of these specific bequests). Many people will opt for a combination, 
leaving the bulk of the estate to one person or a small group of people, and 
then list a few specific items to go to other individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is valid in all states except Louisiana. In the other states, laws 
on wills do not differ greatly. Users punch in the name of their state to start 
so that the resulting will conforms to its laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book that comes with "WillMaker" is well-written, clearly 
understandable and even interesting to those of us who have not thought much 
about wills, you don't have to read much of it before embarking on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The software guides you through the process by asking a series of questions 
about what you've got to give and where you want it to go. Along the way, it 
alerts you to ways of handling situations to avoid certain taxes or fees. It 
suggests that you name alternative inheritors in case your primary 
beneficiaries do not survive you. 
</P>
<P>
 You are also guided in designating how you want debts owed to or incurred by 
you to be handled. And it provides for the formal naming of an executor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although technically painless, as computer processes go, using "WillMaker" 
certainly stirs much more deep-seated emotion than a round of Tetris. It's just 
you and your computer screen, planning for a time when you will no longer be 
around. The process is daunting and maybe even a little disturbing. Although 
"WillMaker" is unflaggingly encouraging -- "Congratulations! You have now 
finished specifying your wishes for your final arrangements," it cheerfully 
notes at one point -- it's not a bad idea to have a significant other or good 
friend nearby when you do this. Bribe them with the promise you will leave them 
your Elvis key chain or other prized item. 
</P>
<P>
 When you complete the program, it prints out your documents and gives 
directions about how the signing of the forms is to be properly witnessed (it's 
not necessary in all cases to have them notarized). The program also gives you 
information about storing the documents and making alterations as your life 
situation changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only addition to the program I would suggest would be at the very end, 
after all the forms are completed. At that point, I think it would be very cool 
if the program simply announced, "Game Over."

NONTOXIC HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS

 In addition to household hazardous waste collection programs, the Los Angeles 
City Bureau of Sanitation encourages consumers to use safer alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Its "Household Hazardous Waste" brochure lists more than 100 inexpensive 
recipes for garden, paint and household products. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than pesticides, you might foil roaches by placing bay leaves around 
cracks in the room and leaving out dishes of equal parts baking soda and 
powdered sugar. The last resort is a mix of powered sugar and boric acid (a 
poison). For other pests, a soapy water spray can be an insecticide, and a 
shallow pan filled with stale beer will kill snails and slugs. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the family pet, alternatives to toxic flea collars include 
eucalyptus ointment, herbal baths and a pinch of brewer's yeast or Vitamin B 
with dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 Household cleaning alternatives abound. Baking soda can clean a toilet bowl, 
substitute as a scouring powder or clean an oven. Vinegar and water will clean 
glass, and three parts olive oil with one part vinegar make furniture polish. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure also includes safety tips, telephone numbers for information and 
toxic emergencies and disposal options. To request the brochure, send a 
postcard to HHW Hotline, 419 S. Spring St., Suite 800, Los Angeles, Calif.

INK: NIXON WROTE OF HIS OWN ELVIS SIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It turns out Richard M. Nixon's posthumously released "Beyond Peace" (Random 
House) was not his last published word. Eight days before his death in April, 
he wrote a playful letter to Egil (Bud) Krogh for inclusion in "The Day Elvis 
Met Nixon," his former aide's firsthand account of the strange White House 
encounter in 1970 between the King and the Prez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It remains to be seen," Nixon wrote, "whether the author of 'The Day Elvis 
Met Nixon' will be resourceful enough to be able to arrange for Elvis to appear 
at a book-signing." 
</P>
<P>
 Krogh's amusing paperback describes how Elvis Presley requested the meeting in 
a long-winded, hand-scrawled note to Nixon that he handed to a White House 
guard only hours before being ushered into the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be here in Washington for as long as it takes to get the credentials 
of a federal agent," Presley wrote on American Airlines note paper. "I have 
done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing techniques and 
I am right in the middle of the whole thing where I can and will do the most 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, with Krogh looking on, a cape-wearing Presley showed Nixon some of the 
badges he had received from police departments around the country and baffled 
the President by unexpectedly accusing the Beatles of being "anti-American." 
(See the August issue of Los Angeles magazine for an account of the Beatles' 
painfully awkward meeting with Presley at the singer's Bel-Air mansion six 
years earlier.) 
</P>
<P>
 After the White House drop-by, Nixon arranged for Presley to receive a badge 
as a "special assistant" of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. And 
the historic summit remained a secret -- until syndicated columnist Jack 
Anderson broke the story a long 13 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Krogh, who headed the infamous "Plumbers" unit in the Nixon White House and 
served four months in jail for conspiracy, now practices law in Seattle. He 
established Pejama Press, which has printed 15,000 copies of "The Day Elvis Met 
Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Publicity Trek: Like the Rolling Stones and other acts on summer tours 
across the land, mystery writer Walter Mosley has been bouncing from here to 
there. His 22-city trek, reading from "Black Betty" and signing copies of the 
book, has lasted weeks longer than what most novelists ever experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley's long road, which was to end last night with a reading in New York 
City at Central Park's SummerStage, has been greased by sterling reviews for 
his latest caper about Los Angeles private eye Easy Rawlins and by numerous 
welcomes on national radio and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff: After taking root on regional bestseller lists, "Black Betty" 
landed on Publishers Weekly's national list five weeks ago and has since risen 
into the New York Times' top 15. The book's publisher, W.W. Norton & Co., 
reports that the number of copies in print has well exceeded 100,000. In 
addition, reports about the filming of Mosley's first mystery, "Devil in a Blue 
Dress," which will star Denzel Washington, have spurred sales of that book in 
paperback. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a tour like this, you're in a different place every other day and you 
really don't know the people you meet," Mosley said after landing in Seattle on 
Tuesday. "It's a completely alienating experience on one level. On the other 
hand, I just did four readings in Los Angeles and had more than a hundred 
people at each of them, having a good time and talking, so it's really 
wonderful and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Louise Brockett, Norton's director of publicity, "Black Betty" 
has sold well around the country in line with a marketing plan that targeted 
mystery shops, independent bookstores, the chains and black-oriented outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 James Fugate, a co-owner of Esowon Books in Inglewood, says his mostly black 
clientele has responded enthusiastically to Mosley, who did a reading at the 
store last weekend, and other black authors mainly because customers in recent 
years have been able to learn more about these writers from print coverage and 
talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Racks: A further blurring of the line between journalism and celebrity 
puffery can be found in the August issue of In Style, the new Time Inc. 
magazine. None other than Bob Woodward, the Watergate sleuth and author of "The 
Agenda" (Simon & Schuster), helps hype his new book about the Clinton 
Administration by allowing an inquiring reporter, hairstylist and photographer 
to visit him at his weekend home on the Maryland shore. Woodward and his wife, 
Washington Post reporter Elsa Walsh, smooch for the lens, coo their love for 
each other and even share a favorite pasta recipe -- all the while emphasizing 
how important their weekend privacy is.

VOLUNTEERS DIG FOSSIL-FINDING VACATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HARLAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Cassaday, 68, wields a cheap but wicked looking commando knife to scrape 
sandstone from around a bony protuberance on a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has got me mildly excited," says Cassaday, a retired Navy lieutenant 
commander from Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
 Paleontologist Kraig Derstler watches over Cassaday's shoulder. "That's a 
posterior rib for sure," Derstler tells him. "Way posterior." 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, Cassaday has uncovered about 10 inches of brown, shiny bone 
that once belonged to a duckbill dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the nine other volunteers scratching at the ground on this hot July 
afternoon, Cassaday has paid Derstler's nonprofit ExcaVacations $495 to spend a 
week here at Dragon's Grave. (Additional weeks are $95 each.) 
</P>
<P>
 In return, volunteers get meals, a spot on the prairie to pitch their tents 
and the right to dig bones 10 hours a day under the blazing sun. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cassaday, it's a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a marvelous field for a retiree who doesn't need to get paid," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cassaday, an electronics specialist in the Navy, came to dinosaurs late in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to accumulate skills for retirement," he says, so he went to a 
library and looked up professional associations. "When I came to paleontology, 
it rang a bell." 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff? "Being around young people is good for you, physical labor is good 
for you and sleeping outside is good for you. I'm really blessed that they let 
me do this," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Candice Knight feels the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the miracle of my life," says the 47-year-old New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer Knight had both hips replaced to relieve the crippling effects of 
arthritis. All winter she swam laps and lifted weights to prepare for the dig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just started laughing yesterday," she says. "I thought, 'I'm healthy. I can 
do stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Knight teaches elementary school in Manhattan, so she has to know about 
dinosaurs. During the school year, she brings a big wading pool to class, fills 
it with dirt, then salts it with real fossils. The young paleontologists spend 
the year working the dig in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knight had never been on a real dig herself, so when she saw an ad in 
Nature magazine for ExcaVacations, she signed up. Derstler is helping her make 
a videotape for the class. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dragon's Grave dig is sponsored by the University of New Orleans, the 
Friends of the University of New Orleans Vertebrate Paleo Lab and the nonprofit 
Dinosaur Society, which is based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the labor comes from Derstler's nonprofit ExcaVacations program, 
which offers dedicated amateurs a chance to get their hands dirty for science. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimps need not apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew is up at 6 a.m. for bagels, Pop-Tarts or whatever else they can eat 
fast. They work until 12:30 p.m., then take a four-hour break to avoid the 
day's heat, which routinely reaches 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon "siesta meal" is the feast of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The digging resumes at 4:30 p.m. and runs until 8:30 p.m. or until the light 
fades. 
</P>
<P>
 ExcaVacations provides the tools and supplies, such as X-Acto blades for fine 
digging and Satellite City Hot Stuff glue for preserving bones. But like 
Cassaday, most volunteers bring their own dull knives, which are perfect for 
the soft sandstone. 
</P>
<P>
 The remote campsite is 20 miles from the nearest paved road, then it's another 
20 miles to the nearest town, Newcastle, Wyo. Visits to civilization are 
limited to once a week, so participants have to get along with each other, 
which didn't worry Knight. "Who else would come to something like this except 
someone like you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Probably no one, although some of the volunteers are more likely suspects than 
others -- students of paleontology and anthropology, for example. But this 
summer's crew also includes a television broadcast engineer, a lab technician 
and a 58-year-old mother of 10 grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Digging a fertile site like Dragon's Grave can be rewarding. The crew was 
finding bones at the rate of 60 a week by mid-July. Significant bones are 
logged in "the book" with the name of the discoverer. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day Derstler offers a free hamburger to the person who finds the longest 
piece of duckbill tendon. Cassaday wins the prize today, with a piece measuring 
220 millimeters. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not in it for the burgers. "I wouldn't work this hard for money," 
Cassaday says. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight agrees, and two hours later she proves herself right. "I found a bone!" 
she yells. "I'm in the book!"

'IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU' IS JUST THE TICKET; A COP GIVES A WAITRESS HALF OF HIS 
$4-MILLION LOTTERY PAYOFF IN ANDREW BERGMAN'S CHEERY FAIRY TALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Lang (Nicolas Cage) is a New York cop with an overdose of decency. 
He's sweet and affable and he believes in keeping his word -- he's like Forrest 
Gump with an elevated IQ. 
</P>
<P>
 When Charlie finds himself in a diner short of a tip, he makes a 
pie-in-the-sky promise to his waitress (Bridget Fonda) to give her half of any 
possible winnings on his just-purchased lottery ticket. When the ticket pays $4 
million, Charlie, moving against his aghast, social-climbing wife (Rosie 
Perez), does the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It Could Happen to You" is a romantic comedy about the consequences of doing 
the right thing. It's slight but sweet: It might have been made by Charlie Lang 
himself. It's not easy to make a movie about a character -- particularly an 
adult of some intelligence -- who is all good. Goodness in the movies is often 
a guarantee of blandness. Goodness usually means a civics lesson is lurking in 
the brush. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though "It Could Happen to You" has its tenderized, good citizenship 
side, it's been written (by Jane Anderson) and directed (by Andrew Bergman) 
with an embracing cheer. It's blissfully uncynical. When Yvonne, the wide-eyed 
waitress who came to New York from Pittsburgh five years ago, tells Charlie 
that what he did is "like a fairy tale," she's also cuing the audience what to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel keeps the New York cityscapes delicately soft 
-- the grime has a pastel shimmer. Turning New York into a magical aerie where 
ordinary folk can win millions and sweet-hearted romance can bloom may seem as 
far-fetched a goal as actually lucking into the lottery. But in its own modest, 
beseeching way, the urban transformation in this movie works. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the filmmakers cheat a bit. They draw their romantic feeling from a 
sugared '40s conception of the city, with Sinatra and Tony Bennett doing their 
versions of "Young at Heart" on the soundtrack. The nostalgia isn't as gummy as 
it was in "Sleepless in Seattle," a movie that also went in for a 
those-were-the-days romanticism. The romanticism in that movie seemed forced. 
In "It Could Happen to You," it just wafts off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Cage and Fonda are perfectly paired. Cage, for that matter, also seems 
perfectly paired with Perez, and with Wendell Pierce, who plays his partner, 
and just about everybody else in the film. He's become a remarkably generous 
and versatile performer. Is there any other actor who can play zigzag dementia 
as well as he can -- in films like "Wild at Heart" and "Vampire's Kiss" -- and 
then turn around and play zigzag normality -- as in "Moonstruck" and Bergman's 
"Honeymoon in Vegas" and now "It Could Happen to You" -- with equal conviction? 
It could be that, for Cage, these ordinary guys are the weirdest of 
incarnations -- normality as the ultimate masquerade. But he doesn't condescend 
to these characters or turn them into schmoes. He respects their tiny dreams 
and so, of course, when the dreams pay off big, they don't seem so ordinary 
anymore. These characters become figures in a fable. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonda shares Cage's grace and gift for simple gestures. Her Yvonne, bankrupt 
and on the outs from a crumbum husband (Stanley Tucci), still manages to cling 
to her romantic illusions. She's untarnished: Her white waitress uniform looks 
angelic on her. Fonda lets Yvonne's emotions out slowly; as the inevitable 
romance with Charlie develops, her eyes grow wider and her smile radiates. 
She's the emblem of happiness, and we can see why the married Charlie would be 
drawn to her -- even though it messes with his rectitude. 
</P>
<P>
 All our sympathies are with Charlie, though, because Perez plays his wife like 
a gold-digging chatterbox. ("I'm a person who needs money," she squeals.) She's 
a cartoon Emma Bovary: Stuck with her dull, decent husband in Queens, she 
craves shopping sprees at Saks. Perez's life-of-the-party spiritedness and 
rat-a-tat locutions give the film a buzz. Post-lottery, she twinkles like a 
44-carat diamond, and she's just about as hard. Her redecorated apartment is 
such a gaudy-tacky wonder that it's practically an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman eases into conventionality a bit too cozily in "It Could Happen to 
You." It lacks his trademark nut-ball inspirations: like that scene in "The 
Freshman" where Bert Parks serenaded Marlon Brando with Bob Dylan's "Maggie's 
Farm," or the parachuting Elvis impersonators in "Honeymoon in Vegas." But he 
pulls off the central romantic conceit in this film without a hitch, and that's 
not easy. Charlie and Yvonne are each other's lucky charms. They don't need to 
win a lottery. They're already rich -- they have hearts of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild language and a scene of cop action. Times 
guidelines: It includes a fairly graphic convenience store robbery.

 Opening the Closet: "The Celluloid Closet," Vito Russo's groundbreaking book 
about Hollywood's portrayal of gay and lesbian characters in the movies, is 
being made into a feature-length documentary for cable's HBO. The movie, which 
began production this week, is produced and directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey 
Friedman, who produced 1989's Oscar- and Peabody-winning documentary "Common 
Threads: Stories From the Quilt." "The Celluloid Closet" -- which will include 
clips from more than 100 films and interviews with several Hollywood actors, 
writers, producers and directors -- is slated to premiere on HBO in late 1995. 
Proceeds from the nonprofit project will benefit the AIDS awareness 
organization Hollywood Supports.

 'Beethoven' Suit: ITC Entertainment is accusing Universal Studios of stealing 
the story line for its own project "Dwayne" and turning it into the successful 
dog tale "Beethoven." In a federal suit filed in Los Angeles, ITC says that its 
work had been submitted to Universal as a possible project and that the studio 
later put out the similar "Beethoven" in 1992, and a sequel this year. ITC 
alleges its losses at $10 million. The complaint also seeks an injunction

MOVIE REVIEW; DANGEROUS ROMANCE BLOOMS IN 'STUDENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Foreign Student" has such a good, offbeat premise and such winning 
performances from Marco Hofschneider and Robin Givens, it's a shame that it's 
only so-so when it could have been terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofschneider was the charismatic young star of "Europa, Europa," in which he 
played a Polish Jew who winds up in the German army during World War II. Here 
he plays Philippe, an 18-year-old Frenchman who wins a one-semester scholarship 
to a Virginia university. Hofschneider captures perfectly the culture shock 
experienced by the young man upon his arrival in a small college community in 
the beautiful Shenandoah Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after his arrival he encounters Givens' April, a schoolteacher who 
also works as a cleaning woman for one of Philippe's professors. Their mutual 
attraction is instant, and why not? Both are exceptionally attractive and 
bright individuals. But it's 1956, the South, and the very notion of an 
interracial romance is fraught with peril. Still, Philippe is the only white 
man who has ever looked April straight in the eye, and April is not only 
beautiful but as lonely as Philippe -- it's not likely that April has any 
friends trying, as she is, to learn French via a correspondence course. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted by Menno Meyjes (who also wrote the script for "The Color Purple") 
from Philippe Labro's autobiographical novel, the film is best and strongest 
when it sticks to Philippe and April, whose romance develops with credibility 
and tenderness. From his sophisticated world of Paris, Philippe is baffled by 
naked racism and segregation while April is at once intrigued and wary of this 
very different kind of white man. Director Eva Sereny does capture the aura of 
danger confronting the couple -- anyone who attended a college within a stone's 
throw of the Mason-Dixon Line in the '50s could tell you how daring and risky 
their affair is. 
</P>
<P>
 When the film moves away from the lovers by themselves, "Foreign Student" 
becomes decidedly uneven. Rick Johnson is outstanding as Philippe's pal, a guy 
who fits the Golden Boy football star image but is actually a sensitive, caring 
and courageous individual behind his breezy jock demeanor. There's also a 
lovely cameo by Charles Dutton as a blues singer who comes to Philippe's rescue 
when the youth dares to go to a blues joint in a black neighborhood, a venue 
decidedly off-limits to white college boys, and a brief, effective appearance 
by jazz vocalist Jon Hendricks as April's father. But Edward Herrmann, so often 
a fine actor, emerges as a caricature of the tweedy, pipe-smoking professor, 
and Charlotte Ross, a game young actress, is stuck with what may well be the 
worst role of 1994: a Bostonian who passes herself off as a Southern belle and 
then suffers a nervous breakdown when she discovers Philippe has a "black 
mistress." (None of this curious behavior is explored.) 
</P>
<P>
 In her feature debut, Sereny, a Hungarian-born Englishwoman, displays more 
sincerity than style, and she has a hard time imposing any kind of firm shape 
or form upon her material. Not helping matters are the film's syrupy score, 
banal theme song and unctuous soundtrack narration.

TV REVIEW; MODINE MAKES PBS LOOK 'ALIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The directing debut of actor Matthew Modine is the chief hook, if not 
necessarily the main reward, of tonight's installment of "Alive TV," the 
occasional PBS series collecting unusual contemporary short films. Two of the 
three, Modine's "Smoking" and David Munro's "Bullethead," were hits at the 
Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and make their television premiere 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the 13-minute "Smoking," there's no evidence Modine will be a 
filmmaker to reckon with anytime soon, but the source material is strong enough 
that it doesn't much matter. He's taken writer David Sedaris' whimsical 
meditation (first heard on public radio) on the personal and social hazards of 
tobacco addiction and provided a pack of literal images to go with the droll 
narration. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedaris' musings begin as a funny, anti-PC paean to partaking with an opening 
rant against "aggressive nonsmokers," then turn into a more wistful accounting 
of the sad cost cigarettes extract. Modine's visual additions are pretty 
obvious at every point, and the Woody Allenesque jazz scoring doesn't help, but 
the short's still a good, provocative second-hand joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-minute closing short, "Bullethead," is very much in the vein of early 
David Lynch, as the title would suggest, but director Munro proves one of the 
master's better imitators. How's this for Lynchian: The title figure is an 
Eastern Bloc sled racer whose head was surgically elongated when he was a child 
to make him superhumanly aerodynamic. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not at first clear this is anything more than a perversely enigmatic 
extended gag. But the intentions, if pretentious, aren't pointless: The aged 
Bullethead, being studied in front of a wind machine in a lab by a scientific 
bloke chugging a Coke, emerges as the sad product of a Cold War whose end has 
rendered his dystopian engineering irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 In between these two is a quickie piece of animation concerning a would-be 
lounge lizard. Altogether, a more legitimately lively "Alive TV" than average. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Alive TV" airs tonight at 11 on PBS Channel 28. CHRIS WILLMAN

WOMAN CLEARED IN BOY'S DEATH; RETRIAL: JURY FINDS BABY-SITTER DEBRA SUZANNE 
CUMMINGS OF RESEDA NOT GUILTY OF MURDER CHARGES FILED AFTER THE 9-MONTH-OLD 
DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Debra Suzanne Cummings, a former PTA president from Reseda charged with 
murdering a 9-month-old boy placed in her care in 1990, was found not guilty 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an abrupt climax to a retrial that had focused national attention on the 
quality and affordability of child care, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury 
deliberated only seven hours before acquitting Cummings, 36, of second-degree 
murder, voluntary manslaughter and child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
 She had earlier been cleared of manslaughter charges in the death of another 
child under her care, a 14-month-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the verdicts were read Thursday, Cummings shook with excitement, crying 
out: "Oh!" She laid her head down on the table, embraced her attorney and 
sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can leave," Judge Michael J. Farrell told her. She bolted from her chair 
and yelled to family and friends in the corner of the courtroom: "We're going 
home!" 
</P>
<P>
 On her way to the elevator, she amended that, shouting out: "We're going to 
Disneyland!" Surrounded by well-wishers, she insisted she was serious: "We may 
stay there the next three days!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the way down in the elevator, Cummings hugged her 10-year-old 
daughter, Megan, and said quietly: "It's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, after four years and two trials, are criminal charges. The verdict, 
however, leaves unresolved the underlying mystery: How did 9-month-old Kevin 
Young die? 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, president of the PTA at Shirley Avenue Elementary School, had 
advertised "Loving Child Care in My Home" for $75 per week. She has admitted 
repeatedly that she ran an unlicensed baby-sitting service.  
</P>
<P>
 On June 15, 1990, she was baby-sitting Kevin Young. The next day, he died from 
severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended that Cummings attacked the boy. She maintained that the 
child somehow exacerbated a prior injury. 
</P>
<P>
 At her first trial, which ended last July, a Superior Court jury deadlocked 
after eight contentious days of deliberations, 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Carol Fisch pressed for a retrial. Cummings complained that she was 
a victim of coincidence and the target of a vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother, Toni Majoy-Young, testified in February before a 
congressional subcommittee investigating the availability of quality child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a judge dismissed manslaughter charges against Cummings in an 
unrelated case, saying there was no evidence of foul play in the March, 1990, 
death of 14-month-old Matthew Cooley. He died after an apparent seizure while 
she was baby-sitting him in a park. 
</P>
<P>
 At the retrial, which began two weeks ago, Farrell barred any mention of 
Cooley's death, ruling that it would be too prejudicial for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling an injustice was done," Lynn Cooley, 34, of West Hills, Matthew's 
mother, said Thursday after the verdicts were in. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young was the first witness at the retrial, which was broadcast on Court 
TV, the cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 She told jurors that Kevin was "alive and well" when she dropped him off. That 
afternoon, after picking him up, she said, "I was screaming at him the entire 
time I was in the car. I said, 'Kevin, wake up. It's mom. Wake up! Wake up!' 
And he never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young, who was present for the entire testimony phase of the trial, was 
not in the courtroom for the verdict. She was on an airplane back to her new 
home in Baltimore, not expecting such a quick decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings testified at the retrial in her own defense, saying she never would 
have hurt Kevin Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Deputy Public Defender Tamar Rachel Toister, contended that the 
injury did not occur at Cummings' home and said that, in some cases, symptoms 
of head injuries do not occur for hours or even days. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the testimony came from a parade of doctors discussing the causes and 
effects of head injuries. One said that the injury could have been 36 hours old 
when Kevin Young was dropped off at Cummings' house. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury foreman, George Mickelwait, 49, a financial analyst from Encino, said 
jurors thought the doctors offered too many conflicting opinions. But the key 
to the acquittal, he said, was Cummings' testimony -- especially her affecting 
manner on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think Debra Cummings was a murderer," he said. "I didn't see it in 
her face, her eyes and anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Fisch said after the verdicts were returned that she believed that 
the evidence against Cummings had been "overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 "What it boils down to is that even though jurors say they will convict on 
circumstantial evidence, they still want an eyewitness," Fisch said. "That's 
the problem in a child death case like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Toister countered that the reason for the acquittal was far 
more basic, that the prosecution had "no case." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "From Day One, I've said I was going to get an acquittal."  
</P>
<P>
 On the way to her car, Cummings said she was "in the middle of a book deal," 
one for each trial. The last four years, she said, had been "hell." She added: 
"I want to thank those 12 people very much for letting me go home."

INJURED INMATES SEEKING $660,000; LANCASTER: SIXTY-SIX FILE CLAIMS FOLLOWING 
'CELL EXTRACTIONS' CONDUCTED DURING A SEARCH FOR WEAPONS. SEVERAL GUARDS WERE 
ALSO HURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A prisoners rights law office filed claims Thursday seeking more than $660,000 
for dozens of inmates at Lancaster State Prison who said they were shot with 
wooden pellets and forcibly removed from their cells by guards during a violent 
crackdown earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 2 incident stemmed from an investigation into a tip that several 
inmates in a special unit for problem prisoners were conspiring to stab a 
sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 According to claims filed by the San Rafael-based Prison Law Office, a daylong 
series of "cell extractions" to search for weapons left at least four inmates 
with broken bones and one with a severed finger. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of the operation, one of the guards used a gas-propelled gun 
that fires wooden bullets to force uncooperative inmates from their cells, 
according to claims filed with the state Board of Control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guards were vicious and used far more force than necessary," said Steven 
Fama, an attorney for the private law office near San Quentin State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lancaster prison Warden John Ratelle on Thursday defended the operation in 
which 13 guards also sustained minor injuries. The incident was never reported 
to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done an internal affairs investigation on that whole incident," Ratelle 
said. "There was no excessive force." He described the inmates as "totally 
uncooperative" and said they threw urine and feces on guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the prisoners pulled from their cells that day were transferred 
from Lancaster to high-security units at Pelican Bay and Corcoran state 
prisons, according to the claims filed on behalf of 66 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Eve Shapiro, another lawyer working on the case, said one prisoner received no 
medical treatment for a broken foot until he arrived at Pelican Bay two days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle denied that any prisoners with apparent injuries were taken from 
Lancaster without medical treatment. "All of the inmates we knew of who were 
injured were treated here at the institution before they were transferred," he 
said, adding: "They get better medical care than you or I do." 
</P>
<P>
 According to prison records and the claims filed Thursday, the violence 
unfolded after a weapons search was ordered of the "administrative segregation 
unit," which houses recalcitrant inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupants of 49 of the 100 cells in the unit refused to allow their cells to 
be searched. In an effort to force the inmates out, guards fired wooden pellets 
in. The practice is proper prison procedure, according to Ratelle, and similar 
to techniques used in the Los Angeles County jail system to quell riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates struck by ricocheting pellets reported a broken nose, a broken thumb, 
a broken foot and a broken ankle. Two of at least 13 injured guards were 
treated at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center for minor injuries and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one improvised metal weapon was found in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a prison report written shortly after the incident, the sergeant 
who was the subject of the conspiracy operated the air gun that fired wooden 
pellets. But Ratelle on Thursday denied that the sergeant took part in the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the unit, but he did not participate in cell extractions," Ratelle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Thursday's claims are rejected by the state Board of Control, the group 
will probably file a lawsuit against the state, attorneys said. The individual 
claims -- one for each inmate -- each ask for more than $10,000.

SYLMAR CRUISING SPOT IS DECLARED PUBLIC NUISANCE; CRACKDOWN: SHOPPING CENTER 
DRAWS ROWDY CROWDS, RESIDENTS AND OFFICIALS SAY. MANAGER IS ORDERED TO ADD 
GATES AT ENTRANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the San Fernando Valley's hottest cruising spots -- the La Rinda Plaza 
-- has been declared a public nuisance by a city zoning official who ordered 
the shopping center's owners to install gates that can be closed at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was applauded Thursday by grateful residents and officials who 
said rowdy crowds at the plaza, which draws car aficionados from Rancho 
Cucamonga to Simi Valley, have brought noise, traffic and violence to their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are terrorizing the neighborhood," said Officer Tim Falco of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Foothill Station. "There are beer bottles, 
urinating, shots going off every weekend. Some of the kids are good, but they 
don't realize the danger they are in." 
</P>
<P>
 But many youths insist that they are all suffering for the misbehavior of a 
few -- that the violence is unrelated to cruising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come to show off our cars," said John, 22, of Simi Valley, who recently 
cruised the plaza in his purple Nissan truck. "We're trying to keep out of 
trouble." Like many of the cruisers, he declined to give his full name. 
</P>
<P>
 In an order mailed out Wednesday night, city officials directed the manager of 
the shopping center at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Workman Street to close 
gates on five of the eight entrances to the property at 10 p.m. to drive off 
the scores of cruisers who gather in the parking lot from dusk to the next 
morning. The cruisers gather Friday and Saturday nights but the largest crowds 
congregate on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator William Lillenberg imposed 13 other conditions 
on the plaza owners, ordering them to install overnight lighting, post security 
guards and develop a plan to renovate the parking lot with improvement such as 
landscaping, resurfacing and re-striping. 
</P>
<P>
 According to mall manager Stephen Chan, gate posts are to be installed today 
with the gates themselves to be installed in the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center has been a draw for cruisers for at least two decades, 
residents said. The lot has been a popular spot because the cruisers know they 
can scatter through any number of exits when the police show up. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem has worsened in the past two years, leading residents to fear 
for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents say they no longer sleep in bedrooms facing the street because 
they fear stray bullet fire. They find empty beer bottles tossed in their 
yards. Bricks or rocks are plucked from their yards to be used in fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Even officials with Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills have complained 
that their employees coming in for their overnight shifts have been trapped in 
the streets by the hundreds of cars that follow a traditional cruising route -- 
Laurel Canyon to San Fernando Mission Boulevard to Workman and nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months police have cracked down on cruisers at the plaza and 
surrounding streets. On a recent weekend police impounded 80 cars and issued 
hundreds of tickets for a wide variety of violations. Officers say they have 
also broken up scuffles between the cruisers and recovered several stolen cars. 
</P>
<P>
 To youths who have frequented the area, however, cruising is a rite of passage 
-- popping the hydraulics of their converted Cadillacs in adolescent 
challenges, then cruising down Laurel Canyon or Sepulveda boulevards in search 
of teen-age romance. It's just fun, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were out here thinking there was going to be violence, we wouldn't be 
here," said Julie, who is seven months pregnant. "I'm not going to risk my 
baby's health." 
</P>
<P>
 Lillenberg said that this was the first time he used such measures to combat 
cruising. But the restrictions, such as the guards and lighting, have been 
effective in turning around liquor stores and motels which have been deemed 
public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some pretty good success with it, but it depends on the cooperation 
of the owners," Lillenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, with Sun West Property Management, has been criticized by city officials 
and residents for turning a deaf ear to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chan counters that he has been limited in what he could do without police 
backup. Security guards hired in January have been too scared to confront the 
hundreds of cars coming into the plaza at night and have refused to work past 
11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 With the city's decision, however, Chan is optimistic that a solution has been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got great cooperation from the Police Department, that they will be on 
site," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 90 days, city officials will hold a hearing to review how effectively 
the plaza has complied with the order. The plaza management might comply with 
the city order, but the cruisers may have other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can force them to keep moving, then they are not very happy," said Tom 
Weissbarth of Sylmar, who has kept an eye on the cruisers as a member of the 
Foothill Area Surveillance Team, a volunteer citizens watch group. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the effort is successful, some law enforcement veterans concede 
that a few locked gates won't end cruising. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that has changed is that the cruisers are more vocal and 
rowdy," said a 15-year veteran parking cop who used to blockade cruisers on Van 
Nuys Boulevard. "But there will always be cruising."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; DOCENTS CREATE FUND-RAISER TO RESTORE RANCHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1849, it was one of the first homes in the San Fernando Valley that could 
be visited by weary travelers heading west. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it is not even fit for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Northridge earthquake caused more than $1.5 million in structural 
damages, the ancient rancho that once housed Valley families and cattle 
ranchers is barely standing in what is now Los Encinos State Historic Park, 
16756 Moorpark St. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents who once conducted tours in the rancho's two ancient structures are 
planning a fund-raiser to restore the buildings and replace the artifacts that 
were lost during the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising event, called "Fandango," will be held Saturday in the park 
near the corner of Balboa and Ventura boulevards from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Donations are requested. Highlights include a Wild West stunt show, melodrama, 
food, music and costumes from the 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our history," said Lil Bauer, 69, of Encino, one of the 50 docents who 
are helping to stage the event. "We really want to get back in there and 
contribute what we can to the community there." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally the home of a family of cattle ranchers in 1849, the de la Ossa 
adobe lost its northern wall and suffered cosmetic damage from falling plaster, 
said state park Ranger Russell Kimura. Repairs are possible by replacing the 
adobe bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Garnier building was not so lucky. Built in 1872 of limestone to house 
workers who helped herd sheep, the structure is barely standing, supported by 
only two steel beams that could give way in an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the rooms of each structure had individual themes for the 
families that lived in them from 1849 until 1927, complete with unique 
artifacts. Many of these items, such as china, furniture, picture frames and 
antiques, were lost in the earthquake, Kimura said. The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency has offered an unspecified amount of assistance, Kimura said, 
but the aid will "help us out so we can get the building structurally safe 
again and OK to walk through, but what they cannot help is replace the antiques 
and other interpretive artifacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimura hopes the funds can be used to buy enough replicas of the artifacts and 
finance enough repairs to allow indoor tours to proceed again. Although the 
park has been open since the earthquake, only tours of the grounds have been 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For tourism, we're very, very valuable," Kimura said. "Very little history 
was saved in the San Fernando Valley. We are one of the very few historical 
sites in the Valley to tour people who come from out of town. What the valley 
has lost is tremendous historically." JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOL BUS SEATS STILL WITHOUT RESTRAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Nearly a year after a group of parents won support for it, a controversial 
type of safety device has not been installed on Las Virgenes Unified School 
District buses as promised, because of the manufacturer's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it isn't going to happen unless someone else comes in and takes 
this project over," said Asst. Supt.Donald Zimring. "It was a whole lot of 
effort for naught." 
</P>
<P>
 After an intense lobbying effort by a group of parents last summer, the Las 
Virgenes school board agreed to allow Micho Industries to install a pull-down 
safety restraint -- called the R-Bar -- on the seats of one or two buses for a 
trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 The restraints originally were scheduled to be installed, at no cost to the 
district, by January. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dunn, vice president of marketing at the Lompoc-based company, 
conceded that the project "has lost a lot of momentum" due to "financial 
difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the company is "still committed to the success of the project, 
because we know what it means to the safety of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents felt their children would be safer if buses were equipped with such 
devices, despite a lack of evidence supporting claims that the restraints 
increase safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Beth, who helped organize support for the R-Bars, said she was "very 
disappointed" about the company's failure to install its product. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't allow my children to go on the field trips unless I drive them 
myself," Beth said. "If the buses had the restraints, I would feel safer about 
letting them go." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CELLULAR TOWER WON'T BE BUILT AT CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to public outcry against the construction of a 75-foot cellular 
transmission tower on the property of the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in 
Northridge, AirTouch Cellular has announced that it would find another 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 "(AirTouch Cellular) will look for another site in the same general area," 
said Phyllis Winger, planning deputy to Councilman Hal Bernson."They said they 
will work with the community and the council office," Winger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge residents, led by Goldie Weis, objected to the tower because they 
said it would decrease the value of their homes and that there may be health 
risks involved. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee at the Lutheran church said that the money it would have been paid 
for the tower was to go toward community outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch Cellular's decision to back down from building the tower at the site 
was announced Monday, the same day as the zoning administrator's public hearing 
for those affected by its construction. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: A HIGH NOTE FOR BARBERSHOP QUARTET SINGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blushing brides, the sweet smell of roses and chance encounters at Coney 
Island. These are the good old-fashioned themes of barbershop songs, dear to 
the hearts of the over 100 members of the San Fernando Valley Chapter of the 
Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the members, known as the Valleyaires, celebrated their 35th 
anniversary with spirited harmonizing and performances at the Bernardi 
Multi-Purpose Center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbershop quartets came into existence around 1938, back in the days when men 
would hang out at the neighborhood barber shop and sing in four-part (lead, 
tenor, baritone and bass) harmony, according to the Valleyaires chairman, Mitch 
Guzik. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth resident Jim Summers, 67, the last remaining member of the original 
San Fernando Valley barbershop group, was on hand for the event. "It becomes a 
way of life," said Summers, who after 35 years of singing, still performs with 
the Valleyaires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing brings men together like hitting a chord, just like in 'The Music 
Man,' " said 16-year barbershop veteran Norman Laufe of North Hollywood. 
Looking around at the crowd that had gathered for the anniversary and reunion, 
Laufe said, "It's nice to see some of the old faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cohen, a rookie Valleyaire, said he especially enjoys the variety of 
people in the chorus. "There are no professional singers here. They are 
janitors, gardeners, lawyers and doctors," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valleyaires have enjoyed success in competitions such as the International 
Finals, where they placed ninth in 1978. They have also have won the Southern 
California West DivisionChampionships in 1991, 1992 and 1993. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; FIRE STATION'S DEMOLITION TO BEGIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Demolition of Studio City's only fire station was slated to get under way this 
morning, after Department of Water and Power personnel spent Thursday 
disconnecting the building's electrical and plumbing lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews were expected to begin removing the roof of the 47-year-old building 
today and knock down walls early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Station 78, near the intersection of Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Ventura 
Boulevard, suffered damage in the Northridge earthquake and ensuing 
aftershocks, and was eventually deemed unsafe, forcing crews to move out. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan now, said Capt. Louis Roupoli of the department's building 
administration office, is to raze the damaged structure but leave in place the 
existing concrete slab to support heavy equipment. Temporary structures will 
then be installed at the site and the firefighters of Company 78 will be able 
to return to their district while a new, permanent station is erected. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Jan. 17 temblor initially left the pale, stucco building with only 
minor damage, officials said aftershocks eventually made it unsafe, and 
firefighters were moved to a neighboring station in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fire companies were called in to help cover the area -- one of the San 
Fernando Valley's busiest for medical calls -- but all had to come from greater 
distances, causing response times to double in some cases. No problems from the 
delayed responses have been reported, but the situation has continued to worry 
officials and residents alike. 
</P>
<P>
 While crews begin razing the old station, officials will continue to seek 
funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and state Office of 
Emergency Services to pay for the demolition as well as a new and almost 
certainly larger building, Roupoli said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4,700 square feet, the old station was less than half the size of most 
modern stations, and officials would like to increase the square footage of 
both the new building and surrounding lot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the department's list for a possible new site is a corner of the 
nearby Studio City Golf Course, though no deals have been made for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition of the old Station 78 is expected to last about a month, and 
Roupoli said temporary trailers would be installed and ready for the returning 
crews in about four months. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; BIRD AUCTION TO AID PARROT DISEASE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This auction's for the birds. At least that's how it will be Saturday in 
Sherman Oaks when an exotic bird auction is held to raise money for research on 
a deadly parrot disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual event will auction off birds such as princess parrots, 
orange-cheeked finches and barrabands. Nearly 40 birds will be displayed for 
view, and bidders may inspect the animals before purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's auction raised more than $4,000, twice as much as the year before. 
Funds raised from the event will go toward research of psittacine beak and 
feather disease (PBFD), a deadly virus that afflicts nearly 10% of household 
parrots in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 PBFD affects birds the way AIDS affects humans, according to a biologist 
affiliated with West Valley Bird Society, sponsor of the auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the proceeds will be donated to the University of Georgia College of 
Veterinary Medicine, where Dr. Branson Ritchie and a team of researchers are 
currently working on a vaccine. For the past year, Ritchie has been developing 
a test to determine if a bird has been exposed to PBFD.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the disease is transmitted through feather dust and is contagious 
through human contact or air. Humans cannot be infected. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining funds will help support conservation of the great green macaw, 
an endangered species that lives in both Costa Rica and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Artwork, literature and bird cages will also be available. The auction will 
begin at 11 a.m. at the Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks Senior Citizens Center, 5040 Van 
Nuys Blvd. ALICIA DOYLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; GROUNDBREAKING SET FOR HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you ask Valley residents to name the two most frustrating things about Los 
Angeles, the answers might well be finding a place to park and an affordable 
place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 a.m. Sunday, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the Jewish Federation 
Council and dignitaries from local community churches and temples are scheduled 
to participate in groundbreaking ceremonies for a Sherman Oaks project that 
attempts to address both of these problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Menorah Housing Foundation's long anticipated 83-unit apartment complex 
for low-income senior citizens, partly funded by a federal Housing and Urban 
Development loan, will officially be under construction once these ceremonies 
commence. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex at 14567 Dickens St. will replace a 142-space public parking lot 
just south of a Ventura Boulevard shopping strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two levels of the Menorah project's four-story building will consist 
of 247 parking spaces, 41 of which will be reserved for the tenants. This will 
add 64 spaces to those available to the public. All 83 units will be 
one-bedroom apartments with a maximum occupancy of two people. Eight apartments 
are specifically designed for senior citizens who use wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to HUD's Section 8 program requirements for occupancy, an 
individual's annual income cannot exceed $17,650 or, for couples, a combined 
annual income may not be greater than $20,150. Tenants must be 62 or older or, 
if disabled, 50, and must be able to live independently. Qualified tenants will 
pay up to 30% of their monthly gross income in rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately three to six months before construction is completed, the 
Menorah Housing Foundation will solicit tenant applications. The application 
period will last for two to three weeks. Federal preference is given to those 
who now pay 50% of their income in rent, are living in substandard housing or 
have been involuntarily displaced from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 All other qualified applications will be assigned lottery numbers. Tickets 
with corresponding numbers will then be drawn randomly, with the first ticket 
selected designating the first applicant to be assigned an apartment. The first 
83 will receive apartments, and remaining applicants will be placed on a 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Menorah Housing Foundation is an agency of the Jewish Federation Council 
of Greater Los Angeles. It is represented regionally by the San Fernando Valley 
Alliance. The project was made possible by a $6 million loan from HUD. In 
addition, the Jewish Federation Council donated $10,000 in seed money and 
extended a $500,000 credit line to the project for additional construction 
costs. ANTONIO OLIVO

HUBER CASE GOING TO ORANGE COUNTY; COURTS: DNA TEST RESULTS TO DATE INDICATE 
THE FORMER NORTHRIDGE WOMAN WAS MURDERED IN LAGUNA HILLS. SHE DISAPPEARED IN 
1991. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Long-awaited blood tests confirmed that a former Northridge woman whose 
battered body was found in a freezer here was apparently bludgeoned to death 
three years ago in Laguna Hills, leading Arizona authorities on Thursday to 
send the murder case to Orange County for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors quickly filed capital murder charges against John J. 
Famalaro, a 37-year-old house painter who lived most of his life in Orange 
County before moving in 1992 to Arizona where he was arrested earlier this 
month on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Denise Huber, 23, disappeared June 3, 1991 after her automobile 
had a tire blowout on the Corona del Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Her whereabouts had been a complete mystery until Arizona detectives, thinking 
they were about to uncover a cache of illicit drugs, found her body in the 
freezer, which Famalaro brought here from California and kept supplied with 
power in a Ryder rental truck parked in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although criminal defense attorneys both here and in California have said that 
prosecutors would have a tougher time securing a death sentence if the murder 
case was sent to Orange County, they also said that Arizona would have little 
choice but to surrender jurisdiction if evidence surfaced that death had 
occurred in California. 
</P>
<P>
 That evidence was uncovered by police detectives from Costa Mesa, and 
confirmed by crime lab technicians of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint statement issued Thursday said that the decision to send the murder 
prosecution to Orange County was "based on the DNA analysis of blood stains 
collected at the warehouse (Famalaro occupied) at 23192 Verdugo" in Lake 
Forest. Two types of DNA testing were being done, the statement said, and 
"results to date show that the blood found at the warehouse matches that of 
Denise Huber." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint charging Famalaro with murder included the "special 
circumstance" of kidnaping. "Due to the special circumstance allegation, 
Famalaro is eligible for the death penalty," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huber family, prominent in Presbyterian church circles in the San Fernando 
Valley since 1973, moved to Newport Beach in 1987. Denise Huber attended Valley 
Presbyterian School and Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead woman's father, Dennis Huber, said from the family home in Newport 
Beach that he and his wife were greatly relieved that the jurisdictional issue 
had finally been resolved, and that his daughter's body would be released in 
time for a twice-postponed funeral now scheduled for Tuesday in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "It closes the chapter, but not the book," Dennis Huber said. He added that he 
had "mixed feelings" about the case being transferred to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it might have been an easier prosecution over there," he said. "I 
think it will be a fair trial and justice will be served. It just might be 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's defense attorney, Thomas K. Kelly, agreed with that assessment. 
"From Day One, I believed it to be in my client's best interest to have the 
case tried in California," he said, because it is easier to carry out a death 
sentence in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of California's more than 300 death row inmates have been executed 
since the death penalty was restored in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro will continue to be held without bail in Arizona's Yavapai County 
Jail pending extradition to Orange County, said Yavapai County Sheriff Buck 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he waives extradition, he'll go quick (to Orange County). If he doesn't, 
he goes slow. But, he goes." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Yavapai County attorney's office has filed papers requesting 
that all evidence seized in three searches of Famalaro's home here be turned 
over to Orange County authorities.

EX-FOOTBALL STANDOUT CONVICTED IN SHOOTING; COURT: LEODES VAN BUREN, 19, OF 
NEWBURY PARK FACES UP TO SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON FOR FIRING INTO GIRLFRIEND'S 
HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County jury deliberated just two hours Thursday before convicting 
former Newbury Park football standout Leodes Van Buren of firing a gun into the 
home of his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, 19, the state's all-time leading pass receiver who was headed to 
the University of Colorado on a scholarship before the shooting, now could be 
sentenced to seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark set sentencing for Aug. 25. 
Prosecutors say Van Buren faces a minimum sentence of six months in jail. But a 
defense attorney said that Clark could suspend any jail or prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to have to deal with a felony conviction," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
James Grunert said. "I don't know how many colleges are going to want felons on 
their team." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren was shocked by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "His statement to me was, 'How could they believe I was guilty?' " said 
defense attorney John B. Miller. He said the athlete still expects to get a 
football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This conviction is not going to preclude Leodes from attending college, and a 
Division I college, " Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren was charged with shooting into an inhabited dwelling after his 
girlfriend, Marcie James, 20, told authorities that he fired a bullet through 
the back door of her family's home April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Both James and Van Buren, who are now married, later denied that he fired the 
shot. They said instead that one of Van Buren's acquaintances from 
South-Central Los Angeles was the culprit. Van Buren refused to identify the 
man, saying he feared retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller said the defendant changed his mind after the verdict and now 
intends to "find that guy . . . no matter what risk he puts himself or his 
family through." 
</P>
<P>
 Grunert and Miller agreed that the key evidence during the three-day trial 
were audiotapes recorded the day of the shooting. Van Buren and James both 
identified Van Buren as the triggerman. "That put everything into context," the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his closing argument, Grunert contended that Van Buren decided to deny 
firing the gun a day after the incident in an effort to salvage his 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller countered that the prosecutor had failed to prove Van Buren fired 
the shot, which broke a glass pane in the door but did not injure anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Grunert told the jury that, on the day of the shooting, James had broken off 
her relationship with Van Buren after she discovered he was having an affair 
with a Westlake High School girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren went to the James house looking to "trash" his girlfriend's car, 
Grunert said. But James had parked the car inside her garage, and she refused 
to let Van Buren inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he was trying to do was shoot the door handle so he could get in," 
Grunert told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, James dashed upstairs and phoned her mother at work, 
screaming into the receiver, "He shot the door! He shot the door!" according to 
the prosecutor. The mother asked who had shot the door. "Leodes," James 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grunert discounted the contention that someone else fired the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Van Buren and James, Grunert told the jury: "We're dealing with two people 
who are young and involved in a romantic relationship. Emotions are running 
high and common sense is nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew their scholarship would be taken away, that their life at the 
University of Colorado was gone," Grunert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller asked the jury to disregard confessions Van Buren made to a 911 
dispatcher and a Sheriff's Department detective shortly after the shooting. 
"The tape recordings that we have heard contain statements that are not under 
oath," Miller noted. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the jury to put stock in statements James made in court, where she 
testified that the gang member was the real shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren did not testify in his own defense.

 Strict new planning laws adopted this spring have prompted the Fillmore City 
Council to deny an application by Clinicas del Camino Real to rebuild its 
earthquake-damaged downtown medical center.

<P>
 The new guidelines -- a blueprint of central city zoning for decades to come 
-- call for the front third of storefronts within Fillmore's downtown district 
to be used only for shops and restaurants.

 That means the clinic, shaken irreparably in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
and later demolished, would be forced to open a retail pharmacy or other 
business in the front portion of the new building it wants to construct 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, council members said, Clinicas could lease or sell the front part 
of its structure, or it could find another place to rebuild. None of the 
alternatives pleases Clinicas officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed," said Jack Hinojosa, associate director of Clinicas. 
"We wanted to utilize all of the floor space to provide medical, psychological, 
health education and other services." 
</P>
<P>
 Architects already have drawn up plans for a 12,000-square-foot, two-story 
building on the clinic's property at 355 Central Ave., Hinojosa said. It would 
be more than double the size of its 4,800-square-foot temporary facility behind 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinicas' attorneys, Hinojosa said, are reviewing the Fillmore Specific Plan 
for potential flaws, but he stopped short of saying they may file suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning document, which took two years of meetings among city and 
community leaders to develop, seeks to lure foot traffic to the historic 
downtown by creating a retail mix of specialty shops and services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical to our community to keep that central area of town in a retail 
area to encourage what we would like to develop," Councilman Scott Lee said. 
"That is a pedestrian flow of interesting shops, where one shop would 
complement another." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan gives nonconforming businesses five years to change or relocate. But 
it also includes exemptions from its land-use policies for so-called civic 
buildings such as City Hall, the post office and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojosa said he understands the intent of the plan, but told the council that 
his clinic should also qualify for an exemption because it draws a lot of 
people to downtown Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 18,000 visits a year, the businesses in the downtown area benefit from 
all of the foot traffic that passes through our facility," Hinojosa said, 
adding that most of the clinic's patients walk to the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Brewster, however, said Clinicas, like any other medical office or 
business, must comply with the conditions of the Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a vital part of the town," she said of the clinic. "We do need the 
health center and the service, but it's the location I have a problem with. It 
does not belong downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Rojas, who has managed the Fillmore Clinicas office from temporary 
quarters since the earthquake, said a retail shop in the front portion of the 
new building would limit the clinic's space and threaten its nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in the retail pharmacy business, we're in the health care 
business," Rojas said. "To sell (drugs) at a profit or even at a nonprofit 
rate, there may be some jeopardizing of the federal funds we rely on." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don Gunderson, the lone council member to vote against denying 
Clinicas its building permit, said he would have liked to give Clinicas time to 
conform to the downtown plan. But he was outvoted 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have bought them a five-year window of time to provide retail or 
relocate," Gunderson said. "It's unfortunate that the earthquake made this such 
a desperate thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster said she had an obligation to maintain the integrity of the planning 
document. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinicas officials "are looking only at themselves and the services they 
provide," the mayor said. "I'm looking at a much broader perspective, and the 
goal of what the citizens want for their downtown."

FIRE BURNS 200 ACRES NEAR LEBEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A disabled car that caught fire beside the Golden State Freeway just north of 
the Los Angeles County line set off a brush fire Thursday that leaped the 
eight-lane roadway and burned across steep hillsides near Los Padres National 
Forest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three hours of starting at 1:45 p.m., the flames had destroyed nearly 
200 acres in the Tejon Pass as nearly 500 firefighters fought the blaze, said 
Deputy Chief Steve Gage of the Kern County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters from Kern, Ventura, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties were aided by helicopters and air tankers, Gage said. The fire was 
almost directly across from Fort Tejon State Park, about half a mile north of 
the town of Lebec, Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze came close to a school, but had damaged no structures by late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Using bulldozers and hand crews, firefighters dug a fire line in an effort to 
contain the fire to about 700 acres, Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to have it contained by midnight," he said. "We just hope the fire 
line holds."

2 SENTENCED IN CHEMICAL DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men who illegally dumped chemical waste products down a hillside at a 
state park in Sunland were ordered Thursday to serve 30 days in jail or spend 
the same length of time working in a Los Angeles Police Department graffiti 
removal program, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Onik Damaryan, 42, of Los Angeles and David Azaryan, 40, of Burbank, were 
sentenced by Los Angeles Municipal Judge Barry Taylor, according to the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were fined $810, placed on two years probation and ordered to pay nearly 
$2,500 in restitution to the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority 
for cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby notified park rangers that the men were dumping three drums filled 
with flammable automotive waste and gasoline down a steep hillside in La Tuna 
Canyon State Park in February. The hazardous waste came from the men's defunct 
auto body shop in Sunland, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's hazardous materials section and the 
California Environmental Protection Agency conducted an investigation that led 
to criminal charges by the city attorney's office.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; INVESTIGATORS TRY TO IDENTIFY REMAINS FOUND IN 
ACTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators remained puzzled Thursday in their efforts to identify the 
skeletal remains found at the bottom of an embankment in rural Acton and to 
determine how the person died. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know whether it was murder, suicide or accidental," Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Homicide Detective Joe Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the remains, scattered over a small area, possibly by animals, 
included a skull, a lower jaw and three other bones that appeared to be human. 
</P>
<P>
 A brother and sister, looking for recyclable cans, spotted the remains late 
Monday off Angeles Forest Highway, just south of Alison Canyon Road, and 
notified sheriff's deputies the next day, Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the steep terrain, a mountain rescue team was called in to help 
deputies collect the remains. Along with the bones, deputies found some long 
hair, but the color could not be determined because of exposure to the 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies also found a piece of cloth that appeared to have come from a 
headband or another garment, Guzman said. No other clothing, jewelry or 
identification papers were found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The sex could not immediately be determined. The pelvic bone, which often 
indicates whether the skeleton was from a man or a woman, was not found, Guzman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies are reviewing unsolved homicide files and missing person reports that 
may be linked with the Acton remains, he said. Dental records may be used to 
compare the recovered jaw to those of missing persons. 
</P>
<P>
 During the coming week, the coroner's office plans to call in a forensic 
anthropologist to review the remains for clues as to age, sex, identity and 
cause of death, coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies also may enlist an anthropologist to reconstruct the skull's facial 
features so that deputies can prepare and circulate a composite drawing to help 
them identify the person.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE TEACHER CHARGED WITH MOLESTATIONS; 
CRIME: DAVID ALLEN MONTANA, 42, CALLS THE ALLEGATIONS BY SEVEN GIRLS AND A 
SECRETARY 'NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors have filed 15 misdemeanor counts of child molestation and battery 
against a Palmdale teacher, alleging that he touched seven girls and a school 
secretary in inappropriate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 David Allen Montana, 42, a social studies teacher at Palmdale Learning Plaza, 
also was the subject of a petition signed by dozens of students who complained 
about his conduct, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 On the petition and in interviews with a sheriff's deputy, female students 
complained that Montana made them uncomfortable by repeatedly massaging their 
shoulders, looking down their blouses and making comments such as "You have 
sexy legs" and "You look foxy today." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale School District officials, who had received complaints from parents, 
placed Montana on paid administrative leave on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office filed the 13 misdemeanor charges against 
Montana on July 22, according to court records. Prosecutors and sheriff's 
deputies declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted at his home, Montana referred all questions to his attorney, saying 
only, "It's not really a big deal, and they're making a big deal over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana's attorney, Kenneth Schreiber, said the allegations are untrue. 
Schreiber said he had talked to investigators about the charges, but that he 
had not seen the complaint or the police reports. Montana remained free 
Thursday, but Schreiber said he was making arrangements for his client's 
surrender to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often the most caring and the most sensitive teachers and the ones most 
dedicated to their jobs are the ones whose conduct is misunderstood and who are 
judged in retrospect from a perverted viewpoint," Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schreiber added that although the charges include the word "molestation," the 
term is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I rubbed your shoulder and made you uncomfortable and you happened to be 
17 years of age, I could be charged with that offense," Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Smith, Palmdale School District superintendent, said Montana has taught 
at the Palmdale Learning Plaza, a new school that uses non-traditional learning 
techniques, for four years. She said he has not previously been disciplined by 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she first heard reports of a problem in May, when a group of 
parents complained about the behavior of the seventh- and eighth-grade teacher. 
She would not elaborate on the parents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, the misdemeanor offenses took place between Sept. 
1, 1993, and May 10, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 12, a parent reported to authorities that Montana allegedly had rubbed 
her 11-year-old daughter's back and shoulders, leaning over to look down her 
blouse as he was doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's child abuse investigator followed up on this report by visiting 
the school and interviewing other girls and a school secretary, who described 
similar conduct by Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, an attorney for the school district also 
interviewed students about Montana's behavior and shared the information with 
sheriff's investigators.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EX-DEPUTY DENIES GUILT IN STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy pleaded not guilty Thursday to 
charges that he bought more than two pounds of cocaine in an undercover sting. 
</P>
<P>
 William Todd Barr, 25, charged with selling cocaine and possessing cocaine for 
sale, entered not guilty pleas to the two felony counts in a brief hearing 
downtown before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Barr could draw up to five years in prison. The judge set a 
hearing Wednesday on a defense bid to reduce Barr's $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover sheriff's deputies claim they sold Barr -- then a guard at the 
Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho near Castaic -- a kilogram of cocaine, or 2.2 
pounds, on March 2 inside a car parked outside a downtown Los Angeles post 
office. He was immediately arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence at a preliminary hearing earlier this month included a videotape of 
the apparent sale. It also featured testimony from a jail inmate at the 
Pitchess facility who said Barr asked him if he "wanted to do some narcotics 
deals and if I could help him out."  
</P>
<P>
 That conversation, authorities said, triggered a monthlong investigation that 
led to the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Barr, of Bellflower, bought the cocaine so that he 
could take it to Tennessee and become a drug dealer. Defense lawyer Leonard 
Levine insisted after Thursday's hearing that Barr is a victim of government 
entrapment.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FORMER PRESIDENT SUES BANK OVER HIS FIRING, 
SEEKS $2 MILLION; LITIGATION: ROBERT MANLEY SAYS HE WAS OUSTED BECAUSE HE HAD 
TRIED TO COLLECT DELINQUENT LOANS FROM BOARD MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fired president of Valencia National Bank is suing the bank and its board 
of directors for $2 million, contending that he was wrongfully ousted because 
he tried to collect delinquent loans from several board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank executives have said Robert Manley, 51, was fired June 1 because of 
declining earnings at the bank, the only locally owned bank in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley's lawsuit contends, however, that the bank's most significant financial 
problem was the unpaid loans and the costs of trying to collect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that the bank's actions were improper and, beyond that, done in very 
poor taste," Manley, a founder of the bank, said in a telephone interview 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank executives have conceded that the bank had a problem with unpaid loans to 
directors, and that directors with such loans were asked to resign, but said 
that had nothing to do with Manley's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks commonly lend money to their board members on the same terms that 
customers receive. However, Manley stated in his lawsuit that he had complained 
since 1991 about delinquent loans to board members with no results. He said the 
situation has now cost the bank several hundred thousand dollars and is 
tarnishing its image. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of the bank's "problem loans" were owed by five of the board's 
12 members in March, 1993, not including one to the father of a board member, 
according to the lawsuit. Four of the five board members resigned. They were 
joined by another board member who reportedly disagreed with Manley's stance 
and whose loans became delinquent after he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley contends in his lawsuit that the bank was on the brink of receiving a 
formal regulatory order or censure from the federal Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency until the directors with delinquent loans resigned. But the 
suit states that at least one current director has continued such practices, 
seeking special treatment for a delinquent loan to a relative. 
</P>
<P>
 "These actions are very serious and smack of our own 'Whitewater,' " Manley 
wrote in a March 23 memo seeking help from board President Louis Garasi, 
submitted as part of the lawsuit. "On several occasions," Manley wrote in the 
memo, he felt that he was "the only one that is promoting ethical conduct on 
the part of our Board of Directors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board members with delinquent loans were not identified in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Garasi said in an interview that Manley's accusations are a smoke screen to 
cover the real reasons for his firing -- declining earnings from 1991 to 1993 
and a disagreement with shareholders over his management style. Bank stock 
worth $10 a share when the bank opened reached $14 several years ago, but now 
trades for $7 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Garasi declined to comment on the allegations in Manley's lawsuit, stating 
that the bank has not been formally notified of the suit, but said no current 
board member has an outstanding loan. 
</P>
<P>
 A press release issued by the bank Thursday states that it earned $127,413 
during the first six months of 1994, compared with a loss of $141,009 in the 
same period a year ago. Garasi attributes the increase to recovery from the 
recession, saying earnings might have been even higher had Manley not presided 
over the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit after receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit names the bank and its eight current board members as defendants. 
Board members include Garasi, Eugene Burke, Charles Albre, Richard Keysor, 
Walter Fisher, Richard Patterson, Robert Nahabit and Joseph McKeon, brother of 
Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita). 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman congressman is another of the bank's founders and served as 
chairman of the board of directors until he was elected to office in November, 
1992. He is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, although he said he knew 
about the delinquent loans and the related disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bank initially prohibited loans to directors until bank regulators 
told them "that it's not a good policy because you deprive the bank of some 
good business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy was to never give a board member anything you wouldn't give 
somebody who just walked in off the street," McKeon said. "You couldn't give 
them a better interest rate, any kind of advantage. You had to bend over 
backward to make sure you weren't using the bank to help board members. It was 
tougher for board members than for others." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who was involved in Manley's hiring but not his dismissal, said Manley 
had always had a rocky relationship with the board, which tolerated him when 
the bank was doing well, but decided to oust him when earnings dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank is expected to name a replacement for Manley within a week, Garasi 
said. Manley has accepted a position as regional vice president for the 
Valencia branch of American Pacific State Bank, scheduled to open at the end of 
August.

COUNTY SCHOOL PROGRAM CITED AS U.S. MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County program has been cited as a national model for decreasing 
violence in schools. The county Office of Education's Teacher Expectation and 
Student Achievement program, begun in 1971, was recently recommended by the New 
York State Board of Regents as a model training program to help teachers 
promote school safety. The program concentrates on helping teachers become more 
aware of the needs of their students, addressing such issues as teacher bias 
and ethnic diversity.

MOVIE REVIEW; A SOLID, LOVING TALE OF 'BEAUTY'; CREATED, AS THE NOVEL WAS, FROM 
THE HEART, THIS 'BLACK BEAUTY' IS AS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD AS ITS SOURCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I am writing the life of a horse," Anna Sewell modestly confided to her 
journal in what proved to be quite an understatement. Her 1877 novel, "Black 
Beauty," described as being "translated from the original equine," became the 
horse story of all time, reaching worldwide sales of 20 million by 1935 and 
gaining a permanent place in the fantasies of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell's first and only novel (she died shortly after it was published) has 
been brought to the screen several times, but screenwriter Caroline Thompson 
("Edward Scissorhands," "Homeward Bound," "The Secret Garden") was happy with 
none of the attempts. She wanted to stick closer to the original, and, as a 
lifelong horse lover, felt the only way to guarantee that was to make the film 
her directing debut as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Created, as the novel was, from the heart, this latest version of "Black 
Beauty" is as simple and straightforward as its source. Though not especially 
inspired, it uses integrity to make up for that lack, and its unaffected "just 
the oats, ma'am" approach makes it a fine film for younger viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 While she has made some small changes in the plot, Thompson has retained the 
book's straight-from-the-horse's-mouth conceit. Introduced happily grazing by a 
limpid stream, Black Beauty is quick to tell us (in a voiceover read, sometimes 
too enthusiastically, by Alan Cumming), that things weren't always so cushy. 
"Mine is a story of trust and betrayal and learning to trust again," the horse 
informs us. "And I remember everything." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything" includes the act of being born (something Sewell wouldn't have 
dreamed of describing) into a pleasant farm in that storybook England where the 
gentry ruled and servants knew their place. Between kindly Farmer Grey (Sean 
Bean) and Beauty's wise mother, he learns all he can before reality takes over. 
"We don't get to choose the people in our lives," Beauty astutely points out. 
"For us, it's all chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The first family Beauty lands with is a good one, and the horse is put under 
the wise care of the aptly named John Manly (Jim Carter) and his good-hearted 
but initially clueless assistant Joe ("Secret Garden's" Andrew Knott). 
</P>
<P>
 But even performing heroic deeds and risking his life can't save Beauty from 
being sold into the stables of unfeeling aristocrats Lord and Lady Wexmire 
(Peter Cook and Eleanor Bron), where all horses must be slaves to fashion 
though they be treated cruelly in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Sewell, an animal-rights activist before her time, wrote 
"Black Beauty" was to forcefully protest the several ways horses were 
mistreated, and to Thompson's credit this aspect of the book is given its due 
and the philosophy that "kind treatment makes good horses" enthusiastically 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, perhaps the most curious change from the book, and one whose 
silliness will be apparent even to those who haven't read it, is the decision 
to jump-start the relationship between Beauty and Ginger, the high-strung mare 
who is his sometime stablemate. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the best Victorian tradition of the original, the two horses told the 
press they were just good friends, the film has Beauty fall giddily and rather 
preposterously in love with Ginger, to the point of exclaiming at one point, 
"She likes me, she really likes me." Perhaps Thompson felt the staid original 
needed a bit more juice, but this solution is not a workable one. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the energetic American quarter horse who plays Beauty is deservedly the 
film's center of attention, the picture comes most alive in its second half, 
when David Thewlis enters as Jerry Barker, the kindly London cabbie who shows 
the horse what it's like to live and work in the big city. 
</P>
<P>
 While this simple part is literally a drive through the park for Thewlis after 
his agonizing starring role in Mike Leigh's "Naked," his ability to bring a 
level of emotional connection to the portrayal makes his scenes stand out as 
the most believable around. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson also gets good marks for resisting the temptation to 
over-sentimentalize "Beauty's" story. But, more workmanlike than dazzling as a 
director, she is unable to bring the kind of excitement or magic to the project 
that animated a classic horse movie like Carroll Ballard's "The Black 
Stallion." This picture is not that kind of thoroughbred, but it is solid and 
dependable, and those qualities are no doubt rarer in films than they are in 
horses.

MUSIC REVIEW ; TALMI, CHANG OFFER SUMMER WONDERS, INDOORS, IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: What does lucky San Diego have in the good old summertime that Los 
Angeles doesn't? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: A little night music indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The key word is indoors . It has become an increasingly nice word. It makes 
one think small. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, Angelenos have been conditioned to regard post-season 
orchestral programs as massive starlit orgies in which the listnin' is easy. 
Audiences can approach 18,000 -- even 53,000 if you're thinking tenorish. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing intrinsically wrong with that. Gargantuan picnic serenades can 
be fun, so long as the participants on both sides of the proscenium don't 
confuse the events with lofty aesthetic experiences. Alfresco bowling 
tournaments in Hollywood are compromised, virtually by definition, by sonic 
distortion and social distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer in brave and sophisticated San Diego, however, the local 
orchestral forces are playing four major concerts in Copley Symphony Hall, 
capacity 2,255. Bless them. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have a roof over their heads. The sound, predicated on 
old-fashioned natural balances, actually accommodates subtle detail in proper 
perspective. The atmosphere is serious if not somber, the ambience relatively 
intimate. The music is the thing. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no microphones here. No fireworks. No airplanes. No police sirens. 
No tenors. No picture shows. No narrators. No wine-bottle rolling contests on 
concrete steps. No obligatory anthems. No wise guy yelling, "Play ball." No 
skunks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 The bliss for a capacity audience downtown on Wednesday could be attributed to 
two heroes: Yoav Talmi, the sensitive music director from Tel Aviv who was 
making his last appearance of the season, and Sarah Chang, the 13-year-old 
violinist from Philadelphia who was reconfirming her position on the brink of 
what should be a phenomenal career. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing Bach's Third "Brandenburg" Concerto as a clockwork prelude to 
grandiose indulgences of Schubert and Sibelius, Talmi began the festivities 
with better intentions than executions. He earned credit for personally manning 
the harpsichord. Unfortunately, his modest continuo realization seemed all but 
inaudible from a seat at the front of the balcony, and his finger movements 
suggested a certain lack of invention. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the stylistic problems, he utilized 26 strings -- more than 
necessary under the circumstances. Ensemble textures tended toward mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief came with the Schubert Fifth Symphony in an exceptionally poignant 
performance notable for graceful exposition, gentle propulsion and elegant 
shading. The Bachian miscalculations were easily forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional program structure always places the concerto before intermission. 
But Talmi, who obviously recognizes a stellar climax when it beckons, saved the 
Sibelius Concerto -- and, possibly, the best -- for last. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang made the most of her opportunity, playing the nostalgic showpiece with 
degrees of poise and passion that seem virtually indecent in one so young. 
There was nothing studied, nothing dutiful in a performance etched in dark, 
ample, resonant tone and articulated with awesome virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang made it all sound easy. Remember her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Talmi and the San Diego Symphony provided vibrant, alert, sympathetic 
collaboration. In this instance, the word accompaniment would be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remaining concerts in the summer series at Copley Symphony Hall, 750 B St., 
San Diego, at 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 3 (George Cleve, guest conductor, Andre Watts, 
soloist) and Aug. 17 (Henry Lewis, guest conductor, Marilyn Horne, soloist). 
Tickets: $18.50-$55 (Military, senior and student discounts 50%.) Special $10 
tickets available at box office from noon to 1 p.m. on day of concert.

JAZZ REVIEW; BARRON ENTRANCES, ENRICHES WITH TWISTS ON THE PIANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART * Kenny Barron plays today through Sunday, 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
(7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Sunday), at the Jazz Bakery, 3221 Hutchison Ave., 
Culver City. $15, refreshments included. Information: (310) 271-9039.

<TEXT>
<P>
 With turns angular and aggressive, sumptuously melodic and ardently swinging, 
pianist Kenny Barron opened his first Los Angeles club run in 15 years 
Wednesday at the Jazz Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by the sure hands of bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Sherman 
Ferguson, Barron, 51, was resplendent.Still, in the course of his first set, he 
gave listeners not only a history of jazz piano, but also an unspoken 
demonstration of what jazz is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Packed discretely into Barron's versions of "There Is No Greater Love," 
"Rhythm-A-Ning," "Embraceable You" and an excruciatingly lovely "Body and Soul" 
were stride gallops, jack-rabbit runs, smooth lines that gleamed like garlands 
of pearls held up to a lamp, boppish phrases that twisted like a DNA double 
helix, humor-driven chordal whams and atonal whirls. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than part and parcel, what the enthusiastic audience at the Bakery 
really heard was Barron, the complete artist who wove these multifarious facets 
into a style that both entranced and enriched. For the pianist is the kind of 
artist who, on cursory listen, delivers bouquets of gorgeous notes, but with 
deeper attention paid, goes beyond mere offerings of beauty to reveal the 
emotional range of human existence. It is hard to imagine not being touched by 
what he plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpkins and Ferguson provided Barron with easy-chair comfort and support 
despite the lack of a rehearsal; this band should be quite something by the end 
of its engagement Sunday. ZAN STEWART * Kenny Barron plays today through 
Sunday, 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. (7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Sunday), at the Jazz 
Bakery, 3221 Hutchison Ave., Culver City. $15, refreshments included.

RESTAURANTS; CAFE CAMELLIA: THE SECRET'S IN THE SAUCE (S) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I didn't want to go to Bellflower to eat, and nobody I knew wanted to go there 
either. I'd been to enough French and Continental restaurants out in the 
suburbs and eaten my share of murky wine sauces, too much tarragon and strange 
specialties of the house including, at one place, alligator. And I'd dragged my 
friends to enough far-flung fiascoes to make them equally balky. But recently, 
I had a house guest who wanted to take me out to dinner. "If you are a true 
friend," I said, "you would let me take you to Bellflower, to Cafe Camellia." 
</P>
<P>
 I knew nothing about Cafe Camellia, but someone had given me a menu. Except 
for calamari Szechwan and blackened mahi mahi and Cajun shrimp, the menu was 
hard-core Continental (duck liver pate, petrale sole Duglere, escalope of veal, 
duck in cherry sauce). "Continental Drift cuisine," we named it, and my house 
guest announced with great snobbery and ingratitude, "There is nothing here I 
want to eat, except maybe lamb chops." 
</P>
<P>
 We found Cafe Camellia next to a car window tinting shop four blocks north of 
the 91 Freeway on Bellflower Boulevard. The two white-walled dining rooms were 
spare, simple, elegant. The flowers were fresh; the tablecloths damask. We 
scanned an ambitious, lengthy, reasonably priced wine list and ordered 
starters. Fluffy dinner rolls were shaped like amorphous croissants. My guest 
held one up. "The places I've let you drag me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But then came Cajun shrimp, four fat, sweet prawns lightly blackened with 
ground chile and salt; the saltiness was smoothed by a mild pepper cream sauce 
and a tuft of barely cooked spinach added a pleasing vegetal crunch. Next, we 
ate slippery, sexy slices of eggplant marinated in sesame oil and garlic and 
topped with thin, wiry shreds of cheese. By then, we knew we were in seriously 
competent hands, and nothing contradicted this. Spinach salad had only the 
faintest, most beguiling hint of tarragon in its smart, warm lemony dressing. 
White bean soup du jour was a clear, full-bodied broth smoky with good pancetta 
.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Poached salmon came swathed in an unimaginably light and subtle sour cream 
dill sauce. My surly house guest ate his words along with excellent, juicy lamb 
chops. Entrees were served with beautifully steamed fresh vegetables and true 
scalloped potatoes: sliced potatoes baked in cream. We felt great shame for our 
unwarranted prejudices. In penance, we cleaned our plates. 
</P>
<P>
 That first dinner was the best, partly because of the sheer thrill of having 
our expectations so soundly dashed, and partly because we came rather late on a 
slow evening, and there weren't many other plates vying for the chef's close 
attention. The food was never less than lovely. But that night, the chef agreed 
-- grudgingly -- to make for us a lovely, crusty, custardy chocolate souffle 
with a Gran Marnier sauce for drizzling. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a restaurant of sauces, which sounds -- and is -- retro. Sauces, 
especially cream sauces, have fallen into ill favor precisely because they 
often aren't as varied or restrained as those found here. A spirited fresh 
tomato sauce spikes crunchy bites of creamy, bland fried buffala mozzarella. 
Triangular wedges of calamari stew in a clear sauce of soy, red peppers, onions 
and whole roasted garlic. Poached veal sweetbreads provide a pillow of 
exquisite blandness for a sauce of goose liver and shaved truffles. One risks 
inebriation, however, with forest mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Salads are fresh and lovely, although the Caesar needs better quality Parmesan 
cheese. The only weak link on the menu is the pasta; the combination pasta 
plate with ravioli, gnocchi and fusilli is dull, and pasta primavera, despite 
lovely fresh vegetables, is gluey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crispy duck" is moist and flavorful, but not crispy. The kitchen does have a 
tendency to repeat itself: Fresh yellowtail, a special, shows up in the same 
spices and pepper cream sauce as the Cajun shrimp and, good as it is, I wish 
I'd tried the escalope of venison, or swordfish with artichokes -- something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts, from Camellia's sister restaurant, Boulevard Bistro, tend toward 
fussy cakes and tarts. Better to wait for the room to clear, and beg a souffle. 
* Cafe Camellia, 16916 Bellflower Blvd., Bellflower , (310) 866-2824. Open for 
lunch Monday-Friday, dinner seven nights. Beer and wine served. Major credit 
cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$66.

RESTAURANTS; PEDALS: FEAST FOR THE EYES AND PALATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having brunch on the terrace of Pedals, the casual seaside cafe in Shutters 
Hotel, one is often the subject of envy. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe sits right beside the Santa Monica Strand, and not infrequently, a 
bicyclist or pedestrian peers in, face transfixed with longing, as if wishing 
he or she too were sitting among burgeoning pink geraniums under umbrellas and 
eating a salad of butter lettuce and fresh rock shrimp or a big plate of raisin 
French toast with hot berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Such longing is absolutely appropriate. In a beach town whose major seaside 
restaurants are located on traffic-clogged thoroughfares, Pedals comes as a 
pleasant surprise. Casual, moderately priced, with a smart, appealing 
California-style menu, Pedals is like a more refined Crocodile Cafe -- the 
prices aren't that much higher, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the pleasure of visiting here is first walking through the hotel's 
lovely art-filled lobby, stopping for a drink on the outdoor deck or pausing to 
giggle at William Wegman photographs of Weimaraner Fay Ray riding a bike and 
surfing on an ironing board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pedals is at beach level, or actually slightly below: sunken to where one's 
eyes are approximately at pedal level of passing cyclists. The dining room is 
bright, gleaming and noisy with a large open kitchen. Pretty wooden tables are 
paired with lavish postmodern wooden cafe chairs. Chandeliers hang like big 
face-down suns with wrought-iron rays. Wall sconces are smaller spiky suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows are wood-sashed and wide; on a warm day, they slide sideways to admit 
the ocean breeze. Although a window seat is preferable, from almost every 
table, one sees strand, sand, well-lit palm trees, bike path, surf and, 
depending on the hour, blue sky, sunset or starry night.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem -- and of course, there is one -- lies in the service, which can 
be very good on some occasions and downright terrible on others. Entrees either 
arrive right on top of our appetizers or an exceedingly long time after we 
finish them. Waiters are sweet, inexperienced and easily overwhelmed. Once, 
during a rush, I waited more than a half-hour to order dessert. Until the staff 
is stronger, I'd avoid Pedals at peak dining hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingredients are fresh and generally well-handled. The pan-fried crab cake, 
made with lumps of Dungeness crab, is absolutely delicious. And it should be: A 
single not-large patty is $8. A peppery mesclun mix is dressed with a white- 
miso dressing; the Caesar, made with crisp inner leaves of romaine, has 
unusually good croutons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soups aren't as successful: Chilled potato-and-garlic soup has a bouillon 
cube-like saltiness, and chicken soup with udon noodles, despite wonderful fat, 
slippery noodles, is lukewarm, lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedal's new chef is Nicholas Coe, formerly of the Brentwood branch of 
Mezzaluna, which leads me to believe that there's hope for the pizza. Unlike 
Mezzaluna's great pies, Pedal's pizzas so far wear way too much cheese on a 
dull crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the pastas, Singapore-style pan-fried noodles, is spicy -- good but tricked 
up with too many slivered vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 A rotisserie half-chicken, golden brown, plump and juicy, comes with mashed 
potatoes laced with pureed roast garlic and terrific grilled asparagus. Perfect 
French fries and a green salad accompany a cloud-light piece of Chilean sea 
bass, but the plate is so hot it wilts the salad. Marinated sirloin steak is a 
bit overcooked -- still, it comes with great, garlicky Argentine chimichurri 
sauce and a side of black beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are straightforward, large and delicious, and should be enjoyed with 
the excellent house coffee or one of a wide selection of good teas. The dessert 
called fruit band is puff pastry, pastry cream and fresh berries; cheesecake a 
pure white wedge of richness in a pool of warm berries. Ben and Jerry ice 
creams come with an optional waffle cone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pedals, 1 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica, (310) 458-0030. Breakfast, lunch and 
dinner seven days. Sunday brunch. Full bar. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner 
for two, food only, $26-$60.

JAZZ NOTES: HOLLYWOOD VENUES REMAINING VIABLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there a curse on jazz in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two months, two of Hollywood's three main jazz venues -- the Vine 
St. Bar & Grill and Legends of Hollywood -- have either closed or relocated. 
Only Catalina Bar & Grill remains as a viable commercial entity. 
</P>
<P>
 So can jazz survive in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 Not right now, says Bob Marks, who has moved his Legends of Hollywood to a new 
location in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, say both Ron Berenstein, the owner of the now-defunct Vine St., and 
Catalina Popescu, proprietor of the club that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds just didn't want to come to Hollywood. They were afraid," says 
Marks, referring to the area's high crime rate and rundown appearance. Marks, 
who closed his delicatessen-jazz club in May, added that the neighborhood 
wasn't developing as fast as necessary for businesses to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is convinced that Hollywood will be wonderful, but it may take 10 
years longer than I could wait," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Popescu, on the other hand, continues to book top-name jazz talent and says 
that the area is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy," she says. "There is no problem with being located in 
Hollywood. None at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business at the room is generally good," Popescu says. "Sometimes it's fine, 
sometimes it's not, but it's always been this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Popescu's positive assessment, rumors have gone around for some time 
that she is looking for a new location. Popescu is adamant that such talk is 
unfounded. "It's not true, not one word," she says. "We are not selling. In 
fact, we are thinking of doing some more improvements (the club was remodeled 
just two years ago)." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he closed Vine St. after a 15-year run, Berenstein gave Hollywood 
an overall good rating. "The area has no negatives," he says. "I don't know 
that anywhere has a great potential for jazz, so in that respect, Hollywood is 
not better, or worse, than any other area. It's more about who an artist is, 
when they last appeared here, how they are promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason his establishment closed, Berenstein says, was not Hollywood but a 
general downturn in the economy. He cites "the continual bombardment of 
incidents like the (1992) riots and fires that were felt citywide, and the 
conscious (decisions) by jazz lovers" to stay at home rather than attend a 
nightclub performance. "Hollywood has great potential," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Marks is thrilled to be in Studio City. His Legends of Hollywood 
is now located on Ventura Boulevard, midway between the Baked Potato in North 
Hollywood and La Ve Lee in Studio City. "This could be like the new jazz mecca 
of Southern California, and I wanted to be in on the deal," Marks says. 
</P>
<P>
 Legends, located at 11720 Ventura Blvd., in the building that formerly housed 
the St. Mortiz restaurant, opened last Sunday with a celebrity jam session. 
Marks plans to have music three nights a week for the time being, then expand 
to as many as seven nights. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Legends serves no alcohol, but a beer and wine license should be 
in effect in 45 days; a full bar is expected to be in by early 1995, Marks 
says. The establishment is open for lunch, Monday through Friday, and dinner 
seven nights. Lunches are deli style, and range in price from $6.95-$9.95, 
while Continental cuisine is on tap for dinner, with such items as shrimp 
scampi, prime rib and sauteed orange roughy priced between $12.95 and $24.95.

<P>
 Bye-Bye Birdland: After 17 years in a prime downtown Long Beach location, 
drummer-entrepreneur Al Williams is closing his jazz club, Birdland West. "I'm 
just tired, man," he said. "I had to be there all the time. I'm 51 now, and 
I've done enough for jazz. Now I want to play some music, play with my 
grandchildren, shoot some hoops and enjoy life." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who operated the Jazz Safari spot near the Queen Mary for nine years 
before opening Birdland West, is closing his club on Sunday. He said a decline 
in business wasn't at the root of the closing. "Business is down, but not out," 
he said. "We're no more down than anyone. I'm just tired of the hassle of 
day-to-day operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The drummer, who also produces the Long Beach Jazz Festival -- which will be 
held Aug. 12-14 at the city's Rainbow Lagoon -- plans to hold a closing-night 
bash. On tap will be Eddie Harris, Poncho Sanchez, Lorez Alexandria, Ernie 
Andrews and many others who have performed at Birdland West. Information: (310) 
436-9341. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Bakery Still Cooking: The Jazz Bakery, which had been scheduled to relocate a 
few doors west to its new digs in the old Helms Bakery complex in Culver City, 
has postponed that move until Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Ruth Price, musical director of the nonprofit Jazz Bakery, will plan 
the room's debut around a performance by be-bop masters Terry Gibbs (vibes) and 
Buddy DeFranco (clarinet). Information: (310) 271-9039.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; OFFSPRING HIGHLIGHTS START OF PUNK FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seattle grunge may be the heartbeat of current commercial rock, but young 
suburbanites still need heavy doses of pure, hard-core punk. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday at the Hollywood Palladium, they celebrated the opening of the 
Epitaph Summer Nationals, a three-day, sold-out punk-rock extravaganza that 
will feature 13 bands and some 15 hours of unadulterated moshing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kick-off show, teens in baggy mall shorts and boots slammed non-stop to 
five bands while large video screens showed images of skateboarders, body 
piercing and race car crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Local independent label Epitaph Records, owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett 
Gurewitz, is sponsoring the shows, which feature mainly the label's bands, 
including the opening night lineup of Offspring, Claw Hammer, Down by Law, Ten 
Foot Pole and the Red Ants. 
</P>
<P>
 Offspring, the charismatic Orange County quartet famous for its hit "Come Out 
and Play" (you know the line: "Gotta keep 'em separated"), proved it was much 
more than just a one-off novelty act. The group, whose album "Smash" is on the 
verge of platinum, was by far the best band of the crowded, sweaty and loud 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Its songs are tight and lively, emanating the sticky kid-stuff appeal of Cheap 
Trick with the maniacal driving edge of Orange County's early '80s seminal punk 
group, the Adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Dexter Holland, who dove into the crowd sporadically, whipped his tiny 
blond braids around and let out bitter-sweet, high-pitched lyrics about gangs, 
guns and ex-girlfriends. The band played anthem-like songs with catchy pop 
hooks, breaking up the inherent monotony of hard core with fast breaks, chants 
and clever guitar accents.  
</P>
<P>
 Saluting its roots, the group brought Jack Delague -- the singer with OC's 
legendary TSOL -- and backed him on a brilliant rendition of TSOL's morbid 
classic "Code Blue." Most of the crowd, who were probably still in diapers when 
Delague's band first banged out the song, slammed in delight, but went truly 
ballistic when Offspring later played "Come Out and Play." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesser-known opening acts served mainly as backdrop music for perfunctory 
moshing and crowd surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Local band Clawhammer machine-gunned out a garagy-punk blend, bringing out 
mentor Wayne Kramer of the MC5 for a rendition of "Kick Out the Jams." Though 
the band lacked any truly meaty songs, it delivered some haphazard fun. The 
following quartet, Down by Law, was too grinding and monotonous, making 
headliners Offspring all the more worth waiting for.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; A DARK AND PETULANT NINA HAGEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that grim, flannel-clad brutes have taken over, it's hard to find a touch 
of eccentricity and campy whimsicality in rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-enter Nina Hagen, who has been carving out a persona of dizzy, cartoonish 
flamboyance since the early days of new wave in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour that brought her to the Coach House on Wednesday night is something 
of a comeback for Hagen, although she has kept up a steady recording pace, with 
the new "Revolution Ballroom" her third album in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, Hagen may have been out of the spotlight, but she obviously hasn't been 
out of touch. She knows that dark and petulant is in, and that was the tone she 
set at the start of her 75-minute concert before lightening up later on. 
</P>
<P>
 With cover material that included the Ramones, Sid Vicious, Ian Dury and two 
Nirvana songs (plus a loopy country ode to "Kurtie baby . . . in the sky"), 
Hagen seemed intent on proffering her credentials as a godmother of punk. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no easy task she has set for herself, riding the old new wave, showing 
solidarity with its '90s heirs, and at the same time trying to do justice to 
her own diversity and eccentricity. With a serviceable but nondescript band 
proving no great help, the results were scattered but sometimes colorful. MIKE 
BOEHM

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BEAT GOES ON FOR LYNYRD SKYNYRD, NUGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the mid-'70s, Lynyrd Skynyrd spearheaded the rebel charge of Southern 
rockers, while Ted Nugent reigned as heavy metal's premier gonzo guitarist. On 
Wednesday night at the Greek Theatre, each act demonstrated that while its 
moment of pop triumph may be long gone, the music rumbles on. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening its headlining set with an acoustic segment, the band -- which has 
been regrouped since 1991 with Johnny Van Zant on lead vocals -- kicked some 
new sparks out of old favorites like "Saturday Night Special," with the group's 
trademark triple guitar attack sounding particularly effective unplugged. 
</P>
<P>
 When the band fired up its amps and began to run through its lengthy list of 
hits and crowd-pleasers, the energy stayed high even as the music became 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 The set peaked as a giant Confederate flag was unfurled to the guitar-driven 
strains of "Dixie," just before the band launched into "Sweet Home Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
 Nugent's ferocious set was a powerful showcase for his estimable guitar 
skills. Fronting a power trio, Nugent was something of a heavy metal harlequin, 
pulling faces and clowning about the stage as he ripped through "Cat Scratch 
Fever" and "Stranglehold" with virtuoso abandon. The longtime hunting 
enthusiast ended his set with a bit of archery, aiming an arrow at a guitar 
hoisted up at the rear of the stage. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

ART REVIEW; 'POP': REMINDER OF AN OFFBEAT CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pop '60s were important. After all, how many modern periods have been 
nicknamed for an art movement? Liberal and libertine, the decade said "yes" to 
everything, including the idea that everything is art and art is for the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 We're reminded of all that by "Printed Pop," a searching show of about two 
dozen oversize prints at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. Organized by curator 
Diana du Pont, it inhabits a handsome new graphics gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing better embodied the notion of Pop populism than the revival of the 
craft of printmaking, with June Wayne's Tamarind lithography workshop in Los 
Angeles leading the way. The idea was that printmaking's ability to produce 
multiple originals would bring prices within the reach of ordinary people. For 
a while it actually worked. Ed Ruscha's now classic "Standard Station" image 
could once be had for $75. Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe suite was $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop dealt in cliches and produced some great ones of its own, like Warhol's 
soup cans and Lichtenstein's war comics images. But cliches are always with us 
and thus seem eternally current, if not exactly fresh. "Printed Pop," drawn 
entirely from the permanent collection, has a cast of images sufficiently 
offbeat to bring the epoch back alive like some half-forgotten ditty from your 
high school prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop was a tongue-in-cheek celebration of everyday America, its history as well 
as its ephemeral present. Jasper Johns' "Souvenir" wafts suggestions of old 
19th-Century fool-the-eye barroom paintings that accidentally predicted both 
Assemblage and collage. Robert Indiana's "Number 5" welds grass-roots barn 
emblems to the poetry of William Carlos Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A flower-child sweetness hid behind Pop. Lichtenstein's picture of a drugstore 
lunch counter sandwich and Coke has the crooked smile of nostalgia. Tom 
Wesselmann's collage of Valentine cards is even more tenderly funny. It takes 
its title from a heart-shaped paper doily bearing the motto, "Macy's has loved 
you for 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes real anger slipped out. Even Warhol's fey facade could not conceal 
his outrage in "Birmingham, Race Riot, 1964." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop was later characterized as a species of smug aesthetic American 
isolationism. It didn't feel like that either then or in this exhibition. It 
evidences an open embrace that intended to include both a new audience and new 
places. The period marked Los Angeles' first day in art's larger sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruscha's ongoing international importance is suggested. His "Drops" depicts 
that word spelled out with illusionistic water and is a good example of the way 
he grafted the zing of native ad art to the insights of Surrealism.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Pop spirit gave Angeltown its first crack at the big time, it 
positively revived London. David Hockney became its updated Noel Coward and 
moved here, creating an interesting new aesthetic hybrid. His "Wind," showing 
little photographs blowing along Melrose Avenue, reminds one of Joe Goode. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite also happened. The American R. B. Kitaj settled in London to 
craft a subspecies of brainy Pop. His images look as if they were researched in 
the British Museum and pay homage to English pluck during the Blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Beatles and the Stones, Peter Phillips picked up a lot of Yankee Pop 
argot. He crafted it into images like "Crash" with its metal-flake car and 
tinfoil babe. They are as unshakably locked into their time frame as the 
classic Ford Thunderbird. 
</P>
<P>
 Things stay frozen in time. People don't have to. Many of the artists here 
have evolved since. The general direction for people like Malcolm Morley, Jim 
Dine, Kitaj and Ruscha has been toward a sadder-but-wiser form of humanism. The 
suggestion is that Pop, for all its postures of cool airheadedness, was always 
on the side of the angels.

THEATER BEAT: 'KIMCHEE, CHITLINS' LEAVES A MIXED TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fighting the inner "bogeyman" of racism is the subject of "Kimchee and 
Chitlins," at West Coast Ensemble in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 As the title suggests, Elizabeth Wong's play explores the frayed relations 
between African Americans and Asian immigrants.The heroine is Suzie Seeto 
(Julia Nickson), a Chinese American TV reporter who struggles with issues of 
fairness and racial identity while covering a long-simmering dispute between 
Korean merchants and black residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong has chosen to dramatize this tale in a highly stylized, story-theater 
format. As a result, the characters often narrate the story directly to the 
audience or act out abbreviated or symbolic scenes. Accordingly, Suzie is 
joined by black and Korean choruses (Nyra Crenshaw, Larry Gamell Jr. and Kevin 
E. Jones and Allison Sie, Benjamin Lum and Eddie Mui). 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Jaffee's briskly mounted production showcases both the virtues and 
flaws of this approach. "Kimchee" very effectively outlines the complicated web 
of resentment between the two groups. Yet dramatically the show dulls its own 
impact through repetition and unfocused conflict between two or more sharply 
drawn characters. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Kimchee and Chitlins," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd., 
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays 3 p.m. $15. (213) 871-0502. Ends 
Sept. 4. Running time: 1 hour and 55 minutes. SCOTT COLLINS

THEATER BEAT: 'SONG OF SINGAPORE': SILLY AND SPRIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gobs of time, money and energy have been lavished on the period musical "Song 
of Singapore," at the International City Theatre. The inside of the theater has 
been painstakingly transformed into a 1941 Singapore nightclub, complete with 
bar, dance floor and bandstand.The audience sits at tiny tables, while 
waiter-performers in tropical attire take drink orders (fruit juices and 
cappuccino only, for the anachronistic price of $2 a pop). 
</P>
<P>
 "Singapore" is somewhat slow-going in the first act, but picks up momentum 
after intermission, when the merely silly turns lunatic. Indeed, silliness 
reigns throughout, relentlessly so; the imminent invasion by the Japanese is a 
mere plot device in this somewhat flimsy parody. 
</P>
<P>
 But silliness is the point. Jules Aaron's lively staging and a determinedly 
sprightly cast keep the action mostly diverting. This Tiffany box show may only 
hold cubic zirconium -- but it's fun jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Song of Singapore," International City Theatre, Clark and Harvey Way, Long 
Beach City College. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends Aug. 
28. $16. (213) 480-3232. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes. F. KATHLEEN FOLEY

THEATER BEAT: LESSONS OF LIFE STIR 'DRAMA COACH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At one time or another in our lives, we have all had a teacher like Mari 
Rothka (Lorna Raver), the title character in Corey White's rich and moving play 
"The Drama Coach," now at Hollywood Actors Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 When she sees one of her students slogging through a dull interpretation, 
Rothka is liable to grab the startled actor from behind, cover his eyes and 
shout, "Don't pay any attention to me! Concentrate on the scene!" 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the play is devoted to Rothka's often hilarious attempts to whip this 
class of eager but naive acting students into shape. But "The Drama Coach" is 
really about how Rothka -- a left-wing protester as well as a talented actress 
-- survived the Communist blacklist of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of the text lies in the way it subtly and artfully links these two 
narrative threads after the class receives a visit from Lloyd Cone (John 
McKay), the movie star who betrayed Rothka many years before. We all survive, 
White suggests, by concentrating on the scene, whatever it may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Raver delivers a knockout portrayal of Rothka, whom she plays as a fiercely 
intelligent woman whose imperious nature belies her deep humanity. Fine support 
comes from Betty Porter, as a student with divided loyalties to Cone and 
Rothka, and Todd Fraser, who also directed. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Drama Coach," Hollywood Actors Theatre, 1157 N. McCadden Place, 
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays 8 p.m., Sundays 7 p.m. $10. (213) 856-8952. Ends

THEATER BEAT: 'FUNNEST': A MANIC NEO-VAUDEVILLE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sexually ambivalent teen-age girl, a mime who drives his roommate crazy and 
a Jaggeresque rocker -- these are just a few of the characters played by John 
Topping in his "The Funnest Show Ever Created," presented by Artists 
Confronting AIDS at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bearded and jovial Topping looks as if he is having the time of his life 
writing and starring in this manic, gay-themed "neo-vaudeville" show.But his 
irreverence and enthusiasm might be more contagious if the writing were a 
little sharper. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Harvey Perr, the 10 skits too often begin with a decent comic 
premise but never really go anywhere. In one sketch Topping plays a man who 
talks and walks in slow-motion. A comedy team like Bob and Ray would have had a 
field day with that one. But Topping stops at treating the tic as funny in 
itself, rather than as a means to clever wordplay or some unexpected twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bits are more derivative or even a little nasty. A skit about a girl who 
denies her own attraction to other women comes off as a transparent excuse for 
Topping to wear a gag costume that snidely caricatures the female body. And do 
we really need any more jokes at the expense of mimes, the world's easiest 
target? 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: SWEET, 'SENSITIVE' MIRACLE ILLUMINATES LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a beautiful white cat lounging on top of the garbage outside Tom 
Hanratty's apartment in New York's Hell's Kitchen, an unheard-of sight in this 
grimy, rat-ridden neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat must be an omen. A miracle is about to happen -- or so insists Edna 
(Carol Sigurdson), Tom's new volunteer reader. After all, it's Christmas. And 
Tom (Greg Mullavey), who was blinded in an accident eight years ago, is long 
overdue for a little seasonal magic. 
</P>
<P>
 The miracle is that the withdrawn and embittered Tom is lured back into the 
world of the living by the sheltered Edna, and that the two fall in love. 
However, by the end of Jim Geoghan's "Light Sensitive," now playing at Actors 
Alley, one realizes that the real miracle is the play itself, a sweetly 
sentimental drama that radiantly illuminates the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A thumbnail sketch of Geoghan's premise -- blue-collar blind man finds love 
with dowdy East Side girl -- sounds like an overblown television movie plot. 
And indeed, in the hands of a less masterly craftsman, this could have been 
sheer melodrama. But Geoghan understands how to move without manipulating, how 
to gently uplift rather than detonate. His is a simple tale of believable 
people, with all their fears, flaws, needs and nobilities presented intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Chambers directs with unassuming straightforwardness, the requisite 
approach to Geoghan's simple story. A formidable performer, Mullavey splendidly 
charts Tom's progression from surliness and despair to giddy romantic 
exhilaration. Carl Strano is also superb as Tom's longtime friend Lou, who is 
jealous of Edna's influence with his buddy. Sigurdson is, on first impression, 
less technically competent than the men in the cast, but her undemonstrative 
sincerity is ultimately very affecting. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Geoghan's play, it is a simple treasure to cherish, precious, with none 
of the negative connotations of that word. 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'POLTERGEIST' LASER DISC SCARIER THAN EVER

 Our fascination today may be on the side of the angels, but a dozen years ago 
far darker spirits made us shiver in our seats, thanks to Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poltergeist," which he co-wrote with Michael Grais and Mark Victor, put the 
otherworldly into the special-effects realm of George Lucas' Industrial Light & 
Magic. Director Tobe Hooper and co-producers Spielberg and Frank Marshall 
concocted a host of frightening special effects that made most of us sit up and 
take notice, or dive under the chair. 
</P>
<P>
 If you saw only half of the scary 1982 film because you had your hands over 
your eyes or caught it on television or videotape in its ludicrous pan-and-scan 
version, MGM/UA's new letterboxed (at its proper 2.35:1 aspect ratio), 
three-disc CAV edition ($60) is for you. Here is a chance to see it all one 
heart-stopping frame at a time, or even in slow motion, with full-gear Dolby 
Surround sound, in a beautiful transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of a typical suburban family (with Craig T. Nelson as the father and 
Jobeth Williams as the mother) doing battle against not-so-nice-guys from the 
other side who want their young daughter (Heather O'Rourke) is an exercise in 
breathtaking special effects and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 An accompanying promotional film on "The Making of Poltergeist" gives us a 
glimpse of how difficult it was to pull off, but leaves us wanting more. "There 
was a special effect in every sequence," Spielberg notes, as we see him 
explaining one effect he has in mind. It's a reminder that a second audio track 
explaining what went into each shot and effect would have made this laser 
release so much more valuable. It is not enough just to add production stills 
and an international trailer. This was a missed golden opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as scary, and a lot more lighthearted, is MCA Universal's laser bonanza 
"Abbott & Costello Meet the Monsters Collection" ($100, three discs). The 
repackaging of Bud and Lou's encounters with just about every other movie 
monster delivers 5 hours and 33 minutes of funny frights. All of the films -- 
"Abbott & Costello Meet . . . The Invisible Man" (1951), " . . . the Mummy" 
(1955), ". . . Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1953), ". . . Frankenstein" (1948) -- 
have been issued singly. Laserbits

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CROWDED, CONFUSING MI PIACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My first meal at Mi Piace was a business lunch four years ago. The explosion 
of Italian cafes in Los Angeles had just begun to reverberate in the 'burbs. My 
editor and I had both grown up eating in Pasadena's Roma Gardens, and he was 
thrilled to show me that the Rose City finally had a restaurant attempting 
trendier Northern Italian dishes. After an iceberg lettuce salad and an 
overcooked capellini alla checca, I did not want to dampen my editor's 
enthusiasm, but I could not share it. 
</P>
<P>
 I did revisit Mi Piace a few times, coaxed by friends who liked the look of 
the place. Old Town was still struggling to be born, and the white, airy room 
with enormous clean windows was as hip and with-it a venue as any in Pasadena. 
I disliked the inevitable wait for a table: There's no place to stand that is 
out of the way and the large plates of mediocre food did not justify the 
inconvenience. Passing by, I'd see people clustered out front in the evenings, 
waiting, and their desire seemed like a riddle to me. I'd peer in those vast 
clean windows, see the great snarls of pasta glistening on dark plates, and 
nothing in me responded. I'd eaten that pasta and now, it had no power over me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, the food sustained a large, devoted 
following even without critical acclaim. Still, the owners apparently wanted to 
elevate the restaurant's cachet and a year ago, they hired an executive chef 
with sterling credentials: Francois Kwaku-Dongo, formerly of Spago. For many 
months, Kwaku-Dongo's touch was seen only on the page of nightly specials 
handed out with Mi Piace's regular menu. Recently, a new menu was introduced 
that includes all the old favorites, plus a selection of Kwaku-Dongo's 
specialties. A sheet of nightly specials is still handed out. 
</P>
<P>
 After a spate of recent visits, in which I dipped into the new menu and tried 
various nightly specials, it would seem that Mi Piace has had more effect on 
Mr. Kwaku-Dongo than vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 An appetizer of stuffed mussels is solid in concept: mussels stuffed with a 
kind of dry rouille and sauced with saffron cream. The mussels are fine, but 
the stuffing looks like something you'd pull out of a drain and the cream is so 
overdosed with saffron, it has a scorched, medicinal taste. A salad of rare 
beef is a big clump of the usual mixed greens, dressed with what tastes like 
bottled dressing, and topped with ragged spokes of rare beef and chunks of 
waxy, unripe Roma tomatoes. The word that comes to mind for this $9 salad? 
Inelegant. 
</P>
<P>
 An even more disheveled appetizer has more heaped greens and tasteless Romas 
plus over-marinated cucumbers, a doughy egg roll and slices of quite delicious 
sauteed scallops. The salmon tempura has the same greens, uneven chunks of 
breaded and fried salmon and two shaggy avocado slices -- doesn't the kitchen 
have a sharp knife? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tasty, smoked duck-filled ravioli is the best thing we try. Swordfish is 
muddled by a thick gob of grainy mustard sauce. Salmon, overcooked, is cloaked 
in a cold, heavy tomato salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts can be just as dismal. The crust of a blueberry pear cobbler is soggy 
with butter. Three-chocolate terrine, astoundingly faint in flavor, rests in 
grainy espresso cream. An individual poppy seed lemon tart is powerful lemon 
curd in a crust scantly peppered with poppy seed. 
</P>
<P>
 I had somewhat better luck ordering off the menu, although not with 
appetizers. A goat cheese and eggplant salad is yet another heap of 
over-dressed greens topped with tomatoes and eggplant soaked in a strong, 
unappealing vinaigrette. It's July, the heart of tomato season: Why can't the 
caprese come with decent tomatoes? 
</P>
<P>
 But a linguine with scallops and rapini is just right, and so are ravioli , 
large rounds of chewy pasta filled with well-seasoned ricotta and spinach and 
topped with a decent marinara and shaved dry ricotta. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Spago chef and the new menu have certainly not altered Mi Piace's 
appeal: They're still lining up to eat, the wait is still long and awkward, and 
the food still eludes at least this critic's acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mi Piace, 25 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (818) 795-3131. Open seven days 
for lunch and dinner. Beer and wine only. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner

THEATER REVIEW; DANCIN' FEET DON'T FAIL '42ND ST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "42nd Street," the 1981 Broadway play based on the 1933 movie, is about as 
substantial as cotton-candy -- a sentimental feel-gooder with predictable 
romances, lots of tap-dancing and hummable tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a story about the making of a musical, and particularly about a 
down-on-his-luck producer who loses his leading lady at the last moment and 
gives a chorus girl a chance to make good. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of what established its place in Broadway lore was what was really going 
on behind the scenes of this show, which is, of course, a show about the world 
behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary producer David Merrick presented it on Broadway when he, like the 
producer in the story, desperately needed a hit. And it was the last play 
directed and choreographed by Gower Champion, who died the day the show opened 
(the cast wasn't told until they took their bows). 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden West College production that runs through Aug. 7 doesn't add 
anything fresh to the show, but it does a likable job. There's nothing much to 
chew on, but there's lots of fancy footwork and strong singing of some dandy 
ditties by Harry Warren and Al Dubin, particularly "Lullaby of Broadway" and 
"About a Quarter to Nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially good is Howard Mango, whose fine timing and strong voice drive the 
musical as the dour, sardonic producer Julian Marsh. Short on money, Marsh has 
to hire Dorothy Brock (Peggy Magee), a slightly over-the-hill star who has a 
sugar daddy to finance the play. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brock breaks her leg, Mango will have to close the show or give a 
talented young chorus girl, Peggy Sawyer (Julie Ertl), a chance to take over as 
the star. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Magee doesn't project the look of a star, but her strong voice and sure comic 
delivery satisfy nicely. Ertl, all perky charm, is the ultimate ingenue as the 
little girl from Allentown who wants to make good in the big city. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fast-tapping feet even convince us that there is something special about 
Peggy. Unfortunately, she never makes the needed leap to star status when she 
should blow us away in the final scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In supporting roles, Lili Lewis belts it out pretty well as Maggie, the show's 
co-writer and co-performer featured in the funny "Shuffle Off to Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Cote flashes a winning smile as Billy Lawlor, the male star smitten with 
Peggy, and does well in his opening number, "Young and Healthy." But the 
romance gets lost in Brandee Williams' busy direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors tend to focus on Julian Marsh's story, probably because they 
identify with him. And his tale does pump the heart of the play. But that 
shouldn't really hit home until the end. One should believe at least until the 
penultimate scene that this story is all about Peggy. And that's where Williams 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, her direction and choreography suit the show fine, pulling strong 
ensemble work out of the large cast, offering up nicely polished song-and-dance 
numbers as well as witty interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nick DeGregorio's spirited musical direction also brings out the best in a 
comically varied score (one of the jokes is that songs can be thrown into the 
musical-within-a-musical that have absolutely nothing to do with anything). 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Davis' imaginative sets and lighting may not convince us that we are 
on Broadway, but they sport lots of lovely touches such as floral-decked swings 
and giant coins that rise from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Thomas Babb's colorful costumes are similarly pleasing, though one 
wishes for something more dramatic for Peggy to wear in the "42nd Street" 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 For if only that final "42nd Street" number were stronger, one wouldn't wonder 
afterward whether Julian Marsh has a hit on his hands. And if that number was 
stronger, it would go a long way to giving Golden West College a hit as well. 
</P>

JAIL PROPOSAL ANGERS OFFICIALS IN ORANGE; CORRECTIONS: THEO LACY FACILITY COULD 
EXPAND FROM CURRENT 1,326 INMATE BEDS TO 4,480 UNDER A 'WORST-CASE SCENARIO' 
ENVISIONED IN A COUNTY REPORT. BUT SUPERVISOR STEINER SAYS THAT'S HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's Theo Lacy Branch Jail, located in Orange, could triple in size 
and house more maximum-security inmates under a proposal released Thursday by 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, calling for up to 4,480 beds at the jail under emergency 
circumstances, was described as an unlikely "worst case scenario" by county 
officials, but it was enough to anger Orange city officials already alarmed by 
the transfer of maximum-security inmates to the branch jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main county jail is supposed to be in Santa Ana. It's not supposed to be 
in Orange," said Councilwoman Joanne Coontz. "What's so disappointing about 
this is not the fact that prisoners are being jailed, but the fact that they 
are being jailed in our community, with the addition of high-risk inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner, who recently was appointed to negotiate 
with Orange officials in hope of reaching a compromise, stressed Thursday that 
it is unlikely the jail will ever hold 4,480 beds, the worst case outlined in 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
 That scenario calls for the expanded jail to operate at twice its normal 
capacity under emergency circumstances, which the report calls "highly 
unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I think that the (environmental review) process will clearly 
demonstrate that this site cannot support the worst-case scenario," said 
Steiner, who added that the adjacent Orange County Animal Shelter and 
Orangewood Children's Home would have to be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The support facilities would be totally overloaded. It's not very practical 
to accommodate 4,480 inmates because it would use every square inch of the 
facility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the expanded jail operates at "crowded capacity," as all county jails 
currently do, the expansion probably would increase beds there from the current 
1,326 to 3,378, according to Steiner and the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "This represents the beginning point in a lengthy process that could be 
challenged each step of the way," Steiner said. "The end result could be 
something completely different that the county and the city of Orange could 
live with." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 30-day period for public comments, the county will prepare a draft 
environmental impact report on the expansion, probably by November. The final 
EIR will not come before the Board of Supervisors until March, 1995, according 
to a schedule of anticipated key dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said the EIR will examine alternatives to expanding Theo Lacy, 
including increasing the number of inmates at the main jail in Santa Ana and 
expanding the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The report paints a grim picture of Orange County's exploding inmate 
population, and projects a need for at least 7,000 new jail beds by 2006. 
Steiner said the report, released by the Environmental Management Agency, was 
drafted under the guidance of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the whole scenario reflects the severe pressure on the jail system 
to accommodate inmates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls for three phases of expansion at Theo Lacy. The first, which 
Steiner said would cost $3.8 million a year for personnel and could be 
accomplished "very quickly," would add 358 beds by double bunking in already 
existing cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase calls for construction of two additional housing units that 
would hold 614 new beds. The third phase would involve construction of up to 
seven more housing units for 1,080 more beds, bringing the jail to "maximum 
capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 The final two phases would occur "over a period of years," said Steiner, 
costing $53 million to build and an additional $40 million yearly for 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a very significant expenditure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz said she is open to negotiations with Steiner and believes he is doing 
his best to compromise with the city. But she remains convinced that Orange 
will be forced to bear the brunt of the county's jail expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are continuing to get the expansion because no one else in the county 
wants it," she said. "It seems like it's time that the county starts to work 
cooperatively with us, instead of operating secretly and then dropping their 
plan on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to expand Theo Lacy and the county's transfer of 48 maximum-security 
inmates there in April have enraged officials in Orange, who say high-risk 
inmates and the sheer volume of prisoners could endanger homeowners and hurt 
local business. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange officials filed a lawsuit against the county in May, saying the 
transfer of prisoners violates state law, a court order and action by the Board 
of Supervisors. But county officials counter that the sheriff has full 
authority in managing the jail system as he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed expansion outlined in Thursday's report calls for new inmates to 
range from minimum- to maximum-security. Steiner said he thinks the sheriff 
should be granted the flexibility to house high-risk inmates there. 
</P>
<P>
 The report could serve as a launching point for negotiations with Orange 
officials regarding the future of the facility, he said.

HAVEN CAN'T WAIT; LOW-COST DAY-CARE CENTER SHORT OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As two boys scrambled atop colorful playground equipment nearby, Diane Prado, 
8, told why children enjoy coming each day to Pride Development Council's 
day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's lots of fun things to play with, and they take care of me" here, 
Diane said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diane and her classmates may soon lose this after-school haven, where she 
is fed, supervised and feels safe. The subsidized day-care center, in the 
city's lowest-income neighborhood, is struggling to stay open after a second 
year of sharp public-funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride Development founder Dorothy Lewter Davis said this week that unless she 
can raise more than $80,000 soon, she may have to close the 17-year-old center 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Diane and about 90 other children from the ages of 2 to 14 may 
lose the only day care their families can afford, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel real bad. I feel like the dream I had is gone," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Davis received $13,000 in block-grant funding after she made a 
vigorous appeal to the City Council on behalf of her nonprofit center. The 
grant falls far short of the $65,000 she requested. In 1992, the city allocated 
about $45,000 to the center and reduced the funding to $17,500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having financial trouble because they're not giving me the money I need 
to serve the clientele I have. To pull the money out of our school is to set us 
up for failure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials said they have done all they can to help the center 
and emphasized that there is simply not enough money to fund all the worthy 
community service programs nonprofit organizations that serve the area. A city 
commission, created to arbitrate among all the worthy applicants, had 
recommended against providing any funds to the child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pride Development day-care program costs about $250,000 a year to run, and 
its budget is paid through donations, student tuition and grants. Right now, 
the center needs money to pay for liability insurance, fix its buses, pay 
teachers' salaries and buy food for the children, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a single mother, created the day-care center to offer opportunity to 
predominantly low-income single parents saddled by family responsibilities that 
often keep them locked in a cycle of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The center, in a converted three-bedroom home on Sullivan Street, mostly 
serves children from the immediate neighborhood, but also uses its own buses to 
shuttle youngsters in from as far as Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Pride Development offers children supervised activities Monday 
through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and three meals a day. Children go on 
daily field trips, including excursions to libraries, museums and roller 
skating rinks. While many day-care centers charge $90 or more a week per child, 
Pride Development charges about $50 or less, depending on a parent's ability to 
pay, Davis said. 
</P>

 One recent morning, several youngsters scurried across the playground while 
others stayed indoors, toying with colored plastic blocks on a classroom floor. 
During a break from her play, Diedre Lewis, 9, of Garden Grove said she was 
worried about the center's future and her own. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, she is seldom bored and always has friends. If it were to 
close, "I'd be mad. I'd just be at home not doing anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what worries Davis most. Children left unsupervised with nothing to do 
are vulnerable to child molestation, kidnaping and other crimes. They are even 
more vulnerable to gangs, drugs and early pregnancies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride Development teacher Nancy Nguyen urged community members and businesses 
to support the center with donations and through volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are the future for us, and if we don't teach them at a young 
age, they won't have a bright future. They won't know how to set goals and be a 
better person," unless they learn from caring adults, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in volunteering can call (714) 543-2528. Donations may be 
sent to Pride Development Council Inc., 803 S. Sullivan St., Santa Ana, Calif. 
92704.

DANA PARSONS: SUCCESSOR NEEDS TO PICK UP WHERE CASTRUITA LEFT OFF 
</P>

 Pio Pico Elementary School in Santa Ana sits in one of the county's most 
impoverished neighborhoods. Of the 300 families with children in the school, 
about a dozen have a car. The median education level of the parents of Pio Pico 
students is third grade. That combination limits the life choices of those 
parents; part of Rudy Castruita's mission as schools superintendent was to see 
that it would be different for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita has left to take over the superintendency in San Diego County. The 
task now for the Santa Ana Unified School District's Board of Education is to 
find someone who can run the county's largest school district and yet not 
forget about a school like Pio Pico. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita was so celebrated during his 6 1/2-year tenure as Santa Ana 
superintendent that some consider him irreplaceable. To some parents who felt 
uninvolved in school life and to many students who felt little connection 
before to successful professional Latinos, Castruita took on almost messianic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one who could court the Santa Ana business community in the morning and 
hunker down with second-graders in the afternoon and tell them that he, too, 
began school not knowing how to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's always been his message: that 'I know what it's like not to have 
things, to be raised by an extended family,' " said Pio Pico principal Judith 
Magsaysay. "That means a lot to them. It's symbolic and it's tangible at the 
same time, to see someone who has struggled like they have." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked district board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji, a Castruita supporter, if 
his charismatic appeal makes finding a replacement more difficult. "I think the 
temptation for people is to want to clone, to get another Rudy, and I think we 
may be setting ourselves up for a major disappointment if we try to do that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we needed him to do in '88 he did, which was to improve morale, reach 
out to parents and kids and classroom teachers who sometimes felt neglected and 
forgotten about in the big picture," Yamagata-Noji said. "I think what Rudy did 
was give us all a sense of hope in a district that had been hit by some bad 
press and a lot of misperception and white flight. And in a city with a lot of 
gang activity and crime and violence, the district had an image problem and 
people were beaten down morale-wise, and he gave a lot of people hope. They 
just felt better about themselves and their work and were proud of being in the 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked her about the next superintendent. "I think the biggest problem we 
have now is morale (because of Castruita's departure), so if we have someone 
who can come in and pick up the human contact and be visible and connect with 
people and parents, that will really work. . . . I guess I'm saying everything 
is well in the district, and Rudy left us in a good place. What we need is to 
continue to come together. We don't need radical change. We're not looking for 
a superintendent to come in here with an agenda that will encompass a lot of 
changes in personnel and policies and direction, because we're pretty solid on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High school teacher Rick Bryan is a Castruita supporter but said recent school 
board elections suggest the district now has a divided constituency, as 
evidenced by 3-2 votes on issues. The next superintendent, he said, should be 
someone who can work with all groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the scuttlebutt around the district is that the two relatively new 
board members have taken credit for Castruita's decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Bryan if Castruita left at the right time. "I think so, in the respect 
that he worked extremely hard for things he thought were best for students, and 
he wouldn't have been comfortable if it were a situation where he had less say 
as far as autonomy. I saw him as a very dynamic leader who would only be happy 
if he were given ability to make some changes, and I don't think he would have 
been happy with the situation (of increasing trustee resistance). I know he 
wouldn't have." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan said interim superintendent Don Champlin would be a "perfect choice," 
but given the inherent difficulty in following Castruita's act and the 
increasing acrimony on the school board, Bryan wondered if an outsider may not 
have the inside track. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams Elementary School Principal Frances Byfield said, "I think Dr. Castruita 
left things in place, so programs will continue. My personal opinion is that we 
don't need someone to replace him. We need a new leader. We need someone who's 
just a leader in their own style. I would like to see someone who is hands-on 
and not just theory. I want to be able to know the person. I think it's 
important for the kids to know him, too, as well as parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, this anecdote that captures exactly what Byfield means: 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, Pio Pico parents threw a going-away party for Castruita. 
Saddened that he was leaving, one of them approached him and said, "Who will 
speak for us when you're gone?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You will," Castruita responded, meaning the parents as a group. 
</P>
<P>
 Before hiring Castruita's successor, the school board should insist that the 
candidate understands both the depth of that question and the answer.

ALL THE PRESIDENTS' NECKWEAR EXHIBITED AT NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Gerald Ford is the only U.S. President to occupy the White House without 
winning a national election. In a new exhibit on presidential neckwear, Ford is 
also the only chief executive represented by a polyester tie. But, hey, it was 
the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace, the neckwear display 
showcases the ties and accessories of Presidents from Thomas Jefferson to Bill 
Clinton. Nixon library curators hope the exhibit sheds more light onto a 
subject that has been "woefully neglected by political scientists," according 
to a sign at the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in June, thousands of library visitors have browsed through such 
presidential fashion items as Abraham Lincoln's bow-tie, Calvin Coolidge's cuff 
links and George Bush's red-and-green-striped Christmas tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit gives the public the chance to rate the Presidents' fashion sense 
-- and it isn't always complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Nixon's favorite dark blue tie with white stripes worn on a 1992 
visit to Moscow? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty boring," said Barbara Anderson, 44, visiting the library 
Wednesday morning from Sioux Falls, S.D. "It's really boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's predecessor didn't fare much better with some visitors either. A 
black-and-silver pin-striped tie worn by President Lyndon Johnson while signing 
the Air Quality Act in 1967 didn't do much for George Harris of Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Johnson tie," said Harris, 66, a retired aerospace executive. "Even when 
it was in style I wouldn't have worn that one." 
</P>
<P>
 While not a political favorite with visitors, President Bill Clinton drew much 
praise for his sartorial choices. A navy tie with printed red and green owls 
worn by Clinton when playing saxophone for Russia President Boris Yeltsin 
pleased Laguna Beach resident Pat Kelley, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care for him at all, I probably shouldn't say that," said Kelley, 61. 
"But I like his bright tie." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit runs through Sept. 6.

UCI SCIENTISTS LOCATE GENE FOR DWARFISM; RESEARCH: PRENATAL TESTING COULD 
IDENTIFY BABIES WITH A CONDITION THAT LEADS TO DEATH QUICKLY AFTER BIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine researchers announced Thursday that they have identified the gene 
that causes the most common form of dwarfism, called achondroplasia, the latest 
discovery in the controversial field of prenatal diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Molecular biologist John Wasmuth said the discovery will allow physicians to 
determine whether a fetus has the most severe type of achondroplasia. That form 
is invariably fatal shortly after birth. 
</P>
<P>
 With this information, he said, parents will know whether a child will be born 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be a relief to parents," Wasmuth said during his announcement at 
the Chemical Research Center at UC Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 Achondroplasia, which affects one in every 20,000 people, causes alterations 
in bone growth and development, resulting in an enlarged head, a normal torso 
and short limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 A gene test could be conducted after an ultrasound indicated that the child 
would be a dwarf, Wasmuth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although children who inherit only one achondroplasia gene are generally 
healthy, those who inherit two copies die in infancy. If both parents have a 
copy of the gene, each of their children has a one-in-four chance of inheriting 
two copies and dying as a result. The researchers' discovery of the gene will 
thus enable doctors to determine whether a fetus has one or two copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasmuth, who was also a member of the teams that discovered the genes for 
Huntington's disease and for colon cancer, said doctors now will be able to 
tell within the first 10 to 12 weeks of gestation if a child with 
achondroplasia will be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Schafnitz, the 5-foot-11-inch mother of a 4-year-old boy with 
achondroplasia, said the hardest part of her pregnancy was not knowing whether 
her child would live past the birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important is that more parents will choose to keep their children," 
she said. "There is a lot of relief involved, especially knowing the child 
would have normal intelligence and little to no medical problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Schafnitz said she remembers doctors giving her a thumbs up sign when her son, 
Alex, was born healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day Alex asks me (if he) can get a brother just like him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics argue that because of such advances in prenatal diagnosis, more 
parents will choose abortion if told early in the pregnancy that their babies 
will have some form of birth defect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are severely concerned, since it happened in World War II," said David 
Brookfield, district director of Little People of America. "Hitler wanted 
everyone to be blond-haired and blue-eyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brookfield warned that "If it was happening in the 40s with limited testing," 
there is an even greater possibility today that society could "eliminate 
differences we have in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Billy Barty, founder of the Billy Barty Foundation, which serves as an 
education and advocacy group, said something special would be lost if there 
were no dwarfs. In fact, some of the world's most famous people were dwarfs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know who was a dwarf, although we don't like to talk about it?" Barty 
asked. "Attila the Hun."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; ARTWORK STOLEN FROM ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thieves took a large, $1,600 painting from the Festival of Arts earlier this 
week, forcing officials to tighten security at the outdoor gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists say the theft is the first time such a large painting has been taken 
from the festival, where thousands of pieces of art are on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Paige Oden said she was stunned to learn that her uninsured 3-foot by 
4-foot rendition of the Madonna and Child had vanished sometime between 
midnight and 7 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like double whammy bad karma because it's a religious work they stole," 
Oden said Thursday. "I feel they just knocked the wind out of my fun for the 
summer, not to mention my wallet." 
</P>
<P>
 Festival officials met with about a dozen artists Wednesday to assure them 
that security has been increased around the 161 exhibits, which include 
paintings, ceramics, jewelry and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sort of incident is very unusual," festival spokesman Tim Wilcox said 
Thursday. "These grounds are gated. There are (locked) turnstiles up front and 
there's always someone there. We're frankly puzzled." 
</P>
<P>
 While praising festival security as "top notch," artist Pat Sparkuhl, a 
festival exhibitor since 1979, said the incident has made artists feel more 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we're realizing now is the festival is not immune to what's 
going on in society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said security guards are now making more frequent sweeps of the gated 
grounds, especially during off-hours. Five or six guards are on the grounds at 
a time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oden said she was especially saddened by the loss because the painting, 
entitled "Madonna and Child in Thought" was part of a body of work she created 
in response to the unexpected death last year of her father, Richard Oden, who 
had been chairman of the art department at Cal State Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that someone has it, that someone's hanging it up," she said. "I 
would do anything to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Created with acrylics, colored pencils, pastels and gold leaf, the artwork 
depicts a mother in profile, eyes downcast, with a child on her back. The child 
is looking straight at the viewer. It was framed and covered with glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have no suspects in the case. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CAMP GETS FUN DOWN TO A SCIENCE

<P>
 The softball field at Irvine Valley College became Mission Control on Thursday 
as about a dozen kids watched breathlessly as model rockets thundered into the 
air behind clouds of white smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, enrolled in a weeklong science camp sponsored by the Science 
Discovery Center in Costa Mesa, took special pleasure in bellowing the famous 
countdown that proceeded each blastoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three, two, one. Whoa!" exclaimed Devin Barbieri, a 9-year-old Irvine boy, as 
he watched one rocket being launched. "They are so impressive. It's amazing how 
high they go up." 
</P>
<P>
 The college was just one stop in a fast-paced week of science activities that 
touched on everything from astronomy to physics. Also on Thursday, the group 
used laser beams to send coded messages to Mars as part of a program that is 
repeated weekly for the rest of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocket launch was supervised by IVC physics professor Roy McCord, who 
explained to the children the principles behind rocket power and how the 
assorted projectiles worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a rocket launch, not a baseball game," said a smiling McCord as the 
children swarmed around a rocket to examine it. Their spirits soared when 
rockets blasted off successfully. They sighed when one rocket malfunctioned, 
falling apart in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a rocket before, and this is pretty cool," said Tiffany 
Daniels, 13, of Costa Mesa. "My favorite is when the rocket goes up and stays 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany and the rest of the group had a busy week. They have identified 
constellations, stars and planets in a portable planetarium, learned about 
Greek and Native American myths and constructed biospheres using marshmallows, 
noodles and Ping-Pong balls. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, each child sent a coded message to Mars by using the flashes of a 
laser. The laser images were sent into space through a telescope, said Janet 
Yamaguchi, director of education for the Discovery Science Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the message sent by children: "How are you doing?" and "How many rings 
does Saturn have?" SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LATINO GROUP MAPA FORMS NEW CHAPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new community association has been created to tackle political issues that 
affect Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is the Greater Orange County/Anaheim chapter of the Mexican American 
Political Assn., an offshoot of the Orange County chapter of MAPA formed in 
March. The county chapter is based in Santa Ana, however, so the new group was 
created to make it convenient for residents in Anaheim and surrounding cities 
to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Both chapters are part of the nationwide MAPA, which promotes Latino activism 
in politics, education and civil rights. The Anaheim chapter formally organized 
this month. The following officers were elected to serve on the new chapter's 
board of directors: 
</P>
<P>
 * President Rudy Escalante, a Korean War veteran and longtime community 
activist. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vice President Ross P. Romero, president of UC Irvine's Chicano Alumni Assn. 
and a real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secretary Olivia Porras, a Fullerton College student. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corresponding secretary Judith A. Safarini, a community activist and writer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasurer Tony Garcia, a business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Youth organizers Seferino Garcia, executive director of Solevar Community 
Development Corp., and Alfonso Alvarez, a counselor at the Orangewood 
Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
 MAPA's goal is "to include Latinos in the political process and to help 
cultivate viable Latino candidates," Romero said. Group members plan to promote 
student leadership in school and hold voter registration drives and candidates 
forums. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not too many organizations out there that are working with so-called 
at-risk youths or gang-affiliated youths," Seferino Garcia said. "We plan to 
empower youths by teaching them about what's happening in local government and 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Rueben Martinez, president of the Orange County chapter of MAPA, said his 
group welcomes the new chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos "are the fastest-growing ethnic group in California, and hopefully 
many chapters of MAPA will open throughout the state," Martinez said, adding 
that MAPA should have a chapter in every Orange County city "so together we can 
stand and fight for the rights of all people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Greater Orange County/Anaheim chapter meetings in members' homes on the 
last Wednesday night of the month are open to the public. Information: (714)

<P>
 Trustees voted unanimously to approve the new bus fee schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The change will not affect families with one child who rides the bus, but 
families with two or more children will save from $230 to $412.50 per year in 
comparison to the old fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old fee schedule, a family with two children who rode the bus would 
pay $730. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they will pay $500, which is the most any family will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 A family with three or more children riding the bus was charged $912.50 under 
the previous fee schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Families with one child riding the bus still will be charged $365 a year under 
the adopted change. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge for a second child is $135, while a third child or more are free. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was able to offer the bus-fee reductions after saving money by 
contracting with a new transportation company. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Frank L. Ury said he wanted parents with children who ride the bus to 
receive a bigger break because of the money the district saved by switching bus 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a great half-step," Ury said, adding that about 200 families 
would benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 But other trustees said they wanted to take a more conservative approach in 
the event the district's budget is hard hit later by cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Marcia Birch said she hoped the new fees would remain in place at 
least three years. JEFFREY BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; LIFETIME CARE DRAWS SENIORS TO FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Natalie and Jerry Roth this week moved out of their luxurious Los Angeles home 
and settled into a two-bedroom apartment in the Morningside retirement 
community here because of its guarantee to take care of them for the rest of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a marvelous home with three terraces, 80 rosebushes and all kinds of 
fruit trees and yet, we left it without regret because of the lifetime care 
offered here," said Natalie Roth, 79. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roths and about 50 other senior citizens organized their belongings in 
Morningside's new building, Gardenside, which was recently built. The couple 
now joins about 300 Morningside residents who live there for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big step but one has to be realistic," Natalie Roth said. "We've 
seen too many friends end up in miserable nursing homes because they postponed 
taking care of their futures too long. . . . Moving here is like living in a 
very, very resort area." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, who is 83, added: "Once we got here, we felt a big relief of 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get security because you know you'll be taken care of," said Rick 
Aschenbrenner, Morningside's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The community is the only place in the city that offers the lifetime care 
guarantee in which a 24-hour nursing facility and hospital are provided, 
Morningside officials said. But it isn't cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrance fees range from $97,950 to $372,950 and residents must pay between 
$1,226 and $2,450 a month, depending on whether they live in villas or 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials point out that the cost includes a meal a day, utilities, 
transportation and housekeeping services and computer classes. In addition, a 
billiards parlor and a pool are available. Activities such as golfing, crochet 
and dancing also are held on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's senior citizen population grew from 10.2% to 11.7% in 10 years, 
according to U.S. Census figures. Because of that growth, the $90-million 
Morningside project was built, Aschenbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People buy this product and get a feeling of freedom and peace of mind," he 
said. "It's a continuing care retirement community that really cares for its 
residents. . . . Many people feel it's like living in a fine hotel or being on 
a cruise." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; PLAN TO END MAYOR VOTE IS SUGGESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters may cast their final ballots for mayor this November. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members have agreed to require the city attorney to draft a 
ballot proposal for the 1995 election that will ask voters if they want to 
cease direct elections for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, an ordinance would set up a rotational system so council members 
would fill the job for a one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said she has heard from residents concerned that 
the change would revert the city to the "good ole boy" politics that prevailed 
before 1978. Before direct elections, the mayor was elected by the council.  
</P>
<P>
 Shirley L. Grindle, one of five members of a committee lobbying for the 
initiative, said the rotational system must be part of the ordinance. "If not, 
this committee will not support the measure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Mickelson, who presented the petition last week, said the two-year 
mayoral terms waste time and money. The measure can be seen as a streamlining 
measure, he said. "And this will strengthen the city manager form of 
government," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Robert O. Franks will draft the ordinance and present it in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed that the job of mayor pro tem, currently elected, 
would become a rotational job also. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would not have any politics then," Councilman Mike Spurgeon said.  
</P>
<P>
 The cost of a ballot measure is generally $4,000 to $6,000, according to City 
Clerk Marilyn J. Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will decide later whether the city should pay for ballot 
arguments against the measure as well as for those in favor. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY PLANS TO WHITTLE 54 JOBS FROM 
BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are proposing to eliminate 25 full-time jobs and 29 part-time 
positions to balance next year's general fund budget and help make $3 million 
in cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said most of the positions are vacant 
due to attrition and a two-year hiring freeze. Some of the jobs are occupied by 
people who plan to retire soon, and those jobs will be eliminated once they do. 
One employee, a public works counter clerk, faces layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga this week presented an update on the proposed 1994-95 budget to the 
City Council, which will discuss the cutbacks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson said she is pleased no fee increases that would 
affect residents were proposed to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not support any fee increases," she said, adding that, "Overall, it's 
a good proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said the budget will be balanced primarily by reducing expenses and 
staffing. But that will affect the quality and quantity of services to the 
public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the staffing reductions, departments affected include police, fire, public 
works, community services, the attorney's office, community development, 
administration and the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said four jobs in the Police Department are expected to be cut. Those 
include the positions of a captain, lieutenant, records manager and secretary, 
all of which are currently held by people who plan to retire this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Fire Department, three vacant firefighter positions and a vacant 
storekeeper's position to maintain supplies for fire stations are slated to be 
eliminated. But in April, 1995, three firefighters who will be trained as 
paramedics will be added to the department as part of a reorganization plan to 
increase paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve part-time, temporary employees are expected to be laid off to save 
money in the Community Services Department. A total of seven employee positions 
are expected to be reduced from Public Works Department staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga also proposes to increase parking fines to raise $128,000 and impose 
a new library fee of $20 a year for non-residents who use the library to 
generate another $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to adopt the $94.2-million budget for the next fiscal 
year by Sept. 30. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; 6 PICK UP COUNCIL CANDIDACY PAPERS

<P>
 Six people have taken out candidacy papers for the upcoming City Council 
election in November. The six potential candidates will vie for the two seats 
held by incumbents Carol Downey and Norman Z. Eckenrode, both of whom picked up 
nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the potential candidates is Dale Goodman, a member of the city's 
Advisory Council on the Disabled who is a frequent critic of the council. The 
former health care administrator was part of a group of people who protested 
last year's increase in the utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, 51, said she is considering running because the current council is 
out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't find too much in the way of open ears," Goodman said. "People who 
come to the podium (to address the council) are not treated with respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents who took out nomination papers as of Thursday include L. Ray 
Estes, 41, a traffic manager for a warehouse and shipping company; John 
Hoevers, 34, a senior account manager for an elevator company; and James Itow, 
49, a facilities manager for Orange County Superior Court.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; NOTHING ILLEGAL IN MISSING SCHOOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim police said Thursday that they have found no criminal wrongdoing at 
Esperanza High School, where school officials discovered that $65,000 is 
missing from the Associated Student Body fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chased everything, every check, every receipt," Detective Steve Whitson 
said."We never found one thing that proved anyone did anything illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials and an auditor reported that some of the money was 
misappropriated during the 1992-93 school year. The money was part of nearly 
$600,000 in income the student organization received in 1992-93 from 
fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor's report found several insufficient bookkeeping practices that 
have made it impossible for police and the auditor to trace the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Preston, activities director at Esperanza during the 1992-93 school year, 
disputed that the money is missing. Preston resigned from the school in June, 
1993. Four months later, an auditor discovered that the money was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Preston said Placentia Yorba Linda Unified School 
District officials were trying to blame him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deny that there is any missing money," Preston said. "The district is 
completely at fault and is trying to pin the blame on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left in June, all the records were complete and accounted for, and all 
the money was there," he said. "It was not possible to divert funds. Absolutely 
not." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY EXTENDS ADULT BUSINESS MORATORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For at least another year, city officials will not process applications to 
establish massage parlors, adult bookstores, strip joints and other adult 
businesses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Monday decided to extend until Aug. 7, 1995, a temporary 
ordinance that provides for a moratorium on adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time that the ordinance, originally passed on Aug. 9, 1993, 
has been extended. City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said Monday that he is still 
conducting surveys of neighboring cities to determine the effect of adult 
businesses on those communities while preparing a permanent ordinance. This is 
the final extension permitted by law. The permanent ordinance likely would 
contain similar restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the ordinance is not intended to limit or restrict adult-oriented 
materials, which are protected by the U.S. and California constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also considered as adult businesses are movie houses that show adult films, 
public baths, figure modeling studios, acupressure clinics, cabarets that 
feature topless dancers and strippers, and adult hotels and motels that feature 
pornographic movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager may grant exemptions to the ordinance under stringent 
conditions. An adult business will not be permitted within 300 feet of a 
church, school, park, playground, mobile home park or a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, adult businesses will not be allowed within 500 feet of each 
other. The building housing the business also must blend with the surrounding 
commercial structures. BERT ELJERA

LABORER CONVICTED IN BABY'S DEATH; COURTS: A JURY REJECTS THE HUNTINGTON BEACH 
MAN'S CONTENTION THAT HE DIDN'T ABUSE HIS FORMER GIRLFRIEND'S 14-MONTH-OLD 
DAUGHTER, WHO WAS KILLED IN 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach laborer was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and 
sexual assault charges for the beating death of his former girlfriend's 
14-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Yoshisato, who had maintained his innocence in the slaying, wept as the 
court clerk announced the verdict, his head in his hands. The 30-year-old man 
had been out on bail but was taken back into custody following the verdict, 
which came after nearly three days of deliberations by a Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 His family also wept in the courtroom as jurors found him guilty of murder, 
four counts of sexual assault and felony child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
 With the conviction, Yoshisato faces a possible sentence of 25 years to life 
in state prison when he is sentenced Oct. 7, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn 
Kirkwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor commended the jury for its work in the five-week trial, which 
at times contained graphic testimony of abuse and torture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of perseverance on their part," Kirkwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's mother, Pepper Grunbaum, was not in court for the verdict but 
testified during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very painful experience for her, a very emotional experience for 
her," Kirkwood said. "I just think she's trying to get through it the best she 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshisato's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Stephen J. Biskar, declined to 
comment after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Felicia Lynn Grunbaum was beaten to death July 10, 1990, in a Huntington Beach 
home where she lived with her mother, then 19, and Yoshisato. 
</P>
<P>
 The young mother and her child had moved in with Yoshisato, an unemployed 
laborer who raised dogs, shortly after Memorial Day that year in a "whirlwind 
relationship" that had started only weeks earlier, Kirkwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 40 days the three lived together, Kirkwood alleged the child became a 
victim of an escalating pattern of abuse at the hands of Yoshisato. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's upset with her crying," the prosecutor said during her closing argument 
to the jury. "His temper flares. He hated her. He wanted to hurt her." 
</P>
<P>
 But in his closing argument before the jury, Biskar said there were questions 
about who really abused the baby, suggesting it could have been the child's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you have to decide," he told the jury. "Who did it." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Biskar contended his client's only mistake was not acting to save 
the baby. "That's what he has to live with for the rest of his life," Biskar 
told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors rejected that argument and found that the boyfriend was 
responsible.

COUNCIL SPEEDS UP TRAFFIC LIGHT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criticizing the public works staff for delays in installing two traffic 
lights, the City Council this week accelerated the bidding process to get the 
lights in before school starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The signals, one near Edison High School and the other where Atlanta Avenue 
intersects Miramar and Greenfield lanes, were to be installed by June. At last 
week's meeting, the council was told the lights wouldn't be in operation until 
November. City staff said the delay resulted from errors in the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealed bids were requested last week and opened this week. The contract for 
$240,300 was awarded to Moore Electrical Contracting Inc. of Corona.

PUBLIC DEFENDER ALTERNATIVE OPPOSED; COURTS: COUNTY BAR ASSN. IS AGAINST 
SUPERVISOR STANTON'S PROPOSAL TO FARM OUT SOME OF OFFICE'S CASES TO THE LOWEST 
BIDDER, WITH THE AIM OF COST CUTTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried that legal services for the poor might suffer, directors of the Orange 
County Bar Assn. strongly oppose a tentative plan by the Board of Supervisors 
to farm out some of the Orange County public defender's caseload to the lowest 
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday night, the board of the 6,000-member organization passed a 
formal resolution against Supervisor Roger R. Stanton's effort to study 
alternatives to the public defender's office, which represents criminal 
defendants too poor to hire their own attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution stemmed from a measure passed by the county supervisors this 
week to consider a number of ways to cut the cost of indigent legal services. 
Among them is a pilot program to privatize a portion of the public defender's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the bar said Thursday they want to send a strong message to the 
Board of Supervisors, which has been tinkering for years with the idea of 
contracting out the public defender's cases to private law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Constitution provides for the right to counsel. It doesn't say, 'By the 
lowest bidder,' " said attorney Steven C. McCracken, the county bar president. 
"We see no reason to auction off the rights of the poor to profit a few people 
at taxpayers' expense." 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office has an annual budget of about $19 million, and 
its 123 lawyers now handle more than 60,000 cases a year. The bulk of its work 
involves criminal defense, but the agency also represents those facing 
commitment to mental health institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that private contracts for indigent defense, instead of a 
public defender's office, have been tried in other counties, often resulting in 
greater expense to the public and a lower quality of legal representation for 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable failure of the competitive bid process occurred during the 
1980s in San Diego County, where the poor quality of legal representation 
eventually forced the county to re-establish a public defenders office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Privatization does not work, and the track record shows it does not work," 
McCracken said. "We felt it was important that the bar association go on record 
with the public, the Board of Supervisors, and with the judges as supporting 
very strongly the present system." 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the bar association's 39-member board met Wednesday night to 
discuss the county's latest move to study privatization. Those present voted 
unanimously to oppose the pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton could not be reached for comment Thursday. But his executive 
assistant, Robert L. Richardson, defended the pilot program, saying the bar 
association leadership is overreacting and should keep an open mind about 
innovations that save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly they are entitled to their perspective," Richardson said. "But the 
role of the Board of the Supervisors and my boss in particular is to make sure 
people have an adequate defense and to spend taxpayer dollars responsibly. To 
say this can only be done by government-paid attorneys is not completely 
accurate. To suggest that a simple pilot project will undermine the public 
defender is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot project, however, is still tentative. The board has agreed to let 
eight county judges who serve on the alternative defense steering committee 
review the program, which could take another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Special legislation also would be necessary to exempt the pilot program from a 
state law that requires the public defender to undertake all indigent defense 
in counties where a public defender's office has been set up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not kill an idea before its tried," Richardson said. "Just because it 
failed in another county doesn't mean it can't work here. We are living in a 
fiscal environmental where every stone must be turned over and different things 
must be tried." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1971, the public defender's office has been audited and studied by 
county government, the grand jury and outside accounting firms almost every 
other year. Without exception, those studies found that the office is 
cost-effective and provides competent legal representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been talked about for 20 years in different kinds of ways," said 
Chief Deputy Public Defender Carl C. Holmes, the second in command of the 
office. "We've dealt with this issue, and all the studies have come to the same 
conclusion."

FIRM FINDS SMALL SLIDE IN FIRE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A geological report released Thursday appears to be a mixed blessing for some 
of this city's fire victims. It confirms the existence of a new landslide but 
states that it is smaller than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In its final report on the fire-damaged Temple Hills community, Geofirm, a 
Laguna Beach geotechnical consulting firm, found that 47 lots in the study 
area, including 11 properties that burned in the October fire, were in areas of 
"potential instability." 
</P>
<P>
 Fears that a larger, deeper landslide might exist caused concern among fire 
victims eager to rebuild and raised questions about whether owners of homes 
that survived the fire might also be required to undertake expensive 
stabilization measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, wrote the geologists, who said that "the suspected larger ancient 
landslide postulated by previous investigators is not present." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank expressed relief Thursday at the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had a 70-foot slide when the first geologist reports came in," 
he said. "So I'm pleased, actually. It's turned out better than I thought it 
would." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Gary Stoney, an engineering geologist who is one of two 
principals of Geofirm, said the slide area may be easier to stabilize than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, the new report "certainly couldn't be considered good news because 
a landslide was discovered," Stoney said. "But it is better from a workability 
standpoint, from a stabilization standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear how the latest findings will affect efforts to rebuild in 
the neighborhood, but the report said property owners are likely to be able to 
stabilize their properties on a "lot-by-lot basis." The report gave no 
indication how much such measures might cost, however, and Stoney said he was 
not aware of the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were endorsed by a second geotechnical consulting company, 
Leighton and Associates of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The report will be presented to property owners during a special meeting at 9 
a.m. Saturday in the City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, reports from geologists of possible problems in the Temple Hills 
area prompted city officials to asked Geofirm, based in Laguna, for the study. 
A similar investigation was underway at the time in Mystic Hills, another 
community ravaged by the Oct. 27 firestorm, which damaged or destroyed more 
than 400 homes in the Laguna area. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Geofirm recommended a more extensive investigation of the geology 
underlying about 68 Temple Hills lots.

SEARCH OF ALLEGED DRUG LAB FINDS NO LINKS TO UCI

 A search of a San Clemente couple's home turned up no evidence linking their 
alleged methamphetamine lab to UC Irvine's chemistry department, where the 
husband worked as an assistant, police and university officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Scarr, 34, a graduate chemistry student, and Sandra Louise Scarr, 37, 
were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of manufacturing methamphetamines and 
cultivating marijuana.They were both being held at Orange County Jail on 
$100,000 bail each, Irvine Police Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial searches of the Scarrs' home found no apparent connection between the 
seized material, which included beakers, scales, "large amounts" of chemicals 
and a "sophisticated marijuana cultivation system," Irvine police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still checking the chemistry department's records and inventory, 
Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Police Chief Kathleen Stanley said large and expensive lab equipment 
usually bear "Property of UCI" labels. It would be difficult to determine 
whether smaller items were stolen from the labs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no evidence that chemicals or materials found in the residence were 
from UCI property," Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Scarr worked in a research lab that specialized in bio-organic 
chemistry and molecular recognition, which is the study of how chemicals 
interact. Graduate students are not required to sign out equipment and 
chemicals they use, according to John Hemminger, chairman of UCI's chemistry 
department.

JURY CLEARS HUNTINGTON BEACH OFFICERS IN EXCESSIVE-FORCE SUIT; COURTS: ACTIONS 
OF 5 POLICEMEN DURING 1991 ARREST WERE REASONABLE, JURORS SAY. MICHAEL SCANLON, 
WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE DRIVING A STOLEN TRUCK, REPORTEDLY RESISTED ARREST. 
</P>

<P>
 A Superior Court jury ruled Thursday that five Huntington Beach police 
officers did not use excessive force when they arrested a man in 1991 who was 
driving a pickup that had been reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Scanlon, a 34-year-old paralegal, sued the officers and the city, 
alleging officers used excessive force during the traffic stop, including a 
type of neck hold that rendered him briefly unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jury, after about 3 1/2 hours of deliberations, ruled in favor of the 
city and officers Steven Schnars, Jack Paholski, Dave Bunetta, Brian Tedrick 
and Daryk Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority believed the officers' version of the events and concluded the 
force was reasonable and was not excessive," said Attorney Neal Moore, who 
represented the city and the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A sixth officer initially named as a defendant was dropped from the suit for 
lack of evidence near the end of the 2 1/2-week trial, Moore added. 
</P>
<P>
 The five remaining officers testified that Scanlon had resisted arrest. The 
trial "was a stressful thing for them," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers also had been cleared of any wrongdoing by a department 
investigation, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlon was disappointed with the verdict, his lawyer, L.G. Strickland, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically it was a battle of the experts as to the force used," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach man was never charged with a crime in the Jan. 31, 1991, 
arrest at Beach Boulevard and Slater Avenue and was released the next day. The 
stolen-car report stemmed from a dispute with a former employer that was later 
resolved, Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlon, who said he suffered neck and shoulder injuries, was seeking about 
$123,000 for alleged violations of his civil rights, pain and suffering and 
medical expenses.

DEAD BOY'S PARENTS SUE SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents of a 7-year-old who was killed by a pickup truck after he got off 
a school bus sued the Capistrano Unified School District this week, alleging 
officials were negligent in hiring and training a bus driver who did not flash 
his stop signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas William and Barbara Lanni said in their lawsuit, filed Wednesday in 
Orange County Superior Court, that district officials failed to design an 
adequate plan that would prevent students from getting off a bus at a wrong 
stop and that would provide assistance for students to cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Their son, Thomas E. Lanni, was killed on April 22 while crossing Aliso Niguel 
in front of a stopped school bus. Thomas, who had just moved with his family 
from New York, had been riding the bus for the first time. He mistakenly got 
off one stop before where his mother was waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning lights of the bus were not flashing. At least three of the 
students who disembarked at the stop live on the other side of the street, but 
the bus driver told investigators he was unaware any would be crossing to get 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the boy's premature death, the lawsuit stated, his family has been 
"deprived of (his) future support, love, care, comfort, affection . . . and, 
thus have suffered pecuniary and non-economic loss." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks an undetermined amount in general, special and punitive 
damages. The Lannis filed it after district officials in June denied their 
claim that made similar allegations. In that claim, Thomas' parents said they 
were seeking at least $10 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified officials could not be reached for comment Thursday.

MISSING MAN WITH ALZHEIMER'S, 65, KILLED IN HIT-AND-RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Texas man, missing since July 5 when he vanished while visiting relatives in 
Anaheim, was killed by a hit-and-run driver hours after he disappeared, police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members, who have been searching for 65-year-old Teodoro Carreon for 
nearly a month, identified his body Thursday at the Orange County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreon suffered from Alzheimer's disease and had wandered off once before 
near his home in San Elizario, Tex., family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreon was struck by a car as he crossed Garden Grove Boulevard near 9th 
Street about 4:15 p.m. July 5, Garden Grove police said. He was taken to UCI 
Medical Center, where he died a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took several weeks for authorities to identify him because he was 
carrying identification that bore the name "Teodoro Balderrama" at the time of 
his death, Anaheim police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the coroner's office initially filed the case under the name 
"Balderrama." Earlier this week, a deputy coroner saw Carreon's picture on 
television and recognized him as Balderrama, according to the police statement. 
</P>
<P>
 An Anaheim police spokesman said Thursday that he didn't know why Carreon was 
carrying the identification or if Balderrama was some sort of alias or middle 
name. Carreon's family in Anaheim and Texas could not be reached for comment 
Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreon disappeared after walking outside his niece's home near Walnut and 
Katella avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police are seeking the driver of the car that hit Carreon.

MARINE KILLED IN FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One Marine died and another was injured in a traffic accident early Thursday 
on the Santa Ana Freeway that left their vehicle "engulfed in flames," the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Marines from Camp Pendleton were heading south in a Ford Ranger pickup 
truck when it ran onto the right shoulder of the freeway just north of the Lake 
Forest Drive exit and crashed into a sign pole about 3 a.m., CHP spokesman 
Bruce Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no witnesses, but an unidentified passing motorist managed to help 
the passenger, 20-year-old Daniel Laflash, out of the pickup before it caught 
on fire, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the county coroner's office said Thursday afternoon that 
they were attempting to identify the driver through dental records.

WOMAN HIRES ALLRED IN RECOVERED MEMORY SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening a new chapter in a widely watched dispute over recovered memory 
therapy, Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred has been hired by an Irvine woman 
who contends that she forgot and later remembered that her father raped her 
when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The move marks the latest twist in the battle between Gary Ramona, a former 
top executive at a Napa Valley winery, and his daughter Holly, a graduate 
student at Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Gary Ramona won $475,000 after a Napa County Superior Court jury 
concluded that two Orange County therapists and a hospital had reinforced false 
memories of sexual abuse in his daughter's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict was hailed by critics of recovered memory therapy -- one of the 
most divisive issues confronting the mental health community -- and was said to 
mark the first time a non-patient had successfully sued a therapist for 
malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Allred is representing Holly Ramona in round two of the battle -- a civil 
lawsuit seeking damages for the alleged abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona contends that she had no recollection of being raped until age 
19, when she was a student at UC Irvine and began experiencing vivid flashbacks 
during therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 She first sued her father in 1990, charging that he molested her repeatedly 
between the ages of 5 and 8. In a newly amended version of the lawsuit, she 
claims the abuse lasted much longer -- until age 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred is a veteran of celebrated cases, many of them involving women. In 
1992, she helped a client win $500,000 in a similar lawsuit involving repressed 
memories.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YOUR MONEY; MONEY FUNDS FACE NEW WOES OVER 
DERIVATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problems apparently are not yet over for money market mutual funds that 
invested in so-called derivative securities, and at least one affected fund may 
be searching among its peers for a bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the Investment Company Institute, the Washington-based trade group 
for mutual funds, say that several money funds have contacted the ICI since 
July 1 "asking for advice on how to handle their problems" related to 
derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one money fund "asked for suggestions on others that might be 
interested in acquiring it," an ICI official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of a new round of losses in supposedly "safe" money market 
funds may come as a shock to the public, industry observers worry. A handful of 
money funds announced derivative-related problems in June, but the sponsors of 
those funds were large enough to quickly cover the losses without hurting 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's great fear is that a money fund will be forced to mark down its 
per-share value from the standard $1 level, because of an unexpected decline in 
the underlying value of the fund's securities. 
</P>
<P>
 That could set off a nationwide chain reaction among money-fund shareholders, 
who might begin to doubt the security of their investment. Money fund assets 
now total $595 billion, and the ICI estimates that Americans have more than 21 
million money-fund accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, money funds have invested only in extremely safe, short-term, 
debt instruments of the U.S. government, major banks or large corporations. 
Because most of the securities mature within a period of months, they fluctuate 
little in value -- which allows the money funds to maintain a stable asset 
value of $1 a share under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 That share-price stability, as opposed to the fluctuating share prices of 
stock and bond funds, has been a hallmark of money funds since they were 
introduced in the mid-1970s. Yet in effect, money funds' stability has created 
a perception problem for the industry: Most shareholders believe they can't 
lose in a money fund, even though the funds don't guarantee that. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the emergence of derivative securities as investments has changed the 
risk equation for some money funds and for mutual funds in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are securities whose value or returns often are tied to, or 
derived from, financial market trends rather than the fortunes of the 
particular issuer. In 1993, as conventional money-market security yields 
hovered at 30-year lows, Wall Street brokerages dangled a number of 
money-market derivatives before money fund managers, usually offering 
above-average yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch on most of the derivatives was that their value would plummet if 
market interest rates began to move up sharply again. Because few money 
managers expected a surge in rates this year, derivatives in 1993 and early 
this year appeared to offer a reasonable bet to some money-fund managers who 
were trying to juice-up their dismally low yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Federal Reserve Board began to push market rates higher in February, 
however, the result has been havoc in the bond market, and particularly in the 
market for derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, a long line of companies, and a handful of bond mutual funds, 
announced that they had suffered major losses on derivative bets that went awry 
as interest rates jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Few money market funds, in contrast, publicly admitted to derivative losses in 
the spring, though a number of funds are believed to have quietly covered small 
losses without fanfare. The worst disaster was at two of BankAmerica Corp.'s 
Pacific Horizon money funds. BofA was forced to infuse a total of $68 million 
to make up for derivative losses that otherwise might have caused the funds' 
share prices to fall below the $1 level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, more money funds are expected to announce that they must realize 
losses on their portfolios because of derivative securities held since winter 
or spring. Though the number of funds with derivative-related problems is 
believed to be small, any publicity generated nonetheless could affect all 
money funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the fund industry, everyone suffers from the failures of the few," notes 
Don Phillips, a principal at fund-tracker Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The new round of derivative-security loss disclosures may result directly from 
a warning issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission to money funds on 
June 30. The SEC told the funds to get rid of derivatives that don't fit the 
parameters the agency has previously laid out for "safe" money fund 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the SEC wants the funds to divest those securities in an "orderly" 
manner, there may be no alternative for some of the funds but to take a loss by 
selling the derivatives, some analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is raising the question of whether the sponsors of the newly troubled 
funds are willing or able to cover the losses, as BofA did -- or whether these 
funds will force shareholders to accept the loss by devaluing their share price 
from $1 to 99 cents or less. 
</P>
<P>
 That the ICI admits at least one money fund is actively seeking an acquirer 
suggests that the sponsor of that fund may not have the resources to cover its 
losses by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the ICI may face a crisis it has long feared: Whether to let a money 
fund "break" the $1-a-share level, or whether to organize an industry-wide 
bailout of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 An ICI spokesman said Thursday that discussion of an ICI-organized bailout of 
troubled money funds "is not underway." He also said that the group has no 
formal policy on the bailout question. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue poses a true dilemma for the industry. Forcing shareholders of one 
fund to eat a loss could cause a ripple effect, fueling unwarranted concerns 
about other money funds' stability. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, with the full extent of derivative problems in money funds 
and other mutual funds still unclear, an industry bailout of one fund would set 
a dangerous precedent. As one industry executive put it, "We don't know how 
many other beggars are at the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Fund Flows Stay Down: In other mutual fund news, the ICI reported Thursday 
that investor demand for stock and bond funds remained relatively depressed in 
June, reflecting jitters about the markets' next moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Net new cash flow -- a measure of the net amount of money entering the funds, 
after accounting for redemptions and exchanges among funds -- was a negative 
$1.7 billion for bond funds, and a positive $7.7 billion for stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, many fund companies say stock fund inflows improved somewhat -- 
especially for international funds -- while bond funds continued to experience 
outflows, though at a modest pace. Fund Cash Flows 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are still pulling money out of bond mutual funds, on balance, but 
stock funds are continuing to attract new money, though at a slower pace. Net, 
new cash flow into stock and bond funds, monthly in 1994, in billions of 
dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK FUNDS, June, 1994: $7.7 
</P>
<P>
 BOND FUNDS, June, 1994: -$1.7

HUGHES UPS THE ANTE IN SATELLITE NETWORK; COMMUNICATIONS: THE COMPANY PROPOSES 
EXPANDED SYSTEM TO COVER THE GLOBE. OTHERSALSO HAVE BIG PLANS FOR SPACE. 
</P>

<P>
 A mad scramble to build electronic highways in space -- and to pay for them -- 
got crazier Thursday when Hughes Communications proposed a fivefold expansion 
of its plan to launch a system of satellites offering two-way voice, video and 
data services. 
</P>
<P>
 Just eight months after unveiling a $660-million Spaceway project that would 
target only the United States, Hughes has gone back to the Federal 
Communications Commission seeking permission to build an expanded $3.2-billion 
worldwide system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes expansion seemed to reflect a brightening outlook for the role of 
satellites -- in addition to fiber-optic cable and cellular technologies -- as 
Earth becomes connected on the fast-evolving information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we continued to do technical work and market analysis," said Kevin 
McGrath, chief executive of Hughes, "we realized that the things that make this 
proposal attractive in the U.S. make it even more attractive for the rest of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Hughes plan comes just four months after Teledesic, a company started 
with seed money from Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates and McCaw Cellular 
Communications Inc., astounded the world with an ambitious plan to build a 
$9-billion network using 840 low-orbiting satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not all. Other proposals in the works include a similar 
48-satellite system from Loral Corp. of New York and a 77-satellite system from 
Motorola to offer worldwide mobile communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledesic says it finds Hughes' new proposal encouraging. "We see this as an 
endorsement of our assertion of the global demand for broad-band services," 
said Russell Daggatt, president of Kirkland, Wash.-based Teledesic. "There is 
room for many competitors providing different kinds of services." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' McGrath, who met unsuccessfully with McCaw last month to discuss 
possible cooperation between their two companies, agreed there is room enough 
in space for all the applicants and more. The companies are now working with 
the FCC on ways to efficiently share the type of frequency required to operate 
many of the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hurdle is finding the cash. Motorola was first in the race and has 
already lined up some deep-pocketed Japanese backers. Teledesic has a few 
million dollars in seed money from its two wealthy founders, but has yet to 
line up a major backer. Hughes is owned by General Motors but says it needs 
major strategic partners both to help finance the project and market its 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go to the plan that offers the best reward for the least risk, 
and Hughes contends its plan for nine satellites to cover the globe is quicker 
and far less risky than Teledesic's complex proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes would have two satellites operational for the United States by 1998 and 
the rest in place by 2000. Since the satellites are "geostationary," meaning 
they float 22,300 miles high above a certain point, each satellite could be put 
into use as soon as it is in position. Fewer satellites also means fewer risky 
rocket launches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Teledesic plan would require hundreds of successful rocket 
launches before it could begin service, since its satellites would be placed in 
fast-moving, low orbits about 435 miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledesic's Daggatt says the low-orbit approach allows users to get service 
with smaller, cheaper receivers. He says the Hughes system would have 
difficulty offering many kinds of communications services because its 
satellites would be so far from Earth there would be split-second delays in 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies, however, agree that satellite systems are an important 
supplement to current telecommunications systems. Daggatt sees a combination of 
cellular and satellite service as the most economical means of providing phone 
service to developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath sees satellites providing crucial communications services to 
multinationals everywhere. An oil company that had drilling samples from an oil 
rig, for example, could beam that information for evaluation by its 
supercomputers at home with just a 26-inch antenna and a two-way communications 
system. If such systems were sold in the millions, as Hughes hopes, they would 
cost less than $1,000 each.

BREAST CANCER PATIENT IS AWARDED $312,000 BY JURY; HEALTH CARE: THE CASE FUELS 
A NATIONAL DEBATE OVER MEDICAL COSTS AND POTENTIALLY LIFE-SAVING TREATMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a case that adds fuel to a national health care debate, a Superior Court 
jury in Los Angeles Thursday awarded damages of $312,000 to a Tustin woman 
whose insurer had refused to pay for an expensive breast cancer treatment that 
she believes saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, voting 10 to 2, found that Blue Shield of California had acted 
unreasonably in adopting a blanket policy of rejecting such treatment -- bone 
marrow transplantation in conjunction with high-dose chemotherapy -- for women 
with metastatic breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Schoenburg, 50, who brought the lawsuit, said she felt overwhelming 
relief when the jury returned the verdict Thursday morning after seven weeks of 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just put my head down on the table and cried," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the decision does not change Blue Shield's policy, the trial raised 
issues that are the subject of continuing controversy nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when employers, who control most health insurance purchasing, are 
pushing their insurers and health care providers to slash costs, pressure is 
also building to force insurers and health maintenance organizations to pay for 
a wider array of potentially life-saving treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers worry about having coverage decisions taken out of their hands, with 
both courts and legislatures intervening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schoenburg case is at least the third of its kind to go to trial in 
California. Last December, a Riverside County jury returned an $89-million 
verdict against Health Net, the large, Woodland Hills-based health maintenance 
organization, for denying the treatment to breast cancer patient Nelene Fox, 
who died at age 40 before the case reached trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), Democratic nominee for state insurance 
commissioner, is sponsoring a bill now before the California Senate that would 
require insurers to cover physician-recommended treatments for any 
life-threatening condition providing that the treatment is considered safe and 
effective by the relevant national medical body -- the American Society of 
Clinical Oncologists, in the case of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the Schoenburg case is the fact that Blue Shield is not her 
direct insurer. Because her husband, Robert, is a lawyer for Caltrans, Judith 
Schoenburg is insured by the California Public Employees Retirement System. 
CalPERS hired Blue Shield to administer its health plan, and Blue Shield -- 
with CalPERS approval -- applied the same standards it uses in its own plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Schoenburg underwent the bone marrow transplant and a high-dose 
chemotherapy regimen in 1992 and has had no recurrence of the cancer. However, 
the $312,000 in medical costs forced her and her husband to borrow against 
their home. Had the jury not decided as it did, "We'd have lost the house," 
Robert Schoenburg said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield rejects the treatment for all breast cancer patients, contending 
that it has not been proven safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>
 During trial, a Blue Shield physician testified that the insurer receives -- 
and rejects -- about three requests per month for such treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were told at the trial that numerous other insurers, including Blue 
Cross of California, cover the procedure on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Thursday afternoon, most of the jurors said they believed that 
Blue Shield adopted the policy solely to save money rather than because it 
considered the treatment unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Diana Bailli of Rosemead said she was particularly upset by testimony 
that such treatment requests get only token consideration before being 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take someone's file and give it a cursory, 15-minute review, that's 
not right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all seven jurors interviewed said they were disappointed by a judge's 
ruling preventing them from assessing punitive damages against Blue Shield. The 
jury consisted of 10 women and two men; both men voted in Schoenberg's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge David A. Horowitz ruled out punitive damages on grounds that there was 
no evidence that Blue Shield had acted maliciously. He also dropped CalPERS as 
a defendant in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield attorney A. Robert Singer said it was too early to speculate on 
whether the insurer would appeal, since several issues remain to be decided 
through post-trial motions. The judge could conceivably reverse the verdict 
based on the motions, Singer said. One issue to be decided is whether Blue 
Shield -- as administrator rather than direct insurer -- should be held 
responsible for a coverage policy that CalPERS approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said the verdict also raises a fundamental question: "Are organizations 
involved in the provision of health care services going to be able to make 
informed and rational decisions regarding medical treatment, or will they be 
subject to second-guessing and perhaps serious financial penalties at the hands 
of people who -- however well-intentioned they may be -- do not bring a great 
deal of medical expertise or experience to the table?"

DAMAGE CONTROL; CAR INSURERS ARE BUSY SIGNING UP PREFERRED PROVIDER SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The concept of preferred provider networks, popular for years in the health 
care industry, is gaining acceptance among auto insurers looking to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the arrangement, auto body repair shops agree to meet minimum equipment 
and training standards and, in most cases, grant insurers price breaks. 
Insurers, in return, refer policyholders to the shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks give insurers some control over accident repairs, limiting fraud 
and incompetence and costs associated with those problems. The networks also 
allow insurers to reduce jobs and labor costs, since preferred shops assume the 
function of claims estimators. 
</P>
<P>
 Unheard of only five years ago, the preferred provider networks, known as 
direct repair programs, have grown quickly. It is believed that preferred shops 
now handle at least 15% of accident repairs, up from less than 5% in 1989. Many 
think that percentage could swell to 40% by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Among companies with programs are Farmers Insurance, the Automobile Club of 
Southern California, Allstate Insurance and 20th Century Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks are mostly invisible to policyholders until they have an 
accident. While state antitrust law prevents insurers from directing 
policyholders to a shop, insurers are permitted to explain their direct repair 
programs and offer a referral. Policyholders have the final say on where they 
take their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 If they live up to expectations, the programs could lower accident repair 
costs and, in turn, regulators say, cut car insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are concerns that an overemphasis on cost-cutting could lead to 
abuse. Mark Rakich, California Department of Insurance senior counsel, said 
some consumers have accused the shops of cutting corners to save money, 
although such complaints are not widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned the programs could lead to 'repair mills' where cheaper, 
sub-quality parts are substituted," said Michael Shames, executive director of 
U-Can, a San Diego-based consumer advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators say direct repair programs aren't immune to fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 To the collision repair industry, preferred provider programs are problematic. 
The arrangements can generate huge amounts of revenue, but they require shop 
owners to cede some control over their business to insurance companies. Auto 
body shops must submit to surprise inspections and negotiate their prices with 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Collision shops outside the networks risk losing out on all-important 
insurance claims, which account for 90% of all accident repairs. The programs 
"are the bogymen of the '90s," said John Loftus, president of the Society of 
Collision Repair Specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no count of how many shops participate in the programs, but the number 
is easily in the thousands. Farmers alone has 835 direct repair shops in 27 
states. The Auto Club has 53 shops in its Southern California network and 
expects to have 75 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While insurers don't offer policyholders price breaks for using preferred 
shops -- a situation regulators would like to see changed -- they dangle other 
enticements. Most insurers offer speedier claims processing, as there is no 
need for policyholders to see a claim estimator. Another common benefit is a 
lifetime guarantee on repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual insurers may toss in extras. The Auto Club, for example, gives 
preferred shop patrons a free lift to a nearby rental car agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks have evolved partly in response to low standards in the collision 
repair business. The Bureau of Automotive Repair reported this month that 
nearly 40% of collision repairs statewide involve fraud or ineptitude. It also 
said that many shops lack equipment needed to properly repair cars and less 
than 20% of technicians have any formal training. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers say they are choosy about which shops join their networks. Shops must 
have modern equipment, trained employees and a clean business record. Shops 
caught cheating or doing poor work may be thrown out of the networks, insurers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance companies are making it mandatory for the shops to improve 
themselves," said Rick Johnson, who owns a body shop in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 While not every insurer has a direct repair program -- State Farm Insurance 
Co. is the most prominent exception -- collision shop owners say they are 
becoming too strong a force to ignore. Though insurers deny it, collision 
repair technicians say the special benefits of direct repair programs -- such 
as lifetime guarantees -- point consumers to preferred shops. Thus membership 
in a network can make or break a shop, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are quality shops not in the direct repair programs, but the customer 
isn't going to find out about them," said Los Angeles body shop owner David 
Truslow. "The reality is, you become part of the system or be out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of shop owners are making themselves over, trying to link up with 
insurance companies. They are spending thousands of dollars on new equipment 
and sending self-taught mechanics to school. When Farmers brought its program 
to Sacramento last year, technical classes at nearby American River College 
filled to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County shop owner Rick Reiss, intent on impressing the Auto Club, spent 
$40,000 for new auto framing equipment and $5,000 to redecorate restrooms and 
customer waiting areas. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts a year ago are paying off. Reiss said that since linking up with 
the Auto Club three months ago, business has climbed 30%. If the pace 
continues, Reiss said he will recover his investment by December. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all the emphasis on standards, regulators say there is no evidence 
that direct repair programs are less prone to fraud or incompetence, which, 
according to one study, increases repair costs by an average of $866. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had cases where repairs at direct referral shops were not up to snuff," 
said Dan Povey, who heads auto body repair investigations for BAR. "I don't see 
anything that suggests repairs are necessarily of a higher caliber." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers say much of the savings from the programs results from taking over 
tasks once performed by the insurance company. Using special computer software, 
direct repair technicians can perform standardized claim estimates and send 
copies electronically to insurers for review. One company, Stonewall Insurance 
Co., further reduces costs by having shops videotape repairs, eliminating the 
need to check completed work on-site. 
</P>
<P>
 Stonewall executives acknowledge they've received complaints from customers 
about the quality of repairs, but, says claims Vice President William Dibble, 
"not as many as you'd think." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies also save because shops waive charges on vehicle storage, 
typically $20 a day, and grant discounts on certain jobs, such as wheel 
alignments. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislation defeated last year would have allowed consumers to benefit 
directly from the savings. The bill would have allowed insurers to offer 
consumers a choice between a traditional insurance policy and a discounted 
preferred provider policy. In return, insurers would have been exempted from 
applicable antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Insurance advocated the measure, which received lukewarm 
support from insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some body shop owners grumble that insurance companies demand too 
much from them. Sacramento shop owner Harold Nunn said he dropped three direct 
repair programs because insurers wanted bigger price breaks than their repair 
volume warranted. He wouldn't name the insurers, saying he continues to work 
for their policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience hasn't soured him on preferred provider networks. He belongs to 
three others. "I'm not against them or in favor of them," Nunn said. "I accept 
them as reality."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CLAUDIA ELLER: AT SONY, WINDS OF CHANGE REACTIVATE 
RUMOR MILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leave it to Sony Corp. to always find a way back into the news. With Jeffrey 
Katzenberg's career hanging in the balance at Walt Disney Studios, the latest 
rumors have Sony offering him everything short of its co-patent on the compact 
disc player to take his act to Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the speculation, aside from the Disney studio chairman's well-known 
desire for a promotion, is the widespread suspicion that Sony Pictures Chairman 
Peter Guber is likely to resign by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to Katzenberg deny reports that he's held job discussions with 
Sony of America President Michael P. Schulhof. They say that the two executives 
have not seen each other in months, despite a supposed rendezvous last week at 
Sony's corporate dining room in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof, for his part, is mum on the company's plans. But regardless of what 
happens to Katzenberg, knowledgeable sources say Guber has been fairly candid 
about his restlessness after five tumultuous years at Sony Pictures' helm. With 
a bonus pool worth tens of millions of dollars set to kick in early next year, 
the smart money has Guber moving up at Sony or leaving to set up shop as a 
filmmaker at Warner Bros., where he co-produced the mega-hit "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter goes in five- to six-year cycles, and his cycle is about up. He's 
definitely on the bungee (cord)," said one confidant. 
</P>
<P>
 Added another: "I think he's intellectually interested" in what goes on at 
Sony, "but he's not as emotionally committed as he once was." 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's former producing partner and co-chairman at Sony, Jon Peters, has 
already returned to Warner. The two recently lunched in Peters' private dining 
room and toured the studio lot, but sources say there has been no formal 
discussion of Guber and Peters re-teaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber, who is in New York this week for meetings with Sony of America 
executives, declined comment on his plans. People close to the 52-year-old Sony 
chief denied that he's eyeing the exit door, since he extended his contract 
only last November. But they were at a loss as to explain why so many key 
executives who do business with Sony have developed that impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have lots of ideas in this town," said one source, who insisted that 
Guber has made a long-term commitment to his job. "That doesn't mean they're 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of the suspicion appears to be based on Guber's own behavior. 
Colleagues say he has become increasingly hostile toward the pressure-cooker 
nature of a job in which every multimillion-dollar move is scrutinized and 
second-guessed. They also point out that, with his bonus coming, Guber has 
amassed a fortune so large that he doesn't need to work anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Some took it as a sign that Guber was losing interest in the job when he 
recently cut back on his creative involvement at the company's two studios, 
Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sony chief may have been trying to give his executives more breathing 
room. But critics say Sony's productivity has suffered as a result. The 
company, which made a big deal of its nearly 20% combined domestic box office 
market share at the end of last year, is mired around 11% so far this year. 
Columbia Pictures' big summer hopes died with the disappointing performances of 
"City Slickers II," "Wolf" and "North." At TriStar, meanwhile, a dispiriting 
paralysis has set in. It's been nine months since the studio green lighted a 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parts of the company, including its TV production and exhibition 
divisions, are performing better -- and Sony plans to consolidate some 
operations to cut costs. But the company is still struggling to stabilize its 
executive ranks. Amy Pascal, an executive vice president of production at 
Columbia, is expected to depart soon for a top job at Turner Pictures. One 
knowledgeable source said that announcement could come as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 If Guber goes, Sony is widely expected to step up its efforts to sell a chunk 
of the company, after already having put 25% on the block. It could offer an 
investor some voice in future management. New leadership could also be used to 
promote a stock offering on Wall Street, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever develops, people close to Guber point out that he has always 
privately characterized himself as a short-termer. In conversations he's fond 
of saying, "We're all just employees." Moreover, many contend that his real 
talents are being wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about a different corporate temperament," one friend said. "Everyone 
has always wondered about his suitability to a corporate job. Peter is more 
suited to being a producer, and he's not producing." The source also noted: "No 
one ever thought Peter was in this for the long run, but I really don't think 
he's going anywhere for a few years. He pays attention to movies like a 
producer would. In that way, he's dedicated to a fault." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The Money King: Walt Disney Co. can whistle "Hakuna Matata" all the way to the 
bank and beyond now. In a new report, entertainment analysts Jessica Reif and 
Harry Wagner of Oppenheimer & Co. in New York project that the "The Lion King" 
will contribute nearly $1 billion to the operating profit at Disney over the 
next two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Reif and Wagner say the animated feature will become "one of the most, if not 
the, most profitable films of all time," if their projections are correct. 
"Lion King" is already tracking 83% above "Aladdin" in foreign territories and 
is expected to take in more than $250 million at the domestic box office. When 
the worldwide audience is accounted for, they say its total gross should reach 
$700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that all of the home video, video game, album, merchandise and other 
revenue streams and "The Lion King" is an unbelievable bonanza. Disney has also 
scored with its video, "Return of Jafar." Nearly 10 million copies have sold 
domestically, according to Reif and Wagner.

 Two Firms Invest in Showscan Corp.: Culver City-based Showscan said two firms 
bought more than 500,000 of its newly issued common shares, amounting to 9.8% 
of its outstanding common stock after the effect of the sales. The company, a 
leader in the production of entertainment motion-simulation theater 
attractions, said Fidelity Investments bought 357,040 shares at $7.75 each, or 
$2,767,060, while Neuberger & Berman acquired 150,000 shares at $7.75 each, or 
$1,162,500. The purchase follows a registration statement declared effective by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, and brings the total 
outstanding Showscan shares to 5,189,559 from 4,682,519.

FINANCIAL MARKETS: DOLLAR RALLIES AGAINST YEN; STOCKS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar jumped above the psychologically important level of 100 Japanese 
yen on Thursday, on growing expectations of a breakthrough in trade 
negotiations between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks, meanwhile, got a small boost from falling bond yields, and both 
markets were helped by the dollar's strength. The Dow Jones industrials inched 
up 10.36 points to 3,730.83. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar surged to 100.10 yen, up from 98.55 on Wednesday. It 
was the dollar's first close above the 100-yen mark since June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also finished stronger against the German mark, rising to 1.591 
marks from 1.574. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoying the U.S. currency: American and Japanese trade negotiators were 
scheduled to meet today for talks, ahead of the Sunday deadline Washington had 
previously set for deciding whether to take steps toward trade sanctions 
against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a suspicion in the market that there will potentially be an 
agreement before the deadline," said Peter Gloyne, a currency trader at First 
National Bank of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an accord to cut Japan's huge surplus with the United States, currency 
markets may figure that a weaker dollar is the Clinton Administration's only 
potential weapon in the battle. With an accord, however, markets may assume 
that the dollar will begin to strengthen again, and that the Administration may 
abet that. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of the potential for a trade accord took hold in the market even as 
American officials played down the possibility. Late in the day, Deputy U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who was to participate in today's 
talks, said there had been "minimum progress" in earlier discussions in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo today, the dollar dropped back to 99.75 yen in mid-morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. bond market Thursday, yields pulled back after jumping on 
Wednesday. The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond finished at 7.55%, 
down from 7.61% Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the dollar's sudden strength was a positive for bonds because a 
stronger U.S. currency would tend to attract more foreign investment to U.S. 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Also lending a degree of support to the bond market was a report by the 
Conference Board that help-wanted advertising fell in June, suggesting a slower 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Markets will get another key look at the economy's fundamentals today, when 
the government reports on second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists estimate that GDP expanded at about a 3.8% pace in the 
quarter. A significantly higher number could spark renewed expectations that 
the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit for a fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, despite a minor rally Thursday, was in a cautious mood ahead 
of the GDP news. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow had been up as much as 21 points early in the day. In the broad 
market, advancing issues edged out decliners by just 1,073 to 1,003 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Trading volume remained moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks attracted some renewed buying. 3M Co. gained 1 1/8 to 52 
1/2 after reporting record quarterly earnings. Other industrial issues rising 
on earnings news included Dow Chemical, up 1/2 to 68 1/8; Hercules, up 3/4 to 
106, and Duracell, up 7/8 to 41 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * GM shares inched up 3/8 to 50 1/4 after its earnings beat forecasts. But the 
stock remains just above its 1994 low of 49 1/2, and well below the high of 65 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford gained 5/8 to 31 and Chrysler edged up 1/4 to 47 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among technology issues, Irvine-based computer maker AST Research lost 1 1/4 
to 13 3/4 after reporting quarterly earnings of 43 cents a share, one penny 
below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the health-care sector, Southland managed-care company Wellpoint Health 
tumbled 5 1/2 to 25 after its second quarter results fell below analysts' 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellpoint said it was forced to make higher payments to some of its 
health-care providers under new California laws and regulatory interpretations 
that expanded the scope of health benefits offered to small groups and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weakness also persisted in some health-maintenance organization stocks 
Thursday. U.S. Healthcare fell 1 to 36 1/2, United Healthcare dropped 1 3/8 to 
42 3/4 and Foundation Health lost 1 1/8 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
 * LDDS Communications gained 1/4 to 19 on a report that it is close to 
acquiring the Williams Cos.' WilTel long-distance telephone business for $2.5 
billion. Williams shares jumped 1 5/8 to 32 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But renewed rumors that LDDS will bid for Culver City-based IDB Communications 
failed to help IDB's shares. The stock fell 3/8 to 10. LDDS is said to be 
waiting for a review of IDB's finances by its new auditors, who were brought in 
last spring after IDB's original auditors quit in a dispute with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biogen, which surged 15 1/4 Wednesday on news of promising results in a 
trial of its drug for treating multiple sclerosis, eased 1 1/8 to 43 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed up 110.62 points at 
20,247.85 after briefly falling below the 20,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index gained 13.6 points to finish 3,095.9. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX average ended down 17.63 points at 2,122.81. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index's five-session winning streak came to a close, 
as the index fell 4.07 points to 2,429.15.

 Bidding for Paging Licenses Still Rising: Defying most predictions, the 
government's first auction for public airwaves completed its fourth day, with 
bidders raising the ante to nearly $610 million.At least 10 companies are still 
in the running to win 10 nationwide licenses to offer an array of advanced 
wireless communications services, including two-way paging and messaging, on a 
nationwide basis. Anxious to bring the hammer down, the Federal Communications 
Commission, which is holding the auction, has quickened the pace of the 
bidding. Bids for the most coveted licenses shot up to a range of $77 million 
to $80 million.

GM EARNS NEARLY $2 BILLION IN SECOND QUARTER; AUTOS: THE NO. 1 CAR MAKER HITS 
ANOTHER MILESTONE IN ITS REMARKABLE TURNAROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors on Thursday reported that it earned a record $1.92 billion in 
the second quarter, as surging sales allowed the auto maker to boost prices on 
many of its models while its cost-cutting efforts also produced major savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was another milestone in a remarkable turnaround at the nation's 
largest auto manufacturer. GM had posted total operating losses of more than 
$8.41 billion in 1991 and 1992 and closed dozens of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The profits were more than doubled from the year-ago quarter and capped a week 
of record earnings announcements by the nation's Big Three auto makers. Ford 
Motor Co. said Wednesday that its second-quarter profit also doubled, to $1.71 
billion, and Chrysler said its net income jumped 40% to $956 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its a great accomplishment and says a lot about the U.S. manufacturing base," 
said George Magliano, an auto analyst at WEFA Group in New York. "Here they 
thought Detroit was dead and were writing them off" just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite logging the best quarterly profit in its history, GM still has its 
share of problems, financial analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's share of the U.S. market slipped to 33.1% in the quarter from 34.8% last 
year, while company executives admit that their per-vehicle profit remains 
below the industry average and that their plants could be run more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 The record profits were due largely to a turnaround in GM's key North American 
automotive operations, which account for most of the company's annual revenue. 
Those operations posted a $723-million profit in the quarter on a 10% rise in 
sales, compared to a $33-million loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said earnings from its international automotive operations rose to 
$543 million from $306 million a year earlier, thanks to a slow recovery in the 
European economy and continued strong results in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Surging demand by U.S. consumers has allowed GM and other auto makers to raise 
prices on many of their models and trim back costly incentive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some ways, that strong demand has proven to be a double-edged sword for 
GM. The company couldn't build enough of some of its most popular models in the 
second quarter -- including its highly profitable sport-utility vehicles and 
other light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a solid quarter," said David Healy, an analyst at S.G. Warburg & Co. 
in New York. "But they had a thinner mix of more profitable vehicles, which 
made them earn less than they might have otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 GM said it earned an average of $650 on each car it sold in the second 
quarter, up from about $265 last year. But despite that improvement, its 
per-car profits were about $300 below Ford's and more than $600 below 
Chrysler's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker said the profit margin at its North American operations was 
only 2.7%, which GM officials called "considerably short" of the company's goal 
of an annual profit margin of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 And while GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh said cost-cutting efforts 
added $330 million to its quarterly profit, he said more changes are needed to 
make the auto maker more competitive. Losh didn't say what additional 
cost-cutting moves may be made, although the company is still in the process of 
trimming thousands from its work force.

UNITED UNVEILS NEW SHORT-HOP SHUTTLE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 United Airlines on Thursday formally unveiled plans for its new low-cost, 
no-frills service in California and other western states, where the carrier 
hopes to grab market share from short-haul powerhouse Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shuttle by United, as the new airline is officially known, starts flying 
Oct. 1, with 184 daily flights between eight pairs of cities, including Los 
Angeles and San Francisco. By December, the new airline plans to operate 286 
flights daily between 10 destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach seats on the shuttle will range between $62 and $139 one way.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides challenging Southwest, United chose to launch its no-frills service in 
California because the state's business climate and economy are improving, 
according to Gerald Greenwald, chairman of UAL, United parent's company. 
</P>
<P>
 UAL, which employs 28,000 people in California, expects its new shuttle 
service to create 200 to 300 additional jobs by year's end, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based UAL is launching the new airline after it received major labor 
concessions from its employees two weeks ago. The workers, in turn, acquired 
55% of the company's stock, making UAL the nation's biggest employee-owned 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with those lower labor costs, UAL decided to debut the Shuttle by United 
in California, in a direct competitive attack on Southwest, which specializes 
in short-distance flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no intention of giving up any traffic or revenue," said Gary Kelly, 
Southwest's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald, surrounded by about 200 United employees at a press conference at 
Los Angeles International Airport, said the new shuttle service would compete 
"dollar for dollar" on price against Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle by United initially will fly these routes: San Francisco to Los 
Angeles, Burbank, Ontario, San Diego, Seattle and Las Vegas; and from Los 
Angeles to Sacramento and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 By year's end, the airline also will fly from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and 
Phoenix; San Diego to Sacramento, and Oakland to Burbank, Ontario and Seattle.

FDA ADVISORY PANELS RECOMMEND AGAINST NON-PRESCRIPTION TAGAMET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SmithKline Beecham PLC was dealt a second setback Thursday in its quest for 
regulatory approval to sell its prescription ulcer drug Tagamet as an 
over-the-counter heartburn remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two advisory panels to the Food and Drug Administration recommended against 
approving the drug for over-the-counter sale, saying they were concerned about 
its reaction with other drugs patients might be taking. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisers said, however, that a mild version of Tagamet could be 
recommended for sale for heartburn if the company can resolve these concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory committees, but it 
is not bound by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised by the outcome. Our key objective going into the meeting 
was to resolve the issue of efficacy, and the committee agreed 'Yes, there is 
efficacy,' " a spokeswoman for the British drug company said in London. "We're 
very comfortable that we will be able to work directly with the FDA to resolve 
any outstanding issues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two FDA panels had rec- ommended against over-the-counter Tagamet sales 
last September, saying tests did not show it was effective for episodic 
heartburn. 
</P>
<P>
 An over-the-counter version of Tagamet has been approved in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagamet was once a $1-billion drug for the company, but its sales have fallen 
since May, when it lost its patent protection. 
</P>
<P>
 SmithKline Beecham shares, traded as American Depository Receipts, closed off 
37.5 cents at $31.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Jobless Claims Fall by 59,000: New claims for unemployment benefits for the 
week ended July 23 stood near 331,000, the lowest total since the last week in 
March, the Labor Department said. The previous week's figure was revised from 
392,000, because that week had a surge reflecting temporary layoffs in the auto 
industry and jobs lost from flooding in the Southeast. The department's 
four-week moving average, considered a more reliable measure, fell to 357,500 
from 363,000.

 Help-Wanted Barometer Drops: The Conference Board's help-wanted advertising 
index, which gauges the job market, fell four points in June, the New 
York-based research group said.The seasonally adjusted index now stands at 117, 
down from 121 in May but up from 98 in June, 1993. "The recovery in labor 
market activity has slowed," Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said. 
"Job advertising volume has been quite flat through the first half of 1994." 
But over the last three months, help-wanted ads rose in five of the nation's 
nine regions. In the Pacific region, volume was up 2.1%.

 Ex-Fed Governor Under Probe: Wayne D. Angell, a former Federal Reserve 
governor, is the target of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
into the possible misuse of secret bank information, according to the New York 
Times. The SEC is exploring whether Angell, who finished an eight-year term 
with the Fed in February and became chief economist at Bear Stearns & Co. in 
April, illegally received or passed on inside information this spring, the 
paper said in today's editions.During the time in question, Angell was warning 
clients that the Fed was likely to raise interest rates significantly, the 
newspaper said. Angell said there was nothing to investigate. The inquiry 
follows an internal Fed investigation that found no evidence of wrongdoing.

 IBM to Shut Ambra Unit: IBM had formed Ambra Computer Corp. two years ago in 
Raleigh, N.C., to make inexpensive personal computers for sale directly to 
customers.The closure is one of several cost-cutting actions announced in 
International Business Machine's PC division. The unit will eliminate 1,500 to 
2,000 jobs, nearly 20% of its work force. Competing most directly with Dell 
Computer and Gateway 2000, Ambra sold its computers through phone and catalogue 
orders rather than IBM's sales force and wholesalers.

 Judge Refuses to Remove Himself From IBM Case: U.S. District Judge David 
Edelstein in New York rejected an International Business Machines Corp. request 
that he remove himself from the decades old consent-decree case.Last month, IBM 
asked the court to lift the 1956 court order that bars IBM from certain 
computer-services businesses. Before the request could proceed on its merits, 
IBM had asked Edelstein to remove himself from the case, contending that the 
judge has shown bias against IBM during the litigation. In a written opinion, 
Edelstein refused to reassign the case, saying that IBM's bias allegations are 
"without merit."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY; PROPOSED TOLL CALL CUTS ARE 
UNEVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An analysis of proposed reductions in toll call rates, tentatively approved 
last week by the state Public Utilities Commission, shows that the amount you 
can expect to save varies depending on when you place a toll call and how far 
it travels. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC said rates for toll calls -- those that travel more than 12 miles -- 
would drop an average of 40%. A review of the proposal shows the cuts are not 
distributed evenly, though. Daytime rates are cut more substantially than 
evening or nighttime rates. Reductions are deeper for calls going farther. 
</P>
<P>
 We found that while rates for some daytime calls will drop by more than 60%, 
charges for other calls -- mostly nearby, nighttime calls -- will rise by more 
than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a San Francisco consumer advocacy group, 
says the proposed rate structure appears to favor business customers, who make 
most of their calls during the day, over residential customers, who make most 
of their calls in off-peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pacific Bell said that without deep cuts in daytime rates, callers would 
defect to competing toll call carriers. More than half of all toll calls are 
made during the day, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to keep that volume up to keep people on the network," said Michael 
Miller, Pacific Bell's vice president for competitive readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 TURN said it will ask the PUC to reconsider the rates, as will Pacific Bell, 
which had requested deeper overall cuts. Meanwhile, long-distance companies are 
expected to compete aggressively for the business. MCI, for example, has 
pledged to underprice PacBell by a third. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC said it expects to make a final decision in September. So stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loose change: The tentative decision by the PUC affects more than just toll 
call rates. Among other proposed rate changes: 
</P>
<P>
 * GTE is raising its directory assistance charge to 35 cents a call from 25 
cents. Pacific Bell is lowering its rate to 21 cents per call from 25 cents. 
Both companies will continue to allow customers five free 411 calls a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * GTE is eliminating an $85 sign-up fee that was collected from existing 
customers ordering inside-wiring maintenance service. The PUC said the fee 
isn't justified. Pacific Bell has no sign-up fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * GTE is raising the charge for an unpublished number -- one that is not in 
the phone book or available through directory assistance -- to $1.50 monthly 
from 60 cents. It is also creating a new unlisted service, which for $1 monthly 
omits customers from the phone book but not from directory assistance. Pacific 
Bell will continue to charge 30 cents a month for unpublished numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * GTE is raising the installation charge for 800-number service to $179.80 
from $70, and Pacific Bell is raising its installation charge to $173 from $70. 
If you ever thought about getting an 800 number to encourage your parents or 
penniless college-student children to call you, now's the time. If approved in 
September as expected, the changes will take effect on Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calling card fees: Toward Utility Rate Normalization recently surveyed rates 
on five commonly used telephone calling cards. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that Pacific Bell had the lowest rate at 35 cents per call, while 
Sprint had the highest rate at 80 cents per call. AT&T charges 80 cents for 
calls outside California, 53 cents for calls in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the survey, TURN said GTE charges 40 cents per call while MCI 
charges 79 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling cards allow consumers to bill calls to their home numbers. While the 
cards are convenient, using one can double the cost of a short telephone call. 
For example, using a Sprint card for a three-minute daytime call between New 
York and Los Angeles would push the cost to $1.61 from 81 cents. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Odds and ends: The consulting firm Runzheimer International reports that the 
average round-trip domestic air fare fell to $476 in the first quarter of this 
year, its lowest point since the end of 1992. But the company says the 
long-term trend is up. . . . Ortho Mattress says it sells a split box spring so 
couples won't have to argue over the firmness of their bed. But they'll still 
have to argue over shelling out an extra $50 for it. Changing Phone Rates 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission has tentatively approved an average 
40% reduction in toll rates, ushering competition in the so-called local-long 
distance market. A closer look at the PUC's proposed decision shows changes in 
rates vary widely, depending on when the call is placed and the distance it 
travels. A few rates give the flavor.

 Cable: Viacom and Tele-Communications Inc. may have scrapped their plan to 
form a joint venture for their adjoining cable systems on the West Coast. 
Instead, sources say, Viacom is considering the sale of its systems to a 
TCI-affiliated minority buyer, thereby qualifying Viacom for a tax deferral 
under federal rules meant to encourage media sales to minorities. With 1.1 
million subscribers, the Viacom systems could fetch more than $2.4 billion,

RISING INTEREST SPURS EARLY LOCK-IN OF MORTGAGE RATES; FINANCING: MARKET'S 
VOLATILITY FUELS HOME BUYERS' SENSE OF URGENCY TO FREEZE LOAN VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Last summer, shopping for a mortgage was like strolling through a crowded 
bazaar. Never before had there been so many loan options with such attractive 
interest rates from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the task is more akin to visiting a toy store Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the market remains largely competitive, a precipitous rise in 
interest rates due to inflation fears has forced most borrowers to grab the 
best rate available as soon as possible. Some are securing a mortgage even 
before they've located a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, if people didn't lock in right away, they often benefited . . . 
because they probably saw rates decline before they closed on their mortgage," 
said Gregory Samp, president and chief operating officer for Sibley Corp., a 
mortgage banker based in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, market volatility continues to inch rates upwards, so there's a 
lot more urgency on the part of the home buyer to lock in," Samp said. "Chances 
are, in the next 60 days, it (the rate) could be worse than now." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the lender, borrowers can lock in the prevailing interest rate 
and certain loan terms for a few days to a few months and usually at any time 
during the application process. They must, however, close on the mortgage 
before the lock-in expires or they lose the preset rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lenders charge a lock-in fee -- usually up to one point, or 1% of the 
loan amount. This fee often is credited toward closing costs. However, 
increased competition for fewer customers this year has forced most lenders to 
provide the service for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibley is one of them. It allows certain customers to lock in a mortgage rate 
for up to 150 days -- far beyond the average 30- to 60-day lock-in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lenders are also offering 30-day lock-ins before borrowers have located a 
home to finance. The lock-and-shop program, which started in California about a 
year ago, is being done as customers are prequalified for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very competitive world," said Samp. "There are 30% more people in the 
business now than in 1991 . . . because of the '92-93 business boom." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, business is down substantially from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Chappelle, a vice president at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. in Washington, 
said this summer's mortgage activity is off by about 50% because of the higher 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage volume had reached a record high of $1.1 trillion in 1993, buoyed by 
heavy demand from homeowners wanting to refinance their old mortgages with 
loans carrying lower rates. Volume this year is expected to total $700 billion, 
said Chappelle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refinancing market was the force behind last year's business boom. It has 
virtually dried up this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve has been pushing rates higher to help control inflation. 
Lenders have followed suit by increasing a variety of consumer loans, including 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists predict 30-year fixed-rate mortgages will hit 9% before the 
end of the year. They're now at a two-year high of between 8.5% and 8.75%. Last 
summer, they averaged between 7% and 7.5%, before dipping to a 28-year low of 
6.8% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been surprised at how fast long-term rates have gone up," said Robert 
Van Order, chief economist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co., or Freddie 
Mac. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Duobinis, director of economic forecasting for the National Assn. of 
Home Builders, says many borrowers are making do by opting for adjustable rate 
mortgages over fixed-rate loans. Most one-year ARMs, for example, are in the 5% 
range for the first year. (They're usually adjusted up or down a maximum of two 
percentage points each year, with a cap of six percentage points over the life 
of the loan.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lock-ins have also been extended to ARMs. Some lenders will allow ARM 
customers to lock in one rate, then switch to another should interest rates 
drop before the closing date.

TRUST PROPOSES SETTLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS AT 10% OF VALUE; LITIGATION: JUDGE WILL 
CONSIDER THE CASH-STRAPPED MANVILLE FUND'S PLAN IN NOVEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Asbestos victims who have been waiting years to get paid by a cash-strapped 
trust created from the Manville Corp. bankruptcy would get just 10% of the 
value of their claims under a proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, which is independent from the 
Denver-based corporation, said Thursday that the settlement proposal was 
presented to U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in New York Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairness hearings on the latest settlement -- the third affecting the trust -- 
will begin in November, according to Weinstein's office. The accord excludes 
claimants from Maryland, and a hearing on those plaintiffs will be held next 
Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proposed settlement, payments would be made in the order that 
the claims are approved, provided that cash is available, at a level of 10% of 
their value. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a long and complex process, and the trust's claimants have been 
waiting many years for payments," said Robert Falise, chairman and managing 
trustee of the trust. "The pro rata percentage payment is unfortunately 
necessary, but at least we will now be able to provide payment to our 
beneficiaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Falise said the trust hopes that it will be able to increase the percentage 
when more is known about future claims filings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairfax, Va.-based trust has been engulfed in legal and money problems 
almost from the moment it began operation in 1988 when Manville emerged from 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Manville, once the largest U.S. producer of asbestos, filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection in New York in 1982. At the time, the company had been 
hit with about 1,600 personal injury suits. 
</P>
<P>
 The case made history when Manville became the first company to use a Chapter 
11 reorganization to create a fund to settle massive physical injury claims. 
</P>
<P>
 But parties in the landmark case grossly underestimated the number and size of 
claims that would be filed against the trust. It had been expected that no more 
than 100,000 would be filed against the $2.2-billion trust over three decades. 
The trust has paid 30,000 claimants more than $1 billion, and in the meantime 
has received 200,000 more with a settlement value estimated at between $5 
billion and $6 billion. The trust predicts that it could receive another 
300,000 claims in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Weinstein approved a new distribution plan to increase the trust's 
financing, but a federal appeals court overturned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The current proposal, in addition to settling individual claims, would set up 
three funds to pay other asbestos manufacturers and distributors hurt by a 1990 
stay in litigation against the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 One $35-million fund would be used to pay manufacturers that were sued by 
individuals and had to pay more than their share of damages because of the 
stay. A second $10.7-million fund would pay asbestos distributors who sought 
indemnification from Manville for damages as a result of their distributing the 
company's asbestos. A third for $10 million would pay distributor MacArthur & 
Co., which had a separate settlement agreement with Manville.

<P>
 20th Century Industries reported Thursday that second-quarter earnings fell 
86% on continued claims costs from January's California earthquake 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills-based property and casualty insurer said net income dropped 
to $4.9 million, or 9 cents a share, from $34.8 million, or 67 cents, a year 
earlier. Revenue in the quarter rose to $333.5 million from $272.9 million a 
year earlier.The results include the latest estimate of $685 million in pretax 
costs from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July 13, the company received 33,697 homeowner and condominium claims 
and 9,860 automobile claims, forcing it to pay $586.7 million in pretax claims 
losses and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer said pretax gains from the sale of investments rose to $49.8 
million from $4.5 million a year earlier and net investment income fell 11% to 
$21.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit by fierce competition and a huge restructuring charge, Delta Air Lines 
said it lost nearly $250 million in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Low-fare competition is increasing and has permanently changed the industry," 
Delta Chairman Ronald Allen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta, the nation's third-largest carrier, said it lost $249.8 million, or 
$5.50 a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter after a $413.7-million pretax 
restructuring charge. Excluding the charge, the Atlanta-based carrier posted 
net income of $10.8 million for the quarter, compared to net income of $7.2 
million a year ago. Revenue rose to $3.18 billion from $3.13 billion.

VIETNAM NOW WILLING TO SHARE OIL RISKS; PETROLEUM: FOREIGN COMPANIES DRILLING

 Seeking to encourage offshore exploration for oil and gas, Vietnam is willing 
to form joint ventures and share risks with foreign investors, the country's 
top energy executive said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But reluctant banks and a shortage of capital could still deter all but the 
biggest foreign firms, observers say.

 PetroVietnam, the state oil monopoly, may form partnerships with foreign 
companies when it invites them to bid for exploration rights to two promising 
areas off the southern Vietnamese coast, chairman Ho Si Thoang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a joint venture formed in 1981 with the former Soviet Union, 
PetroVietnam has allowed foreign companies in only under production-sharing 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 A consortium led by Australia's BHP Petroleum expects to become the first of 
those to produce commercial quantities of oil when it begins pumping at the Dai 
Hung field, 155 miles southeast of the port of Vung Tau. Production is 
scheduled to start in October, BHP says. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam has large offshore areas that have been barely explored, but the 
number of commercially viable discoveries in wells drilled so far is small, 
said Robert Mollah, a BHP general manager in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam has only one offshore field in production, at Bach Ho, which is 75 
miles southeast of Vung Tau and is operated by the joint venture VietSovPetro. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in two areas near Bach Ho picked up last month after Japan's 
Mitsubishi Oil Co. discovered large quantities of crude in a block just to the 
north. Thoang called the find "the biggest well in Southeast Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 PetroVietnam expects to auction off the two blocks as soon as the government 
gives final approval, Thoang said, adding that several companies have expressed 
interest. He declined to name the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil is Vietnam's leading export, contributing one-third of the nation's 
revenue. PetroVietnam hopes to nearly triple its annual crude production to 20 
million tons by working with foreign companies, Thoang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign companies drilling for oil and gas in Vietnam have had to shoulder all 
the risks involved. But Do Van Ha, PetroVietnam's director of international 
cooperation, said the company would now be willing to share the risks by taking 
a direct interest of up to 20% in joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Inadequate credit for such ventures, however, could still block foreign 
companies from exploring here, said Ronald Issen, vice president at Carr 
Indosuez Asia, an investment banking subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of energy projects approved by the government dwarfs the amount of 
money investors have actually put in, Issen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese banks can't fill the gap, and foreign banks operating in Vietnam 
are often restricted in the amount of money they can lend. Moreover, he said, 
international lenders like the World Bank have offered "peanuts" compared to 
the billion-dollar capital requirements of oil and gas projects.

THE SCENE: I TAN, THEREFORE I AM; THINK OF THEM AS THE MAGNIFICANT SEVEN OF 
MARINA HIGH. THESE GIRLS OF SUMMER ARE FULL OF FUN AND LOW ON WORRIES, AND THE 
NEARLY ENDLESS SEASON IS ONE LONG DAY AT THE BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Admit it. The reason we wax nostalgic over youth has nothing to do with 
unpredictable body changes and everything to do with freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite curfews and rules, not being able to legally drive and occasional 
bouts of freaking out, those teen years when we start high school and just 
before we get our driver's license can prove the freest in our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Free to eat anything without counting calories. Free during vacation and 
weekends to stay up all night chatting with your very best friends without 
worrying about waking up early for work. Free to relax in bed all morning and 
do whatever the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the summer, when freedom rules, "whatever" usually means a daily bake 
at the beach if you grew up within 15 miles of the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Like some biological clock that kicks in the day after school ends, the cycle 
goes like this: wake up 9ish, rise within the hour and make phone calls, watch 
a soap (yes, dudes watch soaps), then get on the bus or your Schwinn Cruiser 
and head to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an almost daily ritual for gangs of good friends like the seven Marina 
High freshman I met up with who have become a fixture on the sands of Surf 
City, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tribute to their conversation skills that they can spend nearly every 
breathing moment together. Most nights they sleep over at one of the girl's 
homes, after an evening of the movies, parties or just hanging out. Those who 
don't have to spend their mornings at summer classes sleep in. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a while Amy Conti, 13, videotapes "All My Children" if it's going to 
interfere with getting to the beach. She and her six girlfriends rely on the 
bus or a parent to get them to the pier at Main Street, although arriving at 
the preferred 1 o'clock doesn't always fit into Mom's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's at this city beach, between the pier and lifeguard Tower 2, where they 
spend about 20 to 25 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This side is where all the surfers are," says Natalie Hallett, 14. "Lots of 
families go on the other side (of the pier)." So do bodyboarders, who don't 
rank as high as their surfboarding counterparts in Natalie's and her pals' 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more cuter surfers than bodyboarders," continues Natalie. "I don't 
why. They're just older. They're cuter." Nearby, Jessica Cashman, 13, and Kelsi 
Black, 14, nod in knowing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Such information counts during these warm, endless days. As much as they enjoy 
the Pacific's natural attributes, the fact that guys add to the landscape makes 
the scene all the more paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's mostly a looky-loo experience. After seeing the same guys for a few 
weeks, they might finally introduce themselves. Even then, the "relationship" 
stays at the beach. It's not about finding a boyfriend, they say. Just uttering 
a quick "hi" and occasionally striking up conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the dudes who check them out, Amy says it's fun. "Except when it's some 
sick, old, 40-year-old guy. Gross!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From where they lounge, an indiscriminate patchwork of oversized towels covers 
parts of the sandy ground, each with its own stock of plastic bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 There's spritzer water to refresh the skin and mineral water to drink, 
bronzing oil, hair lightener, moisturizer. Ragged issues of Mademoiselle and 
Seventeen get passed around. Piles of jeans (cut off or long and extra baggy) 
and T-shirts lie crumpled next to backpacks of every design imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 These seven bikini-clad maidens, like hundreds of their peers along the coast, 
live out the days lying out, swimming, people-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 So do they watch who's hot and not? They remind me that they're not there to 
look at girls. Still, a perfect body can't go unnoticed, no matter how many 
times the admission is accompanied by by "I don't really care." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't," Amy says. "I maybe wish I was like them. But I don't really care. 
Well, I mean I do a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Saraeh Gregory, 14, says it's not an issue of competing with the beauty 
queens, most of whom, she adds, are older. Besides, she says, "there's lots of 
guys here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When they grow tired of their towels, the girls cruise. They walk up and down 
the pier, where they can get a better view of it all ("It's a good place to 
check out guys," confides Amy). 
</P>
<P>
 Main Street Promenade proves better than any air-conditioned mall. You can 
walk in and out of the shops in a swimsuit and shorts, and no one sneers. You 
can shop at cool stores that stock beach, alternative and secondhand gear. And 
there are coffeehouses, Burger King and plenty of other tasty stops. 
</P>
<P>
 About $20 a week goes to the local eateries, each girl figures, for burgers, 
fries, burritos, sodas and other oozing, fried and carbonated grub. Most kids 
at the beach might look like the quintessential picture of health, what with 
their lean, toned and tanned figures, their fresh faces and cottage-cheese-free 
thighs. But a closer look, say to the greasy wrappers next to them, prompts 
some questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the freedom thing. The average teen can consume anything and it won't 
show. Amy and company keep reading magazine articles about eating right and 
exercising. They figure they'll heed the advice and warnings eventually, maybe 
even tomorrow. A couple of them try to as part of their sports training. But 
ask who wants a dripping cheeseburger from Johnny Rockets, and all admit it's 
tough to say no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll care about it later," Amy says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing it off until manana is an integral part of the youth game of life, 
especially when it comes to factors such as junk food, lack of sleep and SPF. 
What about SPF? The subject of the harmful effects of overexposure to the sun 
halts the conversation among them. They look at each other and start laughing, 
somewhat nervously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Ill probably worry about it later in life, like my mom does," Amy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Candipan, 14, agrees. "I don't really think about using sunscreen, 
because I want to get a tan. I'll probably be more conscious about it later. My 
older sister scares me sometimes talking about the dangers. She loads on the 
sunscreen. I do sometimes, but I'd rather use tanning lotion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we're just kids," adds Sarah Shuck, 13. "We have the rest of our lives 
to worry about that stuff. We only do it for two months, and then we go back to 
school," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the burgers and Cokes flow. Let the sun blaze. After all, a reality 
chock-full of bills, deadlines and responsibilities is just a few summers away.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; 'MY FIRST CAR'; IT'S NOT THE MAKE OR MODEL 
THAT MATTERS. MOBILITY IS MEMORABLE BECAUSE IT'S THE KEY TO FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSLIN GEMSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Joslin Gemsch will be a senior this 
fall at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first car is a rite of passage to young adulthood. Forget being 
chauffeured by your parents -- a first automobile is the symbol of freedom. 
These teen-age tickets to independence can be anything from the fixed-up junker 
or shared family car to a sparkling new convertible. No matter what form, the 
first car is an experience not to be forgotten. Bug-eyed 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Troia's search for a car began on a San Juan Capistrano street. Parked 
along the curb was a faded, evergreen-colored 1964 Volkswagen Bug. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it was beautiful. It's a classic. To the average eye it looked like it 
belonged on the side of the street with cobwebs on it," said the 17-year-old 
senior at Capistrano Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy and her older brother, who has his own car, purchased the Bug for $700. 
"The car had potential," Nancy said. "It needed to be on steroids." 
</P>
<P>
 The brother-and-sister team began a restoration process that lasted more than 
a year. The two sometimes worked eight hours a day, fixing the classic car 
inside and out. The electrical system was converted from six-volt to 12; body 
holes were filled with fiberglass; windows were replaced and tinted; new carpet 
and a racing shifter were installed. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Nancy is most proud of is the paint job. "We redid the entire body. 
We filled the dents and put primer over that. Then we block-sanded it and 
applied wax and grease remover," she said. Then brother and sister applied five 
coats of polyurethane paint that transformed the evergreen Volkswagen to a 
mirror-finished raspberry pink. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll keep this experience for a lifetime. It gives me a real sense of 
accomplishment to know that I created something out of nothing by age 16," 
Nancy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy said she likes the fact that people identify her with her car. "People 
always say, 'Oh, you're the girl with the pink Bug!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy developed a personal bond with her car during the restoration. "I think 
my car is a 'he,' " she said. "I can burn-out in it, and I can four-wheel and 
it will still start up the next morning. It's a trooper. We call it Little 
Champ." First Again 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Grisanti's 1968 red Chevy Camaro is an operating piece of history. Not 
only is his car a reminder of the older models of this classic automobile, it 
is a family heirloom. The Camaro was also his mother's first car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was going to get the Camaro. I just came home one day, and 
my parents said 'You can have it,' " recalls the 17-year-old senior at 
Capistrano Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris doesn't plan to pass the Camaro on to his children, though. "I don't 
think my mom would ever let the car out of her sight," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Chris uses a strategy to keep the vehicle as true to its 
original condition as possible. "I try to keep the car away from falling 
objects; you know -- boulders," he joked. He cleans and waxes the car regularly 
and never allows other people to drive it. "Everyone can get a new car, but it 
takes effort and patience to maintain a vintage car," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris' maintenance has paid off. People have pulled up next to his car to 
admire it and ask him questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite his protective measures, Chris still succumbs to the urge to flaunt 
the Camaro's powerful engine. When asked what is the fastest he has ever 
driven, he responded: "The needle stops at 120." Twin Trucks 
</P>
<P>
 Identical twins are mirror images of each other. And Matt and Trent Aronson 
don't seem to mind carrying their similarities beyond their looks. 
</P>
<P>
 They are twins with trucks. Matt drives a brown 1991 Ford; Trent navigates a 
black 1992 Ford F150. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both wanted trucks," Matt said about the coincidence. "It just turned out 
that way," Trent added. 
</P>
<P>
 The twins' father bought the trucks for his sons, and, although they don't own 
the vehicles, Matt and Trent have access to the trucks most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 16-year-olds are juniors at Capistrano Valley High School, they 
each needed a vehicle. Trent's football and volleyball schedules conflict with 
Matt's cross-country and volleyball practices.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are both doing opposite things at opposite times, all the time," Trent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Matt's favorite thing about his truck is its appearance, Trent enjoys 
his roomy, full-sized cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's truck is better? "I think mine is," Matt immediately responded. "It is 
bigger, and it has a better engine, and I think it looks better." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like mine better," Trent countered. "My truck is a stick (shift), and his 
is an automatic. I like to feel the power." Borrowed Time 
</P>
<P>
 You don't catch Robin Benway begging to take her mother's 1990, ocean-blue 
Ford Aerostar minivan out for a spin on Saturday night, but rest of the week it 
gets her where she wants to go.  
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old senior at Laguna Hills High School runs family errands and 
shuttle service in exchange for having access to the minivan most of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 Robin wouldn't mind having a car of her own. "I would be thrilled, ecstatic 
and emotionally exalted by the happiness in my heart and soul," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 However, driving the family van has some advantages. Robin doesn't have to pay 
for gas, oil or insurance. "I drive my brother to various places and run 
errands for my mom, so it's basically a trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
 But the possibility of damaging someone else's property can be stressful. "At 
Taco Bell, I put a huge dent in the side of the door because I misjudged the 
amount of space that I had to park in. My mom was unthrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin enjoys the generous size of the minivan. "My favorite thing about the 
van is the fact that I can intimidate people who drive little Subarus or 
Toyotas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aerostar has been Robin's ticket to adventure. She and six friends once 
made an excursion with a "Magic Mountain or Bust!" sign plastered to the 
window. After they had enough roller-coaster rides, her friends filled her up 
with coffee and told her ghost stories to keep her alert for the drive home. 
"It worked," she remembers. "I didn't sleep all night!" Sweet Sixteen 
</P>
<P>
 It is virtually every teen-ager's dream to open his or her eyes on the 16th 
birthday to the sight of a brand-new car in the driveway. That dream became 
reality for Kelly Seymour, a senior at Capistrano Valley High School. Her 16th 
birthday present was a 1994 jet-black Ford Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of knew I was going to get a car, but basically it was a surprise," 
Kelly said.  
</P>
<P>
 But some unpleasant experiences have followed. "I was in a parking lot at the 
beach, and I was trapped between two cars, and I just backed into one of them," 
Kelly said. Luckily, no damage was inflicted on either vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car has also been a magnet for thieves. "My compact disc changer got 
stolen when my car was in the driveway. I had accidentally left my trunk open," 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's favorite thing about her new car? "The power and the way it handles," 
she says. "I raced a Corvette once. It was fun, but I lost big-time."

 Getting the word out to potential volunteers may be a bit easier for the 
Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Youth Connection Program recently received a $25,000 grant from the 
Weingart Foundation for a three-year program designed to increase volunteer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The program plans to increase the number of nonprofit agencies offering youth 
volunteer opportunities, to develop a working network of information sharing 
and referral service and to increase training and consultation between the 
Volunteer Center and high schools.

 Volunteers from 10 Orange County high schools this month participated in a 
beach cleanup sponsored by the Youth Connection Program at Crystal Cove Beach

BASIA'S BREAK AN 'ILLUSION'; POP MUSIC: SHE'S BEEN GONE NEARLY FOUR YEARS -- IN 
SEARCH OF HER CREATIVE ENERGY, SHE SAYS -- BUT NOW SHE'S BACK WITH AN ALBUM AND 
A TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I heard I had taken time off to have two kids," says Polish-born pop singer 
Basia, chuckling at one of the prominent rumors about her nearly four year 
absence from the music scene. "That's as silly as any of the other rumors. 
People's imaginations were running wild." 
</P>
<P>
 That's bound to happen when an artist who makes million-selling albums -- 
1987's "Time and Tide" and 1990's "London Warsaw New York" -- drops out for a 
few years. Known for her bouncy, pop-oriented blends of soul and samba, Basia 
finally confronted the rumors in May with her third Epic album, "The Sweetest 
Illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Off to a slower-than-expected start, the album peaked at No. 27 on the charts 
and has now fallen to No. 144. However, the collection should get a strong 
boost from her new tour, which begins a Southern California swing tonight at 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 In her West Hollywood hotel this week, Basia, who's last name is 
Trzetrzelewska, sits in the dining room staring at the glorious view of the 
city while she explains what she really did during that hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing that exciting or dramatic -- liking having children or a breakdown or 
kicking a drug habit," she says, firing her words at her usual machine-gun 
speed. "I was working on the album for quite a bit of the time. But we kept 
missing deadlines -- five of them. I kept getting distracted. I think I was 
still winding down from all that recording and touring in the second half of 
the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 The slender singer -- who brings to mind someone with a coffee overload -- 
slows down a second, as if to let her mouth catch up with her mind. Taking a 
sip of her coffee -- decaf , she claims -- she resumes her mile-a-minute 
chatter, still half-glancing at the spectacular view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I see work had been eating me up a little bit," she says, 
revving up again. "One record overlapped the other. It was work, work, work. I 
was trying to get my creative energy back. So what I kept doing was going back 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Basia, who lives outside of London with her band's trumpet player, Kevin 
Robinson, was referring to her birthplace -- Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed home and was missing out on so much that was happening with my 
family," she explains, looking forlorn. "My mom is getting older for one thing 
and I want to spend as much time as I can with her. I'm from a big family and I 
love that atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 But those trips did serve a business purpose too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me something to write about," says Basia, who composes the lyrics of 
her songs, while keyboardist Danny White writes the music. "In my songs there 
are stories about people in my family. They're great source material but that's 
not why I love being around them." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking away from her family has never been easy. As a teen in the late '70s, 
Basia was singing with an all-female Warsaw band that worked throughout Eastern 
Europe, which led to a club opportunity in Chicago in 1979. But she moved to 
London so she could advance her musical career and still be fairly close to 
Poland. She signed a solo contract with Epic in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a chance to do soul and Latin music, which I've always loved, in a 
pop framework," says Basia, who won't reveal her true age, jokingly claiming to 
be 34.  
</P>
<P>
 Singing pop songs exotically flavored with both soul and samba rhythms, Basia 
has carved out a niche in the U.S. market -- much like Sade -- that's fairly 
unique for a foreign-born female singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of falling into a rut, Basia tried something a little different on this 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do more ballads," she offers. "I didn't want to get stuck on dance-oriented 
music. I was sort of hiding behind those dance grooves. I don't do that so much 
on this album." 
</P>
<P>
 Another change is that her voice is a little deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because I took vocal lessons, which brought out that side of my 
voice," she says. "But it's also because of the influence of Anita Baker. I 
love the deep side of her voice and I listen to her CDs constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Winding down a bit, speaking at a lazier pace than usual, Basia reflects about 
recording the album. "I'm satisfied with it," she says. "The only thing I 
wouldn't do again is take so long working on it. I think I'm past whatever I 
was going through when I was making the album. I feel rejuvenated again." 
</P>
<P>
 * Basia performs at 8 tonight at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Irvine, 
$26.50-$52.50, (714) 855-4515; 7:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the Greek 
Theatre in Los Angeles, $19.50-$32.50, (213) 480-3232; at 7 p.m. Tuesday at

H.O.R.D.E. SWEEPING WEST WITH TOUR; POP MUSIC: A GROWING CONCERT PHENOMENON 
WILL STOP AT IRVINE MEADOWS ON SATURDAY FOR AN ALL-DAY FESTIVAL WITH PERFORMERS 
IN THE JAM-BAND TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the original horde commanded by Genghis Kahn, the H.O.R.D.E. Festival is 
about to reach its goal of galloping across an entire continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's all-day encampment at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Saturday 
-- with the Allman Brothers, Big Head Todd & the Monsters and Blues Traveler 
forming an instrumentally adventurous vanguard at the top of the bill -- marks 
the West Coast debut of a phenomenon that has been growing since the first 
H.O.R.D.E. (Horizons of Rock Developing Everywhere) tour in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first tour was basically just a group of friends getting together and 
deciding to do some dates," Blues Traveler's manager David Frey said of that 
two-week jaunt along the East Coast. It involved Blues Traveler and Spin 
Doctors, brother bands that emerged from the same high school in Princeton, 
N.J., as well as Phish and Bela Fleck & the Flecktones. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year H.O.R.D.E. gained in numbers and range in a 25-city tour by Blues 
Traveler, Big Head Todd and other bands with an allegiance to the jam-band 
tradition established by such '60s and early-'70s forebears as Cream, Traffic, 
the Mothers of Invention, the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's H.O.R.D.E. spreads to 32 cities and acknowledges that tradition 
with the reinvigorated '90s version of the Allmans in the headlining spot. 
Opening for the Allmans, Blues Traveler and Big Head Todd, Sheryl Crow lends a 
female presence and a singer-songwriter sensibility to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Lollapalooza," H.O.R.D.E. features a midway-style concourse with such 
attractions as a virtual-reality "LSD flight simulator," an exhibition of Jimi 
Hendrix memorabilia, arts and crafts booths, forums for social action and 
political organizations, and, for the physically adventurous, a bungee 
trampoline and a surfboard variation on the old mechanical bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Also like "Lollapalooza," H.O.R.D.E. will expose less-established talents, who 
will play 30-minute sets on a concourse stage. The newcomers, in order of 
appearance, are the 2 P. C., Jambay, Ugly Americans, Cycomotogoat, Screamin' 
Cheetah Wheelies and April's Motel Room.  
</P>
<P>
 The tour's producer, Peter Barsotti of Bill Graham Presents, points to a 
promising innovation improvised a week into the H.O.R.D.E. itinerary: workshop 
performances featuring some of the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Barsotti got the idea from working on this year's version of Peter Gabriel's 
WOMAD festival. The H.O.R.D.E. workshops were launched last week at the Chicago 
festival site. Blues Traveler's John Popper gave a blues harmonica 
demonstration, with help from Sheryl Crow and members of her band and the 
Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies. Allman Brothers percussionists Jaimoe and Mark 
Quinones gave a drum workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do it every place (on the tour) where we can find three 
sonically isolated spots" that will permit a workshop stage that won't be 
drowned out by main-stage and concourse-stage performances, Barsotti said. That 
could be a challenge at Irvine Meadows. "I'll make it work somehow," he vowed. 
"There's something about being up close to the performers and being able to 
talk to them that makes it special." 
</P>
<P>
 * H.O.R.D.E. on Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center 
Drive, Irvine, (714) 855-4515. $30 and $22.50. Times for the main performers: 
Sheryl Crow, 2 p.m., Big Head Todd, 3:15 p.m., Blues Traveler, 5:15 p.m., 
Allman Brothers, 7:30 p.m. Second-stage performances begin at 12:30 p.m.

311 POUNDS OUT 'PARTY JAMS' TO ITS OWN BEAT; POP MUSIC: SINGER NICHOLAS HEXUM 
CREDITS THE BAND'S ROOTS IN OMAHA -- YES, OMAHA -- FOR ITS SOUND. THEY PLAY AT 
HUNTINGTON BEACH'S CLUB 5902 ON SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The members of 311 had been living in Los Angeles for a couple of months, 
sampling the local music scene, when a big-time record label expressed interest 
in signing them. But the neo funk-rock-rap-reggae quintet decided against doing 
the usual showcase in some prestigious Hollywood venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the band insisted on playing back home, in Omaha. "It's so much more 
of a moving experience there, with 500 or 1,000 teen-agers who know all the 
words, said singer Nicholas Hexum. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, it just wasn't the same. For one thing, many L.A. clubs don't admit 
people under 21, and besides, Hexum noted, "when you see any band around 
Hollywood, there's usually a distance between the band and the crowd, with 
people standing around, sipping their drinks, looking around at the booty. It's 
a totally different thing from a real concert with all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 He says 311 is rediscovering much of that real concert excitement on its first 
national tour, which lands Sunday night at Club 5902 in Huntington Beach. The 
band also has found time to record "Grassroots," its second album for 
Capricorn. 
</P>
<P>
 If listeners have been surprised by the pounding funk energy of this band, 
Hexum said, it is only due to ignorance of the "small but very cool scene" that 
exists in Omaha. Though the state's roster of famous natives includes Marlon 
Brando and William Jennings Bryan, Hexum acknowledged that musically "there 
hasn't been anybody really successful enough to put Omaha on the map" (though 
Matthew Sweet has been a critics' fave). 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a total diversity of music there," Hexum said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's good party jams, man," added 311's co-vocalist, who goes by the name of 
SA. 
</P>
<P>
 311 developed its own hard rhythmic pulse over the course three independently 
released records before working on "Music," its Capricorn debut. Now, after all 
these nights on the road, "we're in the best shape we've ever been," Hexum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A goal of "Grassroots" was to capture the raw energy of 311's live gigs. 
Another was to assemble a collection of songs that fit together, with the aid 
of producer Eddie Offord (who did "Music" and whose resume also includes work 
with Yes). 
</P>
<P>
 The "Music" album, Hexum said, is "three years worth of music, kind of like a 
best of; we took all our best old songs. This new album all was written within 
two months. There is more similarity between the songs. We're more cohesive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hexum first came to Los Angeles when he was 17, after playing with 311 
guitarist Timothy J. Mahoney in a high school band that leaned more toward the 
sounds of R.E.M. and the Cure. In L.A., Hexum was joined by drummer Chad 
Sexton, whom he brought back to Nebraska, where they and Mahoney formed a band 
called Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unity developed into 311 with the additions of SA and bassist P-Nut, who then 
was in the ninth grade. He is the youngest member, at 20; the others are all 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sort of a self-contained group," Hexum said. "We don't have a lot of 
friends who are outside the band. We have our girlfriends and us." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added, "We have really high expectations." He said the members of 311 
never doubted that in L.A. they would continue the success they had found back 
home, and that they weren't really surprised when a record deal came so 
quickly. "In a way, we should have expected to slug it out and pay more dues 
and have to make ends meet. But we didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Filling clubs around the country has further persuaded them to continue with 
the aggressive sound they've developed, without worrying about catering to 
commercial tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me," Hexum said, "the coolest thing is to be a band that has a unique 
style, and that isn't trying to fit into the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 * 311 plays Sunday at Club 5902, 5902 Warner Ave., Huntington Beach. (714) 
840-6118.

LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED PROFIT DROPS AST PRICE; COMPUTERS: SHIPMENT DELAYS REDUCED 
O.C. FIRM'S EARNINGS IN FOURTH QUARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 AST Research Inc. on Wednesday reported a lower-than-expected fiscal 1994 
profit and the personal computer maker's stock paid the price. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said shipment delays in the fourth quarter pulled down that 
period's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 AST common stock fell by as much as $2.25, or 15%, by mid-morning before 
recovering to close at $13.75, down $1.25. About 3.2 million shares changed 
hands in the Nasdaq market, making the stock one of the most active issues on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company posted a profit of $53.5 million, or $1.59 per share, 
for the year ended July 2. That contrasted with a loss of $53.7 million, or 
$1.72 per share, in the prior fiscal year, when AST took a $125-million 
restructuring charge to cover the purchase of Texas-based Tandy Corp.'s 
computer manufacturing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by strong sales in North America and Europe, revenue for the latest 
fiscal year surged 68%, to $2.37 billion from $1.41 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 AST, the world's fifth-largest producer of personal computers, shipped 1.43 
million units in fiscal 1994, up 78% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the company's earnings in the fourth quarter were shy of Wall 
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a good number," said Thomas Rooney, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin 
& Jenrette in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Components problems at the company's Fountain Valley plant delayed shipment of 
its new notebook computers from mid-June to mid-July, said Safi Qureshey, AST 
chairman. Profits also were clipped by the costs of a continuing realignment of 
manufacturing operations overseas, which included moving one production unit 
from Scotland to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 AST also has been moving production of printed circuit boards from Hong Kong 
to south China, and in the latest quarter the company sold its Hong Kong 
factory for $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale helped lift AST's earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter to $14.1 
million, or 43 cents per share. That contrasts with a loss of $87 million, or 
$2.76 per share, in the year-earlier period. Three-month revenue of $584.5 
million was up 43% from $409.2 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in the consumer retail market were up sharply in the fourth quarter 
because of shipments to CompUSA, AST's newest retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey said AST plans to change its line of notebook and desktop computers 
in the next few months. And he said the company would also be introducing 
products in China. "For fiscal 1995, AST is very well-positioned for growth," 
he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts generally agreed. Rooney said AST has plenty of cash ($153 million as 
of July 2), a sound distribution system and now a better-aligned manufacturing 
operation overseas. "I think the pieces are all there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Gilson, an analyst at investment bank L.H. Friend, Weinress, Frankson & 
Co. in Irvine, said he expects AST's sales to grow 14% to 16% in its fiscal 
1995. Virtually all of that growth, he said, is likely to come from outside of 
the United States. Stock Slips 
</P>
<P>
 AST's stock fell sharply after the computer maker posted lower-than-expected 
fourth-quarter results. Monthly closing princes: 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's close: $15.00 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's close: $13.75

147 RESIDENTIAL LOTS SOLD BY BALDWIN CO.; HOUSING: NEWPORT BUILDER GETS $14.9 
MILLION FOR SAN DIEGO PROPERTY. IT ALSO REPORTS 29% QUARTERLY INCREASE IN HOME 
SALES.

 Home builder Baldwin Co. said Thursday that it has sold 147 housing lots in 
San Diego to Standard Pacific Corp., a Costa Mesa builder, for $14.9 million. 
Baldwin also reported a 29% increase in second-quarter revenue from home sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Newport Beach, said revenue for the three months ended 
June 30 was $35.1 million, an increase from $27.2 million for the same period a 
year earlier. For the first half, revenue jumped to $63 million from $46.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company did not report its earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it sold 245 homes for the latest six months, a slight 
increase from the 234 units sold in the same period last year. But prices for 
those properties jumped in the second quarter to an average of $251,000, 
compared to $197,000 for the first quarter this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 147 home lots, all in the Carmel Valley area of northwest San Diego, were 
sold for an average of more than $101,000, which "seems like a reasonable price 
for that area," said Peter Reeb, president of Meyers Group, a Newport Beach 
real estate consulting firm. He said the deal is the fourth recent land 
transaction in San Diego in which lots have sold for $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin, the company's president, said, "We have received a lot of interest 
from home builders looking to purchase lots." The Standard Pacific sale, he 
said, will "substantially enhance" Baldwin Co.'s liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The land sale comes just in time for an $8.5-million bond interest payment due 
Monday as part of the company's $155-million privately placed junk bond 
offering, sold a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will make our bond payment on time, with or without a land sale," Baldwin 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company said it has sold 49 model homes for a total of $7.7 
million and has arranged to lease them back.

BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOBILES; TOYOTA FOUNDATION TO TREAT SANTA ANA FIFTH-GRADERS TO 
TOUR OF THE HEAVENS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proving that you don't need a car to take an unforgettable ride, the Toyota 
USA Foundation is funding a program to enable all fifth-graders in the Santa 
Ana Unified School District to cruise the heavens visually. 
</P>
<P>
 The charitable arm of Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales USA is paying to send 
each fifth-grader -- 8,800 of them next year and in the 1995-96 school term -- 
through Starlab, Orange County's only portable planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toyota foundation, which emphasizes science and math programs, was asked 
to provided the nascent science center with the $15,000 it needed to acquire 
Starlab, said center development director Pamela Shambra. "But we only asked 
for funding for the planetarium," she said. "When they wrote back, they said 
they'd not only pay for it but that they'd finance bringing the program to 
Santa Ana's fifth-graders for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The total bill came to $64,000. For its money, Toyota gets its name on the 
planetarium wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Starlab, contained in an inflatable dome 21 feet in diameter and 11 feet high, 
reveals the planets and 4,000 or so stars that are visible at night. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just open to Santa Ana's fifth-graders. Part of the Launch Pad 
preview program for the science center, scheduled to open in 1997, Starlab is 
available to any school or group interested in science education, Shambra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of the program, which comes to the school or other meeting facility, is 
$3.50 a person (the dome holds 30 at a time). To get more information or make 
reservations, call the Starlab coordinator at (714) 965-0818 or the science 
center office at (714) 540-2001.

 Collector Car Sales: The annual Newport Beach Collector Car Auction drew 
nearly 14,000 people to the Hyatt Newporter resort July 8-10, and bidders in 
the crowd spent a total of $2.4 million buying cars, the event's organizers 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of the 250 vehicles offered at the auction were sold, with 
prices ranging from a low of $175 for an unrestored 1962 Ford F100 pickup truck 
to $310,000 for a 1927 Rolls-Royce touring car. 
</P>
<P>
 In what looks like good news for the local economy and for auto investors, 
sales at the Newport auction were up 15% and the crowd count was up 30% from 
1993, said Don Williams, president of World Classic Auction & Exposition Co., 
the Northern California company that stages the event each year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related event at the auction, the Shelby Historic Garage Sale, one bidder 
paid $10,000 for Carroll Shelby's autographed racing helmet. One of the race 
car driver and designer's trademark black cowboy hats went for $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby, a Texan best known as the designer of the Shelby Cobra sports car, 
raised nearly $150,000 in the auction, a portion of it earmarked for the Shelby 
Heart Fund to provide heart transplants and cardiac care for indigent children.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: INTERBIKE NAMES FORMER TRADE SHOW EXHIBITORS IN 
ANTITRUST SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interbike, which produces bicycle industry trade shows, has sued a number of 
former exhibitors alleging antitrust violations in connection with the creation 
a new, competing expo. 
</P>
<P>
 Interbike, based in Newport Beach, hosts trade shows in Anaheim and 
Philadelphia.The company alleges that Schwinn Cycling & Fitness Inc., Yakima 
Products Inc. and several other manufacturers violated antitrust laws last year 
when they organized the competing Bicycle Industry Organization trade show and 
allegedly pressured other manufacturers to skip Interbike's annual events. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the 
manufacturers created their own trade organization in a bid to ruin Interbike. 
A Bicycle Industry Organization spokesman said Thursday that the group has not 
seen a copy of the suit.

LESSON PLAN; OXNARD OFFER OF HOME MAINTENANCE TRAINING OFFENDS LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city plan to start teaching public housing residents in Oxnard how to take 
better care of their apartments has infuriated some community leaders and 
residents who see it as an insult to the city's poorest Latino families. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at Colonia Village, Oxnard's largest housing project, said the 
city's maintenance workers have a lot of nerve to criticize their work habits 
by asking them to take a course that includes training in such household tasks 
as changing light bulbs, cleaning refrigerators and unplugging toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's maintenance workers could use some lessons themselves, the 
project's residents said. They accused the city of lagging behind schedule so 
badly that some people have had to wait eight years to have their houses 
painted -- only to have shoddy work done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've painted much better than the job they did on my home," said Maria 
Fernandez, whose kitchen paint is already beginning to flake off after city 
workers painted it last year. "They're the ones who need a course." 
</P>
<P>
 One La Colonia leader charged that the plan, titled "Self Help," is racist and 
implies that public housing residents are ignorant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm surprised the city would consider such a program," said Carlos 
Aguilera, president of the La Colonia Neighborhood Council. "It's unfortunate 
that they feel the Mexican people need housekeeping skills. What do they think, 
that the people in public housing are pigs and slobs?" 
</P>
<P>
 The planned program, set to begin next January, will involve a two-day, 
eight-hour training course at a practice facility replete with a refrigerator, 
stove, toilet and other standard household equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to show them what type of cleaners to use, so they don't use 
steel wool on a refrigerator and scrape off all the paint, that kind of thing," 
said Rick Shear, Oxnard's superintendent of maintenance for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials said that many public housing residents simply do not 
know how to perform rudimentary household tasks and that the program is needed 
to save them from incurring costly maintenance fees for elementary work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aguilera disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really trying to say that if things aren't going right for you, that 
if you're living in public housing, you're less of a person, you're dirty," 
said Aguilera, who has several family members living in the city's Colonia 
Village housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every public housing resident thinks the plan is offensive, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people live like slobs, and it infringes on other people," said Michael 
Arriaga, president of the tenants' association for Oxnard's 100-unit Pleasant 
Valley housing project. "I think some people maintain their animals better than 
their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But most residents at the 430-unit Colonia Village on Thursday said they are 
more than capable of doing minor repairs and proper maintenance on their homes 
-- if the city will only let them. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard does not allow people living in public housing to do even small 
handiwork. City officials want to allow project residents to do minor 
maintenance work, but feel that the course is needed first. 
</P>
<P>
 The wood beneath Herlinda Lopez's kitchen counter has decomposed so badly that 
tiles and pieces of wood are crumbling onto the floor. She called the city's 
maintenance department six years ago, asking for help. They have yet to arrive, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't handle the work, they should let us find someone to do it," 
said Lopez, who still cooks in the kitchen for her husband and two children. 
"If they gave us the materials, we would do it. But they don't give us 
anything, and they charge us for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard maintenance workers demand fees for all their work -- even for drilling 
holes in apartment walls so residents can hang pictures, said Homero Martinez, 
president of the Colonia Village Tenants Assn. He said the rate per picture 
hole is 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said he and others would like to start their own handyman business to 
service the project, but they lack the money to get started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, how hard could this be?," Martinez said, pointing to a slumping 
fence. "A child could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council member Andres Herrera said the planned program should be seen as 
a positive way to encourage home maintenance and repairs, adding that he might 
stop by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess some people would take offense to being told how to maintain their 
homes," Herrera said. "But as a landlord, you have to make sure your tenants 
are keeping up your property, and I think that is the intent here." 
</P>
<P>
 The planned program would be voluntary for all current residents, but required 
of anyone applying for public housing after January. Shear said it was aimed at 
easing the overburdened housing maintenance department, which has only 16 
employees to perform repairs on the city's 780 public housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to tell people how to clean their apartment," said Oxnard 
Housing Programs Manager Bernard Carn. "That's not the intent. It's to inform 
them how to keep things in good order and from breaking down."

JUDGE REJECTS VENUE CHANGE FOR THORNTON TRIAL 
</P>

 Mark Scott Thornton's trial in the murder of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan 
will remain in Ventura County, a Superior Court judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys had asked that the trial be moved to another county because 
of extensive pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Charles R. McGrath ruled that defense attorneys had failed to prove 
that news coverage of the case had compromised Thornton's right to a fair trial 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he believes that an impartial jury could be seated in the case 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, who had put on three days of evidence to show why the case 
should be moved, were quick to criticize the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree," Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher said after the ruling. He 
said there have been more than 170 newspaper stories and 120 television 
broadcasts on the matter since O'Sullivan disappeared Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we have met our burden," he said. "If this is not a reasonable 
likelihood of the defense not being able to get a fair trial, I don't know what 
would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Bronson, a law and political science professor at Cal State Chico, 
testified before McGrath that 85% of eligible jurors in the county had some 
knowledge of the case and that two-thirds of them believed that Thornton was 
guilty of killing O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronson designed a scientific survey conducted of 403 respondents in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, McGrath acknowledged that publicity in the case had been 
extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Ventura County, with nearly three-quarter million people, is a 
large enough area to overcome the level of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also said that while the O'Sullivan homicide is unfortunate, it does 
not meet the usual legal requirement for a change of venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, cases are moved to other jurisdictions because they have captured 
the public's attention with multiple murders, torture or child victims, lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors applauded the judge's decision. Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. 
Kossoris said a prosecution survey showed that 78% of the people in the county 
had knowledge of the case. But most of those surveyed were not familiar with 
the specific details, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ruling is the latest in a series of setbacks on pretrial motions 
for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have twice tried unsuccessfully to get the indictment 
against Thornton thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 In one motion, they challenged the ethnic makeup of the grand jury that 
returned the indictment against Thornton. They claimed that the panel did not 
contain enough minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, a judge ended that challenge by refusing to force county officials 
to provide the defense with detailed historical data on the ethnic makeup of 
the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, defense attorneys argued that prosecutors asked leading questions 
during the grand jury proceedings in the case and acted improperly in 
performing background checks on potential grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 But another judge ruled that prosecutors were not out of line in their 
dealings with the grand jury and thus Thornton's constitutional rights to due 
process were not violated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, McGrath left defense lawyers the option of renewing their request 
to move the trial to another location if the lawyers are unable to find enough 
impartial people to fill the jury box. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris said he believes that McGrath's ruling limits a renewed request to 
only a worst-case scenario. "If 80% of the people come in and say, 'I've 
already got my mind made up and let's string him up today,' then they can renew 
the motion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 6.

HOMEOWNERS UNITE AGAINST FEE INCREASES; VENTURA: COALITION LEADER SAYS 
CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATIONS CARRY 'DISPROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL BURDEN.' A CITY 
OFFICIAL DISAGREES. 
</P>

<P>
 Last month, Ventura residents saw their water fees go up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, they watched the City Council hike their garbage collection rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ventura's condominium associations are fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council of Ventura has just passed an increase in water and 
sanitation rates," announces the prerecorded tape on the Ventura Homeowner 
Assn. Coalition hot line. "And, the worst is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are trash fees scheduled to rise, but so will taxes imposed by the 
county flood control district, the tape says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all of this, the HOAs are forced to carry a disproportionate financial 
burden," warns the voice of Marv Rochetti, chairman of the new coalition. 
"Please leave us your name, title and the name of your HOA organization, and we 
would like to invite you to our August meeting."  
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, organizers promise, will give a single, unified voice to 
thousands of condo owners, vocally representing their interests any time that 
City Hall attempts to charge them more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now players in the political scene," Rochetti said Thursday of the 
fledgling operation, which purports to represent 15 of the roughly 45 
condominium associations in Ventura. That means that the coalition speaks for 
about half of the 4,000 condominium households citywide, Rochetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the coalition germinated last month among condo owners in La 
Ventana Greens when the city reconfigured water rates and fees for the complex 
at Johnson Drive and Telephone Road, boosting water bills significantly. 
"Whenever something comes up, it's always, 'Let's sock it to the homeowners,' " 
Rochetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated because they believed that no one at City Hall listened to their 
individual complaints, La Ventana Greens homeowners realized that strength lies 
in numbers. They contacted some other condominium associations that also saw 
their fees rise and held a preliminary meeting earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month should be the real organizational meeting, where the presidents of 
the various condo groups can get together and brainstorm how to blockade 
municipal service fee hikes, Rochetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Graumlich, an employee of Ventura's public works department, said the 
city welcomes comments from residents. But the La Ventana Greens group is not 
telling the full story, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura charged all condominium associations a flat rate for water service 
last year, and only reconsidered the fee structure because La Ventana Greens 
homeowners and other condo associations complained, Graumlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family homes, in contrast, had a tiered rating system that charged 
homeowners higher fees for higher usage. And, Graumlich said, condo owners 
wanted the same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So the city constructed a tiered rating system for apartment and condo 
complexes this year -- and La Ventana Greens' water rates suddenly shot up, 
Graumlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're no longer being subsidized by the other condos that are more 
efficient," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graumlich said condo associations that are saving money under the reworked 
billing system have not contacted city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Owen, another La Ventana Greens homeowner, said he and his neighbors are 
still unhappy because the system puts well-landscaped complexes such as theirs 
at a disadvantage to most single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Owen and Rochetti said whatever discriminatory measures have been 
passed against condos in the past will not happen again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we're like all the other HOAs," Rochetti said. "We're NIMBYs -- 
not in my back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just fine with Steve Bennett, a city councilman and former 
grass-roots activist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome the democratic input," said Bennett, who voted for this year's 
water fee increases. "If they all come to our meetings, then they will have 
more understanding of the costs we face." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The next meeting of the Ventura Homeowner Assn. Coalition is tentatively 
scheduled Monday. For information, call the coalition's hot line at 655-7787.

D.A., SHERIFF CONSIDER INITIATIVE ON FUNDING; FINANCE: OFFICIALS, REACTING TO 
SUPERVISORS' BUDGET CUTS, WANT ALL PROPOSITION 172 MONEY SPENT ON PUBLIC SAFETY 
EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Frustrated by budget cuts forced on them this week, Ventura County law 
enforcement officials are considering a ballot initiative that would bind the 
county to use all of its Proposition 172 revenue to improve public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I along with several others in public safety are exploring the 
possibility of a local initiative," Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said 
Thursday. "It would eliminate the loopholes through which the supervisors 
managed to cut our budgets." Sheriff Larry Carpenter said he too would join an 
initiative effort. "I will support whatever it takes to tie their hands," he 
said. "I'm angry and bitter on behalf of the citizens of Ventura County who 
voted for Proposition 172." 
</P>
<P>
 Their remarks represent the latest round in a continuing power struggle over 
the special sales tax revenue that voters approved in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials maintain that every penny of the estimated $28 
million Ventura County will receive from the tax in the coming year should go 
toward expanding, not just maintaining, services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, before voters approved the proposition, the Board of Supervisors 
agreed to spend all Proposition 172 money on expanding public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 They took the first step toward allocating the money in March, pledging $24 
million toward new jobs and programs for law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, the supervisors took $1.2 million of that money and shifted it 
to other programs, angering the sheriff and district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the supervisors have never committed $4 million of the coming 
year's $28 million in Proposition 172 revenues to augmenting any program. That 
money will go, instead, to maintain current services in the Sheriff's 
Department, county officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the original Proposition 172 initiative, however, prevents the 
county from doing that. In fact, many counties have simply used the sales tax 
to replace, rather than augment, county spending, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, the sheriff and district attorney do not have that much to 
complain about, supervisors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything wrong with what the sheriff's doing, but the board came 
pretty close to the (March) agreement," said Supervisor John K. Flynn, an 
advocate for the law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are probably concerned about a foot in the door, and next year there's 
probably a bigger door opening." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury, blasting the board for dishonesty and "Machiavellian tactics," had 
previously threatened a lawsuit and recall elections against supervisors 
tampering with public safety's money. On Thursday, he said the ballot 
initiative looked like the most viable option to protect the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late for this year's election, Bradbury said they would aim to put the 
measure on the next countywide ballot. But that would not come until November, 
1995, according to the registrar of voters office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said the initiative would assert the need to expand services and 
would strictly define public safety, including the county's Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the supervisors overlooked the firefighters after four law 
enforcement and court agencies came forward with the $24-million proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very hot issue in the near future," said Ken Maffei, who 
heads the Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn. "I think you're going 
to see an initiative. And I think you're going to see all public safety 
departments participating." 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said his organization did polling and legal research on a similar 
measure earlier this year. "Our poll indicated that it would win by a 
landslide, like 90% of the voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters dropped their initiative effort in the spring, believing that 
county supervisors would give them $2 million to $3 million of the sales tax 
revenue, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fire Department did not formally request the additional funding in 
budget hearings, and the supervisors did not provide any. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have been considering cuts in public safety since June, when 
they learned that the state would withhold $10 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury and Carpenter, hoping to stave off cuts, offered to absorb $2.5 
million worth of county services. That included assuming hiring and purchasing 
responsibilities within their departments, as well as taking over entire 
programs like the medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors allowed them to assume the services, initiatives that could 
cost the sheriff about $500,000 and the prosecutor about $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But they balked at broader consolidation plans that would have moved the 
medical examiner's office and legal services for children under the public 
safety umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the board voted to take $917,000 from the sheriff to pay for the 
medical examiner's staff and about $300,000 from the prosecutor to pay for 
children's legal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They completely distorted what we had said," Bradbury said. "That kind of 
dishonesty in government is what the public is so outraged about." 
</P>
<P>
 But supervisors said they received few calls about the issue after Tuesday's 
final budget vote. Even Flynn, who argued staunchly for the sheriff and 
district attorney, said the outcome was not that disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was not exactly what public safety wanted, but I think it comes 
close," he said.

DONATIONS SWAMP ARTS PLAZA FUND-RAISERS; THOUSAND OAKS: TWO NEW PHONE LINES ARE 
ADDED TO HANDLE THE UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Swamped with calls, Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza fund-raisers on Thursday 
added two new phone lines to help them handle an unprecedented surge in 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been phenomenal, the amount of interest and activity," said Stephen 
Woodworth, who heads up the Alliance for the Arts fund-raising campaign. "We 
can't handle all the calls." 
</P>
<P>
 The two new lines will double the Alliance for the Arts' phone capacity. And, 
alliance officials say, it's not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Civic Arts Plaza nears completion, residents are starting to realize 
the cultural center's potential. This week's reports about the inaugural season 
schedule -- which includes performances by magician David Copperfield, comedian 
Bill Cosby, and country singer Willie Nelson -- have fanned the enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I don't think people had an idea of the quality of programming they 
would see in their own back yard," fund-raiser Martha Zilm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilm has accepted a full-time job as donor relations coordinator for the 
Alliance for the Arts. But this week, she has found it tough to perform her 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone's been ringing so incessantly that Zilm hasn't even been able to get 
a dial tone to call out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot tell you how much the phones are ringing -- just constantly," she 
said over the phone as a nonstop jangling in the background proved her point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've probably been receiving hundreds of calls a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the calls, of course, have little to do with fund raising. Residents 
call demanding tickets, inquiring about the grand opening or simply wondering 
about construction progress on the $64-million cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the merely curious sometimes end up opening their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have so far sold more than 3,000 bricks in their "Brick Buy Brick" 
campaign. A $50 gift buys a brick embossed with a name or company logo -- a 
brick that will sit permanently in a walkway outside the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunning a shot at immortality, a few donors have decided not to engrave their 
own names on the bricks. Instead, they have gone for a bit of whimsy. One brick 
will bear the name Wonder Woman. Another proclaims: Ms. Dragon Bait and Mr. 
Woodpecker. A third is labeled Most Loved Twinkie. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council candidate Lance Winslow, who owns the Car Wash Guys, bought a 
brick and named it Rush Limbaugh. "I'm not a big fan of his," Winslow said, 
"but I figured he would have a lot to say about the Civic Arts Plaza. I thought 
it may get a couple of laughs." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who would prefer not to see their names trodden underfoot can plaster 
their monikers on plaques in the civic auditorium. For $1,000, donors can buy a 
name plaque to be mounted on the back of one of the plush, violet-hued chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 485 people have bought chairs so far, including every department head 
in Thousand Oaks City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the seats and the bricks and the major corporate donations, 
fund-raisers have gathered more than $5 million in cash and pledges. They 
expect to collect $7 million by opening night in October, and reach the goal of 
a $10-million endowment by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so busy that all our staff and volunteers at the alliance are under a 
lot of strain these days," Woodworth said. "Needless to say, this is the kind 
of strain we like." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for the Arts now has four phone lines operating on three numbers: 
379-1966, 371-1387, 371-1388. For tickets, call the temporary box office in The 
Oaks mall at 449-ARTS. For grand opening information, call the city at 
496-8688.

BOYS & GIRLS CLUB IS LIKE A SECOND HOME FOR MOORPARK YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boredom drove Carlos Cordova, 15, to the Moorpark Boys & Girls Club. And the 
fear of boredom has kept him coming back for the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live up on Grimes Canyon Road," he said, standing just outside the club's 
recently renovated gymnasium. "There's not a lot to do up there. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get bored. Here you can meet new people and hang out with friends. 
There's a lot of stuff to do."  
</P>
<P>
 Carlos, selected as the club's youth of the year last year, is one of about 
100 youths -- most between the ages of 7 and 15 -- who are dropped off by their 
parents at the club each morning or who arrive by foot each day after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos' parents send all five of his younger siblings, including his 
5-year-old sister Yessenia, to the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the club's director emphasizes that official day-care services are 
not available, many parents faced with spending much larger sums on day care 
opt to pay the $12 per year it costs to enroll their children in the club. 
</P>
<P>
 While other groups charge as much as $100 per week for summer programs similar 
to that of the Moorpark club, officials said they want to keep fees low so that 
children from low-income families will keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, many working families depend on the services they offer, club 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Day care is a major expense," said Michelle Romero, whose 10-year-old 
daughter Leeanna goes to the club after summer school. "I work all day. I can't 
be with her, but I can send her to the club and be sure that she'll have fun 
and won't be bored. I know a lot of parents who can't afford child care, who 
send their kids to the Boys & Girls Club." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club is part of a national organization based in Atlanta 
whose goal is to provide a healthy environment for children to develop 
physically and socially.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to teach children how to survive out there," said Tony Linton, 
the Moorpark Boys & Girls Club president, who is a quality control manager with 
Rockwell International.  
</P>
<P>
 Linton said the programs, including sports leagues, outdoor activities and 
arts and crafts, hinge on social interaction. He said many of the children and 
their parents consider fellow club members as part of an extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the number of programs offered at the club increases, and so do the 
number of youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985 when the club was started in Moorpark, it had about 30 youths and was 
located in a one-room trailer at the Chaparral Middle school. Today, Linton 
estimates that the club, now located in the gymnasium of the old Moorpark High 
School on Casey Road, has more than 1,200 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The club bought the gym in 1991 for over $500,000 from the Moorpark Unified 
School District. The organization made a $150,000 down payment, but still owes 
the school district about $395,000. Linton said the club is planning to ask 
local corporations next spring to help them pay off the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the money owed to the school district, the club is also trying 
to raise funds to repay a $50,000 loan it received from the city to help make 
the down payment on the gym. It also owes about $30,000 in back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we have to do more fund-raising," Linton said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has cost more than $100,000 to renovate the building. Before the 
renovation, the gym floor was dangerously warped and bowed-out in sections. The 
roof leaked, and during every storm the primary activity of the club's 
executive director, Antoinette Carbone-Sarcinella, was to carry out the buckets 
that had collected water dripping onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have carried 40 gallons of water myself during one storm," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The roof is fixed and the cedar-tongue floor is polished and in prime 
condition. The renovated gym, the centerpiece of the club, is used during 
summer for a youth basketball league. Linton said more than 600 youngsters 
participate each year in the league, making it the club's most popular 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton said the club does a good job of making do with what it has. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The club's activities center is located in the gym's locker room. The children 
set up their paints on the white tiles where the shower was once located. They 
make do with a small library consisting of about six book shelves. Until a 
recent break-in, the club had two computers in its computer room. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the arts and crafts and afternoon exercise classes, some of the 
children play pool on the mini-pool table set up in one on the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Smith, 14, is particularly adept at running the table, beating all 
comers for a good hour one morning. She has been coming to the club for more 
than five years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to come here, I just like it," she said. "It's fun and this is 
where most of my friends are. If I wasn't here I guess I'd be at home watching 
TV."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; LIBRARIAN SAYS FAREWELL TO JOB AFTER 12 
YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Friends and co-workers bid adieu to retiring Moorpark head librarian Mary 
Crockford on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crockford, 63, who has worked for the Ventura County Library Services Agency 
for 12 years, took the helm of the Moorpark Library in 1985. She will be 
replaced by the acting head librarian in Port Hueneme, Sara Ellinwood, who 
starts work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'm looking forward to retiring," Crockford said. "It has been 
wonderful. I had a great staff and a lot of friends, but the last year has been 
stressful." 
</P>
<P>
 Crockford had to cut back to half time after the county sliced a large portion 
of the libraries' budget last year. The cutbacks coincide with an effort to 
expand the library and accommodate the growing number of patrons. Since 
Crockford took control of the library, the city's population has grown from 
7,000 to more than 27,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the library has been busier, I had to cut my hours in half," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, the county pledged to pay $260,000 to expand the facility. The 
city has pledged another $65,000 for the effort, but library boosters had to 
resort to a telethon to raise the additional $60,000 to $80,000 they needed for 
the effort. The expansion is scheduled to begin some time before the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said that the financial crisis would have been difficult for 
anyone to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's been very confounding for her," Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason 
said. "She's been wonderful at it though." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, the library is open just 20 hours a week, weekday afternoons 
and Saturdays, and is closed on Sundays. Local officials have said that despite 
the increase needed for library services in Moorpark, future cutbacks are still 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Crockford said Thursday that she is still dedicated to helping the library, if 
she can, as it tries to stave off more cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not leaving town," she said. "I still plan on being active in the Friends 
of the Library. It's important to me." SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 4 OF 5 SUPERVISORS OPPOSE SOS MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After poignant testimony this week, four of five members of the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors agreed to a resolution opposing the "Save Our State" 
initiative, which would deny education and social services to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard abstained from the vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative purports to save $300 million in state and local revenue by 
withholding medical care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents expressed support for the measure, which will appear on 
November's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board is out of order taking a stand," said Louise Moore, who declined to 
say where she lives. "We're supporting people who are breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors expressed concern about the illegal immigration problem, but laid 
blame on the federal government's border policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking this to an initiative does not deal with the real problem we have to 
deal with," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. Often, she added, such measures have 
unexpected consequences for communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The SOS measure, for instance, would require schoolteachers to confirm the 
immigration status of their students. That could cost the schools $10 million 
annually, according to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuts in medical care could begin to threaten community health if students did 
not receive immunizations or seek treatment for contagious diseases, argued 
Bernardo Perez, president of El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, a social 
services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This constitutes not just a threat to individuals but to the public health," 
Perez wrote in a letter to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore argued that her own family can barely afford health care. "It just 
goes against the grain with me," she told the board. "My money is short."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA TO BE SITE OF EXPORT AID CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of 30 new centers designed to help businesses across the country increase 
their exports has been slated for Ventura County, federal officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Export Assistance Center will be part of a new federal program to provide 
small and mid-sized businesses with information and financial assistance to 
help them find customers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing exports is a key to creating new jobs in Ventura County, local and 
federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a strong link, especially in California, between exports and jobs," 
said Jana Goldsworthy de Ruyter, executive director of the California Central 
Coast World Trade Center, a nonprofit group that provides trade assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports account for one in every seven jobs in California, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added exports would not only increase manufacturing and agricultural jobs 
here, she said. They would also heighten the demand for workers at the Port of 
Hueneme and for truckers who carry products to and from the port. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Ventura office, which is expected to open by the end of 1995, will 
provide a range of services -- including marketing and financial assistance -- 
to local businesses looking to increase their exports. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown will publicly announce plans today 
to open a network of export assistance centers nationwide -- all linked by 
computer, according to Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 An exact location for the Ventura office has not yet been selected, but an 
official at the Department of Commerce said Thursday that the center will 
include representatives from Commerce, the U. S. Small Business Administration 
and the Export-Import Bank of the U. S. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are just the kind of services we need here," Goldsworthy de Ruyter 
said. "The addition of this kind of facility should have a strong positive 
influence on our economy." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JUDGE RULES AGAINST MANUAL VOTE RECOUNT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura accountant Scott Weiss, who failed by one vote to qualify for a runoff 
in the race for county auditor-controller, has lost his bid to force the county 
to do a manual recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson ruled Thursday that county elections 
officials acted properly by discounting ballots on which voters punched holes 
next to two or more candidates and ballots in which no holes were punched in 
the auditor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss has contended that he would have edged out opponent Richard Morrisset in 
the June 7 election had those ballots been counted. Morrisset will face 
appointed Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon in a runoff in November. JULIE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CONTRACT AWARDED FOR HIGH SCHOOL 
STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley school board awarded a $1.4-million contract to Carroll 
Construction Co. this week to build an athletic stadium at Westlake High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara-based company presented the lowest of three bids for the 
project, which is expected to be completed by May of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the lowest bid was more than the school district had planned to pay 
for the new 3,646-seat concrete stadium, which is being financed primarily 
through community donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bids were higher than we anticipated they would be," board member Dorothy 
Beaubien said Thursday. "There will be some shortfall, but it will be made up. 
It is not a major problem." 
</P>
<P>
 About $1.2-million has been raised for the project, leaving a shortfall of 
about $250,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Mildred Lynch said the money will be made up through funds the 
district receives from city redevelopment taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the stadium will start at the end of August. TRACY WILSON

 Firefighters on Thursday doused a fire of unknown origin that destroyed a 
young couple's Camarillo garage and charred a white car parked in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris and Tia Bush reported the fire in their garage at 3188 Belair Court at 
7:06 a.m. after being alerted by neighbors, who spotted smoke pouring out of 
the structure, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters from three engine companies extinguished the blaze about 30 
minutes later, after freeing a dog from the back yard, said county fire 
dispatcher Vicki Sosa. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa said investigators could not determine what ignited the blaze, which 
caused about $90,000 worth of structure and property damage. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SHOOTING VICTIM CAN SUE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man paralyzed in a shooting by a Ventura County sheriff's deputy can 
sue the county, an appeal court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by the 2nd District Court of Appeal overturns Ventura County 
Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane who dismissed the man's lawsuit in a 
summary judgment two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion, written by Justice Kenneth R. Yegan, said Lane was correct in 
dismissing the portion of the lawsuit that contended Daniel Moreno's federal 
civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his ruling, Yegan said the lower court should not have thrown out 
Moreno's claims of assault, battery and negligence under state statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno was one of four men who went to a Camarillo shoe store in February, 
1990, to beat up the assistant manager, who had allegedly fondled Moreno's 
daughter, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 After the assistant manager called for help, Sheriff's Deputy Linda Hagemann 
arrived and saw the four men fleeing the store, according to court records. 
Hagemann yelled "Freeze!" as three of the men ran around a corner. She yelled 
"Freeze!" again, and fired her shotgun as Moreno started to turn toward her, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pellets hit Moreno in the skull, paralyzing him on his left side. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Allen B. Grodsky, who worked on Moreno's appeal for the American 
Civil Liberties Union, said Thursday's ruling clears the way for Moreno's civil 
suit to move forward in the lower court. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; NEW DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR APPOINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a unanimous decision, the Camarillo City Council has approved the 
appointment of longtime resident James M. Jevens to be the city's economic 
development director. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next month, Jevens, 56, will assume the position vacated late in May 
by Thomas Flavin, who resigned to accept a similar position with the city of 
Ventura.The council appointed Jevens at its meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Weldon Canyon project manager for Waste Management Inc., Jevens will 
be paid $1,875 for 25 hours of work a month on an 11-month contract, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jevens no longer works for Waste Management, he does consulting work for 
Taconic Resources, a partnership backing a controversial ballot measure that if 
successful will allow a landfill to be constructed in the canyon between Ojai 
and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Although initially concerned about a potential conflict of interest between 
his consulting roles with Taconic and the city, members of the council voted 
for Jevens after he pledged that his work with the San Diego-based company 
would be radically scaled back shortly after the Weldon ballot issue is decided 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the council pointed to Jevens' long residency and civic leadership 
as reasons for his selection out of a field of about 20 candidates. He is a 
former Chamber of Commerce president and a current member of the board of 
directors of the Camarillo Boys & Girls Club. J.E. MITCHELL

OXNARD MAN DROWNS IN VENTURA RIVER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man drowned in a fishing hole in the Ventura River on Thursday 
evening after his friends were unable to reach the non-swimmer who slipped and 
fell into the water, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was pronounced dead at 7:15 p.m. at the Ventura County Medical 
Center.Authorities did not immediately release his name, pending the 
notification of his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The drowning occurred as four men were fishing in the riverbed near Ojai 
Rubbish Service Inc. off Crooked Palm Road just north of Ventura city limits, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them fell in, and he was a non-swimmer," Sheriff's Lt. Gary Cook said. 
"The others tried to get him and couldn't get to him." Cook said the victim's 
friends had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:15, authorities received a call for help, relayed by a worker at Ojai 
Rubbish. "They contacted someone at Ojai Rubbish and there was a language 
problem and they called us," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time firefighters arrived, the man had been pulled from the river and 
up a path, said Ventura City Fire Capt. Mike Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got there, he was unconscious with no pulse and no respiration," 
Vaughan said of the man whom he believed to be middle-aged. "He had lots of 
water in his lungs." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite efforts to revive him, rescue workers could not feel a pulse or 
resuscitate his breathing. The man was transported by ambulance to the county 
hospital where he was pronounced dead. JULIE FIELDS and JASON GRANT

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'FLINTSTONES' VIDEO HITTING STORES IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's up in home video for the rest of the year? 
</P>
<P>
 The best place to find out this week was the 13th annual gathering sponsored 
by the Video Software Dealers Assn., a four-day event at the Convention Center 
here that concluded Wednesday. The nation's video retailers perused exhibits 
mostly showing off tapes that video companies will be marketing for the next 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some significant happenings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the announcements of new movie videos, the biggest was MCA/Universal 
revealing that "The Flintstones" is coming out Nov. 8 at $20. This is the third 
heavyweight on the fall schedule, which so far is highlighted by another 
MCA/Universal hit, "Jurassic Park," and Disney's "Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs." Other announced releases: FoxVideo's Western "Bad Girls," due Sept. 
28, and Columbia TriStar's "Above the Rim," arriving Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no dates have been officially announced, sources at the convention 
indicated late November releases for "Maverick," "Getting Even With Dad," "City 
Slickers 2" and "When a Man Loves a Woman." The December schedule should 
include "I Love Trouble," "Wyatt Earp" and "Blown Away." Some distributors were 
saying that two big summer hits, "Speed" and "True Lies," should debut on home 
video at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judging from the strong push for interactive software, consumers should look 
for more of it to show up at their local video stores in the next year. Hordes 
of CD-ROM publishers and distributors were trying to persuade video retailers 
to stock their software.  
</P>
<P>
 These titles are now more attractive to video retailers. The difference is 
that the software is now more geared to the average consumer. Two years ago, 
most of it was education-oriented. But with such players as Paramount now in 
the game, there's been a surge of titles with high entertainment value -- the 
kind video retailers are more likely to stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * The most impressive showcase of an upcoming title was Turner Home 
Entertainment's "Baseball," the video version of Ken Burns' 18 1/2-hour epic 
that's airing on PBS Sept. 18-28. In the middle of that broadcast period, on 
Sept. 23, Turner will market the entire series, on nine cassettes. The set 
sells for $180, but individual tapes will be available at $25 each. Turner 
executive vice president Stuart Snyder said he expects purchases of the entire 
set to dominate sales. The most popular single cassette, he predicted, will be 
the one focusing on the Negro Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very possible that a baseball strike will be raging in late September. 
Will that dampen interest in the series? 
</P>
<P>
 At a separate press conference, Burns said it might have a negative effect. 
Snyder, though, disagreed, arguing that baseball-starved fans would be even 
more eager for the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Throughout the convention, everyone was buzzing about the opening-night 
speech by Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. He ripped MCA/Universal, 
which will be marketing four older titles at drastically cut-rate prices 
through McDonald's in November. Purchasing a sandwich will entitle the consumer 
to buy a video for $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Such marketing practices, Katzenberg charged, devalue videos in the eyes of 
the consumers. If they get used to spending $6 for a tape, they'll balk at 
spending the usual $10-$20. Most retailers, also wary of such competitors, 
strongly backed the Katzenberg attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest: One of the primary values of this convention is that it 
spotlights small companies selling non-theatrical videos. Among the more 
interesting tapes: 
</P>
<P>
 * "You Can Do Much More for Your Body," a 48-minute exercise tape for seniors, 
assembled by and featuring Ed Perazone, a 64-year-old former engineer. At the 
convention, he said this program is a alternative to the heavily hyped 
celebrity tapes that, he charged, "have more entertainment value than exercise 
value." He added: "It's a low-key program that's OK for older people who don't 
start out in great shape." From Wellspring Media, at $20, (914) 693-2366. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another specialty exercise tape, "Big on Fitness." This one is for 
overweight people, with a workout led by five overweight women. Since many who 
might use this program would probably be in poor physical shape, it's loaded 
with valuable cautions. From Superior Promotions Inc. at $15, (800) 441-9501. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you want to learn Spanish and money is no object, then you might consider 
the "Spanish Video Tutor Program" from HABLA!, a package that includes eight 
video tapes and 15 audiotapes. The price, though, is $395, (800) 422-5299. 
What's New On Video 
</P>
<P>
 "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" (Paramount); what's eating Grape (Johnny Depp) 
is being stuck in a small Iowa town working as a grocery clerk, coping with a 
quirky family that includes a 500-pound mother (Darlene Cates) and a retarded 
brother (Leonardo DiCaprio). Romance, with a perky woman played by Juliette 
Lewis, further complicates his life. A warmhearted, ultra low-key, fairly 
enjoyable comedy/drama. DiCaprio's Oscar-nominated performance is remarkable 
but Cates is even better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blank Check" (Disney); a 9-year-old (Brian Bonsall) wallows in riches after 
cashing a gangster's blank check for a million dollars. But, since this is a 
Disney fable, there's a moral (Money isn't as satisfying as love), which spoils 
the fun. Pre-pubescent youngsters will love this movie, which has heavy "Home 
Alone" overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wrestling Ernest Hemingway" (Warner); two lonely old codgers (Richard Harris 
and Robert Duvall) grapple with some of the miseries of aging. As usual, Duvall 
is brilliant, adding grit to a somewhat sappy melodrama. One of the attractions 
is Sandra Bullock, who's sped to stardom starring in "Speed," playing a 
supporting role as a waitress. Strongest appeal to fans over 50. Shirley 
MacLaine and Piper Laurie co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cabin Boy" (Touchstone); Chris Elliott, who starred in the Fox-TV series "Get 
a Life," is featured in this comedy about a prim preppy on a ship with a bunch 
of nasty, drunken fishermen. Bad movie that will try the patience of even 
Elliott's most devoted fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pinky" (FoxVideo); directed by Elia Kazan, this 1949 drama was considered 
very daring in its day. A poor, light-skinned black (played by Jeanne Crain, 
who is white) from a small Southern town goes to a Northern nursing school and 
passes for white. The story begins when she returns home, gripped by a whopping 
identity crisis and in love with a white doctor (William Lundigan). Somewhat 
dated but still a fairly powerful drama. Fascinating example of post-World War 
II Hollywood liberalism. Ethel Waters and Ethel Barrymore co-star. FILMS ON 
VIDEO
