ROBIN ABCARIAN: GOOD INTENTIONS TAXED TO THE MAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, the attorney in charge of making sure Administration officials 
comply with tax laws was punished because he hadn't complied with tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
 And so William H. Kennedy III -- who didn't pay 1991 taxes for a nanny, and 
who earned nearly $600,000 in private practice in 1992 -- joins the growing 
list of Clinton Administration scofflaws . He was relieved of some of his 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 I read the news. I snickered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bet he doesn't forget to pay his taxes this year, I thought, with nonpartisan 
malice in my heart. If I have to suffer through the paperwork, so should he. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way around it. Those of us who pay Social Security taxes for our 
sitters are deluged with forms and filing dates. And if we miss a little 
deadline, there are penalties and interest to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 You decide to go legit -- to do the right thing by Uncle Sam and your child's 
caregiver. And the next thing you know, the government is dropping paper on you 
like it's Malathion and you are a Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong -- conforming to the tax code has never been a priority for 
me. It's not as if my career ambitions would be affected. I've inhaled far too 
often to seek public or appointed office anywhere . . . except maybe Berkeley, 
where most of the inhaling took place. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that I care about making sure the wonderful woman who helps with my 
child gets a decent retirement and disability should she need it. 
</P>
<P>
 The paperwork, however, is making me insane. 
</P>
<P>
 How can I tell? 
</P>
<P>
 Because I'm thinking of voting Libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the mail brought a little notice from the IRS. Was it a "Thank you 
for being that honest one American in four who paid her nanny tax last 
quarter"? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
 Last quarter, I paid the baby-sitter's tax almost three weeks late. Now I am 
being fined. And Uncle Sam, usurious creep, is collecting interest on top of 
the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 To compound the punishment, the government included explanations: 
</P>
<P>
 If you receive a bill, refund or other notice from the Internal Revenue 
Service, you may call us at your local IRS office for an explanation. All days 
mentioned in these explanations are calendar days, unless specifically stated 
otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
 What is a calendar day? And how is it different from, say, a day day? 
</P>
<P>
 In the next paragraph, I learn how my $22.36 fine was calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 We charged a 5% combined penalty of 4 1/2% for filing late and 1/2% for paying 
late, because, according to our records, you filed your return late and didn't 
pay your tax by the due date of your return. The combined penalty is 5% of your 
unpaid tax for each month or part of a month your return is late, but not for 
more than 5 months, which would total 25% (22 1/2% late filing fee and 2 1/2% 
late paying).  
</P>
<P>
 Wake me up when this is over. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 22 1/2% late filing penalty for the first 5 months your 
return is late, we continue to charge the 1/2% late paying penalty for each 
month or part of a month for as long as your tax is unpaid, but not for more 
than 25%. Therefore, the maximum penalty we can charge is 47 1/2% (22 1/2% late 
filing plus 25% late paying).  
</P>
<P>
 And I thought childbirth was hard. 
</P>
<P>
 If you didn't file your return within 60 days of the due date, the minimum 
penalty is $100 or 100% of the balance of the tax due on your tax return, 
whichever is smaller. If you think we should remove or reduce this penalty, see 
"Removal of Penalty."  
</P>
<P>
 What? Huh? Where were we? 
</P>
<P>
 I must have slipped into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is not enough for the IRS to get in my face four times a year about our 
baby-sitter's earnings; the government also feels it necessary to let me know 
how much time I am supposed to spend on this torture: 
</P>
<P>
 Record-keeping: 20 min. Learning about the law or the form: 20 min. Preparing 
the form: 32 min. Copying, assembling and sending the form to the IRS: 20 min.  
</P>
<P>
 Screaming at your family to shut up while you work on the forms: three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 This patronizing data is mandated by the richly ironic Paperwork Reduction 
Act. How ironic is it? Well, our baby-sitter's tax file is several inches 
thick, and our child is only 18 months old.  
</P>
<P>
 I cannot help but be reminded of an exchange in "Henry IV, Part I," which my 
father-the-professor has drilled into my head over the years: 
</P>
<P>
 Glendower: I can call spirits from the vasty deep.  
</P>
<P>
 Hotspur: Why, so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do call 
for them?"  
</P>
<P>
 (And, dare I imagine. . . .) 
</P>
<P>
 Glendower: And I can even order the government to reduce paper work.  
</P>
<P>
 Hotspur: Why, if you could do that, the taxpayers would be overcome with joy.  
</P>
<P>
 Glendower: Never mind then.

MOVIE REVIEW; THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS?; JOE PESCI IS WELL-CAST 
AS BARRY LEVINSON'S 'JIMMY HOLLYWOOD,' AN ACTOR WAITING FOR HIS BIG BREAK WHO 
FINDS HIS BEST ROLE IN REAL LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Directors offering tribute to the acting profession has become a mini-trend 
lately, and why not: Where would these auteurs be if the performers weren't 
there for them? However, in an ironic but inevitable twist, in each case the 
acting process and lifestyle are filtered through that director's distinctly 
personal lens. 
</P>
<P>
 So while writer-director James L. Brooks' "I'll Do Anything" stressed the 
wildly neurotic comic insecurity of the profession, Abel Ferrara's "Dangerous 
Games" (scripted by Nicholas St. John) was a lacerating look at its darker 
psychological corners. And writer-director Barry Levinson's "Jimmy Hollywood" 
turns out to be just the kind of flimsy doodle of a movie, amusing but small in 
scale, you might expect from the director of "Diner" and "Tin Men." 
</P>
<P>
 What "Jimmy Hollywood" isn't reminiscent of is the elaborate films Levinson 
has done most recently, big-ticket items like "Bugsy" and "Toys," with stars 
like Warren Beatty and Robin Williams attached. While Levinson tends to go too 
far in the opposite direction here, often ending up with minimal emotional 
effects, "Jimmy Hollywood" does have its shambling pleasures, starting with Joe 
Pesci in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the name Jimmy Alto, but known to pals back in New Jersey as Jimmy 
Hollywood because of his passion for the movies, he is one of those 
self-absorbed "Day of the Locust"-type characters who hover around the edges of 
the industry in sunglasses, dyed-blond hair and loud tropical shirts waiting 
for that one break. 
</P>
<P>
 Though success as an actor has easily eluded him (he seems, in fact, never to 
have actually gotten a part), Jimmy retains full confidence that he knows all 
the angles and all the answers. Didn't he blow Andy Griffith off the screen in 
a reading, only to lose the role because of "politics"? And hasn't he just made 
the shrewd career move of investing in an ad on a bus bench at a particularly 
high-profile corner of Sunset Boulevard? Like the Energizer Rabbit, Jimmy never 
ever runs out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
 And since the two people in Jimmy's life, his hairdresser girlfriend Lorraine 
de la Pena (Spanish actress Victoria Abril in her American debut) and his best 
friend William (Christian Slater), a mentally challenged Hollywood Boulevard 
street urchin, accept Jimmy the way he is, things probably would have gone on 
this way forever. Except for the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 One unfortunate night Jimmy's car gets broken into and his radio stolen. 
Vowing revenge, Jimmy and William stake out the neighborhood with a video 
camera. One amusingly implausible turn of events leads rapidly to another and 
suddenly these two find themselves mistaken both by the media and the police 
for a powerful vigilante organization dedicated to retaking the streets of 
Hollywood for decent folk. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he is anything else, Jimmy is an actor, and the best parts of 
"Jimmy Hollywood" (curiously reminiscent of "General Della Rovere," the Italian 
classic starring Vittorio De Sica as a petty criminal whose life changes when 
he impersonates a resistance leader) involve the way this man embraces 
vigilante leadership as the role of his life, enabling him to use all the "deep 
acting stuff" he's been working on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Considerable care has been lavished on Pesci's character, on detailing all the 
foibles of a man who is so endearingly self-deluded his darkest threat is 
"you're out of the Oscar speech." Pesci, himself an Oscar winner for 
"GoodFellas," has a fine time with the part, commanding the screen and almost 
hypnotizing you with his brash patter. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems with "Jimmy Hollywood," paradoxically, is that there is 
too much of Jimmy in it and too little of anything else. Writer-director 
Levinson appears to have been mesmerized by his title character, to the point 
where Victoria Abril and especially Christian Slater have had to make do with 
undernourished roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's plot has related problems, first taking its time to kick in and 
grandly bypassing plausibility when it does. Still, Jimmy Hollywood is such a 
determined character that the cockeyed fable he's lent his name and story to 
manages to carry you along even as it gets further and further out of hand. 
Maybe the guy can act after all. 
</P>

ART REVIEWS; LESSONS FROM A PAIR OF MASTERS: HOCKNEY, BLUHM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Hockney is such an agreeable, beloved and adept artist it is easy to 
slip into the error of finding him less than serious, a kind of virtuoso dandy. 
</P>
<P>
 His first local solo gallery exhibition in five years includes two dozen 
paintings, drawings, prints and gouaches. It finds him seemingly up to his old 
trick of paying homage to classic modern styles, kidding a little, while 
quietly probing for fresh and personal meaning. In this case, the language is 
largely abstract. 
</P>
<P>
 The work clearly reflects the same slightly funky visual concerns that 
inspired his recent set for Strauss's opera "Die Frau ohne Schatten." 
</P>
<P>
 The general style of this new batch of work is based on that weird late Cubist 
phase of Picasso, when he used Swiss-cheese-shaped fragments and salted it all 
with a little Surrealism. Strange receding planes with rows of pegs look like 
De Chirico. Clunky wave shapes echo the Futurists. Brushy paint handling tips 
its hat to German Expressionism.  
</P>
<P>
 But the resulting images don't look like any of their sources. In a couple of 
drawings they look like Hockney thinking about Saul Steinberg and wondering 
what Steinberg would come up with if he thought about Hans Arp. In short, 
Hockney is making art the way all the best L.A. art has been made, blending 
many existing sources to unique result. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a different twist to this work. All the references to other art 
somehow function as a distancing mechanism. It's as if the artist somehow 
doesn't want to cop to what he's feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Titles reveal him trying hard to be his usual casual, smart, witty self. "The 
Fifth Very New Painting" shows off his superb color sense in a palette of 
green, lavender and ocher. "The Ninth Very New Painting" includes visible 
shapes such as a red rear-end and a kid-like drawing of the Eiffel Tower. But 
the work, like most of the others, comes across as a spooky night scene where 
everything is on the precipice of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 This art expresses immense nostalgia for the vanished glory days of early 
modernism. It tries hard to keep its mind on that but can't quite shut out a 
real world that's falling apart around it. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Louver Gallery, 77 Market St., Venice; through April 23, (310) 
822-4955. * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who despairs of the possibility of seeing good painting these days 
should go straightaway to a museum-quality exhibition by Norman Bluhm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluhm, rarely seen on the West Coast, is a member of that lost second 
generation of New York Abstract Expressionists that nonetheless eventually 
managed to produce such fine talents as Alfred Leslie and Grace Hartigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, now in his mid-70s, performs with the wisdom of his years, the 
physical energy of a man of 30 and the imaginative abandon of an infant 
Bacchus. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 big compositions attain sizes as large as 8-by-20 feet. All play off 
a recipe of Rorschach-blot symmetry suggesting everything from stacks of 
luscious spraddled pink nudes to Tarot cards mirroring one another in a kind of 
send-up of symbolism. You can see Bluhm thinking of Aubrey Beardsley and 
Alphonse Mucha with one half of his brain while the other contemplates 
Gargantua, Paul Bunyan, Willem de Kooning and Delacroix's "The Death of 
Sardanapalus." 
</P>
<P>
 He announces he's into decadence with titles like "Turkish Harem" or "Oriental 
Madonna." Plummy color schemes involve blacks, blues and lavenders. His great 
accomplishment, however, is the way he lays into the prissy over-refinement 
that makes the 19th-Century forerunners of this art look so neurotically 
exhausted. Bluhm's pictures say phooey to all that investing sybaritic 
exoticism with all the juice it deserves. The paintings ooze like big wet 
kisses and overripe persimmons. The show is hugely entertaining and ferociously 
sensual.

 'American Playhouse,' PBS Split: "American Playhouse" has confirmed it will 
leave PBS next year, after producing nearly 200 dramas for public television 
over the last 14 years. The move follows a decline in Public Broadcasting 
Service funding for the productions, which has dropped from a high of $10 
million a year to the current $6.6 million, with projections for 1997 falling 
to less than $1 million. Instead, the nonprofit company will form a new 
venture, Playhouse Pictures, in partnership with the Samuel Goldwyn Co. Plans 
call for the production of 15 commercial features over the next three years, at 
a cost of $70 million. More than 40 of "American Playhouse's" previous 
productions, including "Longtime Companion" and "Stand and Deliver," were first 
released in theaters. Under the new agreement, PBS will still get the broadcast 
rights to the productions, but only after they are offered to theaters, home 
video and cable.

 Classic Movies' Starting Lineup: The new commercial-free cable network Turner 
Classic Movies will launch at noon on April 14, marking the centennial of the 
first public presentation of motion pictures at New York's Times Square. 
Programming will begin with a 24-hour movie marathon, starting with the 
complete road-show version of "Gone With the Wind" -- including the original 
overture, intermission and exit music, plus rare footage from the 1964 Civil 
War centennial reissue in Atlanta. Other titles in the opening marathon include 
"Singin' in the Rain," "It Happened One Night," "Citizen Kane" and "The Asphalt 
Jungle." The network, which promises to screen nearly 400 movies a month, also 
plans a series of monthlong tributes focusing on such legends as Greta Garbo, 
George Cukor and MGM's 70th anniversary. MOVIES

 New Date, Distributor: Martin Lawrence's solo concert movie, "You So Crazy," 
which was given a restrictive NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, will now be released with no rating on April 27 by the Samuel Goldwyn 
Co. Goldwyn picked up the film after Lawrence disagreed with the original 
distributor, Miramax Films, about cutting the movie to make it qualify for an R 
rating. Miramax co-chairman Bob Weinstein said Tuesday that as a Walt Disney 
Co. subsidiary, his company is bound by MPAA ratings. Miramax agreed that the 
film would be "adversely impacted" if it were released with the NC-17 
designation, which would effectively bar it from mainstream movie theaters or 
from being advertised on television and in major publications. As an 
independent company, however, Goldwyn is free to release the film into theaters 
as Lawrence wanted, uncut and unrated. That leaves the decision of whether to 
book the film up to individual theaters, which are also not bound by the MPAA's 
restrictions. THE ARTS

 Citywide Soccer Murals: Five new murals will be erected on the route between 
Los Angeles International Airport and Pasadena to celebrate the World Cup 
soccer finals at the Rose Bowl this summer. The murals, which are expected to 
be completed by June 1, will be painted by artists Willie Herron, Johanna 
Poethig, Roberto Salas, Olivia Gude and the team of Michael Schnorr, Susan 
Yamagata and Todd Stands, as part of the World Cup's ARTS94 program. 
Administered by Venice's Social and Public Art Resource Center, the program 
will create murals on a parking structure at LAX and on the 405 Freeway just 
south of Manchester. The other three will be painted along the 110 Freeway -- 
one just south of the 7th Street overpass, one on a nearby building between 8th

MOVIE REVIEW; 'THUMBELINA' A MAGICAL ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Bluth's "Hans Christian Andersen's Thumbelina" casts its spell so 
effectively that you don't even have to be a child to be swept away to its 
magical never-never land. Another success from Bluth and his partner Gary 
Goldman, whose previous animated hits include "The Secret of NIMH" and "An 
American Tail," it is a work of lilting pace and charm with an array of 
enjoyable rather than memorable songs, with lyrics by Jack Feldman and Bruce 
Sussman and music by Barry Manilow.  
</P>
<P>
 As a work of animation, it is securely in the Disney tradition of simply 
designed whimsical characters set against painterly landscapes and interiors. 
Bluth's script, in fact, is so sturdily constructed that he actually could have 
gotten away with a more venturesome, contemporary style and still appeal to 
family audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 A lonely woman (voice of Barbara Cook) living in a cottage on the outskirts of 
medieval Paris so longs for a child that she visits a "good witch," who gives 
her a barley seed, revealing, when it blossoms, a tiny living creature, a 
pretty young woman whom her new mother names Thumbelina (voice of Jodi Benson) 
because she's no bigger than her thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbelina brings joy to her mother, but she soon grows lonely, longing to 
enter the world of fairy tales because the figures in her mother's book are the 
same size she is. Magically, her wish is granted, and she soon meets and falls 
in love with the handsome Prince Cornelius (voice of Gary Imhoff), whose wings 
leave trails of stardust and who rides a bumblebee for longer journeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the young lovers are not about to get to live happily ever after so 
early in the game, and, sure enough, Thumbelina is kidnaped by the amorous toad 
Grundel (voice of Joe Lynch). She escapes only to land momentarily in the arms 
of Mr. Beetle (voice of Gilbert Gottfried) and finally winds up for the winter 
in the care of Ms. Fieldmouse (voice of Carol Channing), who thinks she'd be 
the perfect bride for the homely, sightless but rich Mr. Mole (voice of John 
Hurt), whose underground quarters possess a movie palace splendor. At times, 
Thumbelina seems as imperiled as a heroine in a Samuel Richardson novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not innovative, Bluth and company are certainly imaginative, taking 
us into their enchanting world so completely its people actually become real 
for us. There are a number of quite impressive set pieces, most notably a 
high-stepping nightclub sequence in which the jazzy Mr. Beetle and his pals 
dance up a storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The casting of the performers who supply the voices is especially inspired, 
making full use of the distinctive sounds and personalities of Channing; Hurt; 
Charo, who voices Grundel's mother, a knockout performer in the Carmen Miranda 
manner, and Gino Conforti, who voices Jacquimo, the swallow who befriends and

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MAJOR LEAGUE'S' HIGH SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for the fact that it was a commercial hit, the 1989 baseball movie 
"Major League" was not the sort of film that cried out to be sequelized. But a 
lot can happen in five years -- for one thing, baseball movies seem to be 
hanging in there. (So are sports movies in general.) So here's another go-round 
with the cloddy, come-from-behind Cleveland Indians sluggers who once again 
stumble in pursuit of the American League Eastern Division championship. Want 
to bet they make it again? The people behind "Major League II" are no dopes: 
They must already be cooking up "III." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the same players from the first film put in repeat appearances. 
Charlie Sheen's Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn is now a superstar with a seven-digit 
salary, a stretch limo, a fancy girlfriend and a groomed GQ look to replace his 
former punkishness. Dennis Haysbert's Pedro Cerrano has gone Buddhist; he 
chants in the locker room and compliments opposing pitchers on their fastballs. 
Willie Mays Hayes, played in the first film by Wesley Snipes and here by Omar 
Epps, has been making Hollywood movies in the off-season as the action hero 
Black Hammer. Tom Berenger's Jake is back as the manager, replacing James 
Gammon, who spends his best moments in the film cheering the Indians from a 
hospital bed while he's pretending to watch "Masterpiece Theatre." Bob Uecker, 
as the Indians' perpetually bedraggled play-by-play radio announcer, puts in 
another appearance, dressing down from his Liberace-like duds to a T-shirt as 
the Indians slide into the cellar. (His aghast expostulations are the film's 
highlight.) 
</P>
<P>
 If only the "Naked Gun" folks had stepped in to really shake things up! 
Baseball movies are ripe for a full-out lampoon but "Major League II" keeps 
pumping up its "heart." We learn all sorts of homiletic life lessons about the 
value of sportsmanship and Being True to Yourself. Why do sports movies always 
have to devolve into civics lessons? To its credit, "Major League II" doesn't 
go in for a lot of moony sentiment about America's Pasttime but it ends up 
tenderized anyway.

of yelling in the bleachers.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JAD FAIR SURFACES AT THE NUART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The term underground rock legend is tossed around pretty carelessly these 
days, but Jad Fair is the real deal. Making records with his group Half 
Japanese and under his own name, the Baltimore nerd has been inflicting his 
obsessions on the world since the late '70s.Fair has exerted a strong influence 
on the independent rock scene, but remains too elusive to be lit by the 
reflected glory. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nuart Theatre on Monday he remained something of an enigma -- unsullied 
innocent or a genius of the put-on? -- even after the 90-minute documentary 
"The Band That Would Be King." Fair himself followed the film with his first 
L.A. show in five years. Backed by a local pickup trio, he played his "love 
songs and monster songs" in a sloppy but engaging set. It veered from driving, 
Velvets-derived rockers to unaccompanied segments in which he wound his guitar 
strings into random tunings and chopped out rapid rhythm patterns. He didn't 
bother to retune for the next full-band song, but after a few hours in Jad's 
World, that made perfect sense. RICHARD CROMELIN

TV RATINGS; SURPRISE! OSCAR DOES WELL--AND SO DOES ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With ratings just a fraction below those of a year ago, the Academy Awards 
telecast emerged as the highest-rated entertainment program of the season and 
helped propel ABC to its third victory in as many weeks. With Whoopi Goldberg 
as host, the Oscar show attracted 49% of the available viewers, the A. C. 
Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC had 12 other programs among the Top 20, including two episodes of "Home 
Improvement," a Barbara Walters special, "NYPD Blue," "Thunder Alley" and three 
of its news series--"Turning Point," "PrimeTime Live" and "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its strong performance the past few weeks, ABC will be unable to catch 
CBS in the seasonal prime-time standings. The so-called "official" 30-week TV 
season--the period used to compare one season to another, even though first-run 
programming continues--ends April 17. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, meanwhile, didn't get Winter Olympics-sized ratings with its World Figure 
Skating Championships on Friday and Saturday, but that event drew larger 
audiences than CBS garnered on Thursday and Friday for coverage of the NCAA 
basketball tournament. Southland Ratings 
</P>
<P>
 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area 
during the same week. Each rating point equals 50,064 households.

TV REVIEW; MET'S 'I LOMBARDI' A PROBLEMATIC OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Verdi's fourth opera, "I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata," has faults of 
exuberant youthful genius, but they hardly merit the drubbing several East 
Coast critics gave the work when the Metropolitan Opera staged it for the first 
time in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, by stage director Mark Lamos and set designer John Conklin, on 
the other hand, is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Written when the composer was 29, the opera stacks three stories on top of one 
another: a feud between two brothers, a love affair between a Christian woman 
and a Saracen prince, and the Lombards' first crusade to win the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
 At its worst, it is a brisk, episodic, occasionally unfocused and sometimes 
perfunctory historical pageant. None of that matters much. Verdi already 
grounds the larger social and historical issues in the conflicts and 
relationships between individuals. He also creates character-defining melodies 
and choruses of sweep and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in the heroine's denunciation of both sides of the Christian-Saracen 
struggle, he inadvertently makes the piece vault its 1843 origins to our own 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 At 58, Luciano Pavarotti sings the Saracen prince Oronte with well-preserved 
freshness and sweetness, rising to the heights sometimes with effort, sometimes 
with ringing tone. Slimmed down a bit, he also acts with involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over from Aprile Millo, Lauren Flanigan sings Giselda with bright, 
steely and pitch-wandering focus and acts with intensity. (During the run, 
Flanigan actually sang the role seven times, as opposed to Millo's three.) 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Ramey brings a dark, burly bass and generalized energy to the evil 
brother (later saintly hermit) Pagano. Bruno Beccaria counters as a nearly 
unbearably tremulous, hoarse-sounding, eye-popping good brother Arvino. 
</P>
<P>
 James Levine conducts with eminent spirit and affection for the Verdi idiom. 
Brian Large's wandering close-ups unfortunately tend to capture the singers at 
the very moments they're checking cues with the conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamos and Conklin create an airy and abstract world ludicrously dominated by 
symbols: a gigantic floating crucifix and a forest of red crosses for the 
Christian scenes, a blood-red, crescent moon for the Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunya Ramicova's clashing designs dress the Muslims as caricatures; wisely, 
Pavarotti dons dignified silvery-blue robes.

HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIFTED STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "An E for Excellence or Elitism?" March 23: 
</P>
<P>
 Every school district should be fortunate enough to have a Whitney High 
School! 
</P>
<P>
 It allows the students that want to learn the opportunity to be educated by 
teachers who want to teach without being burdened by the disruptive and rude 
young people that waste so much valuable classroom time. Attitude is 
everything. Hooray for Whitney High! 
</P>
<P>
 DONNA STREFLING

</P>
<P>
 * With regard to your article on Whitney High, we think there are some items 
that need to be examined. There seems to be the assumption that if you are a 
gifted ABC School District student, Whitney is the only place to go if you wish 
to succeed. At Cerritos High School we offer 12 different Advanced Placement 
classes and last year 275 of our students took almost 500 AP tests; 36% of our 
seniors go on to four-year schools and a full 75% go on to either two- or 
four-yer schools, and those seniors going to the UC system do better than the 
Whitney students by the latest statistics. It is no crime to be bright at CHS. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us also point out that the students admitted to Whitney are not 
necessarily the brightest but rather those who do well on a sixth-grade 
standardized test. If Whitney does not want to be like other schools, why is 
there a demand for a gym and for an expanded athletic program? It would appear 
they want to have their cake and eat it too! 
</P>
<P>
 Also, by siphoning off the "best and brightest," do not some students lose out 
because they no longer have access to advanced classes because the numbers do 
not warrant the classes being offered? How many of us did better in school 
because of the competition from the bright students now not found at most ABC 
schools? And if Whitney is not elitist, where are the special schools for the 
middle- and lower-quartile students, who also might like to have a school of 
their own?

 * As an Asian American student attending Whitney, one thing came to my mind as 
I read your article. I noticed that all the dissenters about the system were 
adults, not the kids who were left out of Whitney High School. If the kids 
themselves that couldn't make it don't mind, or seem to care, why should 
teachers and administrators at other schools seem to care? Kids generally 
respect Whitneyites for being smart, instead of harboring a grudge against them 
because they didn't make it.  
</P>
<P>
 Whitney does not discriminate against African Americans or Latinos; it 
discriminates against Asian Americans. As an extreme example, my friend, who is 
Chinese, scored 183 out of a possible 194 and a writing sample of 4 and was not 
admitted. Another kid who is half-Asian and half-white scored 150 and 4 and was 
admitted. There may be other factors involved, but when one person scores 40 
points above another and the lower score gets in, that is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to mention that dozens if not hundreds of people move to Cerritos 
or the ABC District to try to get into Whitney. So, let's acknowledge Whitney 
as a first-rate school with great students and greater teachers and 
administrators.

<P>
 * Hurrah for the achievement of students at Whitney High School. Critics who 
charge that a selective school is elitist are ignoring the fact that forcing 
gifted students to remain in classrooms where teachers teach to the "middle" 
does a disservice to everyone. Gifted students deserve to be challenged to 
perform at the highest level they can; not to do so wastes a great human 
resource. 
</P>
<P>
 I am the product of one of the five public high schools in New York which give 
admission exams. I attended the Bronx High School of Science and had a 
marvelous education, which enabled me eventually to pursue a career as a 
college educator and administrator. Many of my classmates have gone on to be 
top performers in their chosen fields. My husband, also a graduate of Bronx 
Science, was so bored as a student in the traditional classrooms that he 
refused to go to school. My son, as a highly gifted child in a regular 
classroom, was sent to teach in the lower grades (he was 8 at the time) because 
his teachers did not know what to do with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Equal education does not mean keeping everyone at the same level. All students 
should be in classes where they are motivated to do their best. It serves no 
purpose to mix the gifted with average children in the same classroom; the 
gifted one is bored and the average ones feel stupid in comparison to the 
brightest ones.

OCTOPUS AT CABRILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a marine biologist and educator I feel compelled to comment on the 
actions of the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals in protesting the 
display of the Octopus dolfleini individual by the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium 
(March 19). The activists have missed the mark and need to temper their zeal 
with biological knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Objections of the animal rights activists to the size of the tank and the 
conditions under which the octopus is displayed underline their biological 
naivete. Mary Beth Sweetland, director of the group, decries the condition of 
the animal as "smashed up . . . between the rock and the glass" and states her 
desire to see its arms stretched "out to their entirety." As explained by 
exhibits director Mike Schaadt, octopuses prefer to shelter in very confined 
spaces. In fact, these animals are secretive to the extreme, sheltering in 
lairs -- small crevice areas -- where they remain unless foraging for prey. 
These organisms also modify their color pattern and skin texture to mimic their 
surroundings and remain hidden. A large tank where the animal could "stretch 
out" would be the last choice of habitat by an octopus. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium have consistently demonstrated 
concern for the health and well-being of the organisms on exhibit, as well as 
having excellent understanding of how to educate the public to appreciate and 
preserve the marine environment. The manner in which this individual was 
acquired -- proprietors of a local fish market chose to donate the octopus to 
the aquarium rather than butchering and selling it for profit -- is in itself 
proof of the effectiveness of the preservationist efforts of the aquarium and 
the effect on the fishing community.

 * Congratulations to reporter Deborah Schoch for getting everyone's side of 
the story about the octopus.  
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo's main argument seems to be that it is "anthropomorphic" to name the 
octopus and to believe she would wish to be free. Of course, aquariums avoid 
naming their captives for the same reason laboratory workers are advised to 
number, not name, the monkeys, rats, and dogs they see exposed to radiation or 
force-fed drain cleaner. The goal is to keep people from identifying with the 
victims -- to forget that the animals are feeling beings who, like us, enjoy 
freedom and pleasure and fight pain, loneliness and death. It is a dishonest 
tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Cabrillo's offer to release Octavia should she start to self-mutilate 
from stress -- that would be a trifle late, wouldn't it?

 * It was good to read that Mayor Richard Riordan and City Council President 
John Ferraro have made positive moves to improve the conditions at the Los 
Angeles Zoo (March 23). I hope these improvements will be put into motion with 
a minimal delay. 
</P>

 Some thoughts came to mind as I read this article: If Director Mark Goldstein 
cannot get along with the animal keepers and has not earned their respect, if 
Goldstein cannot make good decisions in the best interests of the animals he is 
overseeing, and since Goldstein has proven over a two-year period to be a very 
overpaid underachiever, why keep him as director of our zoo? Couldn't his 
$120,000 per year salary be better spent?

 * After the death of the elephant, Hannibal, at the Los Angeles Zoo, a 
committee was formed to aid Goldstein in the transfer and acquisition of 
animals. Now the mayor has proposed that an outside management expert be 
brought in to assist the director in the zoo's master plan 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't the obvious become obvious? Perhaps an expert committee should be 
formed to find a new zoo director.

CULTURE WATCH; SENSE IN NONSENSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Drama comes in two great forms, as everyone knows, comedy and tragedy, 
corresponding to life itself, which is sometimes comic, sometimes tragic. But 
everyone also knows that life itself is sometimes neither comic nor tragic but 
merely ridiculous.The phrase theater of the absurd has entered the language 
because it so perfectly matches this middle region of our non-theatrical 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ridiculous" is a phrase that many a theatergoer has thought while 
viewing a play by Eugene Ionesco, who died Monday in Paris at 81. This is as it 
should be: Ionesco, among the most playful of playwrights, was sometimes funny; 
but more than "This is funny," his judgment on our time was "This is 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 And in that judgment, the loaded word was this. This -- the normal play in the 
normal theater for the normal audience -- was ridiculous when another this -- 
the world outside the theater -- was peopled by ludicrous saints and murderous 
clowns. By recreating in the theater the elusive emotional quality of the world 
about which we say, with a distinctly contemporary sigh, "This is ridiculous," 
Ionesco began a tradition of originality and richly theatrical vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Satire -- unhappy but also unsad -- lies between comedy and tragedy. And like 
his great colleague and early patron Samuel Beckett, Ionesco was a satirist at 
heart. Satire always refers; it is always a satire of something. Ionesco's rare 
gift was his uncanny way of capturing and satirizing something in modern life 
so new that ordinary dramatic language was dumb before it. We salute his 
memory.

TIRED IDEAS IN A SHINY NEW BOX; JAPAN'S LATEST TRADE PLAN DOES LITTLE TO 
ADDRESS WASHINGTON'S CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan is striving to put trade talks with the United States back on track with 
a so-called "new" set of market-opening initiatives. Too bad the effort does 
not live up to Tokyo's stated intentions. The half-baked plan unveiled Tuesday 
is widely perceived as a mere repackaging of the vague, unsatisfactory 
proposals rejected by Washington last month when U.S.-Japan trade talks 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan is notable on two counts: Missing are the numerical targets or 
trade goals that have become a defining element in U.S.-Japan talks under the 
Clinton Administration. The omission is in line with Tokyo's well-honed 
campaign to portray as "managed trade" President Clinton's quest for results in 
the effort to reduce the $60-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Should 
Washington balk at the latest Japanese plan, Tokyo surely will cry foul and 
claim the United States is violating the spirit of free trade in seeking 
quantitative and qualitative results. Clever -- but misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, who are the Japanese to complain of managed trade? Tokyo practices 
its own thinly veiled version of what it complains about. Even though Japan has 
dismantled many formal barriers, imports face major administrative and other 
hassles in entering Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 Tokyo was willing to commit to fairly specific trade goals with 
Europe. Japan agreed to freeze car exports to Europe at 1.23 million units a 
year until 1999, in return for being allowed to increase the number of cars 
produced by Japanese factories within the European Community fivefold. Two 
years later Tokyo even agreed to further cuts in its car exports to Europe 
because of a slump in car sales in the EC. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Japan conveniently agrees to goals when it comes to exporting but 
not importing. Curious. Sounds a bit like managed trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough. The rhetoric, including the sometimes abrasive tone of U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor, distracts from the real issue: true results in 
reducing the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance. Tokyo should help define those results 
instead of fighting them. Its latest plan, however good Tokyo's intentions 
might be, does little to advance the dialogue.

HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS; HOW A COP RELATES TO THE COMMUNITY DEPENDS ON 
ATTITUDE, NOT RESIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ideally, the police officers who patrol Los Angeles all would live in the 
neighborhoods where they work. And, ideally, every cop would know the 
neighborhood so well that he or she even would know when a particular teen-ager 
was playing hooky. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of intimacy still occurs in some towns and cities. Indeed, a 
"community policing" relationship between Los Angeles Police Department 
officers and residents should be encouraged. But it's downright silly to 
suggest that where an officer lives is the determinant of attitude, or "feel" 
for a community. A good cop can live 20 miles from his or her precinct without 
ill effect. A bad cop can live around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 That point seems to have been lost in the report released Tuesday by the 
American Civil Liberties Union. The study says that 83% of LAPD officers live 
outside the city limits. Because many live in suburban white areas, the report 
comments that "the racial and ethnic diversity in which officers and their 
families reside, socialize and go about their personal routines generally bear 
little resemblance to the city the officers police." That's true. But it's 
quite a leap to imply that cops who live in largely suburban and white areas 
are somehow automatically not quite up to the job of policing a multiracial 
urban area. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1974 California constitutional amendment bars residency requirements used 
elsewhere to ensure that officers live within city limits. So where an officer 
lives cannot be mandated. But the ACLU does recommend that rental subsidies and 
low-interest loans be used to encourage more cops to live in the city. Given 
the demands already placed on the city budget -- the need for more police 
foremost among them -- channeling public funds into such a program would be 
ill-advised. 
</P>
<P>
 But yes, there must be common bonds between the police and the community. 
That's a strong argument for the LAPD's aggressive recruitment of minorities 
and women. If more officers wind up living in the city, so much the better. But 
the important thing is that officers respect the communities in which they 
work.

A VOTE FOR CONTINUITY; SALINAS AGAIN PICKS A CANDIDATE IN HIS OWN IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has opted for continuity in 
selecting Ernesto Zedillo to succeed Luis Donaldo Colosio, the slain 
presidential candidate. And even though Zedillo's selection was secretive, in 
keeping with outdated Mexican political traditions, anyone who wants stability 
must hope Zedillo can calm the nation's turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 As the candidate of the potent Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), 
Zedillo, 42, is now the odds-on favorite to win the Aug. 21 election. The 
economist shares traits with both Salinas and Colosio, who was assassinated 
last week in Tijuana. No doubt the similarities helped reassure Salinas that 
his choice of Zedillo was a safe one, and Salinas no doubt hopes those 
similarities will reassure Mexican and foreign investors whom Mexico needs to 
keep its slowly reviving economy on a course of liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
 With master's and doctoral degrees from Yale, Zedillo, like his two immediate 
PRI predecessors, has strong Ivy League credentials; Salinas did graduate work 
at Harvard and Colosio studied at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was born in Mexico City, Zedillo was raised in Baja California and 
considers himself a norteno, as northern Mexicans are known. Nortenos tend to 
be more comfortable about close ties with the United States than their 
countrymen. Colosio was from the Arizona border state of Sonora, and Salinas 
from Nuevo Leon, which borders on Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo worked his way up in the government not by running for office but as a 
bureaucrat, mostly in the Bureau of Planning and Budget. That is where Salinas 
made his reputation as a tough-minded economist before being picked as PRI 
presidential candidate by then-President Miguel de la Madrid, yet another 
economist who headed Mexico's budget office before becoming president in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 This pattern of foreign-trained bureaucrats winning the PRI nod has angered 
many old-line party activists, who disparage the young upstarts as technocrats. 
However, Salinas was wise to ignore that PRI wing, which had its own ideas 
about who should succeed Colosio. It may also have been politically astute for 
Salinas to ignore the calls of many progressive Mexicans for a more open 
nominating process. If he had left the nomination to a PRI convention or 
primary, it is very unlikely that Zedillo, who has never run for office, would 
have won. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, this may be a case where old-style Mexican politics, in which a 
president handpicks his successor, works to the benefit of change and progress. 
For despite their lack of appeal in the PRI, "technocrat" presidents are 
popular with the investors and business people Mexico needs to build a modern 
economy.

MOTHERS AND OTHER STRANGERS; THERE ARE PLENTY OF STATISTICS ABOUT THE COSTS OF 
TOO MANY CHILDREN. HAVE WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE COST OF TOO FEW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE DOWLING, Dr. Katherine Dowling, the mother of seven, practices at 
the USC School of Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motherhood just isn't in vogue any more. What was once an honorable profession 
with a sought-after product (a productive human being) is quickly going the way 
of blacksmithing and aerospace engineering. Some people -- those who teeter on 
the apogee of political correctness -- consider mothers downright subversive, a 
threat to the environment. Even moderates look on children as expendable 
frills, to be acquired in small numbers by those affluent enough to indulge 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a baby sometimes seems like a hobby. A woman is socially permitted to 
conceive a token infant to complete her "experience of life" sometime after her 
career is tactically safe and before the curtain of menopause descends. The 
actual parenting of the child will then be done through surrogates. This type 
of motherhood is applauded as neither interfering too much with the female 
person's life nor clogging up the environment with excess humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother who discovers she actually loves the sculpting of a little human -- 
and who then goes on to have a couple more -- will receive scant affirmation 
from those around her. And if for some reason she actually has the time to sit 
down and read, she will find her vocation lambasted daily in the media. Imagine 
being up all night with a fussy baby who has his days and nights inverted only 
to find yourself staring at the morning paper with headlines that proclaim a 
top Stanford professor has declared you are bringing misery to the world 
through your fecundity. Or being stopped by a little old lady as you push a 
stroller and aggressively grilled about your reproductive plans. No wonder the 
American woman isn't producing enough offspring to replace herself and her 
husband in the next generation. Who wants to live with all that?  
</P>
<P>
 In the last several months, doctors practicing in several different areas of 
Los Angeles have noticed an interesting phenomenon. It may just be a fluke, but 
many of us are talking about the decrease in the number of prenatal patients in 
our practices. We can't even test the validity of our observations; the drop is 
so recent that the babies would not even have been born yet. But it did get 
some of us to thinking, and the issues that have arisen are so complex that, in 
the words of the Grinch who stole Christmas, we "puzzled three hours till (our) 
puzzler was sore." Some of us think our hitherto porous border has finally 
become more impermeable to pregnant women, while others point to plentiful and 
socially encouraged abortions.  
</P>
<P>
 My opinion is that the drop is due to many factors: a bad economy, relatively 
small numbers of women at peak childbearing age, delayed marriages and the 
socially accepted conundrum that children are damaging to the environment and 
to personal happiness. (The corollary to the latter is that if one does choose 
to parent, the product's quality will be inversely related to the number 
produced.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our society has pushed for limitations in family size. It looks as if we are 
now to see that. What are the implications of a child-poor society? Have our 
intellectuals really thought this thing through?  
</P>
<P>
 As a family physician, I'm saddened. I love obstetrics and pediatrics, but I 
can switch to geriatrics. Other doctors whose practices are exclusively 
obstetrical or pediatric may not be so fortunate. But we are a small number. 
Let's look at other segments of the economy. Kids go through a lot of clothes, 
vast quantities of food, need to be taught, read to, housed. Lots of people 
make their livings providing goods and services to kids. What about their jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 And I'll take this a bit further. Seniors are the most rapidly growing segment 
of our population. Though they have more money on average than younger people, 
their money will be valueless if they can't purchase the goods and services 
that they no longer can provide for themselves. This could well reach a crisis 
sometime in the 21st Century, when all of us Baby Boomers can no longer mow our 
own lawns or even feed ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the observations of those of us on the front lines in prenatal care 
are in error. Perhaps motherhood will still be considered of value by a 
sufficient number of young women. For me, it will always be, as the bumper 
sticker I just purchased says, "an honorable profession." Meanwhile, if you see 
a mom struggling with a bunch of fussy kids in the supermarket, give her a 
verbal pat on the back. Her kids may just be the ones taking care of you some 
day.

A STRUCTURED APPROACH LOWERS THE CRIME RATE; POLICE CHIEF: THE KEYS ARE 
PROACTIVE POLICING, SWIFT APPREHENSION AND PUNISHMENT.; EYEWITNESS: TED COOKE; 
TED COOKE HAS BEEN CULVER CITY POLICE CHIEF SINCE 1976; BEFORE THAT HE SPENT 20 
YEARS WITH THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT, WHERE HIS DUTIES INCLUDED WORK 
WITH GANGS.  
</P>

By * As told to Robert Scheer, Times Contributing Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Culver City is surrounded by five of Los Angeles' busiest police divisions, 
plus Inglewood, and they've all had explosions of crime. And yet we've had less 
crime for 14 out of the last 15 years -- 44% less violent crime last year than 
we had in 1980. We're probably the only city in the county that's had that kind 
of an impact on crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Crime's not that difficult. You need swiftness of apprehension and certainty 
of punishment. The only thing that is marginally effective in addition to that 
is a juvenile-diversion program. We identify at-risk kids and pay for outreach 
programs for them -- counseling, camping programs; we get them very much 
involved with our organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officers personally follow up to ensure that the kids are doing 
homework, that the family's getting along. We've had occasions to get the 
mother into Alcoholics Anonymous or get the father a job. We've dealt with a 
little under 100 kids in the last couple of years, and only one of them screwed 
up.  
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of all crime in our state is committed by juveniles; in our city 
it's only 13%. So we think this is a good program.  
</P>
<P>
 Most departments are reactive. We're proactive. We identify patterns, we 
identify criminals, we just do a lot of things that impact crime. Everything we 
do is structured around being efficient and effective and impacting crime.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, we do not go along with plea bargains. We make probable-cause 
arrests. We have extremely well-trained policemen. We have well-educated 
policemen. We have 200 people -- 117 sworn officers -- and 137 of them have 
college degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 We do statistical analysis so that we distribute people on the basis of the 
best bang for the buck. We have 71% of our people in the field, either directly 
or indirectly doing field activities; we have an absolute minimum number of 
people doing administrative background things. And so our response time, 24 
hours, seven days a week, on all calls, was 11 minutes last year, and in crimes 
in progress or emergency calls, three minutes. We're able to maximize what we 
do.  
</P>
<P>
 On "three strikes, you're out," I think that by the time a guy's committed 700 
or 800 crimes and has been convicted for the third time, society is much better 
off without him and it's a lot cheaper to put him in jail.  
</P>
<P>
 They get convicted for one crime, but that's probably on the tail end of 80 
crimes where they didn't get caught. So "three strikes" would be a substantial 
impact on crime in a very positive way -- if, in fact, we don't let the lawyers 
take it over and disregard it by not alleging the prior offenses in court. I 
think you'll find out that all the complaints about "three strikes" are from 
the usual suspects -- all lawyers. The lawyers cannot make money from criminals 
who are in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot create procedural rules that hide perfectly reliable evidence from 
the jury so that criminals go free and then applaud those decisions as though 
we had done something worthwhile. This is crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of procedural restraints, it's difficult for us to inquire within a 
community about a person we think is suspicious. On those people we do stop, we 
can't do certain searches like we used to -- pat-downs and that sort of thing, 
searches of vehicles of people in suspicious circumstances. So people slide 
through the cracks that way.  
</P>
<P>
 Do we have systems that encourage people to be criminals? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the past when a juvenile was arrested, we'd sit down and talk 
to this kid, find out what would be the best way to see that he didn't continue 
being a criminal. About 18 years ago, the courts created a rule that said we 
could no longer do this. Now, when any kid is arrested, you've got to treat him 
like a criminal, you've got to give him Miranda rights, the relationship has to 
be adversarial, you've got to give him a public defender to counsel him. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they've been arrested four or five or six times, they know there 
are no penalties attached to crime because they've been able to successfully 
navigate away from going to jail or the California Youth Authority or anything 
else, and this adversarial system has educated young people to be criminals. So 
now we have thousands and thousands of hard-core criminals that our system has 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 If we can convict the guy, 64% of the convicted felons get probation. It's 
crazy. People like me get so upset with probation and parole because a good 
burglar, looking to pay for his habit, will hit three to five times a day, 
three to five times a week. So if you get him off the street, that's between 
600 and 1,400 burglaries that don't happen in and around your jurisdiction.  
</P>
<P>
 We don't have the death penalty in this state -- if you don't use it, you 
don't have it. The most severe penalty in California is life in prison without 
possibility of parole. If you get that, you'll only serve 5 1/2 years.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why guys like me go crazy, and why I say guys like me have got to have 
an opportunity to speak out, because these people that the media interview on 
crime don't know what they're talking about.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A PASSIONATE GAZE INTO THE MIRROR OF MYTHOLOGY; ISIS 
AND OSIRIS: EXPLORING THE GODDESS MYTH BY JONATHAN COTT , DOUBLEDAY, $23, 209 
PAGES 
</P>

By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to dysfunctional families, neither the Oedipus clan nor even the 
Reagans offer a more intriguing case history than Osiris and Isis, a pair of 
ancient Egyptian deities who were "not only sister and brother, but also wife 
and husband, queen and king, goddess and god." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of these star-crossed siblings, as recounted by Jonathan Cott in 
"Isis and Osiris," features incestuous love, matricide, dismemberment, anal 
rape, necrophilia, tragic death and miraculous rebirth. And, as Cott shows us, 
the myth of Isis and Osiris continues to exert a powerful and almost magical 
influence on seekers and believers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Astonishingly, some five thousand years after the first recorded 
acknowledgment of her existence," Cott writes, "the Mother of All and her 
brother/husband/consort are still being worshiped today in many countries of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Cott introduces us to Isis and Osiris by recounting their story in solemn, 
measured, almost sacral tones -- but the story itself is so full of strange 
passion that the narrative almost catches fire. Indeed, Cott's book shows us 
exactly why the old myth is so enduring and so beguiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Osiris and Isis are twins who fell in love in their mother's womb and grew up 
as "a couple whose love passed understanding." But a jealous brother murdered 
Osiris and sliced his body into 14 pieces. The grieving Isis summoned her dead 
lover from beyond the grave to impregnate her with the child who will be "his 
son, heir and avenger." And thus Isis and Osiris achieve a kind of immortality, 
and their myth offers "the promise of eternal life and resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am life rushing on," declares Horus, the child of their mystical union, 
"born from the egg of the world, from the belly of a magic woman, born of my 
father's dreams. . . . A man forgets, but his heart remembers -- the love and 
the terror, the weeping, the beating of wings." 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of Isis and Osiris is virtually an encyclopedia of mythic imagery, 
and so we are hardly surprised when Cott argues that its meanings can be traced 
into such far-flung spiritual manifestations as the passion of Christ and the 
doctrine of chakras in the Kundalini system of yoga. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for who knows what vagaries," observes curator Robert S. Bianchi, "we 
in the West might today be Isis devotees instead of Jews, Christians or 
Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, much of "Isis and Osiris" is an account of Cott's quest for the 
linkages between the ancient Egyptian myth and its renaissance in the 
contemporary world. Along the way, Cott introduces us to the sages who study 
Isis and Osiris -- and, more to the point, the seekers who continue to venerate 
them. At the heart of the now-fashionable "goddess worship," Cott suggests, is 
the enduring figure of Isis: "Mother of All, Ruler of the Elements, Progenitor 
of Worlds, Chief of All Deities." 
</P>
<P>
 The adepts and aficionados whom Cott profiles in "Isis and Osiris" range from 
dispassionate scholars to wildly inventive psychotherapists to self-styled 
arch-priestesses. They perceive and interpret Isis and Osiris in starkly 
different ways, but all of them are drawn to the exotic light of their myth. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, James P. Allen, a curator of Egyptian art at the Metropolitan 
Museum of Modern Art, argues that the god myths of ancient Egypt are the 
functional equivalent of our concepts of quantum physics, a way of explaining 
the world to ourselves in sometimes richly metaphorical language. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who worship Isis and Osiris have simply singled out one aspect (of 
ancient Egyptian religion) to identify with," Allen says, "although to me, it's 
the same as worshiping electromagneticism or gravity." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Cott finds his way to a hidden community of so-called Ammonites 
in Cairo who submit themselves to the "Forty-two Laws of the Saints" drawn from 
the Book of the Dead and worship the pantheon of ancient Egyptian gods, 
including Isis and Osiris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the days of the first Ammonite kingdoms outside Egypt, we've been 
wandering as freaks of the earth," says the mysterious woman who claims to 
occupy the Lotus Throne of the Pharaoh and who regards her 9-year-old son as a 
living incarnation of Horus, the offspring of Isis and Osiris, "but by being 
freaks we have kept the seed of truth alive." 
</P>
<P>
 At moments, the Isis worshipers come across as charming eccentrics. For 
example, we spend a good deal of time in the company of a brother-and-sister 
team who preside over the so-called Fellowship of Isis at Clonegal Castle in 
Ireland -- but Isis is only one of the passions of "archpriestess and 
hierophant" Olivia Robertson, a ripping good raconteur who also believes in 
UFOs, reincarnation and ghosts, and who says she was once visited by Mary 
Magdalene: "She had a face like Vanessa Redgrave's," Olivia recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 But, mostly, Cott appears to take his subject quite seriously. He's an 
accomplished chronicler of myth and legend whose work has appeared in journals 
as diverse as Rolling Stone and Parabola, and he approaches his subject with 
both a subtle sense of humor and a profound sense of compassion. And he is 
utterly free of sarcasm and condescension toward the men and women whose 
zealous beliefs he is exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, at the end of his quest, Cott leaves us with an epiphany of his own 
that suggests a visitation by Isis herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adorned with every star of heaven/mirror on your forehead/serpents by your 
side," goes the poem that Cott wrote to capture his dreamy encounter with the 
goddess, "one breathes your perfumed air/through nights of sweetest sleep/until 
your mirror becomes the sun. . . ."

 Snip, snip, duck, duck: Jill Smith of Northridge wrote to alert us that a 
beauty salon recently opened inside the Northridge Pistol and Rifle Range. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The owner wanted to be in a unique location," explained salon manager Renee 
Saunders. "It's definitely a conversation piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Chit-chat isn't drowned out in the salon because it's walled off. "The sounds 
are muffled," Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that many of her customers also use the shooting range. In fact, 
Saunders likes to fire off a few rounds herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've had some real crotchety customers, it's a good way to blow off 
steam after work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the salon, by the way, is Bang! Bang!

 Say 'em again, Sam: The L.A. County Museum of Art recently showed several of 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most famous films to honor the 70th anniversary of the 
studio's founding. But no celebration of MGM would be complete without a list 
of some of the unforgettable malapropisms and statements attributed to mogul 
Sam Goldwyn (1882-1974). 
</P>
<P>
 The envelope please:

<P>
 * "Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I read part of it all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 * "In two words, im possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * "A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's written on." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Directors are always biting the hand that lays the golden egg." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We have all passed a lot of water since then." 
</P>
<P>
 * And, perhaps his most famous: "Gentlemen, include me out."

 A Goldwynesque reply: Vince Pavlicek wrote to a Cleveland company for some 
product information and, because of the problems that people from non-Southland 
regions have spelling Spanish place names, he was careful to say that his 
hometown is "L A space J O L L A." You can see the result.

 Write-offs that tax the imagination: Ex-Angeleno Noelle Allen has just 
published "Confessions of a Tax Accountant," which details some illustrious 
deductions claimed by her clients and others. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lamaze teacher, for instance, successfully wrote off the cost of her family 
room carpet, claiming it suffered wear and tear because of all the prospective 
dads and moms who lay on it during childbirth exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a member of the California Society of Certified Public Accountants, 
also tells about the parishioner who listed innumerable contributions to one 
church. The IRS checked and found that the taxpayer had the canceled checks. 
The church's minister confirmed their authenticity. The minister also mentioned 
that the parishioner was a coin collector and the checks covered his purchases 
of the coins left in the collection plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the IRS was correct in its original two-word assessment of the 
church-goer: Im possible. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 One of our favorite smorgasbords of an eatery is Tandoor Indian Food & Stan's 
Donuts in Westwood. Tandoor, by the way, serves Vienna hot dogs and Haagen-Daaz 
ice cream. No curry-filled doughnuts, though.

PERSPECTIVES ON SOUTH AFRICA; ZULUS ARE THE KEY TO PEACE; WITHOUT RESOLUTION, 
THEY PROMISE A FIGHT 'TO THE END'; THE CHALLENGE IS TO LURE THEM INTO A 
BROADER, SUCCESSFUL NATIONHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY HAZLITT HEARD, Anthony Hazlitt Heard is the former editor of the 
Cape Times, Cape Town. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much bloody mayhem can the South African body politic absorb? The answer, 
based on experience, is: plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a limit. That point came dangerously close when the country's 
major city, Johannesburg, which had been bidding for the Olympic Games in 2004, 
was closed down on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulu demonstrators singing praises to their king went on the rampage, laying 
into civilians as snipers shot at them from high-rise blocks, while resolute 
policing was conspicuously absent. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt to storm the headquarters of Nelson Mandela's African National 
Congress failed, thank God -- otherwise, considering the likely deaths of key 
political players, South Africa could today be well on the road to chaos, 
military coup or sundry other miseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps 50 people died in Johannesburg's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other casualty was South Africa and, because of the country's 
continental importance, Africa. If South Africa does not get its democratic act 
together, its reconstructive role in the eventual recovery of Africa will be 
scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether South Africans will learn lessons from these events and pick their way 
through inevitable further violence to democratic elections at the end of April 
is a matter for conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationwide rate of 10 deaths a day attributed to political violence has, in 
recent months, risen to more than that figure in one region alone, Natal -- an 
exquisite subtropical garden province in the east peopled by Zulus, Asiatics 
and English, and boiling with unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Natal is the source of Monday's conflict in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 This province's Zulu people, with a proud and militant if slightly overstated 
history, have spilled over into vast areas of Transvaal Province and the 
environs of Johannesburg where they live and work and organize. Hence the 
latest mayhem when they demonstrated to have a sovereign kingdom "back home" in 
Zululand, which covers large tracts of Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
 Their call was not unlike Quebec's for "sovereignty association" in Canada. 
But, unlike the relatively puny French separatist cadres, they have many 
millions of disciplined, spear-waving zealots to rely on if called into action 
by their king, Goodwill Zwelethini, a rather dull personage who was not until 
recently taken very seriously outside Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 The plague of violence, more than anything else, places a question mark over 
the future of the country. The big question is whether violence will accompany 
South Africans into the future or be left largely behind as a new government 
under Nelson Mandela settles into power. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence has its roots in the rough-and-ready delimitation of 
constituencies that has been going on among black groups in preparation for the 
elections. Blacks, denied the vote previously, are staking their claims for the 
imminent day they shall exercise their vote. 
</P>
<P>
 There is hope that -- continuing incidents notwithstanding -- there will be a 
gradual slowdown in violence after the election, partly because of a resolute 
security crackdown by a credible and legitimate new government. But more 
negotiation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate future will depend largely on the contest between the merchants 
of violence and the forces of law and order. Some observers believe that there 
is too much pent-up anger, rivalry and resentment in the country -- or large 
parts of it -- to allow for an easy crossing to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to the seemingly intractable problems associated with Chief 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, whose Inkatha Freedom Party speaks for an 
undetermined and conservative section of the Zulus in Natal province, and those 
of Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, who has shown 
that he has substantial support among Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
 A last-ditch attempt to resolve the conflict by bringing in outside mediators, 
including Henry Kissinger, is now under way. There are also plans for an 
unprecedented summit involving President Frederik W. de Klerk, Mandela, the 
Zulu king and Buthelezi sometime next week. These two steps could be the last 
chances for peace, after which, in the words of the Zulu king, there could be a 
fight to "the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the all-party Transitional Executive Council set up to usher in a 
democratic order can assert itself in Natal, by establishing a state of 
emergency, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence in Natal and parts of Transvaal Province notwithstanding, large 
sections of the country are in a state of relative peace, causing foreign 
observers to note that free and fair elections can take place in 90% of the 
country. There may be "mini-Bosnias" in some districts, but no sign, as of now, 
that the general fabric of society is collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 There are right-wing Afrikaner desperadoes in the white community, counting on 
some measure of support in the security Establishment, who have been at work 
killing black civilians from passing cars, blowing up buildings and campaigning 
for a boycott of the elections. They are dangerous but finite in numbers, 
determination and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the Afrikaner, though rich in initial heroism in conflict with 
giants like the Victorian British Empire, generally shows the bulk of this 
Dutch/ French/German-descended group settling with reality, and eschewing the 
"bunker" mentality, once they appreciate that they cannot win. This could apply 
in South Africa after April. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zulus, by contrast, have tended to fight to the last man against all 
comers, as they did in the famous battle of Blood River against the (Afrikaner) 
Boers. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat to the future, therefore, remains the millions of Zulus who might 
follow Buthelezi and their malleable king into suicidal opposition to the new 
order. They have to be lured into a broader, successful South African 
nationhood. That's the challenge.

LAKERS DO ENOUGH TO WIN ONE; NBA: VAN EXEL'S LAYUP WITH 1.7 SECONDS LEFT HELPS 
MAGIC JOHNSON GET SECOND COACHING VICTORY, A 91-89 TRIUMPH OVER MINNESOTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watch your step jumping off the Laker bandwagon. No pushing and shoving, 
please. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds disappeared from the Forum Tuesday night, apparently taking the 
emotional play with them. The Lakers almost went, too, only to be saved by Nick 
Van Exel's driving layup with 1.7 seconds left to salvage an uninspiring 91-89 
victory over the struggling Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to coaching," Magic Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Timberwolves who came in having lost 17 of their previous 21 had a 
chance to tie after calling timeout. But Isaiah Rider dropped Christian 
Laettner's entry pass, picked it up and had to hurry his shot from the right to 
beat the buzzer. It was short, helping the Lakers win for the ninth time in 12 
games and give Johnson a 2-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a victory," said Elden Campbell, who had a game-high 27 points and four 
blocks. "Sure, the effort could have been better, but we've got more games 
ahead and we can put this one behind us and learn from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we took them a little lightly and they jumped on our behinds. We 
found ourselves in a ballgame the rest of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening marked a return to normalcy for the Lakers and their coach. The 
crowd, which filled the Forum two nights earlier for another bad team, was down 
to 13,588 for the Timberwolves. Reporters interested in pregame comments -- so 
intense Sunday that a news conference was needed -- numbered six. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson looked relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The key for the Lakers was to sustain the emotional high that came with 
Johnson's debut. That in itself made this an important outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I was talking to them about -- this emotionally is one of those 
games," Johnson said. "Now we have a team coming in that people say we are 
supposed to beat. Those are always tough games. Plus, this team (Minnesota) is 
getting better -- (Christian) Laettner is back and they are running more." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson countered with his first lineup change, Tony Smith back as the 
starting shooting guard in place of Sedale Threatt, reversing Randy Pfund's 
move of 17 games earlier. The new coach -- inserting a big guard to match Rider 
on Tuesday, Kendall Gill on Friday and Stacey Augmon on Sunday -- considered 
going with Doug Christie instead, but felt Christie needed to improve on 
pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt averaged 18.4 points and shot 50.6% in the 17 starts, but still was 
sent to the bench as Johnson was true to his word of renewed emphasis on 
defense. It didn't sound like a temporary move, either, although Christie could 
eventually take Smith's place. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in the commotion of Magic Johnson's coaching debut was that Michael 
Cooper also made his first appearance as an assistant. "It was a big event," 
Cooper said. "I was kind of glad I was able to slip in like I did, unnoticed. 
If I had slipped and fell over there, no one would have noticed." Cooper was in 
his third year in the front office, serving as special assistant to the general 
manager and longing to be more involved. Coaching continued to interest him, so 
when Johnson took over for Randy Pfund last week, he brought Cooper along to 
help improve the defense. That the Lakers had an impressive defensive showing, 
especially when the Milwaukee Bucks scored only 35 points in the first half, 
made the opener that much sweeter. "It was a big event in the sense that I'm 
finally where I want to be, making the kind of contribution I want to make," 
Cooper said. . . . Milwaukee Coach Mike Dunleavy, on the Lakers' showing 
Sunday: "I thought they played better in the first half than any team we've 
played all year long. I mean, nobody's done that to us."

NHL ROUNDUP; SHARKS CLOSE IN ON PLAYOFF SPOT, WIN TO OPEN LEAD OVER DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Norton, Sergei Makarov, Ray Whitney and Gaetan Duchesne all scored goals 
within a span of 2 minutes 27 seconds of the first period Tuesday night as the 
Sharks neared their first trip of the NHL playoffs with a 9-4 victory over the 
Winnipeg Jets at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks lengthened their lead over the Mighty Ducks to 10 points and the 
Kings to 12 in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Makarov kept up the blitz in the second period, scoring his 29th and 30th 
goals to complete the hat trick as the Sharks extended their lead to 8-2 with 
only 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, Montreal 2 -- Stephane Richer scored the 300th goal of his 
career at East Rutherford, N.J., where the Devils cracked the 100-point mark 
for the first time in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey extended its unbeaten streak to seven games (6-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 6, Hartford 2 -- Sergei Fedorov scored twice and Ray Sheppard got his 
50th goal to help the Red Wings win at home and go two points ahead of idle 
Toronto and into sole possession of first place in the Central Division and 
Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 2, Washington 2 -- Marty McInnis scored a power-play goal 
with 2:45 to play in the third period at Washington and the Islanders ended a 
two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Alexei Kovalev scored his second goal of 
the game with 36 seconds to play to lift the Rangers at Philadelphia.

NBA ROUNDUP; JORDANAIRES WILL PLAY ON AS A SINGLES ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were no celebrations in Chicago. No hooting. No hollering. 
</P>
<P>
 Been there. Done that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls clinched a return trip to the playoffs and a chance to defend their 
NBA championship a third time Tuesday night with a 106-103 victory over the 
Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? They knew they would be back, whether Michael Jordan plays the 
outfield or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We proved a lot of people wrong. We're third in the East. We planned on being 
very competitive. We took a lot of pride," Scottie Pippen said after his 27 
points led the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody pouring champagne. We expected to make the playoffs. It was a 
forgone conclusion," said Steve Kerr, who made two free throws with 5.6 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The future is less bright for Philadelphia. The 76ers lost their eighth in a 
row and 23rd in 24 games, though they made the Bulls, who led by 10 points 
after three quarters, earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But close doesn't count. "It's not a moral victory," guard Dana Barros said. 
"We aren't going to remember if we played well or not. It's a loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 101, New Jersey 98 -- Kevin Willis and Duane Ferrell scored six points 
apiece in the final 4:08 as the Hawks rallied to win in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their sixth victory in seven games and gave the Hawks the league's best 
home record, 31-5. The Nets' three-game winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrell sank two free throws to give Atlanta a 91-90 lead it held for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis had 24 points and 16 rebounds for Atlanta. Johnny Newman and Kenny 
Anderson led New Jersey with 17 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 106, Charlotte 95 -- Charles Oakley, a doubtful starter because of a 
knee sprain, had 22 points and 17 rebounds at New York as the Knicks won their 
14th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak is their longest since a team-record 18 in a row in 1969-70. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was a product of the New York reserves, who, led by Anthony 
Mason's 17 points, outscored the Hornets' backups, 45-17. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 117, Dallas 92 -- David Robinson dominated inside with 37 points, 
22 in the first half, as the Spurs won at Dallas and handed the Mavericks their 
15th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who also had seven rebounds, six assists and five blocks, moved past 
Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal into the NBA scoring lead with a 29.2 average as the 
Spurs won their 50th game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks completed their first winless calendar month in club history, 
finishing March with a 0-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 123, Miami 115 -- Sean Elliott scored eight of his 16 points in the 
final 3:06 as the Pistons won at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dumars paced Detroit with 30 points, all but five in the first and third 
quarters. Terry Mills added 20 for the Pistons, who shot 58%. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Geiger scored 23 points for Miami, which lost its fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 120, Washington 101 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 25 points and 10 rebounds 
at Orlando where the Magic tied a club record with its 41st victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Don MacLean had 23 points and Rex Chapman 16 for Washington, which has lost 
nine in a row and 25 of 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 119, Milwaukee 107 -- Rick Fox had a career-high 33 points and sank six 
free throws in overtime in Milwaukee to lead the Celtics to their third victory 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks have lost five consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 116, Utah 113 -- Latrell Sprewell scored 35 points, six in the 
final minute, as the Warriors withstood a fourth-quarter comeback to defeat the 
Jazz at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 114, Portland 100 -- Shawn Kemp scored 28 points, 16 in the third 
quarter, and the SuperSonics pulled away in the fourth at Portland in winning 
for the sixth time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trail Blazers have lost two consecutive games at home after winning 11 in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 122, Sacramento 101 -- Otis Thorpe scored 21 points and grabbed 18 
rebounds, and seven Rockets scored in double figures in winning at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston played without center Hakeem Olajuwon because of a one-game suspension 
and also without guard Vernon Maxwell and forward Carl Herrera for much of the 
game because of ejections.

LITTLE BROTHER LEADS CLEVELAND OVER CLIPPERS; BASKETBALL: GERALD WILKINS 
OUTSCORES DOMINIQUE WILKINS BY TWO POINTS, AND CAVALIERS ARE 106-96 WINNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins tends to keep an eye on his younger brother, Gerald, but 
usually it's from afar. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, it was up close, and Gerald Wilkins made it real personal. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored a game-high 28 points, 12 of them in a third-quarter run that sent 
the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 106-96 victory over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins led the Clippers with 26 points but scored only one point 
and missed four shots in the decisive third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The luster of playing one-on-one has worn off for Gerald Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing my brother is fun, but it is not an added incentive like it used to 
be, especially my first few years in the league," he said. "In the past it used 
to be an individual thing. Tonight it was a team thing. They helped me, I 
helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dominique Wilkins is his brother's keeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last 10, 11 games, they've been running a lot of plays for him," 
Dominique said. "He's a guy to run things for. He's a great one-on-one player." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the bottom line was that the Clippers ended their final eastern trip of 
the season with their third loss in a row because they couldn't maintain their 
momentum after taking a 56-52 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland led, 82-72, at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Wilkins sank two three-pointers and all four of his shots from the 
field in the run, adding two free throws for the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerald hurt us badly, especially in the third quarter," Clipper Coach Bob 
Weiss said. "He was hitting 'threes,' he was driving, he did it all." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clippers did little, particularly when Cleveland had the basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for us, we didn't execute and we didn't play defense and you have to play 
defense in this league to win games," Dominique Wilkins said. "Sometimes your 
offense isn't there, but if you play defense you can still be in a game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers' defense was better. Tyrone Hill was more excited about it than 
about his career-high 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to play defense, get the rebounds, get things going," said Hill, 
who led Cleveland with 12 rebounds. "Getting some points is going to happen 
sometimes, and it did tonight, but it did because we settled down and played 
defense and took control of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy Hill -- he has just recovered from a thumb injury -- has gotten 
Gerald Wilkins' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Tyrone's going, teams are going to start double-teaming him," Wilkins 
said, "and that's fine, with Mark Price, Terrell (Brandon) and me standing 
outside waiting for the open jump shot." 
</P>
<P>
 John Williams had 15 points and 11 rebounds as Cleveland won its third in a 
row.

 Oscar De La Hoya is known as "the Golden Boy," but Los Angeles' original 
"Golden Boy" was Art Aragon, who fought here in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon isn't upset that De La Hoya has used his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Aragon: "With all the money he's making, they can call him anything he 
wants." 
</P>
<P>

 Add Aragon: Aragon said that he made $120,000 when he fought Carmen Basilio 
here on Sept. 5, 1958, adding, "It cost me $140,000 to get out of the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Basilio won on a TKO in the eighth round. Earlier, between rounds, Aragon's 
manager had said: "Art, if you don't start fighting this guy, I'm going to stop 
it."

 Replied Aragon, "Why wait?"

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: HAIWEE RESERVOIR OPENS FOR FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Bob Hayner, the opening of Haiwee Reservoir represents a successful end to 
a four-year battle with the Department of Water and Power. For others, however, 
the opening of the Inyo County lake represents merely another superb fishery in 
which to wet a line. 
</P>
<P>
 Both 3 1/2-mile long reservoirs at Haiwee opened to the public last Saturday 
for the first time since the DWP obtained the land in a deal with the Bureau of 
Land Management in 1983, but the official opening will be a ceremonious affair 
on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years of hard work have finally come to a conclusion," said Hayner, 
president of the Owens Valley Warm Water Fishing Assn., which pressed the DWP 
to adhere to terms of the 1983 deal and provide public access at the 
reservoirs, which supply drinking water to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The lakes are open from half an hour before sunrise to half an hour after 
sunset. Anglers must fish from shore or in sealed waders; no boats are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayner, who fished the reservoir extensively when it was closed, said there 
are 10- to 12-pound German brown trout patrolling its shores. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I've documented largemouth bass up over 9 1/2 pounds on several 
occasions, but basically they're running two-five pounds," he said. "And there 
are smallmouth bass running 1 1/2 to three pounds, although I've documented a 7 
1/2-pound smallmouth, that my daughter (Heidi) caught (last year)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northern California outdoor writer Tom Stienstra calls an attempt to 
"freeze-brand" hatchery trout "one of the biggest botch jobs at a hatchery in 
California Department of Fish and Game history." 
</P>
<P>
 The DFG is downplaying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Shasta Fish Hatchery personnel were forced to set aside additional trout 
to stock in the upper Sacramento River after an outbreak of disease among the 
27,000 fish that were fin-clipped and "freeze branded" so creel checkers and 
anglers would be able to tell them from wild trout. 
</P>
<P>
 The upper Sacramento will open for fishing April 30 for the first time since a 
train wreck and toxic spill killed virtually all life in the stretch of river 
in 1991. The diseased hatchery fish originally destined for the river will 
remain at the hatchery and, if they recover, will be stocked later this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Stienstra, who writes for the San Francisco Examiner, went to the hatchery 
last week and said the trout had developed not only an ugly white fungus, but 
"red, blistering soars about the size of a nickel" where they were branded. 
</P>
<P>
 The DFG labeled the disease columnaris, "an external bacterial disease common 
in many western hatcheries."  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the new batch of trout earmarked for the river will be marked 
with a fin clip, but will wear no brands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last chances to grab grunion until June are tonight and Thursday night. The 
season then closes for two months to allow the small fish to spawn in the wet 
sand uninterrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's run, along dark sandy beaches, is scheduled to begin at 11:15 and 
Thursday's about midnight. Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- Fishing remains slow locally, and the fact that anchovies are 
hard to come by isn't making it easier on the Southland fleet. Bonito and 
barracuda are in local waters, however. It's a matter of getting them to bite, 
and few skippers have been able to do it. Note: The Isle of Redondo, a deep-sea 
fishing barge operated by Redondo Sportfishing, will open for the spring and 
summer on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: Things are back to normal for this time of year, and that's 
bad news for fishermen. Blue water in the Golden Gate area has turned green and 
the marlin so prevalent in recent months have moved. One angler on a panga ran 
out of gas, was towed close to shore to await another boat and hooked into a 
swordfish estimated at 300 pounds. The angler hopped aboard a cruiser that came 
to his aid and battled the fish for several hours before his reel "finally 
exploded," according to a report from the Pisces Fleet. There was another 
unsuccessful hookup with a swordfish at Gordo Banks. Tuna fishing remains fair 
at times in an area nine miles off Chileno, but winds have been hampering the 
fishing effort even along the beaches, where roosterfish and pargo had been 
providing lots of action. 
</P>
<P>
 East Cape: Striped marlin activity is on the rise, according to Bob Van Wormer 
of Hotel Palmas de Cortez. But tuna remain the prevalent catch. Dorado catches 
are largely incidental. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Long-Range: The giant tuna are fairly plentiful at Mexico's 
Revillagigedo Islands, but getting them to bite with any consistency is still a 
problem. The Polaris Supreme returned to port Tuesday morning with 102 tuna 
kept and 81 released, with three fish topping 200 pounds, and 62 wahoo. The Red 
Rooster III returned last Friday with a similar tuna catch, but with 203 wahoo. 
</P>
<P>

by some of the sport's premier personalities, will be held April 8-10 at the

LOS ALAMITOS; HARNESS RACING FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only three nights of racing remaining in the 1994 winter-spring meeting, 
the future of California harness racing is once again uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the Premier Harness Racing Assn., which has been leasing Los 
Alamitos for harness racing, appeared before the California Horse Racing Board 
at its monthly meeting in Emeryville, requesting six simulcast races each night 
for a harness meeting at Cal-Expo in Sacramento. The PHRA's plan for a meeting 
includes four nights of racing weekly -- Wednesday through Saturday -- from 
April 29 through July 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would include six simulcast races from the Meadowlands in East 
Rutherford, N.J., followed by eight live races. Currently, at Los Alamitos, a 
typical program includes three simulcast races and as many as 12 live races 
three nights a week, Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA's proposal was opposed by representatives of the quarter horse 
industry, who believe that simulcast races would affect the mutuel handle on 
live quarter horse races this summer at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the CHRB approved only four simulcast races for the beginning of 
the Sacramento meeting, which would drop to three after June 15 when an influx 
of 2-year-olds would begin racing and would help alleviate a horse shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Harness racing interests were not satisfied, and the PHRA investors met on 
Saturday to discuss their options. A subsequent request was made to CHRB 
members, quarter horse interests and especially Edward Allred, a 50% owner of 
Los Alamitos and the president of the Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn., 
which operates quarter horse racing at Los Alamitos, to reconsider and allow 
six simulcast races a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA is hoping for an answer by today so horsemen can be told whether a 
Sacramento meeting will proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if there's precedent for the CHRB to overturn a decision," said 
Dave Goldschmidt, the PHRA's racing secretary. "We think they made a poor 
decision and it will be hard for them to admit that in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldschmidt said that if the CHRB doesn't allow six simulcast races a night, 
it would be difficult for his group to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA maintains that without six simulcast races a night from Sacramento, 
investors have little or no chance of recouping their investment. Harness 
racing at Sacramento has always been a less productive meeting than Los 
Alamitos'. Last year's average Sacramento handle was $393,000, compared to 
$841,000 at Los Alamitos.  
</P>
<P>
 The PHRA hopes to use the simulcast races as an opportunity to raise money not 
only for operators, but also for purses for live racing. The simulcasts would 
also help alleviate a horse shortage that has plagued the harness industry for 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Goldschmidt, 481 horses are stabled at Los Alamitos and of those, 
about 100 will leave California to race in other states no matter what happens 
at Sacramento. At the same time, he expects to pick up 50 horses from 
Cloverdale Raceway in British Columbia, which concludes its spring meeting in 
early May. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't race, all these people in California have to find a way to make a 
living," Goldschmidt said. The 13-week meeting that concludes Saturday was put 
together on short notice. In December, three weeks before the meeting started, 
the CHRB approved the PHRA's lease, forcing the group to work through the 
holidays to put together racing programs. Fortunately, many horsemen were 
already operating in California and had horses at some level of training. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet began slowly, a reflection of the few horses ready to race. Business 
was also affected when purses were cut 20% at the end of January. In early 
February, more horses were ready to race each week and the racing improved. 
Slowly, the mutuel handle began to rise, and with it the purses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, purses grew 10% for the second time since the reduction, meaning 
horsemen are racing for about the same money as at the start of the meeting. 
Weekend mutuel handles, which were stuck at about $900,000 at the beginning of 
the meeting, are now routinely above $1 million on Friday and Saturdays.

VIACOM, CABLE GIANT TCI DISCUSS JOINT VENTURE; TELEVISION: THE DEAL WOULD ALLOW 
VIACOM TO GENERATE NEEDED CASH, AND WOULD GIVE TCI ACCESS TO BIG CITY MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS and JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viacom Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc. are discussing forming a joint 
venture to pool Viacom's cable TV assets with some of those of TCI, sources 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which would involve well over 1 million subscribers scattered 
throughout the nation, would allow Viacom to generate the cash it needs to 
reduce debt it has taken on to buy Paramount Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, TCI gets access to the big city markets, including San 
Francisco, Seattle and Nashville, that Viacom now serves. In addition, the deal 
would settle out of court the acrimonious antitrust action Viacom filed last 
fall against TCI in the heat of the Paramount takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is considered potentially damaging to TCI because it lays bare the 
alleged monopolistic practices of the nation's largest cable operator that have 
already caught the attention of federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the talks, the deal calls for Viacom to 
merge its Showtime Networks unit with rival TCI's pay TV affiliate, Encore. 
Finally, Viacom might also extract a pledge from TCI not to join with its music 
video rivals who are planning to launch channels to compete with Viacom's 
lucrative MTV operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax consequences and other mechanics of the deal are still being studied, 
one knowledgeable source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both before and after the Paramount takeover battle, Viacom has searched for 
ways to wring new cash from its cable holdings, which rank 13th nationally in 
subscribers. The division generates about $200 million annually in cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, for example, Viacom considered a proposal to form a venture with 
Crown Media and Southwestern Bell, and one source insisted Tuesday that TCI is 
not the only company that Viacom is talking to now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the deal would be a pooling of Viacom's and TCI's systems in 
San Francisco, Seattle and Nashville where the two operators are the major 
cable TV providers. Viacom and TCI have already worked together to coordinate 
construction of fiber loop to serve both the Seattle and San Francisco markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a deal with TCI would close the Viacom lawsuit, it might not be the 
end of TCI's legal woes. In a separate development, a spokesman for the 
attorney general's office in New York confirmed Tuesday that it launched an 
antitrust investigation late last year into TCI-backed Teleport Communications 
Group, which operates an alternative access telephone service for businesses. 
Cox Enterprises, Continental Cable and Comcast, three other large cable 
operators, also have stakes in Teleport. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom appears eager to shed assets that are not crucial to its merger with 
Paramount. On Tuesday, for example, the company said it sold its one-third 
stake in the cable TV channel Lifetime to partners Capital Cities/ABC and 
Hearst Corp. for $317.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 By spinning off assets, analysts said, Viacom is signaling Blockbuster 
Entertainment that it doesn't need the home video retail giant's money badly 
enough to renegotiate the merger agreement it made to generate enough money to 
buy Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 As Viacom's stock price has dropped steeply since the deal was struck, 
Blockbuster Chief Executive H. Wayne Huizenga has been withholding his 
recommendation on the merger, making Viacom nervous.

DANA PARSONS: HIS WORST NIGHTMARE COMES CALLING ON EIGHT TINY LEGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most people, I have an automatic three-step procedure when I return to my 
darkened home: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Turn on the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Turn on the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Check for spiders. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, the evening begins with a case of the shivers, because my 
otherwise nondescript home apparently has been designated permanent host to the 
International Spider Consortium, at which leading spiders from around the world 
convene for the sole purpose of making me jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 They set up their workshops and study groups pretty much wherever they please: 
behind the front door, along the kitchen baseboards, outside the shower stall, 
on the stairwell and, of course, under the kitchen and bathroom sinks where you 
keep the cleaning stuff. That explains why I never clean the place -- reaching 
through a spider's lair just to get some furniture polish hardly seems worth 
the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving here I spent nine years in Colorado, which always seemed rather 
bug-free to me. I encountered only one giant bug in my house, prompting me to 
describe it the next day to a colleague. I had never seen a bug with thighs 
before, and as I described it, my friend began sketching feverishly on a piece 
of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this it?" he asked, drawing a miniature Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly it!" I exclaimed, making a mental note to always be on his 
side for Pictionary. "What is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "A Mormon cricket," he said. "There's only one way to kill it -- lure it onto 
a flat surface and hit it with a mallet." 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving here, I had never associated California with bugs ("The Golden 
State," "Land of Milk and Honey" "Paradise on Earth" and all that stuff), so it 
was disturbing to discover that I'm living in the heart of flea country, ant 
country and spider country. 
</P>
<P>
 My apartment complex features some of the most intricate spider webs I've ever 
seen. Caltrans engineers should be so gifted. It's possible to walk into one 
and miss a day of work. 
</P>
<P>
 We should all confront our fears, however, and I've wondered where mine began. 
After all, why should we be afraid of bugs and not kitties? I've traced my 
problem (surprise, surprise) to my parents. 
</P>
<P>
 We lived in Texas for a year when I was a kid, and our dumpy little place 
featured a fine assortment of roaches and June bugs, the latter of which, I 
suspect, were nothing but roaches without the reputation. Anyway, my dad got 
this great idea that I should catch June bugs in my hand and throw them 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, gee, Dad, do I have to?" was met with the father-to-son phrase that has 
kept a subsequent generation of therapists in clover: "What are you, a sissy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Better to be a Hitler Youth than a sissy, so I'd snatch the June bug, hold it 
in my closed fist and toss it outside, making Father proud and no doubt setting 
the trauma-association wheels in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, I've never shaken it. I'll be settling in for an evening of TV when, 
suddenly, there in mid-step on the wall, will be a fearsome black spider. 
Zounds! Where did he come from? He wasn't there a moment ago!  
</P>
<P>
 He freezes, sensing my presence. If only he would make the mistake of getting 
down on the floor, I could drop the Yellow Pages on him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's too smart for that. Inevitably, the stare-down begins. I don't move. 
Neither does he. I glance at the TV, then over to the spider. Glance at TV, 
glance at spider. Wait! He moved three inches. I sprout goose bumps. I hope he 
doesn't notice. I rustle slightly, and he moves another few inches. Where's he 
going? Aha, he's trying to make it to the closet, so he can hide in my jacket 
and scare the crap out of me in a week or so. That fiend. Damn, he's ruining my 
TV program. 
</P>
<P>
 He probably figures that if he moves too quickly, he'll attract attention and 
I'll try to squash him against the wall. My ace in the hole is that he has no 
way of knowing that, in addition to being afraid of bugs, I can't stand to 
squash them by hand, because you have to get too close and, well, you know what 
it does to the wall. At most, I will blow in their general direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Silent and catlike, I grab a newspaper and roll it up. Perhaps I can chase him 
outside. I flick the paper at him, and he bolts. He flees the exact opposite 
direction of where I want him to go. I don't have the heart to smash him, and 
he escapes to the hiding place where his buddies are waiting for his report. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamenting my inability to strike forcefully, I watch TV with lights on and, 
later, retire for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep comes, reluctantly then fitfully, sabotaged by awareness of the dangers 
within. 
</P>

PARQUE WINS BIG FOR CRESCENTA VALLEY, 10-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 5 feet 9 and 145 pounds, Jim Parque isn't exactly a dominating figure on 
the mound. In fact, Crescenta Valley's left-handed ace has heard plenty of talk 
about his size over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season I had to work through that to prove something to myself," Parque 
said. "Now I just pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers to let his statistics do the talking. Parque, a senior with a hard 
fastball that belies his size, pitched his second complete game of the season 
Tuesday in Crescenta Valley's 10-2 Mission Conference victory at Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque (4-0) struck out 14, gave up six hits and walked four. He yielded two 
runs and three hits in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was just kind of riding along in a groove with that lead we had," 
he said. "Then (in the fifth) I kind of started experimenting with my pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (6-1, 3-1) entered the inning with a 6-0 lead. The Falcons 
scored four runs in the first, one in the third and one in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover (4-4, 2-2) didn't come close to scoring after the fifth. Catcher Ed 
Perez drove home the team's first run with a ground single to center and 
shortstop Ron Pirayoff drove in the second with a single to left.  
</P>
<P>
 Pirayoff went two for two and walked twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons sealed the victory with two runs in the sixth and two more in the 
seventh.  
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Marty Lane went three for three with a run batted in and 
shortstop Kirk Hagge went three for five with three RBIs. Left fielder Jesse 
Mitchell was three for four with an RBI and catcher John French had two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my team is going to get runs for me and that's part of why I feel so 
confident," said Parque, who will play at UCLA next season. "It's a great 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jose Nuno (0-2) took the loss for the Tornadoes. He gave up 13 hits and 
eight runs in 5 1/3 innings. He walked five and struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirayoff relieved Nuno and gave up one hit and two runs in less than an 
inning. Junior Steve Staub pitched the seventh and gave up one hit.

OFF THE MOUND, WOLF GIVES SPIRITUAL LIFT; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: EL CAMINO REAL 
ACE INSPIRES MATES TO 14-9 VICTORY OVER QUARTZ HILL, BERTH IN TITLE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The El Camino Real High baseball team would have liked to have Randy Wolf 
pitching on Tuesday. But, under the circumstances, the Conquistadores were 
ecstatic just to have Wolf watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, whose father, James, died of a heart attack on Sunday, was wearing 
street clothes in the El Camino Real High dugout during the Conquistadores' 
14-9 victory against Quartz Hill in the final game of pool play in the Thousand 
Oaks tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a big difference to me, just him being here for everyone to see he 
was all right," senior Clint Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf hopes to make more of a difference today. He said he will play for the 
Conquistadores (7-2) in the championship game at 2 p.m. against Thousand Oaks 
(9-2). 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real was 2-1 in pool play, tying with Newbury Park and 
Harvard-Westlake. The Conquistadores advanced because they scored more runs 
than either of the other two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Both El Camino Real and Quartz Hill were able to score plenty on Tuesday 
against second-line pitching. Each team was playing its third game in fewer 
than 30 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus started for El Camino Real and Darrell Hussman for the Rebels (6-5). 
Neither had pitched this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussman (0-1) was in trouble from the start. He gave up nine runs in 2 1/3 
innings. He was ejected from the game for arguing balls and strikes in the 
third, yielding to Javier Salinas, who gave up three more runs and could not 
get out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real jumped to a 12-1 lead after three innings. Most of the damage 
was done by shortstop Matt Tays, who drove in seven runs in his first three 
at-bats. He finished the game with five hits, including a triple and two 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marcus (1-0), who was effective for the first four innings, fell apart in 
the fifth. Billy Burnette relieved and could only record one out. The Rebels 
pulled to within 12-9, when El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio finally had to use 
Tony Kyber to get out of the inning and finish the game. Kyber pitched seven 
innings Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Leth had two doubles and Albert Miller had two singles to lead Quartz 
Hill. Justin Martin, Craig Carlton, Jason Gibbs and Gavin Bible each had two 
hits for the Conquistadores.

NORTHRIDGE BURIED BY LONG BALL; COLLEGE BASEBALL: LOYOLA, WITH EIGHT EXTRA-BASE 
HITS INCLUDING THREE HOMERS, BLOWS OPEN CLOSE GAME, 13-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been three years since Jody Robinson hung his shingle in the Cal State 
Northridge dugout and hung out signs in the third-base coaching box. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the head coach at Loyola Marymount, it didn't take long for Robinson to 
realize that not much has changed in his old haunts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball does carry well here," Robinson said with a grin. "It's a good 
offensive park." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount parked three balls and rolled up eight extra-base hits 
Tuesday in a 13-7 nonconference victory over Northridge at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (14-18) had homers in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings to turn 
a one-run lead into a 13-6 margin. Once Loyola Marymount lowered the boom, the 
Matador offense -- which has been out-homered by the opposition, 31-23 -- 
wheezed to a dead stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-handed starter Ryan Graves (1-4) and reliever Jesse Ibarra held 
Northridge to two hits over the final four innings. Ibarra, who clubbed his 
11th homer in the seventh to give the Lions a 9-5 lead, allowed a run over two 
innings of one-hit relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Loyola Marymount climbed in front in the middle innings, the Northridge 
fire seemed to disappear. With the Matadors' postseason hopes pinned solely on 
their performance in Western Athletic Conference play, team intensity wasn't 
exactly at a record level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see it out there today," said outfielder Brian Vasey, who had three 
hits for the second game in a row. "We put points on the board, then they put 
points on the board and we didn't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (17-15) managed eight hits, two of which came in a four-run rally 
in the second that gave the Matadors a 4-1 lead. Right-hander Rick Orr (1-2) 
was wild, however, and was charged with six earned runs in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Evan Howland yielded a run in his first two innings on a solo homer 
by Mike Peters, but the Lions iced it in the seventh and eighth, when Ibarra 
and Mike Seal launched two-run homers. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked Robinson's first victory in six games against his former boss, 
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen, whose victory total might have been higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We caught a break one year and had a rainout," Robinson cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, if the game was scheduled at Northridge, maybe not.

</P>
<P>

PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; MATER DEI GETS A BREAK, BEATS LAGUNA HILLS, 2-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The umpire was wrong, the runner was safe and the coach was livid. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's softball team scored a 2-0 nonleague victory over host Laguna 
Hills Tuesday, getting the most out of a hit and run gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
 In what seems to be an officiating rarity, a base umpire conceded he was out 
of position and deferred to his partner, who overruled him -- and what had been 
called an out at third base became a successful double steal that eventually 
led to two runs for No. 8 Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial play took place in the third inning.. After Kendra Meano's single 
and an error on Lisa Tully's bouncer to the pitcher, Mater Dei Coach Doug Myers 
signaled for a hit and run. But Patty Godwin didn't make contact and Meano was 
called out after the throw by catcher Sumer McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers suggested to Jim Abraham -- who made the call from the shortstop hole -- 
that he was out of position to see the tag because Meano slid on her side and 
the tag was on the front of her thighs. Abraham met with home plate umpire John 
Bennett and, after a short discussion, Bennett said he had a better angle and 
from it, Meano was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really safe," Meano said later. "I was totally safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The call did not sit well with Laguna Hills Coach Cary Crouch. And it was even 
worse when, after Godwin struck out for what would have been the third out of 
the inning, left-handed batter Candace Kollen popped an outside pitch down the 
left-field line, doubling home Meano and Tully. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks were trying to pitch around Kollen, a .407 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three pitches later, Kollen was thrown out trying to steal third with all 
parties in almost identical spots as the Meano play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a better angle?" Crouch yelled to Bennett. "You got a better angle?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks got their only two hits -- both in the infield -- in the second 
inning, but failed to get another baserunner. Godwin retired the final 17 
batters; she walked none and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 In other nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 8, Aliso Niguel 7 -- Sara Halverson's sacrifice fly in the bottom 
of the seventh inning scored Raeme Payne with the winning run for Costa Mesa 
(4-5).

Niguel (6-6). Nicole Woody had four hits for Costa Mesa. 
</P>

home run for visiting Capistrano Valley (7-4), which scored four runs in the 
second inning.

RBI single to score Amy Smith in the third for Pacifica. 
</P>

Quinta (6-3, 3-0).

 Tustin 4, Irvine 3 -- A single by Erin Hayes scored Jenny Odum with the 
winning run to cap a four-run sixth-inning rally for Tustin (5-2, 3-0). Odum 
hit a two-run double earlier in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 3, University 1 -- Alison Johnsen had two hits, one run scored and

PREP TENNIS ROUNDUP; THIRD-RANKED UNIVERSITY BEATS BAD VIBES, WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's nothing like using the power of negative thinking to pull out a close 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 University High tennis Coach Josh Davis said he had some bad vibes going into 
Tuesday's match against archrival Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not practice well Monday," Davis said. "I knew this would be our 
toughest Sea View League match of the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan senior Seth Turbow felt even worse about playing Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always a negative thinker," Turbow said. "I usually expect to lose. I 
knew they were good." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked Woodbridge was good, but not quite good enough, losing to 
third-ranked University, 13 2/3-7 1/3, at Woodbridge's North Lake Tennis Club 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors led, 3 2/3-3 1/3, after the first round, but University (7-2, 
5-0) took nine of the last 12 sets to win going away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our seniors pulled us through," Davis said. "Jason Meyers, Seth Turbow, 
Robbie Wilkins and Jason Maddox came through for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers won all three of his singles sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-4, and Maddox won, 6-2, 
4-6, 6-3. But Turbow and Wilkins, who played together at No. 1 doubles, won 
perhaps the two biggest sets of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing Chris Coleman and Tom Ro, 5-4, Wilkins and Turbow came back to win 
the set, 7-6. Wilkins and Turbow won despite Turbow blowing three easy volleys 
in the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just made sure I didn't do anything with my racket after I missed those 
shots," Turbow said. "My temper can be pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Turbow and Wilkins settled down to win their next two sets, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge fell to 8-3 and 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected it to be close, but it's kind of frustrating coming this close and 
not winning," Woodbridge Coach Joan Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to give them credit. They came out really strong in the last round. 
I'm just glad we have another crack at them." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Sea View League match: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 20, Tustin 1 -- The doubles teams for Irvine (5-5, 1-4) swept their 
sets to give the Vaqueros their first league victory. Todd Herrington and 
Gonzalvo Funzalida won, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0. Anup Arora and Brad Thomas won, 6-2, 
6-0, 6-2, and Jeff Chen and Albert Tzeng won, 7-6, 6-3, 6-2. In singles, John 
Manley won his sets, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1, and Sid Khanijou won, 6-3, 6-2, 6-0. Tustin 
is 0-5 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Coast League: 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 12 2/3, Mission Viejo 8 2/3 -- Eli Engle and Dan Roditi swept in 
doubles, 6-0, 7-5, 6-2, for host San Clemente (7-1, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta 17, Los Amigos 4 -- Thinh Tran swept in singles, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, for 
host La Quinta (8-1, 4-0).

ANAHEIM LIONS TOURNAMENT; DANA HILLS NOT PITCHER PERFECT BUT WINS, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Canary, Dana Hills baseball coach, just smiled. What else could he do? His 
team has somehow defied logic. 
</P>
<P>
 The unranked Dolphins' 3-2 victory over fifth-ranked Fullerton at Glover 
Stadium Tuesday put them in the finals of the West Anaheim Lions Tournament. A 
neat trick, considering they've been playing with two arms behind their back. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills has worked its way through the tournament with little help from its 
top two pitchers, Seth Etherton and Chris Toomey. Their six-games-in-seven-days 
schedule has left Canary no choice but to pitch by committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I have no idea who I'll be pitching tomorrow," said 
Canary, whose team will play Loara in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins found themselves in this predicament after a rainout postponed 
their South Coast League game with Capistrano Valley last week. That game was 
rescheduled for Friday. They play Mission Viejo Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 With two league games back-to-back, Canary couldn't afford to waste Etherton 
and Toomey on tournament games, as they are limited by the rules to 30 outs per 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Etherton, who has signed with USC, pitched three innings in the tournament 
opener against Sonora Saturday. Toomey pitched two innings in Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 With minuscule help from their aces, the Dolphins' chances hardly seemed 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hoped we would stay close and get a break," Canary said. 
</P>
<P>
 He got both Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 2-2, going into the bottom of the seventh, Etherton, who 
hasn't batted in a week because of a sore left shoulder, had a leadoff 
pinch-hit single. He went to second when Mark Richardson pushed a bunt passed 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Currier then attempted to sacrifice. Pitcher Keith Ginter fielded the 
bunt and threw to third in time to get Etherton, but third base Robert 
Echavarria pulled his foot off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Ralph then slapped a 3-2 pitch past a drawn-in infield to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins (6-5-1) got another stable performance from their pitchers. Scott 
Maynard, normally a catcher, pitched four innings, and Bob Flood (2-0), a first 
baseman, pitched the final three and got the victory. Neither pitchers were 
strong, but they kept the game close. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Loara 4, Paramount 2 -- Jeff Roncevich pitched a six-hitter with seven 
strikeouts for Loara (8-4) at Glover Stadium. Dan Gusman had two doubles and 
drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora 11, Santiago 2 -- Junior Rodriguez pitched a no-hitter with 10 
strikeouts for Sonora (5-7). Rodriguez had a perfect game until the bottom of 
the seventh when he walked four and had a passed ball that scored two runs. He 
also had four hits and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora plays Kennedy at 10 a.m. Wednesday at Brookhurst Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 7, Laguna Beach 1 -- In the fifth-place semifinal, Enrique Mejia 
pitched a six-hitter for Anaheim (6-6). Stewart Gorton had three runs batted in 
and a double, and Jaime Carlos had two hits and two stolen bases for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra 4, Sunny Hills 3 -- Ryan Busch hit a two-run double to cap a 
three-run fifth inning for La Habra (4-4) at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella 5, Cypress 5 (Katella advances on total bases) -- Katella advanced to 
the consolation final against La Habra at 4 p.m. today at Glover Stadium.

SANTA ANA ELKS TOURNAMENT; GAHR SCORES EIGHT IN SIXTH, BEATS PACIFICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Cerritos Gahr scored eight runs in the sixth inning to defeat Pacifica, 8-1, 
in the championship semifinals of the Santa Ana Elks Easter baseball tournament 
Tuesday at Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (6-7) will meet George Marshall (Va.) for third place at 3 p.m. today 
at Santa Ana High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners broke a scoreless battle in the top of the sixth before Gahr 
battered four Pacifica pitchers in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff DePippo opened the sixth for Pacifica with a walk and took second on a 
sacrifice by Erik Maurer. Eric Martinez was hit by a pitch to put runners on 
first and second. Chad Brown, who struck out in his first two at-bats for only 
the third and fourth times this season, doubled down the left-field line to 
score DePippo and raise his team-leading batting average to .469. 
</P>
<P>
 Gahr came back in the bottom of the inning with eight runs on five hits, but 
Pacifica Coach Brian Flatten was more concerned about his battered pitching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer, who entered the game in the fifth inning, left with a muscle pull 
after facing four batters in the sixth. He has been with the team only a couple 
of weeks, because he was a member of the Mariners' basketball team that reached 
the State final. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer removed himself from the game with a 1-2 count on a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too early to know how he is," Flatten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Foley and Corey Volk also were ineffective before Scott Nelson came in 
to get the final out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Flatten was pleased with the performance of starter Adam Peters, who pitched 
four scoreless innings, allowing three hits and retiring the final six batters 
he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had scheduled a certain number of pitches for him," said Flatten, noting 
that they were working on Peters' pitching mechanics. He threw 52 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 11, Foothill 10 -- Nick Estrada had three hits, scored two runs and 
drove in three runs for Orange (8-4). Estrada had nine consecutive hits dating 
to Monday's first round before reaching base on an error in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 3, Redlands 2 -- Oscar Miranda pitched a five-hitter, striking out, 
and also had an RBI triple for host Santa Ana (3-8). Tony Mier had an RBI 
single for Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 8, Valencia 4 -- Sam Perla had three hits with two RBIs for 
Saddleback (6-6-1).

UPPER DECK TOURNAMENT; MATER DEI BOBBLES A CHANCE TO ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing shoddy defense while facing quality pitching is one proven way to lose 
baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
 And unfortunately for Mater Dei High Coach Bob Ickes, the Monarchs illustrated 
this fact extremely well, or poorly, depending on your perspective, in the 
Upper Deck Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistake-prone Mater Dei lost to San Diego Mission Bay, 5-3, Tuesday in the 
championship quarterfinals at Amerige Park in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (8-3-1) had more errors (three) than hits (two) against the Bucs 
(9-0), who are ranked fourth in the nation by USA Today. Toss in a passed ball 
and a wild pitch, and Ickes' unpleasant disposition was understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense let us down," Ickes said. "Without a doubt, this was one of our 
worst games defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a particularly bad time for a letdown because Mission Bay standout 
Chris Juarez (4-0) was on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior left-hander dominated the Monarchs, pitching a complete game with 
12 strikeouts. Juarez, mixing a sharp breaking ball and crackling fastball, 
retired 12 in a row at one point and struck out the side in the fourth and 
seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ickes: "We're an offensive club, but you're not going to score many runs 
on a kid like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez usually doesn't require much help, but he received support from both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs' problems began in the bottom of the second, which, ironically, 
was the only inning things went right. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei led, 3-0, following senior Adam Harris' first home run of the 
season, a 300-foot line drive down the left-field line with runners on first 
and second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, however, suffered an emotional blow a few pitches before the 
home run. Junior right fielder Dave Sanchez was forced to leave the game after 
suffering a separated right shoulder while avoiding a pickoff attempt at first. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior outfielder Louis Lopez took Sanchez's place in the lineup and committed 
two errors, the first of which helped the Bucs score their first of two runs in 
the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucs scored the tying run in the fourth on Lopez's second error. Mission 
Bay scored the go-ahead run in the fifth on a wild pitch by sophomore Kevin 
Bice (0-1), who was making his first start. Mission Bay's final run in the 
seventh was set up by a pitch that eluded catcher Gary Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado 4, Alabama Hartselle 3 -- El Dorado (9-3) scored the winning run on 
a two-out error at Cal State Fullerton. Hartselle scored once in the eighth to 
take a 3-2 lead but El Dorado's Chris Beck singled home Jeff Moore with the 
tying run with two outs in the bottom of the inning. Beck scored the winning 
run from second on a throwing error by Hartselle third baseman David Lewis. El 
Dorado advances to play San Diego Rancho Bernardo in a semifinal at 7 tonight 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 6, New Mexico Artesia 5 -- Damien Feuerborn had an RBI single to 
break a 1-1 tie in the second for Esperanza (5-6). Greg Fujoika added a two-run 
single later in the inning to give the Aztecs a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy 15, Las Vegas Chaparral 5 -- Brad Downing hit a three-run homer, Rick 
Parmenter a two-run homer, and Trevor Brown and Rich Richey each hit three-run 
doubles as Troy (8-1) scored 11 runs in the sixth to break a 4-4 tie.

KING SAYS HE'S NOW SURE POLICE USED RACIAL SLUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney G. King insisted to a jury Tuesday that despite his earlier uncertainty 
in previous testimony, racial slurs were uttered when he was beaten by police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt in my mind," said King, who is seeking $9.5 million in his 
lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles in his March 3, 1991, beating by four 
police officers after a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, a lawyer for the city said he was not sure a racial slur was 
uttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can hear whatever you want to hear," attorney Skip Miller said. "That's 
how you can characterize it. It was totally unclear." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has admitted liability for King's beating, and jurors have been asked 
to set a compensatory damage figure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trial's second phase, they will try to allocate blame to individual 
defendants, including the four former officers involved, for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The four, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officers Laurence M. Powell, Theodore J. 
Briseno and Timothy E. Wind, were charged in the beating, which was videotaped 
by an amateur cameraman, George Holliday, and broadcast widely. The officers 
were acquitted on all but one charge in a 1992 state trial, and the verdicts 
sparked the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon and Powell were convicted last year in federal court of violating King's 
civil rights and were sentenced to 30 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, King testified that he heard officers shout the racial slur but 
admitted under cross-examination that he could not remember if he heard the 
word nigger or killer . 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, King, testifying for a second day in the suit, said that in 
spite of his previous hesitation, he was now certain what he heard the night of 
the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 One of King's attorneys, John Burris, said King modified his testimony during 
the criminal trial because "he was under a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 On direct examination, King testified that he could identify the point on the 
video soundtrack when the slur was uttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my head turned, I can point it out," King said. Some in the courtroom 
also said they could hear a voice shout, "Nigger, stay down!" 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not clear who, if anyone, shouted the slur. Many law enforcement 
officers were at the scene of the beating besides the four charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Burris said he would try to show in the second phase of the trial who was 
shouting racial slurs, perhaps calling an audio expert to analyze the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Burris said the repeated shouts of the racial slur were not emphasized in the 
two criminal trials because race was not at issue. Prosecutors focused on the 
use of excessive force by the officers.

POLICE UNION AGREES TO HALT BILLBOARD CAMPAIGN; CONTRACT TALKS TO RESUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of the Los Angeles police union said Tuesday that they will take down 
their controversial carjacking billboards in order to revive contract talks 
with the city and acknowledge the recent shooting deaths of two Japanese 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 During a private meeting Monday night with Mayor Richard Riordan, the 
president of the Police Protective League agreed to stop the billboard 
campaign. The mayor, in turn, agreed to reconvene contract talks that came to a 
sudden halt last week when the billboards went up. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, which show a woman being carjacked by an armed assailant, are part of 
the league's campaign to tarnish the city's image, rattle its tourist industry 
and bring visibility to the union's cause. Critics considered the campaign 
inappropriate in a city increasingly worried about crime -- even more so after 
the real-life carjacking of the two teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, which represents about 7,000 LAPD officers, agreed that the 
international attention that the shooting has drawn soured their week-old 
billboard campaign. The billboards will come down today or tomorrow, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragic murders of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura have reinforced the need for 
the city's leaders and the Police Protective League to work together to restore 
public confidence and the international reputation of Los Angeles by improving 
the working conditions of the Los Angeles Police Department," according to a 
statement from league President Danny Staggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Matsuura, both 19-year-old Marymount College students, were shot in 
the head Friday night in the parking lot of a San Pedro supermarket. They died 
Sunday. In Japan, the shooting has become a symbol of America's violent 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan met Monday with the families of the slain students, and afterward 
described the billboards as "grotesque" and "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 The ads were part of a three-pronged campaign by the league to pressure the 
city into a contract settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the union sent brochures to tourist officials that highlighted 
crime statistics. The 21 billboards went up last Tuesday. The union had also 
threatened to distribute to tourism officials a videotape using riot footage to 
show the lawlessness of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides stirring up public criticism, the union's aggressive campaign prompted 
an angry Riordan to cancel negotiating sessions and withdraw a contract 
proposal that he said included a salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Riordan said he welcomed the union's decision to de-escalate the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police union has come to agree with me that good faith negotiations 
belong at the bargaining table, not in billboards, brochures or other public 
relations tactics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the City Council, the body which must ultimately approve any 
agreement, also had been angered by the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the billboards were grotesque before the shooting in San Pedro," said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is a member of the city's negotiating 
committee. "There was no way a pay raise could be justified in the face of such 
a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, union officials on Tuesday refused to call the tactic a mistake, 
insisting that the billboards accomplished their main goal -- attracting 
widespread public attention to the contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the billboards also were designed to protest controversial work-rule 
changes proposed by Riordan, especially a plan to consolidate three ranks of 
detectives into a single classification and allow greater latitude for Chief 
Willie L. Williams to transfer them to patrol duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, claiming an important concession, said Riordan agreed during his 
private meeting with Staggs to withdraw the proposed personnel changes from the 
negotiating table. But the mayor said everything remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can now move to the bargaining table, where . . . issues to be considered 
will include wages, hours, work rules, incentives, contract terms, deployment 
and management rights," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 By taking down the billboards, union officials said they hoped to quickly 
bring to a close a labor dispute that has dragged on for nearly two years. On 
the sidelines, other city employee unions are watching the dispute closely, 
hoping to win new contracts as well.

LEGAL FEES ON FAILED LIBRARY DEAL RAISE CONCERN; NEGOTIATIONS: ALTHOUGH THE 
CITY COUNCIL AGREED TO PAY PHILIP MORRIS' EXPENSES, THE $221,000 BILL HAS SOME 
MEMBERS BALKING. TOTAL COST OF THE SCRAPPED PLAN MAY TOTAL $1.5 MILLION, CITY 
REPORTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after the Los Angeles City Council scuttled a plan to sell the 
landmark Central Library to a subsidiary of tobacco giant Philip Morris, city 
officials are upset by the size of legal fees the company is asking them to 
pay.  
</P>
<P>
 A bill for $221,000 is on the desk of council members, with hourly attorney's 
fees that run as high as $400. That is in addition to $240,000 the city has 
already paid to the firm's attorneys. When all the bills are tallied, including 
the city's own legal and consulting expenses, the cost of the failed deal could 
come to $1.5 million, city reports say. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed in June, at the outset of the negotiations with Philip 
Morris, to pay the subsidiary's expenses. But now that the bills are coming 
due, some council members and members of the city's Community Redevelopment 
Agency say the charges far exceed what they had been told to expect.  
</P>
<P>
 The dispute comes in the wake of an unusual proposal, championed by Mayor 
Richard Riordan, under which the city would have sold the library to a private 
company and then leased it back in a financing maneuver that was supposed to 
save the city $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency designated Philip Morris Capital Corp. as 
the firm best positioned to pull off the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm agreed to pay $71 million for the library in order to gain tax 
credits under historic preservation laws. The city would have leased the 
building, maintained control of all operations and saved $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council in June authorized the city to enter negotiations and said 
that if the deal fell through it would pay the company's legal expenses up to 
$250,000. Later, the council agreed to raise that spending cap by an 
unspecified amount. 
</P>
<P>
 But Community Redevelopment Agency staff members who were working on the deal 
said they were bogged down in so many other details of the transaction that 
they never negotiated a maximum payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Curt Gibbs, a senior finance officer with the CRA, defended the payments to 
Philip Morris, which could total $461,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is standard for these sorts of transactions," Gibbs said. "We were told 
by our consultants and attorneys that unless we offered this we would not find 
anyone willing to do transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for Philip Morris could not be reached for comment late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the final proposal was presented to the City Council in September, all 
but Councilman Hal Bernson voted against it. Several lawmakers said they feared 
that the money used to pay the library lease would be taken out of the 
redevelopment agency account that goes toward low-income housing. The vote was 
seen as one of the first significant losses for Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 A memo from the mayor's office at the time of the vote warned that if the deal 
fell through the total cost could come to $1.5 million. But in the daily crush 
of events at City Hall, the Philip Morris deal had been all but forgotten -- 
until a $581,000 bill from the tobacco firm's lawyers arrived late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of city officials persuaded Philip Morris to trim the bill by $120,000, 
and another $240,000 has already been paid to the tobacco subsidiary. But the 
CRA board this month declined to pay the remaining $221,000 in billings. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Bobbi Fiedler said she was "incensed" when she went through the 
bill for Philip Morris' attorneys, finding charges that ranged as high as $400 
an hour for one lawyer who billed the city for up to 17 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Another board member, Cynthia McClain-Hill, said a spending cap should have 
been set. "The agency had the responsibility to live within limits and that 
loop didn't get closed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiedler and McClain-Hill said the work on the deal was done before they 
replaced outgoing members of the board, who had been appointed by Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Two City Council members joined in the criticism Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm deeply concerned about it," Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. "Some of 
it may be justified, but it just keeps growing and growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon objected in particular to more than $50,000 
requested for legal fees after the council rejected the sale and lease-back of 
the library. Those expenses were charged by Philip Morris lawyers who prepared 
to make a second attempt at council approval, one week after their initial 
failure. The reconsideration also fell short, with the council rejecting the 
plan 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know what the heck they did in so few days that cost so much 
money," Alarcon said. "I think it's a sham."

OFFICERS ANGRY OVER ACLU'S RESIDENCY STUDY; POLICE: SOME SAY THEY LIVE OUTSIDE 
L.A. FOR THE SAME REASONS AS MILLIONS OF OTHERS. COUNCILMAN INTRODUCES MOTION 
URGING CITY TO LURE BACK SAFETY PERSONNEL. 
</P>

<P>
 Police officers fumed Tuesday about an American Civil Liberties Union report 
concluding that 83.1% of the city's officers do not live in Los Angeles. 
Meanwhile, a City Council member introduced a motion urging the city to try to 
lure public safety workers into living inside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police, Fire and safety departments' personnel must be encouraged to live 
within Los Angeles," Councilman Richard Alarcon said in a statement 
accompanying his motion. "By actually living within our city, there is a vested 
interest in seeing Los Angeles improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's proposal, which he introduced in February but reintroduced Tuesday, 
came amid an angry eruption from many police officers about the report, which 
the ACLU of Southern California released at a news conference Tuesday. The 
report, officers said, unfairly suggests that police have to live in the 
communities they patrol in order to care about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just not true," said one Rampart Division officer who was infuriated 
by the report. "It's just the ACLU taking another cheap shot at the Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Other police officers, while acknowledging that they have chosen to live 
outside the city limits of Los Angeles, said they made that decision for the 
same reasons that millions of other citizens have: better schools, better 
property values and safer neighborhoods. Several complained bitterly -- but 
anonymously -- that the ACLU was insinuating that they had done something 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In his only public comments about the ACLU report, Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams was more tempered, saying that he had not had a chance to read the 
document but that he disagreed with the suggestion that officers need to live 
in the city where they work to fully serve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our officers have a strong attachment to the communities they serve 
regardless of where they live," said Williams, one of few high-ranking LAPD 
leaders who lives inside the city limits. "Many of the men and women who are on 
our department were born and raised here. . . . There's a strong anchor between 
the employees in this organization and the people they serve." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU of Southern California found that the vast majority of police 
officers live outside the city and that many are concentrated in white, 
suburban areas such as the Santa Clarita Valley and communities such as Simi 
Valley. That city is home to 293 LAPD officers, more than the number of 
officers who live in the area patrolled by the LAPD's Central Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU's findings are based on ZIP code records provided by the LAPD last 
year. The department did not turn over officers' names or street addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our police force is composed of suburbanites who do not vote in local 
elections or use city services, who do not send their children to our schools 
and who often live in predominantly white neighborhoods," Ramona Ripston, 
executive director of the Southern California ACLU, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hope to improve relations between the LAPD and city residents, if we 
truly want community-based policing to work, the city and the LAPD need to work 
together to implement the recommendations of this report," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its recommendations, the ACLU proposed that the city work with lenders 
to offer police officers low- or no-interest loans to purchase homes inside the 
city limits. The report also suggested offering rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Several officers suggested that the report's authors were hypocritical and 
demanded that ACLU officials disclose their own residences. Responding to those 
charges, Allan Parachini, the author of the ACLU report, released residential 
information about the ACLU staff showing that most of the organization's 
staffers live in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Parachini, 69% of the ACLU's 32-member staff lives in Los 
Angeles, even though the Southern California ACLU covers an area from San Luis 
Obispo to San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our staffers have families with young children. . . . They know 
exactly the challenges that are faced by young police officers and other young 
families, but they've chosen to live in Los Angeles," Parachini said.

OUTCRY IS RARE-SLAYINGS IN SHADOWS GO ON; CRIME: DEATHS OF TWO JAPANESE 
STUDENTS BRING CARNAGE INTO PUBLIC EYE. BUT ON AVERAGE WEEKEND, 16 PEOPLE ARE 
KILLED IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the attention they received, the slayings of two students from Japan 
Friday night were only two of the 25 homicides that took place over the weekend 
in Los Angeles County -- and only one of the approximately 350 carjackings that 
occur in the city every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Generating headlines in newspapers, lead stories on television, concern among 
Japanese officials and reassurances from U.S. dignitaries, the deaths of Takuma 
Ito and Go Matsuura may have accomplished in one weekend what the Los Angeles 
police union has been threatening to do for weeks: scare tourists with 
reminders about violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the killings of the two 19-year-olds in San Pedro also revealed, as 
dramatic crimes often do, the unfortunate gap between the attention lavished on 
homicides that capture the public imagination and the numbing anonymity in 
which most violent deaths here take place. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, about sixteen people are slain each weekend in Los Angeles County. 
Because the news media focus on the extraordinary -- and there's nothing 
extraordinary any more about being killed in Los Angeles County -- most of 
those deaths go unheralded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the killings of Ito and Matsuura were different: 
</P>
<P>
 * Like Yoshihiro Hattori, the victim of a highly publicized fatal shooting in 
Louisiana in 1992, both Ito and Matsuura were from Japan. Their deaths 
reinforced a growing perception overseas that the United States in general, and 
Los Angeles in specific, are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlike the victims of most violent crimes, Ito and Matsuura were members of 
relatively affluent families and were relatively well educated. 
</P>
<P>
 * The shootings were reported widely by the news media, including a 30-inch 
story on Sunday that began on page one of The Times. By contrast, only one of 
the 23 other weekend homicides was reported in Sunday's Times -- a 10-inch 
story on Page 3 of the Metro Section about the fatal shooting of an alleged 
robber by a convenience store clerk in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * The slayings of Ito and Matsuura prompted responses from the mayor of Los 
Angeles, the governor of California and the U.S. ambassador to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 * The crime took place in the midst of a widely publicized billboard campaign 
designed to frighten the public into supporting the salary demands of the Los 
Angeles police union. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21 billboards, which went up last week, show a woman being carjacked at 
gunpoint. The billboards' caption reads, "Warning: This Can Be You Without the 
Police Dept." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Protective League officials said the campaign was designed to hurt the 
city's tourism industry and to point out the essential services provided by 
police. The officials had hoped the strategy would lead to a quick settlement 
with the city, but it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the league issued a statement expressing grief over the deaths of 
Ito and Matsuura and offering assurances that it is "dedicated to bringing the 
perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement went on to add that the families of the slain youths "are 
probably unaware of our contract dispute . . . and rightfully it has no place 
in their time of mourning. Therefore, no action or comment will be issued in 
response to the Police Protective League's current public information campaign 
and this very tragic incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, a Japanese national, and Matsuura, a U.S. citizen who grew up in Japan, 
were shot in the head at close range at about 11 p.m. Friday as they got out of 
their car in the parking lot of a Ralphs supermarket at Capitol Drive and 
Western Avenue, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Declared brain-dead soon after the attack, the young men -- students at 
Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes -- were both were taken off 
life-support systems at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and pronounced dead 
Sunday night. Acting on an anonmymous tip, police found their stolen Honda 
Civic late Sunday near where the students were shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office said last weekend's death toll of 24 
was heavier than normal, but not all that unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 On average this year, 16 people have been slain during a typical weekend, 
which is measured from 6 p.m. Friday through 6 a.m. Monday. On the weekend that 
began Feb. 18, 29 people were killed. On the weekend that began May 21, 1993, 
30 people were slain. Each weekend, most of the victims have been slain with 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of carjackings in Los Angeles increased steadily from 1990 through 
1992, before dropping significantly in 1993. There were 4,169 carjackings in 
1990, 4,404 in 1991, 4,671 in 1992 and 3,886 in 1993. Police said there was no 
obvious explanation for the drop in 1993.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TOPANGA CANYON; PLAN TO 
TURN DEVELOPMENT SITE INTO PARK ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to turn the proposed site of a controversial housing project in Topanga 
Canyon into public parkland moved forward Tuesday as Los Angeles County 
officials gave $11 million to a state parks agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision by the County Board of Supervisors to release the money 
-- part of voter-approved Proposition A funds -- was the last major hurdle to 
resolution of the longest-running land-use dispute in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise deal announced r this month, the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy agreed to buy 662 acres in the Summit Valley area from the Canyon 
Oaks Estates Limited Partnership, which had proposed building a links-style 
golf course and 97 luxury homes on 257 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The price, $19.9 million, was the highest paid by the conservancy since it was 
created in 1979. As part of the deal, the development partnership -- which is 
part of a Disney family trust -- agreed to drop its plans if the conservancy 
could close escrow before April 5. The money released Tuesday allows the 
conservancy to finalize an initial purchase of 432 acres for $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 230 acres must be purchased before August, 1995. Money for that 
acquisition would come either from Proposition 180, an initiative on the 
statewide ballot June 7, or from money owed the conservancy by the National 
Park Service.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHRIDGE; OWNERS OF 
COLLAPSED COMPLEX DEFAULT ON LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of the Northridge Meadows apartments, already facing several 
lawsuits in connection with the building's collapse in the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
have defaulted on a $14.7-million loan for seven other buildings they own, 
according to an investors' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shashikant and Renuka Jogani, owners of Northridge Meadows and about 50 other 
apartment buildings, defaulted on Feb. 1 and owe $145,429 in back payments, 
according to a foreclosure suit filed Monday in Superior Court by a New 
York-based group of foreign investors, the WHC-One Limited Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the investors would not comment. Jay Ford, a lawyer for the 
Joganis, said: "We are right now in the process of trying to negotiate a 
resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest foreclosure action involves properties in the San Fernando Valley, 
Jogani's attorneys said. Some were damaged in the quake but none was 
red-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit, the investors are seeking a court-appointed receiver to 
collect rents and maintain the complexes. The investors are also asking the 
court to allow the receiver to hire environmental specialists, gain access to 
the buildings' plans and construction documentation and make sure the buildings 
are properly insured.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; 
TEEN-AGER FATALLY STABBED, 2 OTHERS HURT IN FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year old boy was killed and two other youths were wounded in a stabbing 
and fight outside a house in an affluent area of Rancho Palos Verdes on Tuesday 
afternoon, sheriff's deputies reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the three were stabbed after a confrontation between two groups 
of youths in the 5300 block of Manitowac Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Details were sketchy late Tuesday, and names were withheld pending 
notification of the victims' families. Neighbors said the house is occupied by 
a couple and their teen-age children, but deputies said the victims were 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the incident erupted when several youths arrived to visit a 
teen-ager who turned out not to be in the house. Upon their arrival, Deputy 
Benita Hinojos said, at least three other youths approached the visitors "and a 
confrontation resulted that started with a fistfight and turned into a 
stabbing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojos said the cause of the confrontation was unclear. No suspects were in 
custody late Tuesday.

WOMEN IN L.A. HISTORY; THE EARLY DAYS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE MARKED BY 
WOMEN WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THE AREA'S DEVELOPMENT AS INVENTORS, LAWYERS, AUTHORS 
AND PHILANTHROPISTS. AS WOMEN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 History Month comes to a close, here is a look at a few of them: 
</P>
<P>
 * CHARLOTTA BASS, 1875 -- 1969 
</P>
<P>
 A pioneering African American journalist, Bass was widely known for her 
leadership in civil rights, voting and housing rights, and as a labor activist. 
She was the owner, publisher and editor of the California Eagle, which was, 
from 1879 to 1964, the longest continuously publishing black newspaper on the 
West Coast. Her fearless stance against the Ku Klux Klan led to a confrontation 
with eight white-sheeted men. The incident ended when she pulled a gun from her 
desk and aimed it at them. She was the first black woman candidate for vice 
president, on the Progressive Party ticket in 1952, when she was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 * INA COOLBRITH, 1841 -- 1928 
</P>
<P>
 Coolbrith, the niece of Mormon church founder Joseph Smith, came to California 
on the Overland Trail, settling in Los Angeles as a child with her family in 
1855. Her career as a poet began with the publication of her early poems in 
local newspapers. In 1915, she was named California's first poet laureate. Much 
of her life was spent in the Bay Area, where she was the first public librarian 
in Oakland and the librarian -- and an honorary member -- of the exclusively 
male Bohemian Club. She encouraged young writers such as Jack London to pursue 
literary careers. Her friends from the arts included such luminaries of the 
time as Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Isadora Duncan, Mary Austin and Joaquin Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 * CLARA SHORTRIDGE FOLTZ, 1849 -- 1934 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz was the first woman admitted to the Bar in California, but only after 
she and another woman, Laura Gordon, drafted a law to eliminate discrimination 
by sex or race, lobbied for its passage in the Legislature and persuaded the 
governor to sign it. Until that time, only white men could practice law in the 
state. When the state-run Hastings Law School in San Francisco refused them 
admission, she and Gordon sued and won the right for women to attend. She was 
posthumously awarded a law degree from Hastings in 1991. In addition to a 
successful law practice in Los Angeles and other cities, she was co-founder and 
editor of the Daily Bee, a short-lived newspaper in San Diego in the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
 * MARY EMILY FOY, 1862 -- 1962 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman director of the Los Angeles library, Foy also pursued a career 
in education as a teacher and principal. She was a leader in the women's 
suffrage movement and a delegate to the 1920 Democratic presidential 
convention. She was a member of the Friday Morning Club, a politically and 
socially active group of women, whose members founded the first public 
kindergartens in California, juvenile courts and a "protective league" for 
abused children. Her longtime residence, a stately Victorian originally at 7th 
and Figueroa Streets, was designated a historic structure and moved to Angelino 
Heights in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * JESSIE BENTON FREMONT, 1824 -- 1902 
</P>
<P>
 A trailblazer in her own right, Jessie Fremont was the wife of explorer John 
C. Fremont. Based in St. Louis, she not only served as secretary for her 
husband's 1843 expedition to the West, but was instrumental in overcoming 
bureaucratic snags that might have aborted it. She wrote about her husband's 
travels, turning his dry reports into exciting tales that captured the 
imagination of the nation. She shared an adventurous life with Fremont through 
such events as the discovery of gold in California, his terms as governor and 
U.S. senator, and his unsuccessful presidential campaign. Her writing supported 
the couple in their later years. 
</P>
<P>
 * BIDDY MASON, 1818 -- 1891 
</P>
<P>
 Mason was born a slave in 1818, came West with her owner in 1848, and in 
California in 1856, successfully sued in court for her freedom. Earnings from 
her work as a nurse and midwife enabled her to buy property, including a parcel 
between Spring Street and Broadway for $250 that is now part of a $24-million 
complex that contains a park in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
 A legend in her day who became a wealthy philanthropist, she helped found Los 
Angeles' First African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first elementary school 
for black children, a disaster center for residents left homeless by flooding, 
an orphanage and a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 * EULALIA PEREZ DE GUILLEN, 1768 -- 1878 
</P>
<P>
 As the original llavera , or keeper of the keys, at the San Gabriel Mission, 
Perez de Guillen was responsible for the mission's storehouses and money room 
during the height of its role as a center of commerce. She managed many of the 
manufacturing and industrial activities of the mission and oversaw the 
activities of many of the Indian women there. She was also a highly regarded 
nurse and midwife. As compensation for her long service to the church, Perez de 
Guillen was deeded Rancho San Pasqual, 3 1/2 square leagues of land (about 
15,400 acres), which included the original site of the city of Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 * HARRIET RUSSELL STRONG, 1844 -- 1926 
</P>
<P>
 Widowed in 1883, Strong decided to farm Rancho del Fuerte, 220 acres near 
Whittier that she and her husband had purchased from Gov. Pio Pico. There she 
hosted such early suffragists as Susan B. Anthony and Anna Shaw. Strong was 
among the first to plant citrus, walnuts, pampas grass and fig trees -- crops 
that became a mainstay for the area's agriculture. The marketing of her crops 
led to success in business and admittance as the first woman member of the Los 
Angeles Chamber of Commerce. She was awarded patents for her canal and 
reservoir systems, and her proposals were used in the development of the 
Colorado River water project. -- NONA YATES

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; POST-RIOT 
MEASURES TO AID WOMEN PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charging that rebuilding efforts since the 1992 Los Angeles riots have failed 
to focus sufficiently on women's concerns, a coalition of women's organizations 
issued a series of recommendations Tuesday including calls for expanded funding 
for child care and women's entrepreneurial efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cycle of poverty is not broken in neglected neighborhoods where 
female-led families live in desperate circumstances, additional riots are 
inevitable, said Abby J. Leibman, who helped prepare the study for the Women's 
Coalition, an organization of more than 70 community groups drawn together 
after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the coalition held four public hearings at which more than 150 Los 
Angeles women testified about the impact on women of the riots and rebuilding 
efforts. The recommendations, gleaned from the hearings, also include calls for 
better street lighting, safer buses, fewer liquor stores and more affordable 
housing for single mothers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; WILSON 
SIGNS BILL CLEARING WAY FOR JAZZ INSTITUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a bill permitting the creation of an 
institute for the preservation of jazz at Cal State Long Beach. The legislation 
clears the way to begin raising private funds for the institute, but forbids 
using public money, except that earmarked for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Wilson's action was music to the ears of Assemblyman Willard H. Murray 
Jr. (D-Paramount). Murray, a jazz aficionado, authored the legislation and has 
lobbied several years for the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," Murray said Tuesday. "It's the culmination of a long 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had vetoed earlier versions of the bill, citing concerns that the 
institute might become a drain on public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute would house an archive of jazz music and artifacts related to 
the music and jazz artists, Murray said. It also would develop curriculum for 
training music teachers and music students about jazz. In addition, Murray 
foresees the institute sponsoring jazz performances and symposiums.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SUPERVISORS AGAIN ACT TO WITHHOLD FUNDS FROM D.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to give the 
district attorney the right to accept a special grant, but not to actually 
spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time in a month that the district attorney has been left 
dangling by a procedural quirk.The board only needs a simple majority of three 
votes to accept special grants from state, federal or private sources, but 
needs four votes to appropriate the funds for expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has been in a feud with the board over his budget, 
and has said he will not accept special funds for programs on real estate and 
welfare fraud if he cannot have the right to use the money to hire additional 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Gloria Molina said the district attorney is already over budget 
and should accept the funds but not hire any additional investigators or 
attorneys until he balances his books. As a result of Tuesday's vote, the 
district attorney could lose $1.7 million in funding for a task force on food 
stamp fraud.

BOARD CONSIDERS OUSTER OF MANAGER; COUNTY: SUPERVISORS REACT TO CHARGES OF 
MISMANAGEMENT IN A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM. PANEL OF 
BUSINESS LEADERS HAS URGED THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an unusual move, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is considering 
dismissal of a senior department head over alleged mismanagement of a 
multimillion-dollar job training program. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina on Tuesday asked the board in closed session to 
consider the dismissal of Community and Senior Citizens Services Department 
Director Robert G. Medina, officials said. Her appeal came as the board weighed 
a request by a panel of private business that a large, federally funded job 
training program be pulled out of Medina's department. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Private Industry Council, a group of business officials who 
jointly manage the jobs program with the county, are unhappy with Medina's 
performance and claim that he has siphoned off too much money for 
administrative and other overhead expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 PIC Chairman Arthur Hirshberg, armed with a critical study by the consulting 
firm of Coopers & Lybrand, alleged that the county bureaucrats are incompetent 
spendthrifts interested only in protecting their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials, including the chief administrative officer and the 
auditor/controller, who have investigated the feud, chalk up the PIC's 
criticism to personality differences. They are recommending that Medina's 
department be given even greater control over the PIC and the millions of 
dollars in the Jobs Training Partnership Act program. The program disburses 
federal funds to private firms that agree to hire and train disadvantaged 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-member PIC board voted overwhelmingly last fall to ask the Board of 
Supervisors to shift the program from Medina's department to a more appropriate 
county agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirshberg said that the funds could be better spent on actual job training 
than on an expensive administrative apparatus. According to the Coopers & 
Lybrand study conducted last fall, administrative and overhead charges to the 
job training program tripled in the past year, to a total of $6.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The county does not dispute those figures. In fact, the county's 
auditor-controller and chief administrative officer said the department should 
be applauded for aggressively recovering county expenses from the federal 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina could not be reached Tuesday. But in an earlier written response to the 
Coopers & Lybrand report, he noted that state and federal officials have 
approved all of the administrative charges. The auditor-controller and chief 
administrative officer agreed that all of the charges are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a majority of the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday said that they are in 
favor of moving the job training program out of Medina's department. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina and Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Michael Antonovich all said 
they favor moving the program, though details still must be worked out. 
Supervisor Ed Edelman said he was undecided on the matter and Supervisor Deane 
Dana said he supports the administrative officer's recommendation that the 
program remain under Medina's control. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter comes back to the board for a vote next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Also left unresolved at Tuesday's meeting was the status of Medina. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina, who like other supervisors would not discuss details of the 
closed-door meeting, said, "I don't think he's been an effective department 
head," adding, "I'm very concerned with the JTPA program." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said the issues of the movement of program and Medina's status will 
probably have to be resolved all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina, 69, has been an employee of the county for 39 years. He began with the 
Probation Department in 1955, and was named director of the county Department 
of Senior Citizens Affairs in 1971. He was made director of the consolidated 
Department of Community and Senior Citizens Services in 1984.

WOMEN MISTREATED IN LAPD, OFFICIAL TESTIFIES 
</P>

<P>
 After nine months of representing two female officers in a harassment case, 
Sgt. Joseph Peyton spoke grimly Tuesday night of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's treatment of women. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before a City Council committee, Peyton described command 
officers who hold archaic views of women, biased Internal Affairs 
investigations and female officers ostracized for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "By any measure, the working conditions which presently exist for women on the 
Los Angeles Police Department are unacceptable and the behavior of some of our 
officers is disgraceful," said Peyton, a 16-year veteran of the department 
currently assigned as a career counselor. "The city and department are on a 
collision course with notions of fairness, due process and respect for our 
fellow employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes toward women have improved at upper management levels, Peyton said, 
but "the abuse continues and is at the very core of certain people's beliefs in 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are command staff members that must also be held accountable for their 
lack of leadership and tremendous resolve to ignore and tolerate the injustice 
against women" said Peyton, who testified that he was prompted to come forward 
because of his recent experiences representing the two female officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular case alone will reveal some of the most extraordinary abuse 
of power ever documented in the history of the LAPD," Peyton said. "There was 
an attempt to cover up the truth and destroy the reputations of my officers and 
a clerk typist who recently returned after nine months of stress leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyton made his comments at the second of two hearings called by the City 
Council Personnel Committee to examine issues of sexual harassment within the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Also testifying were two female officers, one of whom complained bitterly of 
the unwillingness of a department official to help when she sought aid in 
dealing with a biased supervisor. The other woman told the committee that she 
had been raped by another officer and then subjected to humiliating treatment 
when she reported the incident.  
</P>
<P>
 "From the minute I reported the crime, I faced unfathomable treatment by the 
department and its investigators," said the woman, whose alleged assailant was 
found not guilty by a department Board of Rights and remains on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting back tears, the female officer said department investigators probed 
her private life and sexual history in a way that never would have been 
permitted in a criminally prosecuted rape case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt completely discarded by the department," said the woman, who has filed 
a lawsuit against the LAPD. "I feel my career has ended at the age of 27." 
</P>
<P>
 "Please listen," she told council members. "I hope that you don't sell your 
women short." 
</P>
<P>
 (The Times is not identifying the woman because of the newspaper's policy of 
not naming the alleged victims of sexual assault.) 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Susan Willis said that after she refused to falsify a document for a 
supervisor, he constantly found fault with her work and favored the men in her 
office. When she went to the department women's coordinator -- whose job it is 
to assist female employees -- the coordinator did nothing, Willis testified.

CITY TO PAY $1.2 MILLION TO SETTLE POLICE, FIRE DEPT. CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday agreed to pay nearly $1.2 million to 
settle three lawsuits that helped change procedures in the Police and Fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest payment, of $730,000, will be made to the mother of a teen-age 
girl who was killed after police failed to adequately warn her of threats made 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetria Wallace, 19, was shot to death less than a week before she was to 
testify in 1983 against the accused killer of a taxi driver. Although the 
teen-ager's mother had received a threatening phone call, an appellate court 
found that Los Angeles Police Detective Don Richards had left the family with 
the impression there was no immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wallace case and a similar lawsuit led the Police Department to issue a 
bulletin last year advising officers to properly warn witnesses of potential 
threats to their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council agreed to pay $333,000 to the parents of a 
Cheviot Hills man who died after paramedics tied his wrists and ankles behind 
him with a leather strap. The paramedics said they resorted to the restraints 
because they could not control the man, who reportedly was suffering violent 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Fire Department now orders that such patients be restrained by 
a police officer, who must also ride along in the ambulance to monitor the 
patient. The policy also requires that restrained patients be placed on their 
sides to help keep their airways clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the council voted to pay $117,000 to the lawyer who represented the 
family of a man who died in a Police Department chokehold in 1982. The payment 
was in addition to $1.2 million paid by the city to the relatives of James T. 
Mincey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Mincey was the last of several people to die before the LAPD banned neck 
restraint holds in 1982.

CONTRACTOR'S WORK INSIDE HOSPITAL SUSPENDED FOR ASBESTOS INQUIRY; SAFETY: 
QUAKE-DAMAGED WALLS AT ST. JOHNS THAT CONTAIN THE SUBSTANCE WERE DEMOLISHED. 
THE FIRM HAS NO LICENSE TO HANDLE THE CARCINOGEN BUT DENIES WRONGDOING.

 A contractor renovating St. Johns Hospital in Santa Monica may have improperly 
removed asbestos from the quake-damaged facility and has been ordered to 
suspend all interior demolition work pending an investigation, a regional air 
quality official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Atwood, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
said the Long Beach-based contractor, Dillingham Construction N.A. Inc., tore 
down stucco walls in the hospital's main and south wings that contained 
asbestos. The company is not licensed by the state to remove the cancer-causing 
material, which is used for insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if they did anything wrong yet, but what we're investigating is 
that they did demolish a number of interior walls" that contained asbestos, 
Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Johns, one of the leading health care facilities in the nation and the 
largest employer in Santa Monica, has been closed to inpatient care due to 
severe damage sustained in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the most immediate health threat of any asbestos contamination 
appears to be to construction workers. Several of them, speaking on the 
condition that they not be named, expressed anger at being unwittingly exposed 
to the life-threatening substance without proper protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've breathed tons of this crap," one said. "I've got the stuff dripping on 
me all day long. I'm scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman Chan, project manager for Dillingham, denied any wrongdoing, contending 
that the workers are instructed to leave asbestos trouble spots to a company 
that specializes in its removal. "We do the proper procedure that we're 
supposed to," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the air quality agency took samples of walls demolished by 
Dillingham crews and found they contained more than 1% asbestos, the legal 
definition of asbestos-containing material. The agency's investigation will 
focus on whether Dillingham failed to take standard precautions or if company 
officials had good reason to believe the walls were free of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has until Thursday to submit requested documents to the air 
quality agency. It was uncertain how long the investigation might take. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Division of Occupational Safety and Health also is investigating the 
matter after receiving several anonymous complaints. An official there declined 
to comment on the status of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey conducted for the hospital in 1986 showed a network of 
asbestos-covered pipes running behind many interior walls, Atwood said, but the 
walls themselves were never checked for asbestos content. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials were unavailable for comment yesterday, a St. Johns 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The air quality agency also is investigating the performance of a licensed 
asbestos removal company, Abatec Inc. The Mission Viejo firm has been working 
in the hospital's north wing, which has been deemed beyond repair and is 
scheduled to be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Atwood, an agency inspector spotted 75 to 100 bags of wall debris 
that had not been wetted down to keep asbestos fibers from escaping into the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector also noted that Abatec was not using an approved "hand-glove" 
removal technique that protects against air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Abatec spokesman Dennis Hanna suggested that the inspector wrongly concluded 
that workers were removing asbestos improperly when, in fact, they were merely 
knocking down walls to gain access to asbestos-covered pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the bags of debris, he said, "All of our bags are wetted and sealed at 
the end of the shift."

COUNTY ORDERED TO TIGHTEN RULES FOR VOTER REGISTRATION; ELECTIONS: ACTION IS 
TAKEN AFTER REPORTS THAT ACCUSED ASSASSIN MARIO ABURTO HAD RECEIVED CARDS TWICE 
IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stunned at reports that accused Mexican assassin Mario Aburto had registered 
twice to vote in Los Angeles County, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday 
ordered county staffers to find ways to prevent such a thing from happening 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sharp reaction to news accounts that Aburto had lived on both sides of 
the border and had registered to vote here, the board demanded an accounting 
from county Registrar-Recorder Beatriz Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez confirmed that in 1990, Aburto, 23, had picked up a voter registration 
card at a San Pedro post office, filled it out, affiliated himself as a 
Democrat, and mailed it in. A glitch in the way he had signed his name forced 
the county to mail him a new card so he could re-register, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An affidavit on the form asks the signer to swear under penalty of perjury 
that they are, among other things, a U.S. citizen. Aburto signed the affidavit 
using his Mexican appellation, Mario Aburto Martinez, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
 When 1992 arrived and he had not voted, the county mailed a routine card to 
his address in an attempt to update voter rolls, she said. The card was 
returned, indicating he had moved, and a blank voter registration form was sent 
to the address to remind the new resident to re-register. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez said it is unclear whether Aburto used that blank card or another that 
may have landed in the mailbox of his new address, but in any case, he 
registered again in 1993. This time, she said, he used the Americanized version 
of his name, Mario Aburto, and conscientiously noted on the form that he had 
registered before as Mario Aburto Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 That registration was processed, Valdez said, but when a new voter 
registration card was mailed to Aburto's address, it was returned to the 
county. Following the county's policy, Aburto's registration was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's friends and relatives said this week that his decision to register in 
1990 and again in 1993 was based more on a desire to become a legal U.S. 
resident than any fervent interest in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He believed that being on the voter rolls would assist him in obtaining papers 
to remain in the United States and work legally, his relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought that would help him become a citizen," said Ruben Aburto, the 
accused assassin's father, who lives in San Pedro. "He wasn't interested in 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez confirmed that according to county records, the man accused of killing 
Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio last week had never voted 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she added, such fraudulent registrations are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here for 37 years," she said, "and (in that time), we have had less 
than a dozen incidents in which a non-citizen has registered." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez said that accusations are constantly being made, but evidence of 
non-citizens registering to vote is rarely produced. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a perception that a lot of non-citizens are out there voting, and we 
get a lot of calls alleging that," she said. "But when we ask for names, no one 
can ever provide them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, in a written motion, Supervisor Deane Dana expressed concern 
about "the possibility of such illegally registered voters casting ballots and 
influencing the outcome of American elections." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana also noted that "status as a registered voter can be used by those in the 
country illegally as a form of identification, indicating citizenship which 
would allow the the use of public services . . . to which they are not 
entitled." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana instructed Valdez and her staff to find ways to prevent such fraud. But 
Valdez said the assignment could be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter registration forms, she noted, are based on an honors system, and, 
beyond the address of the applicant, very little of the information on them is 
double-checked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New voter registration forms, due out next month, should help, she said. The 
forms ask the applicant whether they are citizens, and then instruct them not 
to finish the questionnaire if they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, Valdez said, state laws would have to be changed, and more 
extensive verification would interfere with the ability of voters to register 
by mail, an option they have had since 1976.

GARAGE WITH HIGHER SEISMIC STANDARDS OKD; CONTRACTS: FIRM SAYS IT WILL ABSORB 
THE INCREASED COST FOR CONSTRUCTION OF COUNTY-USC STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY IS THE 
SAME ONE THAT BUILT THE CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE PARKING LOT THAT COLLAPSED IN THE 
QUAKE.

 In one of the first projects of its kind since the Northridge earthquake, the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday awarded the first phase of a 
$19-million contract for a high-rise parking garage that officials say will be 
strengthened from lessons learned in the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning bidder, A. T. Curd Constructors, is the firm that built the Cal 
State Northridge parking facility that crumbled during the Jan. 17 quake. But 
company and county officials say the new project will be significantly 
different from the university facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't in good conscience build them like we used to, knowing what we have 
learned in the Northridge earthquake," said company President Andrew Curd. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which will oversee construction of a seven-level, 3,000-car 
capacity garage at County-USC Medical Center, was the lowest of four bidders on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Stewart, director of the county's Internal Services Department, which 
oversees awarding of construction contracts, said all four bidders had been 
involved to some degree in projects that suffered damage in the Northridge 
temblor, although some firms disputed that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Curd said that after the Northridge quake, his engineers have redesigned the 
county project to improve the flexibility of columns and strengthen walls, two 
lessons learned from the collapse of the Cal State Northridge garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are significant differences from any (garage) we've done in the past," 
Curd said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cal State Northridge garage, square supporting columns gave way because 
they were too brittle to hold up under the pounding and swaying brought on by 
the earthquake, engineers found. 
</P>
<P>
 Curd said the columns to be used at the County-USC garage will be of an 
octagonal shape and with significantly greater steel reinforcement. Curd said 
engineers estimate that the new design will enable the structure to withstand 
four to five times more movement than the old design. The new garage will also 
have reinforcing shear walls to give the structure greater strength, Curd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the changes are not required under the building code, Curd said they 
are being integrated into the project at his company's expense, which he 
estimated to be several hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said that to ensure that the garage will have the latest improvements 
and design innovations, the plans will be submitted to two independent peer 
review committees. The design reviews will also be coordinated with the state's 
safety design experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the best studied parking structure in the history of the western 
United States," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, officials for the state university system adopted changes in 
construction policies that require the same design improvements being included 
in the County-USC project.

VALLEY COMPANIES HIT IN RASH OF ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least two dozen small businesses in the San Fernando Valley and nearby 
areas have been robbed at gunpoint since the beginning of February, and police 
believe the robberies are the work of one man. 
</P>
<P>
 So far no one has been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously more sophisticated and more clever than most because of the 
type of businesses he's picking and he makes his getaway without anyone seeing 
him," said Detective Rick Jamieson of the Los Angeles Police Department's North 
Hollywood Division, where nine of the holdups occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the robber as a white male between 30 and 35 with short, 
sandy blond hair, which he covered by wearing baseball caps of various colors. 
He is about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs about 175 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the robberies occurred along the commercial strip of Ventura 
Boulevard.

FAMILY GETS BODY OF WOMAN IN FUMES CASE; MYSTERY: OFFICIALS STILL HAVE NO 
EXPLANATION FOR WHY HOSPITAL PERSONNEL WERE SICKENED WHILE TREATING THE 
PATIENT.

<P>
 The Riverside County coroner's office said Tuesday it has released the body of 
Gloria Ramirez, who died in an emergency room after mysterious fumes sickened 
medical workers and led to the facility's evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office said Ramirez's family could claim the body, but would 
have to keep it sealed in a casket until burial. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 19, six emergency room workers were sickened or collapsed at Riverside 
General Hospital while treating Ramirez, a cancer patient. A doctor was 
hospitalized for nearly three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they had smelled an ammonia scent coming from Ramirez's body. She 
died of a heart attack as hospital workers tried to help her and their downed 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroners' officials have not released autopsy results. They expect to finish 
the inquiry in about a month.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS SKID ON RATE WORRIES; DOW OFF 63.33 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks tumbled for a fourth straight day Tuesday as interest rates reached 
12-month highs, and as new economic data suggested more pressure on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 63.33 points or 1.7% to 3,699.02, 
bringing its decline since March 18 to nearly 200 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow now is 7% below its all-time high of 3,978.36 reached on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds soared to 7.06% from 
Monday's 6.97% close. Tuesday's yield was the highest since last April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates took another sharp upward turn after the Conference Board said 
Tuesday that its March consumer confidence index climbed to 86.7, the highest 
reading in more than 3 1/2 years and higher than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors fear that the economy's robust growth -- and consumers' willingness 
to spend money -- will lead to higher inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve 
Board to tighten credit again. The Fed has already raised short-term interest 
rates from 3% to 3.5% this year in two separate moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bond market is certainly suggesting" that the Fed may act again, said 
Joseph DeMarco, managing director for equity trading at HSBC Asset Management, 
a unit of Hongkong & Shanghai Bank with assets of $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the stock market, investors are bailing out on worries about 
higher interest rates, and on fears that the ultimate outcome of higher rates 
will be another recession -- even though most economists believe those concerns 
are overblown. Chemical, financial, utility, and auto stocks were among the 
day's biggest losers. 
</P>
<P>
 As was the case on Monday, smaller stocks -- the market's recent leaders -- 
plunged even more than blue chips. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller 
issues sank 17.21 points, or 2.2%, to 755.29. 
</P>
<P>
 While trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was active at 302 million 
shares, it didn't suggest panic selling. Still, traders noted that winners 
swamped losers by 20 to 3 on the NYSE and by 20 to 7 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's decline past the 50-point-loss level triggered the NYSE's "uptick 
rule," designed to curb computer-driven trading. But that rule does not halt 
individual stock sales, and the rush of selling accelerated late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the stock market is concerned, "the tide is going down and all the 
boats are going down," said Tom McManus, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley & 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The small number of rising stocks relative to the number declining "is giving 
a significant warning that further declines may be in store," McManus said. 
</P>
<P>
 One obstacle the stock market faces is the "big change in liquidity that's 
occurred" since early February, McManus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, the Fed was pumping liquidity into the system. They're now saying 
this fragile economic recovery is strong enough for us to start draining some 
liquidity out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although stocks aren't necessarily too expensive relative to earnings, the 
outlook may remain dim "until stocks find another source of liquidity," McManus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were convinced that stocks will continue to fall unless interest rates 
stop rising, said Jeffrey Malet, chief investment officer of Pacific Century 
Advisers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market is a slave to interest rates, and rates are moving in the 
wrong direction," Malet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues leading the market lower included Caterpillar, down 3 1/8 
to 110 7/8; GM, off 1 3/8 to 56; 3M, down 1 5/8 to 98 3/8; and Dupont, down 2 
3/8 to 54 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology issues also tumbled. Microsoft shed 3 7/8 to 82 1/2, Lotus 
dropped 3 1/4 to 70, Intel slumped 2 3/8 to 66 1/4 and Newbridge Networks gave 
up 3 1/4 to 56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many financial stocks dropped as interest rates surged. Wells Fargo lost 5 
to 142 1/2, Chase Manhattan fell 3/4 to 32 1/2, Travelers tumbled 1 3/8 to 34 
7/8 and Morgan Stanley was off 1 3/8 to 65 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among formerly high-flying young growth stocks, book retailer Barnes & Noble 
fell 1 3/8 to 24 1/2, fast-food chain Boston Chicken dropped 1 7/8 to 41 1/8 
and Hollywood Park tumbled 2 5/8 to 19 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei index closed down 232.05 points at 19,709.74. 
Frankfurt's DAX index ended at 2,168.35, up 6.93 points. In London, the 
FTSE-100 index eased 6.1 points to 3,123.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rallied, adding 283.11 points to 9,480.14. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mexico City's Bolsa index gained 11.44 points to 2,457.59. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold failed to respond to new inflation worries. Near-term futures fell on 
the New York Comex to $386.00 an ounce, off $2 an ounce silver closed at $5.64, 
off 3.7 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil futures rebounded on the New York Merc as bargain hunters followed 
perceptions that the market had overreacted Monday, when prices plunged on news 
that OPEC couldn't agree on new production cuts. Light, sweet crude oil for May 
delivery ended 24 cents higher at $14.32 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traders pushed the dollar down sharply against Japan's yen, registering 
their disappointment over a Japanese plan to cut its trade deficit. The dollar 
fell to 103.10 yen in New York from 104.05 Monday.

<P>
 * Position: Marketing director 
</P>

 * Company: Mascot Metropolitan, Inc., South San Francisco  
</P>
<P>
 Jill Orcutt, whose company manufactures Tutto luggage, offers these 
packing-related tips to help travelers get organized, economize on space and 
arrive with packables intact and rack fresh:  
</P>
<P>
 * Wardrobe. Plan clothing combinations that allow you to mix and match various 
pieces. If traveling light is a goal, pack neutral colors and mostly solid 
patterns while avoiding ensembles where pieces can't be worn with other 
combinations. Pack shoes around the perimeter of the bag, with underwear, sleep 
wear, sweaters, shirts and ties in the center and suites and dresses on the 
top. Other items can be tucked where space permits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Suits. To assure wrinkle-free suits, position pants' waists against the 
shorter side of the case, lengthwise, with the legs hanging out; alternate 
direction with each ensuing pair of pants. Next, stack jackets and place atop 
pants with shoulders against the back side of the case and bottoms of jackets 
hanging out the front. Make sure the sleeves are smooth and lying flat. Fold 
all the pant legs over the jackets, then fold all the sleeves over the pant 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dresses. Dresses can be packed in much the same manner as described for 
suits. Alternatively, stack dresses, five or less per stack, and fold all the 
sleeves over the front of the top dress. After smoothing the sleeves, roll the 
stack from shoulder to hem. This method works especially well for soft sided 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
 * Potpourri. Always make sure bags are tightly packed to avoid shifting and 
potential wrinkling. To avoid taking space with bulky clothing items, wear them 
rather than packing them. Place little items, such as travel alarm clocks or an 
extra pair of glasses, inside packed shoes. And never, never pack tickets, 
passport, jewelry, medication and other important possessions in your checked 
baggage. Carry them with you at all times. Many smart travelers even pack one 
change of clothes in their carry-on bag, just in case checked luggage is 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make a list. To avoid forgetting an essential item, write down all the 
things you want to pack and check them off your list as they go into your 
suitcase or as they are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call ahead. Always check with the hotel or friends you'll be staying with to 
see what items can be provided for you. Most hotels today offer complimentary 
toiletries and many provide bath robes and hair dryers for guest use. Also 
check on laundry service and irons and what equipment and business services are 
available.

 The market managed to ignore the steep downdraft in U.S. stocks, as the Bolsa 
inched up 11.44 points to 2,457.59 on Tuesday. But a bigger rally early in the 
day -- on news that former Education Minister Ernesto Zedillo will succeed the 
slain Luis Donaldo Colosio as the ruling party's presidential candidate -- 
faded toward the market close. * The appointment of Zedillo, 42, had been 
expected; investors believe that he will continue the free-market economic 
policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. But it isn't clear that the 
beaten-up Bolsa can mount much of a rally soon, simply based on Zedillo's 
candidacy. The Bolsa Index Tuesday closes: 2,457.59

THEATER REVIEWS; CURSES! 'OP'RY HOUSE' MELODRAMA FOILED BY EAGERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Kelly is said to be America's most-published playwright. He is also its 
most generic, his specialty being transferring public-domain classics into 
dramatic form. In "No Opera at the Op'ry House Tonight," he tackles that 
venerable perennial, the old-fashioned mellerdrammer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camino Real Playhouse decided to tackle it too, but under Tom Scott's 
unstructured direction, it never quite gets back up on its feet again. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's mistake is a common one, forgetting that comedy is only funny when 
it's done seriously, especially in this genre. There is a good deal of 
satirical humor in Kelly's writing, but it is all but obscured by the reckless, 
juvenile comic abandon Scott has allowed on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is simple and typical. A dashing young French count (known in America 
as Billy Bright), who wants to write operas, and his sister (known in America 
as Betty Bright) are living in poverty in Old San Juan Capistrano. (The play 
has been localized for extra yuks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly there appears at the Camino Real Op'ry House the famous Salami Opera 
Company, guided by aging diva Madame Violetta, lead by her lovely prima donna 
ward Alma Pumpernickel. Voila ! What an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 But beware, Alma is being pursued by villain Wolfgang Von Wolfpack and his 
henchperson, Lily Liverspot, who have learned that before Alma's father was 
lost in an avalanche of ice and snow, he had discovered gold mines that will 
make Alma rich. Greedy Wolfgang must marry her and rake in the fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual mistaken identities, mismatches and mis-marriages take place, and 
the usual happy ending is brought about at the very last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 A cute idea. But not cute enough for this company. 
</P>
<P>
 A few cast members survive by virtue of fairly straightforward readings and 
sort-of-honest characterizations. Spencer McGurk is a stalwart hero -- 
fortunately without a French accent -- attractive and sincere, with just enough 
sensitivity to explain his devotion to music and, incidentally, to Alma. 
Michelle Ehlen is charming as Alma, also attractive and sincere. They both get 
their laughs without clowning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Snooks also comes out well as the opera's basso profundo, Claude Hopper. 
Although his farmer's garb is silly, his four or five studied comic expressions 
are effective and funny. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the cast is as silly as Claude's bib overalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy Ball's Madame Violetta screeches annoyingly and at such a slow tempo 
that she looks as though she's playing Medea on Quaaludes. Terrence D. Baxter 
and Bev Brezden-Toney as the villains, for some unaccountable and unnecessary 
reason, have become Boris and Natasha down to the accents, which obliterate 
many of their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 And oddly, though her brother doesn't have an accent, Betty Bright (Joanne 
Bouck) does, which is supposed to be French but suggests that she spent a good 
part of her life in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Played straight this "Op'ry" might work, but even then it isn't helped by 
David A. Lewis' original ballads that are listenable and entertaining but 
anachronistic and out of sync with the style. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; A LITTLE 'NIGHT' MAGIC DOESN'T DO THE TRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music" seems an odd choice for the premiere 
production of the new Musical Theatre Company, currently at the Gem Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't an easy piece of musical theater, full as it is of potholes for the 
unwary. The fact, according to a program note, that it's a longtime favorite of 
producer-director George Quick, and that the role of Desiree Armfeldt is a 
favorite of lead Beth Hansen, isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, based on Ingmar Bergman's film "Smiles of a Summer Night," is a 
tangled web of loves lost and found, romances lasting and brief and, probably 
most important, finding one's place in the world's oldest game. 
</P>
<P>
 What Quick has not found in his sluggish staging is the magic. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is Sweden at the turn of the century, seen through an antique 
mirror, the passions as fervent as the twirling skirts, the humor as sly as a 
winking star. There is an aura in the air, a zephyr of perfume, the faraway 
ripple of a young woman's laughter, the clop of horses' hoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a few exceptions, everything here is dishearteningly down-to-earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some very good performances have not been brought into this special and 
individual world. Doug Carfrae's Fredrik Egerman, the aging lawyer married to a 
teen-age bride but still dreaming of Desiree, is a solid, thoughtful and 
interesting performance, and he has the firmest grasp of the special quality of 
Sondheim's songs.  
</P>
<P>
 Fredrika, Desiree's daughter, is played by Kate Staiger with a marvelous 
control and humor, wise beyond her years yet young enough to be amused by it 
all. Jo Black-Jacob is a fine, starchy grandmother, Madame Armfeldt, 
reminiscences swirling around her heart like summer breezes. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Rain Anderson as the young wife is a delight, giddy and pretty and 
proud. Petra, the servant who tries to educate Egerman's seminarian son, 
Henrik, in the ways of love, is given the slightly ribald but ultimately gentle 
shading the role deserves by Karen Angela. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the libidinously backward, fervently moralistic Henrik, Chris D. Thomas is 
a bit too rigid for the humor usually found in the role but has a fine 
underlying sense of the rake he wants to be. And Patti McClure's bitchy 
Countess couldn't be more right. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that the world Quick has given them to live in is not in focus. Nor 
is his Desiree. The character is supposed to be the premiere serious actress in 
the Sweden of her day -- grand, elegant and romantic. But Hansen doesn't give 
her Desiree the authority, the sweeping personality or the stature she 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 This Desiree is no more than a music-hall trouper. If her rendition of the 
heart-wrenching "Send in the Clowns" brings a tear to the eye, it is, after 
all, a win-win number. And Egerman's Act II paean to his rediscovery of Desiree 
contains some unfortunate lyrics that may cause a slight giggle in the 
audience.

 There is one odd piece of casting: Mark Wickham as the egocentric, 
pseudo-macho, unconsciously comic Count Carl-Magnus. Vocally, he seems 
uncomfortable in his efforts, and although he is referred to as a tin soldier, 
he needn't walk like one, nor overact so blatantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever is left of the Bergman/Sondheim magic he erases, as does Susan 
Errickson's choreography.  
</P>
<P>
 "Clowns" retains its legerdemain, as does the Countess' and Anne's "Every Day 
a Little Death" and, gratefully, Karen Angela's spirited, randy "The Miller's 
Son," which Petra sings lovingly to Madame's butler Frid (Jared Slater). 
</P>
<P>
 But these few moments do not transform a very long evening.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; COLLIN RAYE COVERS COUNTRY THAT'S ROCKY; INFLUENCES ARE 
EVIDENT IN HIS VOICE AND MOVES, HIS PLAY LIST AND THE DISTORTED GUITAR AND 
SOUND OF THE BAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Collin Raye may have missed his chance to have been on the hit "Common Thread" 
album of Eagles covers, but his early show at the Crazy Horse Steak House 
Monday (his first of four performances that night and Tuesday) showed that he's 
primed for most other rockin' '70s oldies eventualities. 
</P>
<P>
 When country guys line up for their loving and lucrative tributes to Bob 
Seger, Elton John and the inevitable "Boss on a Hoss" Springsteen collection, 
Raye's got the tunes, including a note-perfect rendition of "Don't Let the Sun 
Go Down on Me" and a deafening "Katmandu." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back when I gave a darn I might have groused, "What does any of this have to 
do with country music?" But what the hey, it's a lot more endurable -- and 
honest -- for someone to retread an unaspiring rock song he actually likes than 
it is to have him flaunt his "country roots" by driving more synthesizer stakes 
into the oft-punctured hearts of "Jambalaya" and "Rocky Top." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, when we're talking about the modern mega-buck country, oldies rock is 
the root. Who are these posing, primping Billy Rays and Travis Tritts if not 
the Tabs, Troys and Fabians of their time, singing tunes that are direct 
descendants of "Chevy Van" and "Your Mama Don't Dance"? And like the old 
rockers who now work the oldies circuit, the new country guys can just coast 
along, never daring anything original or immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 When Raye sings, it's with just a controlled touch of a twang in a voice that 
obviously holds Seger, Don Henley and other rockers as its influences. Raye's 
stage moves are from rock, as is the distorto-guitar and synthed-up sound of 
his band. And where those pesky old country stars can give uneven performances 
at times -- just like they're real human beings or something -- Raye is similar 
to most of his contemporaries in delivering a show so paced and pristine it 
might as well be on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That said, those who enjoy a nice replay of 1974 could do a lot worse than 
Raye. His generous 80-minute show displayed a hard-working, plainly handsome 
performer who covered all the bases, from ballads to novelty tunes to full-tilt 
rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attired in faded blue jeans, blue work shirt and a brown suede vest, he hit 
the stage running with the driving "I Want You Bad (And That Ain't Good)," 
followed by the ballad "Somebody Else's Moon," which, like all but one number 
in the set, was somebody else's tune. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raye wrote the clever syllable-crowded "To the Border and Beyond," but most of 
the songs came from the Nashville assembly line, and it's hard for even the 
best singer to invest much feeling in such mass commodities as "Sadly Ever 
After" and "Every Second." 
</P>
<P>
 He was able to elevate a few songs. "That Was a River" boasted a 
brighter-than-average lyric about the magnitude of a love, and Raye brought it 
to life with a vocal that reminded a bit of the very soulful Paul Carrack (of 
Ace, Squeeze and Mike and the Mechanics fame), floating over rich vocal 
harmonies from his five-piece band. Another ballad, "Little Rock," also carried 
some feeling, even if it did start off hog-tied by a self-serving speech about 
how "risky" it is to release a song about alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's My Story" and "My Kind of Girl" were nice-enough novelty tunes. Raye 
wandered into Gary Morris territory with the mawkish "Love, Me," a song about 
grandparents' love, where it's obvious from the get-go that it's going to end 
up on a deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It bears some mention that the packed house apparently loved every second of 
Raye's show, up to and including his guitarist's encore lead-in of familiar 
heavy rock riffs from Led Zep, Deep Purple and other Nashville immortals. Raye 
closed out his show with big, blustery versions of Springsteen's mildly idiotic 
"No Retreat, No Surrender" and Seger's "Katmandu."

 COUNTERPOINT: Friends of Hillary Rodham Clinton are fighting back against her 
critics over Whitewater. Nearly 100 of them took out a full-page ad in the New 
York Times this week to show their support. Among them: Laguna Beach's Janice 
Johnson, whose husband, Roger, is General Services Administration director. . . 
. Johnson, who donated $1,000 for the ad, says: "I think it's great. I'm proud 
to support it. It puts in better words than I can how I feel about Hillary at 
this point. I thought I'd better put my money where my mouth is."

 CARING NEIGHBORS: Diana Colosio, wife of slain Mexican presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, will soon receive condolences postmarked Orange County. 
Los Amigos of Orange County, led by Latino community leaders, will send a 
letter after its weekly meeting in Anaheim today. . . . Says Los Amigos 
Chairman Amin David: "Not only do we express our sorrow for her and her kids' 
tremendous loss, but also for the loss to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 BEYOND GAMES: Willie Herron of Laguna Hills is one of five artists 
commissioned to paint murals across Los Angeles for the World Cup soccer 
tournament beginning in June. Eight games will be played in Los Angeles, and 
murals will be painted along freeways and at LAX. . . . Herron's mural, "Solo 
Unido, Un Mundo Vencera," will express the meaning of its title, which conveys, 
Herron says, "the hope that one day we can be a victorious world if all the 
races unite."

 WINDOW DRESSING? There's interest in Cypress in enforcing an old city 
ordinance that prohibits businesses from blocking more than 10% of their 
windows with ads. It's to help police protect against burglary. Problem is, 
merchants love to advertise and tend to ignore the law. . . . City Atty. John 
E. Cavanaugh got a laugh this week when he told the City Council: "We're not 
required by law to enforce our own ordinances." . . . The merchants can rest 
awhile -- the Cypress council hasn't decided what to do.

 SHAKEDOWN: The streets are quickly mending, and so are our spirits. Life after 
the quake does, indeed, go on in the Valley. But so do the aftershocks -- more 
than 6,000, in fact, since Jan. 17 (B5). The frequency, according to Caltech, 
dropped dramatically after the first day, but we are far from quaked out. . . . 
Seismologists say there's a greater than 1-in-3 chance of another magnitude 5 
in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 GETTING HELP: In the meantime, people affected by the quake are still seeking 
help from the government. Starting today, a new Earthquake Service Center will 
open in Sherman Oaks, absorbing services that had been provided at two disaster 
application centers that closed Tuesday. . . . Officials were serving about 150 
people a day at each of the two centers (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 CHINA CARD: One of the big issues facing President Clinton is whether to 
revoke China's most-favored-nation trade status because of its poor record on 
human rights. Well, one Valley scholar thinks that Clinton should keep the 
status quo. . . . "When people gain economic independence," said Shao-Ju Lee, 
director of the China Institute at Cal State Northridge, "they look for 
political freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 OVERTIME: The Japanese work ethic is legendary these days and, apparently, it 
extends to the baseball diamond as well. Shizuoka Commercial High, which 
recently visited the Valley, routinely holds six-hour practices, and its 
pitchers throw 200 pitches a day (C6). . . . But you can bet that this is one 
area where America won't try to copy Japan. "Your arm can only take so many 
throws," El Camino Real High pitcher Randy Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 TICKETS GALORE: Apparently Santa Clarita is no place to double-park. Since the 
city began processing parking violations in October, the number of tickets 
issued by sheriff's deputies has increased nearly 60%. And no one seems to know 
why (B6). Michael Arkush

WESTMINSTER QUESTIONS 4 ON OVERTIME; INVESTIGATION: OTHERS FROM THE FIRE 
DEPARTMENT WILL ALSO GO BEFORE A PANEL, WHICH IS PROBING POSSIBLE ABUSE OF SICK 
LEAVE AND VACATION TIME. FIREFIGHTERS CALL IT A WITCH HUNT BY THE CITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Four top officials of the Fire Department were questioned Tuesday about 
possible knowledge or involvement in the alleged abuse of sick leave and 
vacation time, as city officials expanded their payroll-fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews triggered charges from firefighters that the city has launched 
a politically motivated witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 A new three-member panel conducting the interviews is scheduled to question 
four more firefighters, including a battalion chief, today. The panel, which is 
conducting the probe for Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr., includes a consultant 
hired by the city and two private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overtime abuse has been going on for a number of years," said Mayor 
Charles V. Smith. "We're looking into every member of the Fire Department. I 
don't know if the interviews would be limited to the eight." 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews are part of an internal review of the Fire Department that 
began last year after an audit revealed that the city paid nearly $2 million in 
overtime to firefighters over the previous two fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is now the subject of a criminal investigation by the Orange 
County district attorney's office. But no criminal charges have been filed to 
date, 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Westminster Firefighters Local 2425, which is leading a recall 
of four of the city's five council members over cuts made in this year's Fire 
Department budget, called the questioning a "witch hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrison, a Fire Department captain, charged that City Council members 
are trying to discredit the firefighters, who succeeded this month in gathering 
enough signatures to force the city's first-ever recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is intended to divert the people's attention away from the recall," said 
Garrison, who was among the four employees questioned Tuesday. Garrison was 
suspended in January for an unrelated matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Smith and council members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and 
Tony Lam will face voters June 7. The firefighters launched the recall campaign 
last year after the City Council cut more than $1 million from the department's 
budget, eliminating one firetruck and forcing the layoff of five firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 All five council members said the cuts were necessary to balance the city's 
budget, contending that the firefighters started the recall effort because they 
do not want to lose their overtime pay. But firefighters charged that the 
budget cuts jeopardized public safety. So far, only one department employee, 
Paul Gilbrook, president of the firefighters union, has been disciplined as a 
result of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook was fired last month for allegedly driving a firetruck with a 
suspended license and using sick leave improperly. He has asked for non-binding 
arbitration to resolve his case, and has appealed to the Merit Commission, a 
city panel that reviews disciplinary actions against employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry into Gilbrook's alleged violation of city sick leave policy led to 
the wider investigation of sick leave, vacation leave, time off and holiday pay 
in the Fire Department, said City Atty. Richard Jones. Gilbrook was the only 
firefighter questioned before Tuesday, when the new panel began its work. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison said that panel members asked him Tuesday to explain more than 900 
hours of sick leave, vacation leave, time off and holiday pay since 1986. 
Garrison was suspended in January for public comments about an ongoing fire 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with eight years' worth of pay stubs, Garrison said he felt he had 
satisfied the investigating panel's concerns, but said he had only 15 days to 
prepare.

DISPLAY OF EMOTION; POWERFUL EXHIBIT AT IRVINE HIGH RECALLS HORRORS OF THE 
HOLOCAUST 
</P>

 While some students ran, laughed and finished their lunches on sunny Tuesday 
afternoon at Irvine High School, the mood inside the school's darkened theater 
was solemn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The haunting score from the film "Schindler's List" played in the background 
as students moved slowly and nearly silently through a display of photographs 
and posters describing the rise of Nazism in Germany and the genocide of 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even look at this one," said senior Jessica Hess, 18, quickly turning 
from a picture of a Jewish woman cradling her baby as a soldier points a rifle 
at them. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles is part of a 
weeklong series of events at the school titled "Celebrating Our Diversity 
Together." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the exhibit is to provide students with a jolting lesson about the 
Holocaust. It certainly had that effect on many of the 50 students who helped 
organize it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got choked up when I talked about it," said Hess, one of a group of 
students who guided visitors through the display. "My emotions get into it as 
well as the words themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 For the exhibit, students and faculty members transformed the theater into a 
dark memorial to victims of the Holocaust. The posters and photos provided by 
the Wiesenthal Center were arranged on the theater stage below a giant swastika 
illuminated by red stage lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the same as if this had been done in the daylight," said junior Rosa 
Tena, 16, another program volunteer. "It's not a normal exhibit. People take it 
more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the exhibit opened Monday, it has been visited not only by students but 
also by community residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are shocked by it. They talk about it a lot afterward," said senior 
Casey Teele, 17. "It creates a lasting impression." 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly the goal, said English teacher Eamon Kane, who designed the 
exhibit and helped bring it to Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are silenced by it, if not sobered by it," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers spent several weekends researching the Holocaust and meeting 
with a concentration camp survivor. They also visited the Wiesenthal Center to 
familiarize themselves with the often graphic images. 
</P>
<P>
 The students said that some of the exhibit photos are difficult to view, such 
as one showing parents separated from their child by a wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Anat Sharoni, 17, said that helping to organize the exhibit gave her 
new insights into the Holocaust, even though her own Jewish grandmother lived 
through the experience in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to communicate with my grandma, but she was too depressed by" the 
Holocaust, Sharoni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess, whose Jewish relatives survived the Holocaust, said: "My family never 
spoke of it. My (relatives) went to their graves without speaking about it. 
Unfortunately, I won't know about their experiences. But I have learned more 
about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will be open to the public today from 3 to 7 p.m. Irvine High 
School is at 4321 Walnut Ave.

LAGUNA ART MUSEUM DISMISSES DIRECTOR; ART: PRESIDENT SAYS 'WE'RE JUST READY FOR 
A CHANGE.' CHARLES DESMARAIS SAYS HE AND THE BOARD HAD BEEN IN DISCUSSION ABOUT 
REALIGNING HIS DUTIES, BUT THE FIRING WAS A 'COMPLETE SHOCK.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Desmarais, who boosted the stature of the Laguna Art Museum in his six 
years as its director, was dismissed Tuesday by the museum board whose 
president called for "more energy to be put in administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais said the news "came as a complete shock." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd dispute any statement that somehow I was doing exhibitions and not 
running the museum," Desmarais said. "I've never, ever set aside my 
responsibility for (any) aspect of the museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Desmarais, the museum has mounted several acclaimed exhibits, including 
a custom car show last summer that was one of the most popular in the 
institution's 75-year history. Last year the museum also received its largest 
grant ever, $1 million from the Harry and Grace Steele Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais cited other improvements in the museum's financial status during his 
tenure, including development of an endowment now totaling $1.8 million and 
grants of more than $1 million from the National Endowment for the Arts. (The 
museum's operating budget at the end of last year was about $1.4 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais nonetheless acknowledged that his relationship with the board had 
been cooling, and that the board had been talking about realigning his duties 
-- "which I was willing to do. My attorney and I expected we'd be concluding 
(that arrangement) a week ago Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead, I got a letter saying I was terminated," along with a check for a 
"substantial severance."  
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, the board said Desmarais "left his position" after he 
and the board failed to work out "differences in management philosophies." 
Board President Teri Kennady subsequently confirmed that the museum had 
exercised a contractual option to "terminate (Desmarais) without cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to specify the nature of the differences between the board and 
Desmarais, she said, "We just need more help and energy to be put in 
administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she thought he had been spending too much time curating and not 
enough administering, Kennady said no. "We're just ready for a change," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Botwinick, director of the Newport Harbor Art Museum, Orange County's 
other prominent visual arts institution, said Tuesday that he was "deeply 
surprised by the news" and that he thinks Desmarais "has done an extraordinary 
job." Exhibitions staged under Desmarais have "brought the museum great steps 
forward," Botwinick said, measuring the museum's growth as "extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 But Botwinick noted that disagreements between museum boards and their 
directors are not uncommon. "Museum directors are maybe like football coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennady said Desmarais "has been a visionary director for this museum and has 
enhanced its reputation tremendously. But this is a new time and he and the 
museum have different needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's curator of exhibitions, Susan M. Anderson, has been appointed 
acting director and a search committee has been formed to replace Desmarais, 
Kennady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the shows presented under Desmarais' guidance were last year's "Kustom 
Kulture," the car show that drew more than 17,000 visitors; the critically 
praised "Proof: Los Angeles Art and the Photograph," which Desmarais curated; 
and "I Thought California Would Be Different," a show of works, all acquired by 
the museum, by young contemporary artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these exhibits, such as "Kustom Kulture," traveled to other museums in 
the country, helping to shape an improved profile for the Laguna museum, which 
only a few years ago had a reputation for far more mainstream exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Laguna museum in 1988, Desmarais, a 44-year-old New York 
native, was director of the California Museum of Photography in Riverside for 
seven years. Before that, he was a curator at the Friends of Photography in 
Carmel, and director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Photography.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; DISTRICT REVIEWING EXPULSION PROCEDURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley School District principals may be asked to review and make 
recommendations on student expulsion cases under a proposal favored by some 
school board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current policy, the Board of Trustees conducts expulsion hearings, but 
some members said they believe an administrative panel of school principals 
would be in a better position to make decisions about a student's academic 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new proposal, the panel would conduct the expulsion hearings and 
then pass its recommendations along to the trustees for final action. The board 
discussed the issue last week, but postponed a decision on the proposal so it 
could further research the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said there has been an increase in student expulsions 
recently and attributed the rise, in part, to the trustees' "zero-tolerance" 
policy, which calls for the expulsion of students who bring any weapon, 
including knives, guns or dangerous objects, onto school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees last week called for a survey of principals to determine the 
effects of the zero-tolerance stance. The survey is scheduled to be completed 
in May. At that time, the board will reconsider the proposal to establish a 
principal review panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak said he favors the idea of forming a 
panel because principals have the educational knowledge and experience to make 
decisions that would be in the best interest of the students involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit of the panel of educators, he said, is that "a decision would be 
made that is more educationally sound for the student and the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Barbara Vogel, who was against postponing a vote on the proposal, said 
the panel approach would bring consistency to the process, especially since the 
makeup of the board changes as new trustees are elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Julie Hoxsie, who is against forming a panel, said she wants to be 
involved in the expulsion hearings because it's part of her role as a board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a responsibility," she said. "We're the ones who set the 
zero-tolerance policy." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; KINDERGARTEN CLASSES AT MAPLE CENTER OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kindergarten classes will open at the Maple Community Center in September, 
1995, if the district can meet certain conditions by then, the school board 
decided last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-1 vote, the board decided to open two kindergarten classes to allow 
children who live in the Maple area to spend their kindergarten year closer to 
home, and put an end to 23 years of busing the neighborhood's youngest 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-eight children who now attend preschool at the Maple Center would be 
eligible to enter kindergarten next year, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the school opens, the Fullerton School District must move a 
playground away from a busy intersection, add a large forum-like room to the 
school, finish refurbishing the site and hire a staff at least nine months in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first items the board will work on is relocating a playground at 
South Lemon Street and Valencia Drive. At a previous board meeting, a physical 
education teacher at Laguna Road Elementary School told the board that the 
playground location is "absolutely unacceptable and inappropriate."  
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Chris Heusser said children "are playing so close to that street. . . 
. The only thing protecting them from those cars are good drivers and a 
chain-link fence."  
</P>
<P>
 The board asked Supt. Duncan Johnson to work with the city to immediately 
relocate the playground to another site on school property. The board also 
asked Johnson to try to move a large, portable building to the Maple center for 
the 1994 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maple center has no room large enough to accommodate all of the students 
for schoolwide forums, and the double-wide portable building would meet that 
purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he would also present the school board with a plan for hiring a 
staff for the new kindergarten by the second board meeting in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the board voted 4-1 in favor of opening the school, several members 
expressed their reservations about the price tag of the new school, which is 
projected at $322,000, and the impact on community services now located at the 
Maple center. If the school is opened, a high school diploma program, English 
classes and services for the poor will be eliminated, decreased or moved. MARY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; YARD CONDEMNATION DRAWS RESIDENTS' IRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of homeowners has vowed to fight a decision by the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday to condemn pieces of their back yards for use in a South 
County street-widening project. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 60 parcels involved in the condemnation near Lake Forest 
Drive and Rockfield Boulevard, only 15 of the lots are residential property, 
officials said. Four of those homeowners appeared before the board Tuesday to 
voice their protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to stop progress," homeowner Lou Shubin said after the board 
vote, "but we're not going to sign our property over to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Shubin and others said the project would slice away valuable buffers from 
their properties and subject their homes to increased noise levels from nearby 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, area resident Ann Hice said, the county plans to take 107 
square feet of her yard, placing her home about 2 1/2 feet from a wall built to 
muffle area traffic noise. As a result, Hice said her family may have to 
relocate a bedroom away from the sound wall, a project that could cost $30,000. 
Hice said she has been offered $2,300 for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wall is just too close for comfort," Hice said. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents did not say they were considering a legal challenge to the 
county action but indicated that they would not allow their properties to be 
taken until their concerns were sufficiently addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the properties are needed to construct additional 
traffic lanes on Lake Forest and Rockfield and a right-turn lane on Rockfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth R. Smith, the county's transportation director, said lanes would go 
far to reduce congestion at the intersection and along the two streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent of the project is to bring the area up to a higher level of 
service," Smith told the supervisors. "There is a need to acquire property." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the county has attempted to limit property acquisitions by reducing 
the widths of sidewalks. Noise testing has been done in the area, and only 
minimal increases in decibel levels have been projected. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the process, affected homeowners have also expressed concern that 
their property losses could eventually leave them out of compliance with 
certain building codes. Since the codes are tied to specific lot sizes, the 
homeowners said they could have to seek new approvals for construction in the 
event their homes were damaged by fires or earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez asked that those code-related concerns be resolved 
before action is taken on their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said negotiations would continue with property owners in an attempt to 
resolve current differences. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; MOTEL TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have authorized the purchase of the La Habra Inn for 
$575,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When escrow closes in the next couple of days, City Manager Lee Risner said, 
the city will begin converting the inn into affordable senior citizen housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from a Redevelopment Agency fund, which can only be used to 
provide affordable housing in the city, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money can be used for no other purpose, and if we don't use it, the state 
requires us to give it to the Orange County Housing Authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the La Habra Inn, at 700 N. Beach Blvd., will become the city's first 
affordable housing complex for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Risner said he expects the entire conversion, which includes adding 
kitchenettes to each of the inn's 81 rooms, will cost about $500,000, and will 
be completed within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the inn is owned by a Los Angeles bank, and business has dropped 
drastically in the last few years, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business is not as good as it used to be," he added. "This is not a motel 
town. We are not a so-called destination point." 
</P>
<P>
 A private management company will manage the soon-to-be city-owned building, 
Risner said. MIMI KO

 Brea Olinda Unified School District trustees have approved two-year contracts 
for the district's two assistant superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter J. Boothroyd, assistant superintendent of human services, and Gary D. 
Goff, assistant superintendent of business services, have agreed to continue 
working for the district for an annual salary of $81,794 each until June 30, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members approved the contracts on a 4-2 vote last week. Trustees Todd A. 
Spitzer and Leonard MacKain cast the dissenting votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitzer said he has nothing against the assistant superintendents but feels 
that one-year contracts are more flexible. "I just don't believe in rolling 
over contracts unnecessarily," he said. MacKain agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Edgar Z. Seal said that Goff's and Boothroyd's contracts have been 
renewed every two years for the past 12 years.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; BALL FIELDS NAMED IN COUPLE'S MEMORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The softball fields at De Portola Elementary School were named this weekend in 
memory of Mark and Noreen Minzey, who were killed in a head-on collision by an 
alleged drunk driver last July while returning home from their daughter Karie's 
softball all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
 An emotion-filled ceremony to name the fields was held before a crowd of 1,200 
Saturday that had gathered for the 22nd annual opening day of the Mission de 
Oro Bobby Sox League.The Mission Viejo couple were volunteer coaches in the 
league, while 12-year-old Karie -- injured seriously in the crash -- was a star 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very special," Connie Beaty, president of the league, said of the 
ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a difficult ceremony for many in the league who were close to the 
Minzeys, including the Rodriguez family, whose daughters Jackie and Danielle 
were involved in the collision but suffered minor injuries, Beaty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred July 11 on Santiago Canyon Road as the Minzey family and 
Rodriguez children returned home from a softball tournament. Second-degree 
murder and driving under the influence charges are pending against Ronald 
Joseph Allen Jr., 31, an internist with a history of arrests, on suspicion of 
driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Karie Minzey has made remarkable progress since the crash and is 
living with her 15-year-old sister, Shelby, with their aunt and uncle in 
Marietta, Ga. Shelby was not involved in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Special awards will also be given in the league each year in memory of Mark 
and Noreen Minzey, and to honor the special player qualities of Karie. A 
special Minzey Field sign, bought with donations from Lamppost Pizza, will be 
installed at the entrance of the field, which is the home of the 350-member 
Bobby Sox league.ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY SEEKS 10-YEAR PACT WITH SWIMMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are seeking a new 10-year agreement with the Nadadores swim 
team that could keep the Olympic medal-winning organization in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 With three months to go before the Nadadores' lease for a city-owned aquatics 
complex on Marguerite Parkway expires, the City Council by a 4-1 vote Monday 
told its staff to start talks with the swim club and bring back a 10-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is right" to start negotiations, said Mayor Susan Withrow. "In 
three months their lease is up." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, offered by Councilman William S. Craycraft, drew strong 
opposition from Councilwoman Sharon Cody. 
</P>
<P>
 The council shouldn't produce a long-term agreement to "support the Nadadores 
10 years hence, not knowing whether we're going to have to lay off police 
officers by then," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Craycraft's motion called for the city staff to return to the council 
with a 10-year agreement, other council members said it doesn't have to be 
binding for that long. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not committing" to any length of time, said Councilman Robert D. 
Breton. "It might be four years. But at least we'll be in negotiations. We need 
a quick resolution here." 
</P>
<P>
 The swim team, whose members have won more than 40 Olympic swimming and diving 
medals in the past 20 years, has been struggling to stay in its longtime home 
in the aquatic complex since ownership of the facility was transferred last 
year from the Mission Viejo Co. to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also dropped its financial support of the team, which had to raise 
money for team trips and swim meets. The city agreed to pay about $350,000 in 
maintenance and utility costs for the pool complex for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement will expire in July. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY GETS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Assn. for Local Economic Development has given its annual award 
of merit to the city for its public-private development project "Civic Center 
Transformation." 
</P>
<P>
 The project involved converting a vacant former Police Department building 
into a satellite campus for Coastline Community College and leasing a former 
public library building for a child-care center, operated by FHP International 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tremendous recognition for the innovativeness the city has had with the 
partnerships we have formed with other entities," said Councilwoman Laurann 
Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 The award will be presented to the city Wednesday at the association's 14th 
annual conference in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the award to the city, the association noted that the 
partnership shows "bold leadership and the spirit of local resourcefulness." 
</P>
<P>
 The association also said the city's project exemplifies the best in 
development partnerships and has significantly contributed to job creation and 
local revenue enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows that the city is progressive and we tend to be entrepreneurial 
in our approach," said City Manager Ray Kromer. "We're not only getting income, 
but we've received complete renovation of the buildings -- and they serve a 
public purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will receive about $110,000 annually from the leases for both 
buildings, Kromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kromer said that as a result of the partnership, about $700,000 in renovations 
to the two buildings were performed at no cost to the city or its residents. 
The upgrades included air conditioning, roof repairs and remodeled interiors, 
he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TAY MURDER SUSPECT TO GET SEPARATE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a setback for prosecutors, a judge granted a separate trial Tuesday for the 
alleged ringleader in the 1992 New Year's Eve murder of honor student Stuart A. 
Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary said she was exercising 
her discretion to protect Robert Chan, 19, of Fullerton. If all four teen-agers 
were tried together, the judge said, Chan would probably find himself fingered 
for the murder from both sides of the attorneys' table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Chan suffers the risk he will not -- and I think it's a serious risk -- 
get a fair trial," O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling paves the way for Chan's murder trial to begin next week. And it 
places an added burden on Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum, who is now 
faced with preparing for a new case, requiring witnesses to testify twice and 
re-evaluating prosecution strategies on the eve of trial. More seriously, 
Rosenblum said, the co-defendants can now blame the murder on Chan, and he on 
them, leaving jurors confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real advantage to the defense," Rosenblum said outside court. 
"Basically, they can say whatever they want with impunity, and I'm limited in 
how I can rebut that." 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of Tay, a 17-year-old student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana, 
shocked Orange County and gained nationwide attention as a symbol of juvenile 
crime spiraling out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with Chan are Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Mun Bong Kang, 18, 
and Kirn Young Kim, 18, both of Fullerton. All are former students at Sunny 
Hills High School in Fullerton. A fifth youth, Charles Bae Choe, 18, of 
Fullerton, has pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the case and has agreed 
to testify against the other teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was bludgeoned before rubbing alcohol was forced down his throat and his 
mouth was taped shut. He was then buried in a back-yard grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe the youths were planning a computer heist with Tay. They 
allegedly attacked Tay after learning he had lied about his name and residence, 
fearing that he might turn them in, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys in the case plan to show that their clients believed Chan 
was a dangerous gang member, feared him and were coerced into carrying out the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman, who represents Chan, said he wanted a 
separate trial because he also expects the three co-defendants will try to 
portray his client as the "heavy" who masterminded the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just not true," he said, adding that his client is not a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of the three co-defendants will follow Chan's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 After the severance hearing, Schulman and Rosenblum discussed questions that 
will be asked of prospective jurors. Key areas of concern are whether 
prospective jurors have been swayed by extensive media coverage of the case and 
whether the race of the defendants could play a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope a jury in Orange County is not going to allow any racial prejudice 
against Asians to affect their deliberations in the case," Schulman said 
outside court. If it proves impossible to find jurors who have not made up 
their minds about the case, he will seek a trial in another county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe Simi Valley," he quipped. RENE LYNCH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; BALBOA BAY CLUB SUBMITS NEW PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after its $60-million expansion plans were rejected by the City 
Council, the Balboa Bay Club recently submitted to city officials a 
smaller-scale project that calls for the demolition and reconstruction of most 
of the club's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan, which would be about half as expensive as the 1991 plan, calls 
for development of a 145-room hotel that would open the club to the public for 
the first time in its 46-year history. Club owner Beverly Ray is also seeking 
an extension of the club's ground lease with the city through the year 2077. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real intent is to essentially modernize the Balboa Bay Club (so that it) 
can remain a focus of activity in Newport Beach," said Dave Wooten, president 
of International Bay Clubs, the parent company of the Balboa Bay Club. "It is 
an old, historic club. We want to preserve the club's ambience as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The project's environmental impact report is undergoing a 45-day public review 
process and probably will not come up for its first public hearing before the 
Planning Commission until May 5, city planner John Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the opening phases of demolition might not happen for another 
three to five years, Wooten said. 
</P>
<P>
 The private Balboa Bay Club was built in 1948 and has established itself as an 
exclusive bay-front haven for the rich and famous, even though it sits on 
publicly owned property along Mariners Mile on West Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 While the club's proposed hotel, restaurant, ballroom, four conference rooms 
and bay-front walkways would be open to the public, some doors would remain 
closed. The new plans foresee building new members-only athletic facilities 
that would include racquetball courts, a gymnasium, a swimming pool and a 
private dining area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hotel facilities and the club facilities are kept pretty separate," 
Wooten said. 
</P>
<P>
 This project, which may cost $20 million to $30 million, Wooten said, is 
designed to provide "view corridors" so residents who live on the hillside 
overlooking the highway can still see the harbor. To avoid a repeat of the 
controversy three years ago, the new facilities on the 13-acre site would not 
exceed a 35-foot height limit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 plan was rejected on a 4-3 vote by the City Council because of 
opposition from nearby residents. The plans for a 300-room hotel, a ballroom, 
two cocktail lounges and athletic facilities would have blocked their views of 
the water and contributed to traffic and congestion on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The size and scale was the main objection to the old project," Wooten said. 
In 1991, club officials complained that they were denied a fair public hearing 
when their plans were initially rejected, but Wooten said that discarding the 
more ambitious plan has become a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has changed dramatically since 1990," he said. "I would not want 
to sit here with 300 rooms to fill up every day of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The club membership requires an initiation fee of $1,400 to $4,000, and 
monthly rents for individual suites fall into a similar price range. The 
Terrace Apartments, a permanent residence for many club members, would remain 
untouched during the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who have lived here for 10 to 15 years," Wooten said. "Every 
room has view of the ocean and the bay. It has 24-hour guard service and 
parking, and they can utilize the athletic facilities. It is a pretty neat 
deal." BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; TOPLESS BAR GETS ORDER NOT TO OPEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge granted a preliminary injunction Tuesday 
that prevents an adult theater and topless dance bar from opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach officials requested the injunction last month after concluding 
that the owner of Mermaids might open the business even after the City Council 
rejected his application. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Warren Siegal is set to decide in a few weeks whether to make his order 
permanent, said Robin Flory, assistant city attorney for Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner sought to open Mermaids at a site on Martingale Way near John Wayne 
Airport. But both the Planning Commission and City Council rejected his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the business argued that exotic dancing is a form of free speech 
and that the city did not have the right to deny the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The city claimed that the business is not permitted under zoning regulations.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OFFICIALS DENY THREAT TO SENIORS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials tried to quell the fears of senior citizens Tuesday in the 
wake of an Orange County Grand Jury report that created the impression that 
services for older residents face imminent cutbacks from pending state 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Area Agency on Aging dispatched bulletins to 55 nutrition centers 
that serve an estimated 6,000 meals a day to senior citizens to inform clients 
that no funding reductions are on the horizon, said agency director Peggy 
Weatherspoon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 20-page grand jury report released Monday, two pending state 
bills could slash funding for senior citizen programs in Orange County by as 
much as $700,000 if they arepassed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weatherspoon said that Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed those bills two years ago. 
And because of pressure from the county Board of Supervisors and local state 
legislators, the Area Agency on Aging will receive a $150,000 increase in its 
budget next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, (those bills) were an issue -- they could become an issue -- but right 
now it's just not an issue," said Weatherspoon. "I just don't want to see the 
seniors frightened. It's just a misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach grand jury officials about the discrepancy were unsuccessful 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Weatherspoon applauded the grand jury's call for the supervisors to 
press for more funding for senior programs. Even though it has the 
fourth-largest senior citizen population in the state, with an estimated 
347,000 residents age 60 or older, Orange County ranks next to last in state 
per capita funding for older residents, said the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is that Orange County is an affluent county, and that 
perception has led to a decrease in funding from one year to the next," said 
Bahai Wilson, who served on the grand jury's Human Services Committee. "There's 
going to be a time very soon when the seniors need the service and it won't be 
available to them because of lack of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report said that, compared to other counties in the state, 
Orange County has the fifth-highest number of residents age 60 or older living 
in poverty. The county also has the seventh-largest minority population age 60 
or older, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report voiced concern about possible cutbacks in county 
Dial-a-Ride services for senior citizens as a result of implementation of the 
federal Americans With Disabilities Act. Dial-a-Ride offers clients 
door-to-door transportation, thus helping to prevent feelings of isolation, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible changes could require senior citizens to use public bus 
transportation, which some seniors will not do, the report said. Walking to bus 
stops could pose a physical hardship for some, while others might shun public 
transportation because of crime fears, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand jury members also recommended that the supervisors implement a four-year 
marketing plan to increase awareness of programs for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, it takes a catastrophic illness and getting your world turned upside 
down before a senior learns about county services," Wilson said. "What we need 
to do is get the wordout to active, healthy seniors now." MARTIN MILLER

SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT RELEASES VIDEOTAPES ON DEPUTY'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department on Tuesday released copies of the 
videotaped footage surrounding the Christmas Day shooting death of Deputy 
Darryn Leroy Robins, allowing the public to get its first direct look at some 
of the now-controversial events of that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had allowed reporters to view the video footage last week when 
they opened up their investigative files, but they had refused to make public 
copies of the tapes for reproduction. Every sheriff's patrol car is equipped 
with a dash-mounted camera that can be activated either manually or 
automatically when emergency lights are turned on. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, the Sheriff's Department provided copies of the footage 
after The Times and other news organizations cited provisions of the California 
Public Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes do not show the pivotal minutes during which authorities say Deputy 
Brian P. Scanlan accidentally shot and killed Robins, 30, during an impromptu 
training exercise behind a Lake Forest movie theater around 2 p.m. on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said that the camera in Scanlan's patrol car 
was knocked out of focus a few minutes beforehand and that it was then turned 
off during the shooting itself, although he said investigators are not sure why 
or by whom. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes do show, however, several key scenes surrounding the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 On one videotape, shot from the camera in Scanlan's patrol car about 20 
minutes before the shooting, Scanlan and Robins, along with a rookie deputy, 
are seen running through a mock car-stop exercise in a parking lot outside a 
Lake Forest Kmart. Scanlan uses his finger as a gun to apprehend Robins, 
playing the suspect in the scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 During the shooting itself a few minutes later, Robins and Scanlan were 
running through a similar car-stop exercise at a second mall lot a few blocks 
away, but Scanlan -- in apparent violation of department policy -- used his 
loaded service weapon. None of this is captured on film. 
</P>
<P>
 The video footage then picks up again with two tapes that show the short race 
to Laguna Hills' Saddleback Memorial Medical Center with the wounded Robins, 
his stiffened legs jutting out the open back door of Scanlan's car. The first 
tape was shot through the windshield of Scanlan's patrol car, the second from a 
patrol car that was trailing him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tapes made public, authorities edited out a scene of Robins being taken 
into the hospital emergency room, saying they did not want to upset Robins' 
family. Scanlan can be heard on one tape at the hospital shouting: "You're my 
buddy, man! C'mon, Darryn!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department did not provide a copy of Scanlan's videotaped 
interview with authorities just a few hours after the shooting, which was shown 
to reporters at last week's briefing. But Lt. Dan Martini said copies of that 
tape will probably be released later. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they have taken the unusual step of making public the tapes 
and virtually all other evidence in the case to help dispel lingering 
suspicions about the controversial shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury decided earlier this month not to indict Scanlan for involuntary 
manslaughter.

2 ON SEAL BEACH COUNCIL REELECTED; 3RD IN RUNOFF; VOTE: INCUMBENTS DOANE AND 
MAYOR FORSYTHE HOLD OFF CHALLENGERS AND CLAIM VINDICATION. COUNCILWOMAN 
HASTINGS MUST TRY AGAIN AGAINST BUSINESSMAN KLISANIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Two incumbents were reelected and a third faced a runoff Tuesday after a 
low-key election that centered on how to maintain the city's small-town charm 
while improving its weak fiscal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 3, which covers the Marina Hill area, Mayor Gwen Forsythe easily 
defeated businessman John Baker and homemaker Kathy Parker, winning more than 
60% of the vote.  
</P>
<P>
 In District 5, which covers Leisure World, Councilman William J. Doane 
defeated engineering manager Richard Davies in a close race. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 1, which covers the Old Town area, Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce 
Hastings faces a runoff election against businessman Jim Klisanin.  
</P>
<P>
 The winning incumbents said the election indicates public approval for the way 
they have run the city, including the City Council's controversial decision 
last year to more than double the monthly tax residents pay on their telephone, 
gas and electric bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe said she was "thrilled and excited. It's been a very long campaign. . 
. . I think I ran a clean, honest and ethical campaign. I think that people 
responded to the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The two incumbents' victories keep somewhat intact a City Council that over 
the last four years has become known for its skeptical views of new 
development. Election challengers accused the council of being anti-growth and 
for not doing enough to help Seal Beach's business community. 
</P>
<P>
 A central issue in the election was the city's poor financial health. Seal 
Beach has faced a string of large budget shortfalls and has been forced to 
balance the city's books by laying off workers and raising taxes. Over the last 
three years, the city has cut spending and personnel each by about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Challengers in the race criticized incumbents for raising the utility users 
tax last year, saying it was the wrong way to increase revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents defended their actions as the only method for balancing the city's 
books without making massive cuts in police and other services.  
</P>
<P>
 Candidates made a variety of suggestions for raising new revenues, from 
reopening the city's long-dormant jail to holding fund-raisers to pay for city 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Challengers also accused the current council of not doing enough to improve 
business conditions, especially on Main Street. They said incumbents burdened 
merchants with too many regulations and rejected proposals aimed at expanding 
existing restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said that they sought to balance the concerns of residents 
with those of business people. Incumbents said there already are too many 
businesses that sell alcohol on Main Street and that they didn't want to add 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Public safety was another issue discussed during the race. Several candidates 
proposed building a police substation at the Seal Beach Pier as a way of 
bringing a permanent police presence to the Old Town area. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates said they wanted the city to increase the number of police 
patrols. FINAL ELECTION RETURNS

MAN SLAIN IN HALL OF SANTA ANA BOARDINGHOUSE

<P>
 An unidentified man was shot to death in the hallway of a boardinghouse 
Tuesday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, believed to be between 20 and 30 years old, was shot several times 
in the head and was dead when police arrived at the home in the 1400 block of 
West Cubbon Street at 1:06 p.m., police Cpl.Jeff Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The female owner of the house told investigators that she was in the kitchen 
at the time of the shooting and did not see the suspects or hear conversation 
of any type," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told investigators that the victim did not live in the house and 
that she did not know who he was or why he was there, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did acknowledge to investigators that she rents several rooms inside of 
the house and the garage to people who then sub-rent their part of the house to 
others," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the shooting, witnesses told police, they saw two men 
running from the house. They ran east on West Cubbon Street then south on 
Graham Lane toward McFadden Avenue, Armstrong said.

NEWSLETTER AUTHORS GET TASTE OF THEIR OWN CAUSTIC INK; POLITICS: ILLUMINAIRE'S 
ATTACK ON ASSEMBLYMAN FERGUSON PROMPTS MOCK EDITION OF CONSERVATIVE YOUNG 
REPUBLICAN STAFFERS' PUBLICATION LAMPOONING THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's conservative Republicans continue to show signs that they 
aren't getting along very well. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the latest skirmish the Battle of the Dueling Pens. 
</P>
<P>
 It began a few weeks ago in the latest issue of Illuminaire -- the cheeky 
conservative newsletter produced by several staffers of the Orange County 
legislative delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newsletter's articles was one about Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach) that was headlined: "Gil: A Portrait of Political 
Alzheimer's." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's defenders apparently fired back, producing and mailing last week a 
bogus edition of Illuminaire. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like the real thing, but clearly it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the lead article apologized for insulting Ferguson and others 
who were attacked in the February-March edition of the bimonthly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work for the Tonya Hardings of the political ice rink and the Lorena 
Bobbitts of painful political sex," the fake newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another article said: "It's true that most everything we said was either a 
lie, taken out of context or embroidered. It's tough to take on the toughest, 
crustiest conservative in the Legislature and make him look like a lib, but we 
sure did our best. We used the Harding pipe and the Bobbitt knife." 
</P>
<P>
 The fake newsletter attempted to mimic the irreverent style that the real 
Illuminaire is known for. But Matthew Cunningham, Illuminaire's co-senior 
editor and an aide to state Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange), said the counterfeit 
version didn't even succeed at doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their vocabulary is mediocre, the writing style is middling, and they can't 
even spell (Democratic gubernatorial candidate) Kathleen Brown's name 
correctly. It's pathetic," Cunningham said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The real Illuminaire is a product of the Conservative Round Table of Orange 
County, a group of young Republicans who are devoted to conservative causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Its recent issue questioned the conservative credentials of Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who is seeking his party's nomination for the 
U.S. Senate seat now held by Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Another frequent 
Illuminaire target is Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham said he suspects that Ferguson's staffers -- but not the 
assemblyman -- produced the fake Illuminaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, no," Ferguson responded Tuesday. "I just got one in the mail, both at 
home and in the office. . . . I don't know who did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said that one of Cunningham's cohorts recently confided to him that 
he had been "very embarrassed" by the attack on the assemblyman in the last 
newsletter and would "try to set the record straight" in the next issue. 
Ferguson did not say who that was. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsors of Illuminaire "are kind of vicious people," Ferguson said. "They 
really attack."

BOARD RETRACTS $1-MILLION IBM CONTRACT; BIDS: COUNTY SUPERVISORS FEAR THE DEAL 
MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY WEIGHTED TO FAVOR THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS GIANT. NEW 
PROPOSALS WILL BE SOUGHT AFTER A RESTRUCTURING.

<P>
 A $1-million computer equipment contract was withdrawn from consideration by 
the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday after officials feared that the deal may 
have been improperly weighted to favor information systems giant IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was the low bidder on the project. But Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder said competitors "screamed" when they learned that IBM, which had won an 
earlier contract to install the equipment, planned to more than double the 
installation costs if a competing firm was awarded the contract to supply 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In its proposal, IBM indicated that it would charge $21,000 to connect its own 
mainframe system, needed to run the county's welfare and finance operations. 
IBM would have charged its competitors $48,000 for installing the same 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said the difference on those costs effectively gave IBM an "inside 
track" to secure the low-bidder position as the mainframe supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just wasn't the way to go," Wieder said, adding that the gap on 
installation costs was not discovered until the bids were reviewed by the 
county's General Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when the other competitors screamed. GSA had no way of knowing 
earlier," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with Comdisco Inc., the second-lowest bidder on the project, 
confirmed that the company had lodged a formal protest on the issue with the 
county but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM spokesman Michael Dutton said only that the company "bid very aggressively 
and intends to bid again" when new proposals are requested. Dutton was not able 
to address the county's concerns about installation cost differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said that while he did not believe there was an 
attempt by any of the parties involved to "create a questionable scenario," 
there were, nonetheless, problems of "perception." 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I was made aware of these issues, I was very uncomfortable with some 
elements of the (contract) process," Vasquez said. "There are better ways to 
conduct this business." 
</P>
<P>
 GSA Director R.A. Scott said the bidding process would be reopened and 
"restructured" but would not exclude IBM or any of the other bidders. Scott 
said IBM would also remain the county's choice to install any mainframe 
selected, noting that it was the only company qualified to do so.

WINDOWS SHOT OUT OF PARKED VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The windows of at least nine vehicles parked on residential streets were 
shattered by gunfire sometime between 11:30 p.m. Monday and 7 a.m. Tuesday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like somebody was driving by and just fired into these vehicles," 
Officer Jon Fehlman said. "We don't have any idea who would have done something 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The windows were shot with either a small-caliber handgun or a BB gun, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the vehicles were parked on Bluebird Canyon Drive, two on High Drive 
and one on Hillcrest Drive.

CITY ORDERED TO SHOW STREET WIDENING'S IMPACT; REDEVELOPMENT: JUDGE SAYS SANTA 
ANA MUST FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE BRISTOL PROJECT COULD DISPLACE AND 
DEMONSTRATE THAT DECENT HOUSING AWAITS THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 City officials must determine exactly how many people could be displaced by 
the $355-million Bristol Street project -- the largest redevelopment in the 
city's history -- and must show that decent housing exists for all of them 
before the project may proceed, a Superior Court judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert A. Knox also ordered Santa Ana 
officials back to the drawing board to explain why so many homes and businesses 
would be swallowed by the project's boundaries.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm jumping up and down," said housing attorney Richard L. Spix, who filed a 
1990 lawsuit challenging the project as a land grab that could displace 
hundreds of people, most of them low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said Tuesday that the city will do whatever is 
needed to get the redevelopment project back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that we'll have to do," he said. "It's a lot of work and a lot 
more expense for us." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the city's plan to expand Bristol Street from four lanes to six 
between Memory Lane and Central Avenue, and revamp more than a dozen commercial 
areas along the congested strip south of the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the project in late 1989 after 2 1/2 years of 
planning. But a lawsuit filed in 1990 on behalf of a single mother and 
businessman in the proposed 783-acre project area has stymied city plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox had ruled in 1991 that the city could go ahead with its project, but the 
4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana argued otherwise. Last month, the 
city and housing advocates faced off in front of Knox again. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials argued that they did not have to explain why each property not 
affected by the street widening should be included in the project area, because 
the entire neighborhood is generally blighted from overcrowding and crime. But, 
in his ruling on Friday, Knox stuck to the higher court's decision, ordering 
the city to make a property-by-property assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also had argued that there is plenty of housing available in Santa 
Ana that would be affordable to residents displaced over the years, and 
submitted a list of potentially available units, including federally subsidized 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knox said the city must go back and more specifically identify who might 
be displaced -- the number of families and their general income -- and whether 
the housing available to them is safe and sanitary and within their means. 
</P>
<P>
 That may require the city to survey area residents, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spix, the housing attorney, praised the judge's 12-page ruling as "remarkably 
reasoned." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare that we get a decision that is this thorough in cases like this," 
he said. "I appreciate the guidance the court has given us." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision will force city officials to assess the project and the people 
who will be affected by it if it goes through, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think it's going to require (city officials) to get out of their 
cars and quit doing windshield surveys of the area," Spix said.

JUDGE BARS SALE OF PEN KNIVES AT FEDCO STORES; COURTS: INJUNCTION COMES IN 
RESPONSE TO CONSUMER UNIT COMPLAINT THAT THE PEN IS A CONCEALED WEAPON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A judge on Tuesday issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting 10 Southern 
California Fedco stores from selling Remington's "Classic Writing Pen Knife," 
which contains a small, hidden blade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint filed March 7, the Orange County district attorney's office 
charged that the devices are concealed weapons, specifically banned by state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 The item had been selling for $6.87 until they were pulled from store shelves 
earlier this month, hours after a civil complaint was filed by the district 
attorney's Consumer Protection Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a public safety issue," said Robert C. Gannon Jr., the unit's 
supervising deputy district attorney. "These writing pen knives are, in effect, 
concealed weapons. We feel very strongly that there is absolutely no 
justification whatsoever for selling or making these items." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-inch item has a ballpoint at one end and, beneath the cap, a fixed, 
single-edged, pointed blade, 2 1/2 inches long. The blade is meant to serve as 
a letter opener, Fedco officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Fedco could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary injunction remains in effect until the case goes to trial in 
Orange County Superior Court. No trial date has been set. The district 
attorney's office is seeking to have the item permanently barred from store 
shelves, Gannon said.

WATER DISTRICT CHIEF STAYING ON JOB AFTER ALL; UTILITIES: AFTER SAYING HE WOULD 
TAKE PRIVATE JOB, SANTA MARGARITA'S SCHATZ STICKS WITH TROUBLED AGENCY.

<P>
 The general manager of the Santa Margarita Water District, who told his board 
of directors March 16 that he would be leaving to work for a Riverside County 
developer, has decided to stay with the district after all. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to all employees dated March 24, John J. Schatz said he would be 
staying despite "a financially significant offer of employment in the private 
sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz said that despite the "attractiveness of the offer" as manager of 
Cox-West Properties in Riverside County, he would remain in charge of the South 
County water district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this commitment is particularly important to the employees and the 
organization as we continue to emerge from, and move past, the events of last 
year," Schatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has been embroiled in a scandal involving conflict-of-interest 
allegations against several employees, including its two former managers, who 
were indicted last week on criminal charges of failing to disclose gifts from 
companies they helped recommend for lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 A former board chairman and the district's current chief engineer are still 
under investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Betty Olson said she was gratified that Schatz was staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only comment is that it certainly helps the continuity of the district not 
to have to replace the general manager after such a short period of time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz did not return several calls for comment.

MAN CHARGED WITH ABUSE IN DEATH OF GIRLFRIEND'S SON; CRIME: PROSECUTORS ARE 
AWAITING CORONER'S REPORT TO DETERMINE IF EVIDENCE WARRANTS A MURDER CHARGE.

 A Newport Beach house painter, charged Tuesday with felony child abuse in 
connection with the death of his girlfriend's 22-month-old son, could face a 
murder charge, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are waiting for the coroner's report to determine whether or not there's 
evidence to base some sort of criminal homicide charges," Deputy Dist. 
Atty.David L. Brent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laudenback, 32, was arrested Sunday in Costa Mesa after the death of 
Tyler Jaeger, the son of Laudenback's girlfriend, Karey Jaeger, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The child died Friday while in the care of Laudenback, who often baby-sat the 
child while Tyler's mother went to work in the San Gabriel Valley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary autopsy showed that the child apparently died of abnormal 
bleeding from a lacerated liver and pancreas due to infliction of a blunt 
instrument, according to Newport Police Sgt. Andy Gonis. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback was charged with felony corporal punishment on a child, which 
carries a maximum punishment of six years in prison, Brent said. The district 
attorney's office will decide in the next few days whether to file murder 
charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback, who made a brief court appearance Tuesday, postponed entering a 
plea to the charge. A new arraignment date was set for April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held at the Orange County Jail on $100,000 bail.

UCI PRINTING DEPARTMENT, 10 JOBS FALL TO BUDGET AX; UNIVERSITY: MOVE COMES 
AFTER TASK FORCES SENT DOZENS OF OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD CUT $4 
MILLION. CHANCELLOR MUST DECIDE THE FATE OF SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 UC Irvine's printing department will close for good and its 10 employees will 
be laid off in an ongoing series of steps aimed at cutting the budget, a 
university spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven full-time employees will lose their jobs when UCI's printing and 
reprographics department closes May 15, UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell said. 
Three part-time or temporary workers also will be laid off, print shop 
employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves came more than a month after two university task forces -- one 
focusing on academic departments and the other looking at non-academic services 
-- issued various broad recommendations to reduce the 1994-95 budget by about 
$4 million. The dozens of proposals issued Feb. 17 include eliminating 
comparative cultural and physical education programs and the teachers' 
credential program, as well as reducing the number of vice chancellors by half. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus groups and committees have pored through the recommendations for budget 
cuts since February and will send their objections and suggestions to 
Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening for her consideration by April 15, UCI 
spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said. Wilkening is expected to decide on the 
fate of several departments by the end of the school year in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The task force on non-academic issues did not specifically recommend closing 
the print shop, Granell said. Printing department layoffs resulted from a 
review process that had been underway before the task force was formed, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Print shop workers produce stationery, forms and documents for other 
university departments, Granell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The university has been exploring the option of contracting with private 
companies to provide services now done by university support employees, Granell 
said. She added that the printing department has been operating with a deficit 
of about $500,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Louise Anderson, representative of the local University Professional and 
Technical Employees Union, said administrators ignored employees' proposals for 
ways to make the print shop profitable before closing the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers have offered a business plan -- a series of suggestions that haven't 
been taken," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers who will be laid off will be given preference when the university 
begins to hire new employees, she said, but print shop employees are unlikely 
to have specialized technical skills to work in other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the university's plan, Anderson said, the employees may take a free UC 
Extension class each quarter to learn new skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "But realistically, that is not going to retrain them for another position," 
she said.

 RAMMING SPEED: Ever cringe when you spot a car hurtling toward you on the 
freeway? That happened twice to hundreds of rush-hour motorists on the Ventura 
Freeway on Tuesday (B1). . . . A felony suspect led the CHP on a 20-mile chase, 
then spun around and plunged into traffic going the wrong way. "It's a scary 
feeling," motorist Dan Young said, "when you see the cars parting in front of 
you . . . people slamming on their brakes, scrambling to get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 PENNIES FROM . . .: Concerned about earthquake-shaken kids in Fillmore, 
elementary schoolchildren in West Virginia collected 61,382 pennies to send to 
a Fillmore elementary school. Fortunately, Augusta School cashed in the pennies 
and instead sent a $613.82 check to Sespe School. . . . Said Sespe teacher 
Norma Vasquez: "When we saw the check, we were just overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 MILLIONAIRESS: Sandra Trinka, a Ventura woman who holds down two jobs to 
support herself, didn't bother to go to work Tuesday. . . . She was busy 
granting interviews, shopping for a new car and other things that accompany a 
$12.6-million Lotto jackpot (B1). For her, the day brought plenty of laughs and 
some insight into the minds of some men. She had two marriage proposals from 
unknown callers to a radio show. "It's funny how attractive you get when you 
have money." 
</P>
<P>
 TAX BREAK: Although three free-spirited condors were grounded Tuesday by 
wildlife biologists (B1), the captive breeding program has pulled the 
endangered vultures from the brink of extinction. The remaining 22 California 
condors have multiplied to 81, with more hatchlings on the way. . . . If you 
want to help save threatened species, there's a line on your state tax return 
for tax-deductible donations to the "Rare and Endangered Species Program." 
There's no guarantee that your money would help condors. Fish and Game 
biologists can use it for any of the 287 species in trouble.

ROBERTI RECALL BACKERS READYING MAIL BARRAGE; POLITICS: LEADERS WANT TO CHANGE 
THE PERCEPTION THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS THE WORK OF GUN CONTROL FOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With last-minute help from the Republican Party and a tax protest group, foes 
of state Sen. David A. Roberti are about to end their virtual silence by 
sending out tens of thousands of pieces of political mail urging voters to 
recall Roberti in the April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Howard, a leader of the recall, welcomed the participation of the state 
GOP party and People's Advocate, a taxpayer watchdog group founded by Paul 
Gann, saying it gives a much-needed boost to the cash-poor recall campaign and 
should help correct the view that it's exclusively the work of gun control 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has been single-minded in painting his recall foes as gun fanatics 
seeking revenge against him because he authored a 1989 state law banning the 
sale of military-style semiautomatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always said this was never strictly a gun issue and this proves it," 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Costa, executive director of People's Advocate, said his group is not 
involved in the recall because of a gun issue but because of what he says are 
Roberti's big-spending ways and his opposition to term limits. "This is not 
about guns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roberti press secretary Staci Walters noted that local Republicans 
such as Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and ex-Congresswoman Bobbi 
Fiedler are opposing the recall as a waste of money because term limits will 
require Roberti to resign from the Senate in December anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the involvement of the GOP and Costa's group, "you can't hide the fact 
that the recall is all about assault weapons," Walters said.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether late intervention by the GOP and Costa's group will have a decisive 
effect on an election that is only 13 days away remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the political mail war has been dominated by Roberti, who has already 
sent out a half-dozen pieces, including an absentee ballot application. 
</P>
<P>
 With a campaign budget that is expected to top $750,000 by election day, 
Roberti to date has overwhelmed his foes at the mailbox with colorful, 
eye-grabbing pieces that are the trademark of his campaign consultant, Clinton 
Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 One piece shows a series of scenes from the 1981 assassination attempt against 
President Reagan and ends with a statement from Sarah Brady telling voters to 
support Roberti if they are concerned about gun-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady is the wife of James Brady, Reagan's press secretary who was seriously 
injured in the 1981 attack, and a leader of Handgun Control Inc., the 
organization that sponsored the nation's new gun control law. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti opponents hope their late mailers will overcome the senator's 
momentum. A Los Angeles Times poll, conducted last week, showed the senator had 
a wide advantage in his fight to foil the recall drive with 62% of likely 
voters favoring Roberti's retention. 
</P>
<P>
 A 60,000-piece mailer from the state Republican Party urges Roberti's removal. 
"This is a golden opportunity for Republicans . . . to rid California of one of 
the most liberal, big taxing and big spending Democrats in the Senate," says 
the piece signed by GOP state party treasurer Michael Schroeder, an Orange 
County attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces, costing $12,500, also include a pitch asking Republicans to 
contribute money to their party. At its recent state convention, the GOP 
endorsed the bid to oust Roberti even though Gov. Pete Wilson did not. 
</P>
<P>
 John Peschong, GOP press secretary, said other party initiatives to help the 
recall effort also are being considered. He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The People's Advocate mailer is a four-page tabloid that is being mailed to 
9,000 of the group's members and about 25,000 other voters in Roberti's 
district who have been identified as sympathetic to the anti-big-government, 
populist reform ideas espoused by the group. Costa's group has been a member of 
the anti-Roberti coalition virtually since its inception, and previously picked 
up the bill for printing the recall petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Californians Against Corruption, a Signal Hill-based group, is 
poised to unleash its own mail offensive against Roberti via a unique, if 
somewhat primitive and controversial, chain mail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer will be produced, folded, stuffed into envelopes and hand-stamped 
by volunteers at "stuffing parties" held in places as near as Van Nuys and as 
far away as Alaska, San Francisco and New York City, said Howard, a top officer 
with Californians Against Corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers get a mailing kit and are responsible for copying the piece of mail 
contained therein and sending it to a list of voters identified by Californians 
Against Corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard estimated that half of his group's volunteers in this effort have gun 
rights as their No. 1 issue. "The rest are concerned about victims' rights, 
taxes and corruption in Sacramento," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said his group expects to reach 85,000 households with high-propensity 
voters in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent activity has given a boost to the morale of the anti-Roberti 
forces. "The public has not really heard our side of the story yet," said Bill 
Dominguez, commenting on the fact that as of this week only a smattering of 
anti-Roberti literature had reached voters. Dominguez, a systems analyst, is 
one of five candidates seeking to replace Roberti if he is recalled April 12.  
</P>
<P>
 Howard, a financial consultant with a major brokerage firm, also speculated 
that much of Roberti's support may be soft and temperamental -- and prone to 
switch once it finally hears from the anti-Roberti side. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they read our stuff, I think we can win," Howard said Tuesday. The piece 
produced by Howard's group contains allegations of misfeasance and malfeasance 
against Roberti, including charges that "Roberti is the Willie Brown of the 
Senate" who supported Chief Justice Rose Bird, opposes the death penalty and 
had as his lieutenants three senators who have been found guilty of political 
corruption, including Alan Robbins of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians Against Corruption squabbled for months with the state's Fair 
Political Practices Commission in 1992 after the group refused to report the 
value of the in-kind contributions made by its volunteers on its campaign 
finance statements.

COUNTY OKS $11 MILLION TO PURCHASE PARKLAND; TOPANGA: THE SANTA MONICA 
MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY WILL BUY 662 ACRES WHERE A GOLF COURSE AND LUXURY HOMES 
HAD BEEN PROPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Plans to turn the proposed site of a controversial housing project in Topanga 
Canyon into public parkland moved forward Tuesday as Los Angeles County 
officials gave $11 million to a state parks agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision by the County Board of Supervisors to release the money 
-- part of voter-approved Proposition A funds -- cleared the last major hurdle 
to resolution of the longest-running land-use dispute in Los Angeles County 
history.  
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise deal announced earlier this month, the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy agreed to buy 662 acres in the Summit Valley area from Canyon Oaks 
Estates Limited Partnership, which had proposed building a golf course and 97 
luxury home sites on 257 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The price: $19.9 million, the highest paid by the conservancy since it was 
created in 1979. Supporters of the purchase say the property is well worth the 
price because of its large size and accessible location. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the entrance of Topanga," said Supervisor Ed Edelman, who brokered 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, the development partnership -- which is part of a Disney 
family trust -- agreed to drop its plans if the conservancy could close escrow 
before April 5. The money released Tuesday allows the conservancy to finalize 
an initial purchase of 432 acres for $14.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 230 acres must be purchased before August, 1995. Money for that 
acquisition would come either from Proposition 180, an initiative on the 
statewide ballot June 7, or from money owed the conservancy by the National 
Park Service. Although the conservancy will carry out the purchase, the 
disbursement of Proposition A funds had to be approved by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, and Robert Wilson, 
president of the Canyon Oaks partnership, said they foresee no problems in 
concluding the deal by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, ardent supporters of the Canyon Oaks golf course and housing project 
promised Tuesday that they would challenge the deal in court. "We are obviously 
not happy with this deal," said Topanga resident Paul Cook. "Disney gets the 
gold and we get the shaft." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Topanga resident, Joan Cooper, said she objected to turning the 
property into a park because of the increased traffic and noise because "anyone 
from anywhere can drive up our streets." Neighbor Bill Dillon complained that a 
park would allow the "criminal element to spew their venom" in Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 A Canyon Oaks attorney said she was unsure of what effect delays caused by a 
possible legal challenge would have on the deal. Wilson has said that the 
partnership would revive its development proposal if the transaction with the 
conservancy did not proceed swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 The money made available to the conservancy Tuesday was in addition to the $29 
million released by the county last fall, bringing its total Proposition A 
disbursement to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said purchase of the Canyon Oaks property would delay a handful of 
acquisition projects until this summer, when $10 million in additional parks 
money becomes available. Three other projects would be delayed indefinitely -- 
a grant to the El Cariso education project and the acquisitions of Elrita Bowl 
in the Hollywood Hills and Woodland Hills Estates in the Santa Monica 
Mountains.

10TH SERVICE CENTER TO GIVE QUAKE AID; RECOVERY: THE LAST TWO VALLEY DISASTER 
ASSISTANCE FACILITIES CLOSE. HELP THAT WAS OFFERED THERE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT 
THE NEW SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal and state disaster officials today will open the 10th service center 
to aid Northridge earthquake victims, after shutting down the last two Disaster 
Assistance Centers in the San Fernando Valley on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 All services -- including new applications -- that had been provided at the 
application centers at the Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Recreation Center and Balboa 
Recreation Center in Encino will be offered at the new Earthquake Service 
Center, 14144 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they were serving about 150 people a day at each of the two 
remaining assistance centers, with an average of about 30 a day applying for 
first-time aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the 6.8 temblor, more than 1,000 people a day visited each 
of the 21 assistance centers that were opened to help quake victims apply for 
federal, state and local aid, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure of the two Valley assistance centers leaves only one such center 
open -- at the Hollywood Recreation Center. The 11th and last service center 
will be opened in the Hollywood area when a site is found, officials said. That 
last assistance center will then be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, most of the new applicants who applied for aid at the Valley 
centers had intentionally waited until now -- nearly two months after the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake -- because damage to their residences was not severe, 
or they did not know if they qualified for government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the stragglers was Mike Andrioff, 34, of Encino. Andrioff walked 
into the Encino assistance center Tuesday simply to get information. But he 
wound up applying for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really sure if I qualified for anything, so I didn't apply right 
away," said Andrioff, whose home sustained a lot of interior and exterior 
cracks.  
</P>
<P>
 "But after getting some estimates on the repairs, I want to see if I qualify 
for any assistance. One quote I got was for $19,000 to repair the stucco." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sherman Oaks center, Joseph Glantz, 71, and his wife, Phyllis, 55, of 
Sherman Oaks, said they were only now applying for assistance because they had 
been waiting to see what their personal and condo homeowners association 
insurance would cover.  
</P>
<P>
 They said they still don't know, but that they know they will have to pay a 
$10,000 deductible in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to get a low-interest loan to pay for the things not covered by 
insurance," Phyllis Glantz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new service center in Sherman Oaks will open at 1 p.m. today and close at 
6 p.m. All service centers are open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through 
Saturday. They are operated jointly by the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their opening, the assistance centers have served an average of 60,000 
people a day, either in person or by phone. As of Monday night, more than 
485,000 people had registered for disaster assistance. More than $600 million 
had been awarded to nearly 234,000 people in federal housing assistance grants. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Small Business Administration, which provides low-interest loans 
to both homeowners and businesses, had approved loans totaling $655 million for 
22,000 individuals and businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 The state Individual and Family Grant Program had disbursed $11 million to 
10,000 individuals. And the state Employment Development Department had paid 
nearly $1.2 million in connection with 3,400 claims.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 19,000 federal certificates have been approved for temporary rental 
housing assistance.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 11 SCHOOLS ASK FOR CHECKS OF EMF LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of revelations that a high electromagnetic field level was 
measured at a Sherman Oaks elementary school, 11 schools have requested that 
their electromagnetic field levels be checked, district officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, parents at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary demanded that the Los 
Angeles Unified School District move an electrical transformer located next to 
a kindergarten classroom because of concerns that electromagnetic levels 
measured there were too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Electromagnetic fields, often shortened to EMF, are present wherever an 
electric current passes through a wire. They are the subject of scientific 
debate as a cause of childhood cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 schools' requests were prompted by news reports about Dixie Canyon, Los 
Angeles Unified School District officials said. They are probably the first of 
many requests, said Susie Wong, director of the district's environmental, 
health and safety branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are going to be more (requests)," Wong said. "But people have 
to put this into perspective of what the risk factor is and how it compares to 
a variety of other risks." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the Department of Water and Power took a measurement of 107 
milligauss at the teacher's chair in the bungalow classroom at Dixie Canyon. 
The average house has an EMF reading of under 2 milligauss. After the district 
announced the readings March 11, the school moved the 33 children from the 
classroom. One week later, under continued parent pressure, the district agreed 
to move the transformer away from the bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the DWP nor the district have a standard for acceptable EMF levels. 
But the measurements at Dixie Canyon and the parent outrage about them prompted 
a district review of 27,000 sets of plans for 650 school sites to determine how 
many transformers are located next to classrooms. Officials are also examining 
a range of ways to move or shield transformers deemed too close. The remedies 
range from about $10,000 to about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't ignore this," Wong said. "But I think we need to go to someone to 
establish a standard. The school district is not a research institute." SUSAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GROUP DISCOURAGES PETS AS EASTER GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are cute, fuzzy and cuddly at first, but the more you keep them around, 
the less your family may appreciate them. 
</P>
<P>
 They are live bunnies, chicks and ducklings and San Fernando Valley animal 
advocates are discouraging people from giving them as Easter gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Martine Colette, executive director of the Wildlife Waystation in Tujunga, 
said that these baby animals often become more like household pests than pets 
as they age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chickies are really cute, but three weeks from now, they look rather 
chicken-like and not so cute," Colette said. "And what are you going to do with 
a crowing rooster when they wake the neighborhood up?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to Colette, many people simply do not know what to do with them when 
the animals get older. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks after every Easter, Colette's nonprofit agency receives a few 
dozen calls for help from frustrated owners whose gifts have grown beyond their 
control and appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ducks are extremely messy," Colette said. "Their manure is everywhere. It's 
on the grass; it's on the patio. No one wants to be stepping on manure." 
</P>
<P>
 Even bunnies outgrow their owners' affections. And in most cases, Colette 
said, it is the children who get tired of taking care of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabbits become a responsibility," Colette said. "Who's going to clean up 
after the rabbit? Who's going to feed the rabbit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Because her animal refuge is designed primarily to care for abandoned wild and 
exotic animals, Colette cannot accept unwanted rabbits, chickens and ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some pet and feed stores may take the grown animals back, Collete has 
one piece of advice that will avoid any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are planning to give a small animal as an Easter gift "should get 
one in plush velvet," she said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TAFT HIGH'S FORENSICS TEAM WINS TOURNEY

 For some students in the San Fernando Valley, success has just four letters: 
T-A-F-T. 
</P>
<P>
 Known around the state for its successful academic decathlon team, Taft High 
School in Woodland Hills scored another victory this weekend when its speech 
and debate team took first place at the qualifying competition at Camarillo 
High School for the national championship in June. 
</P>
<P>
 With the highest combined score of its 10 best students, Taft was named the 
sweepstakes champion of the competition of about 27 teams in the West Los 
Angeles National Forensics League Division that competed in the two-day 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, eight students from Valley high schools will travel to the National 
Forensics League competition in Kansas City, Mo., this summer. They include two 
students from Taft, three from Cleveland High School, two from Granada Hills 
High School and one from Calabasas High School, who will join about 1,900 
students from all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft also won the San Fernando Valley league championship in February and will 
send seven students to the state championships at the end of April. The 
victories reflect the growth of a team from seven students three years ago to 
nearly 30 active members today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Nord, 17, a senior at Taft who placed second in the United States 
Extemporaneous event over the weekend, qualifying to compete in the national 
competition, credits his coach Calvin Vande Hoef for making the team a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taft had never really been a powerhouse until last year," he said. "Now 
everybody fears us.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like going from an underdog to a top dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Vande Hoef, who created the team five years ago, said he recruited students by 
posting flyers and asking team members to tell their friends about the program. 
The team's competitive spirit reflects his nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only do things one way," Vande Hoef said. "If it can be bigger and 
better, that's my next goal." SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGES ALLOCATE $500,000 FOR REPAIRS

<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College District has set aside $500,000 to repair 
earthquake-damaged facilities, of which about $200,000 has been spent, 
according to a district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Fausto Capobianco said about $200,000 has been spent on inspections, 
structural reinforcements, debris removal, overtime pay for repair work, and 
facilities equipment and supplies.The $500,000 came from a contingency reserve 
fund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is counting on being reimbursed when it receives an anticipated 
grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to restore it to pre-quake 
operating levels. The district is asking for a $4-million grant, although the 
amount remains the subject of negotiations with FEMA, Capobianco said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a district board of trustees meeting today, the board will consider 
authorizing the chancellor to submit and sign paperwork for the first 
installment of the district's FEMA grant. Capobianco said he expects the grant 
in one to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $4 million in damages claimed by the district, Pierce College suffered 
$2.1 million in losses; Valley College, $740,000, and Mission College, 
$135,000. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PUTTING NAMES IN THE PAPER IS A FAMILY 
BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For longtime residents of the northeast San Fernando Valley, it is hard to 
imagine an heir apparent to Thelma Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic, 75-year-old editor and publisher of Mission Independent 
Community Newspapers, which includes the San Fernando Valley Sun, Valley View 
and Record Ledger weeklies, has been chronicling Valley minutia for more than 
30 years -- about as long as some San Fernando City Council candidates have 
been alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun, the chain's flagship paper, is in its 90th year of publication, 
having withstood the Depression, the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and a brief 
ownership by the Hearst Corp., among other things. The weekly paper has a 
circulation of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barrios family bought the three weeklies, along with the former Sun Valley 
Scene, from Hearst in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Sun has carved out a niche as the community newspaper 
where no local news is deemed unimportant. Barrios once said that the goal of 
the Sun was to "put the names of as many people as we can in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 An Ohio native, Barrios began working at the San Fernando Sun, then a 
semiweekly, in 1958. She had to work three years at the Sun before she was 
given an editorial position -- as editor of the Sun's "women's pages." 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years of writing and editing the Sun, she quit in April, 1985, 
frustrated by the way the "people from back East" were running the paper. 
Hearst owned the paper from 1981 until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after her "retirement," Barrios started her own weekly, the 
Independent, to compete with Hearst's Sun. In October, 1985, Hearst sold its 
Valley weeklies to Barrios, who combined the Sun and Independent into today's 
Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sun, as far as we were concerned, was back to being a community 
newspaper," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Barrios is asked who could possibly succeed her, she says there is an 
obvious choice: Marianne Barrios, her star reporter and daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a nose for news," she said of her 46-year-old protege, whose first 
job in journalism was at the Sun in the late 1980s. "You'd think she'd been 
doing this all her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Barrios, a jack-of-all trades for the family business, is the chain's 
main photographer, as well as general business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of work," she said, but with "Mom" as she affectionately calls 
Thelma Barrios, around, "I've come to really enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne entered the business to straighten out what she said was a "sloppy" 
financial situation after the demise of El Sol, the chain's failed 
Spanish-language weekly. She stayed because she felt she had to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel obligated in that this is a family business and I'm carrying the 
ball," Marianne Barrios said. "There's nobody else to do it. The newspaper is 
hardly swimming in wealth, but it's got a better identity than ever." MIGUEL

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; NEW SENIORS CENTER TO HOUSE 2 FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new senior citizens center that will bring two existing facilities under one 
roof is under construction in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Two attached buildings on Glenoaks Boulevard will house the Pacoima 
Multipurpose Senior Citizens Center and the Pacoima Senior Citizens For United 
Concern facility, making it possible for seniors to seek a variety of services 
at one site. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a much-needed facility in the northeast San Fernando Valley," said 
Frank Catania of the Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation's Planning 
and Development Division, which is in charge of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is about 85% completed and is expected to open by July 1, 
according to Catania. Thousands of seniors from the northeast Valley are 
expected to take advantage of the combined centers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated on two acres, the 15,000-square-foot complex will contain a facility 
to care for the frail elderly, an auditorium for recreation, several small 
rooms for counseling, and a multipurpose room for nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other social service organizations that focus on the needs of the elderly have 
also been asked to consider joining the two senior centers in the new building, 
and several community organizations have already expressed interest, Catania 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, we have two senior citizens centers in Pacoima, and when we 
combine, we'll be able to streamline," said Ethel May, director of the Pacoima 
Senior Citizens for United Concern center. "We'll provide more services, and 
we'll be able to refer people to each other more easily." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima Senior Citizens For United Concern center, on Glenoaks Boulevard, 
provides classes, trips, lectures, health screenings and counseling for 
seniors. The Multipurpose Senior Citizens Center, on Van Nuys Boulevard, mostly 
provides health care for frail elderly on an outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-time director will be assigned to coordinate the blending of the groups 
into one building, and will also be in charge of creating new programs, said 
Gat Lum of the Department of Parks and Recreation's Special Facility Services, 
which includes senior activities. 
</P>
<P>
 May said the Senior Citizens For United Concern center would like to add 
shuffleboard, light dancing programs and an exercise room in the new facility.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; ACCOUNTANT CHALLENGES 2 INCUMBENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Calabasas City Council members are up for reelection against a traffic and 
financial expert in the city's second election since it incorporated three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Dennis Washburn and Bob Hill, seeking second terms in the April 12 
contest, have touted their accomplishments during the start-up of the city, 
including establishment of a library, acquisition of land for four parks and a 
tennis and swim club, and an increase in public safety and sheriff's services. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Rosenquist, the only challenger in the race, said his experience as a 
certified public accountant and member of the city's Traffic and Transportation 
Commission would come in handy as the city attempts to preserve its rural 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to prevent our streets and our city from being overwhelmed by 
traffic from unwanted development, No. 1," Rosenquist said. "No. 2, if you do 
proper financial planning for a city, you don't end up needing to approve 
development just to maintain your services." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenquist moved to Calabasas from Tarzana four years ago and, two years 
later, helped found Citizens for Stopping Ahmanson Ranch to fight the nearby 
planned 3,050-home golf course community, which was approved by Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenquist, 46, lives with his wife, Debbie, and two preschool-age children in 
the Malibu Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 57, was president of the Calabasas Cityhood Committee, and lobbied 
lawmakers in Los Angeles and in Sacramento between 1985 and 1991 to allow 
formation of the city after a series of unpopular planning decisions by the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our group has taken our money back from the county and been able to increase 
services in many areas," he said. "I think everyone feels pretty good about 
what we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, an investment banker, has lived in Calabasas since 1971 with his wife, 
Kathleen. They have four children between the ages of 21 and 35. 
</P>
<P>
 As founding mayor, Washburn, 51, was in charge of operations during Calabasas' 
fledgling year, until a city manager was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the council's accomplishments he values most are measures to protect 
open space and the city's dwindling number of oak trees, and construction of an 
"environmentally safe" City Hall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've accomplished an amazing amount of work in three years," Washburn said. 
"And when you can respond to crises like earthquakes, fires and floods with the 
kudos of your citizens and no injuries, those are pretty neat accomplishments. 
It proves we can take care of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn's credentials on environmental matters include his current posts as 
president of the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District and 
chairman of the Santa Monica Mountains Parklands Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Washburn were the top vote-getters in an election before the city 
incorporated. The other three founding council members were elected to second 
terms two years ago. The terms are for four years. KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; BUSINESSES SOUGHT FOR EFFORT TO HELP YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Burbank businesses is forming a coalition to help police give 
youths alternatives to drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I owe something back to the community," said Bruce Ferguson, an 
account executive for a Burbank advertising agency who is trying to put 
together the Alliance of Business Community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson saw firsthand the effects of drug abuse during his years driving an 
ambulance in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's aim is to work with the Police Department's anti-drug program, 
Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), to give kids role models, donations to 
pay for special programs, or maybe even some work or volunteer experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Police hope that the new coalition will give kids the support they need to 
make it in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a need out there," said Sgt. Bob Brode of the Police Department's 
juvenile division. "It is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, police officers visit school campuses to tell students how 
to say no to drugs, as well as a variety of ways to say it that help them 
resist peer pressure and retain their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 At-risk youths -- those on the edge of joining gangs or participating in 
criminal activity -- are often referred to Burbank's Outreach Center, but Brode 
worries that Burbank does not do enough to help the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the vast untapped groups that aren't in trouble with the law?" 
Brode asks. "What about those kids who don't want to belong to gangs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fund raising will be the primary work of the coalition. But Ferguson said he 
hopes that the project will go beyond that, with business leaders helping 
youths in one-on-one relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also would support the DARE program by providing speakers and role 
models and financially helping youths join in activities that they would not 
have been able to afford. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Brode is the deputy commander for the Burbank Squadron of the 
Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary to the U. S. Air Force that gets youths involved 
in aviation and teaches them about leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is great for kids because it gets them interested in something 
other than gangs, Brode said. But many of those who would join don't because 
they can't afford the membership fees, uniforms and other expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new business coalition should be able to get kids into the Civil Air 
Patrol or similar organizations, Brode said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of kids who don't want to be involved in gangs," Brode said. 
"They want to go somewhere in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting for business people interested in helping the coalition is scheduled 
for April 20 at 4 p.m. at the Burbank police station. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WILSON APPOINTS 2 TO FAIR BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Moriarty of Calabasas and Robert Wilcox of Northridge have been appointed 
to the San Fernando Valley Fair Board of Directors by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarty is a trial attorney who has practiced in Van Nuys for 20 years.Wilcox 
has been president of Wilcox Public Relations of Los Angeles since forming the 
firm last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointees replace outgoing board members Rockwell Ames and Dallas 
Boardman. Ames joined in 1990 and Boardman, who was board president from 1985 
to 1989, served since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 At its March 18 meeting, the board gave Boardman the Western Fairs Assn. Blue 
Ribbon Award. Also at the meeting, the board members elected Sal Buccieri of 
Sepulveda president. Pamela Corradi of Burbank will serve as second vice 
president and Joyce Van Schaack of Tarzana will serve as first vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair board members are gubernatorial appointees who serve four-year terms 
without pay.  
</P>
<P>
 The board members also decided to waive competitive exhibit fees for this 
year's fair, though prize money and awards will still be given out. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, entry fees totaled only about $4,000, said Georgia Cluver, 
spokeswoman for the 51st District Agricultural Assn., which puts on the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cost more in time and people to process those fees," Cluver said, 
explaining why the fees were waived. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, in its 48th year, will run July 21 to 24 at the Los Angeles 
Equestrian Center in Burbank, with an Old West theme titled "We've Got Your Fun 
Covered." 
</P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN SPRING BREAK FALLS VICTIM TO QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of vacationing out of town or soaking up rays at the nearest beach, 
students at Cal State University Northridge are attending classes this week to 
catch up with the school calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastating Jan. 17 earthquake that left the campus with up to $350 
million in damage also shook up the spring semester schedule by delaying the 
start of classes for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for lost time, officials canceled spring break for the university's 
24,813 students and added another week of classes to the end of the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students have been under unusual conditions where the loss of spring 
break seems to not be as big an impact as we thought it would be," said Kaine 
Thompson, a university spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus activities office is trying to take students' minds off the 
situation with a series of events called Spring Break on Campus, including 
volleyball tournaments and band performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're accepting of it, but it doesn't make it any easier," said 
Rodney Lazar, a senior and vice president of Associated Students. "We're used 
to the daily ritual -- the sounds of trucks rolling by, huge forklifts going 
by, hammers, the constant humming of generators, mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame the administration at all. They did the best with the time they 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than extend classes further into the summer, Thompson said, 
administrators canceled spring break to help seniors graduate on time and to 
start summer school without too much delay. 
</P>
<P>
 That suits students like Jason Burrows just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me at all," said the 24-year-old senior majoring in 
finance. "I'd like to graduate as soon as possible and start working. It's not 
that big a deal to me." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

LANCASTER MAN COMES TO AID OF 71-YEAR-OLD HOLDUP VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A good Samaritan thwarted a street robbery Tuesday, chasing down a youth who 
ripped more than $900 in cash from the hands of a 71-year-old man who had just 
left a liquor store, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Panos of Lancaster said a 16-year-old boy approached him outside the 
Village Liquor store in the 300 block of East Avenue I about 3:30 p.m., asking 
if he had change for a $20 bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'No,' and he grabbed my money and was gone," said Panos, who had just 
returned from the bank. The robber also took a rosary pouch containing a lock 
of hair, a wedding ring and a crucifix belonging to his deceased wife, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Perreira, 34, also of Lancaster, who witnessed the robbery from his 
car in the parking lot, chased the youth in his car and then on foot for at 
least four blocks through a park and an apartment complex, catching him in a 
vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He yelled at me that he had a gun, but by that time I was close enough to 
tackle him," Perreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth offered Perreira half the loot to let him go. When he refused, the 
youth unsuccessfully offered the same deal to onlookers, Perreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a soft spot for old people getting knocked over (robbed)," Perreira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perreira detained the youth for about five minutes until police arrived, he 
said. The youth bit him on the elbow but Perreira was otherwise unhurt, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies discovered crack cocaine on the youth, who led them to the 
spot where he tossed away Panos' pouch of personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't many people who would do this for me and I'm grateful to this 
guy," said Panos, a retired factory worker from northeast Ohio. "I hope they 
give him a commendation."

CITY SLAPS RESTRICTIONS ON MOTEL IN NORTH HILLS; CRIME: THE ACTION IS PART OF A 
CRACKDOWN ON PROSTITUTION. OWNER CALLS THE MOVE UNFAIR AND PLANS TO FIGHT THE 
CURBS IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to impose tough 
restrictions on a North Hills motel that police say is regularly used for 
prostitution, despite appeals from the motel owner that he has tried to battle 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Yung Jung Tsai, owner of the Redwood Inn Motel on Sepulveda 
Boulevard, called the restrictions unfair and said he planned to fight the 
city's restrictions in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the conditions are unconstitutional on their face," said attorney 
Pierpont M. Laidley, referring specifically to a condition that the manager be 
fluent in English. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions are the latest action the city has taken to crack down on 
crime at motels and hotels along Sepulveda Boulevard. Police say they have made 
468 arrests for a variety of crimes last year in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 To tackle problems at the Redwood Inn, the council voted to impose 27 
conditions on operations, including requirements that a security guard patrol 
the motel 16 hours a day and that rooms never be rented on an hourly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials said the restrictions are aimed at eliminating 
prostitution at the hotel. They have accused the motel's management of 
knowingly renting to prostitutes at hourly rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Capt. Vance Proctor, who oversees patrols in the area, said 
the owner has refused to cooperate with police to eliminate the problems -- a 
charge the owner's attorney denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Laidley said Tsai has tried to work with police, but cannot comply with the 
city-imposed restrictions because they are too costly. He said he planned to 
file a lawsuit against the city because the standards the city used to declare 
the motel a public nuisance are vague. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the standard by which the owner can determine if he is in compliance 
with the rules of the city?" Laidley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for the Greater Los Angeles Hotel/Motel Assn. supported Tsai, 
saying the city should try harder to work with the motel instead of imposing 
restrictions that will only make it more difficult to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district includes the motel, said similar 
restrictions have reduced crime problems at other motels along Sepulveda 
Boulevard. "The problems of this area are tied to the problems of the motel; 
they are all tied in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the council's planning committee, urged 
Tsai to work with the city or face losing his operating permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the owner of the motel," he said, "this is your wake-up call."

SUIT CONTENDS OWNERS OF COLLAPSED BUILDING DEFAULTED ON LOAN; AFTERMATH: AN 
ATTORNEY FOR SHASHIKANT AND RENUKA JOGANI SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A 
'RESOLUTION.'

 The owners of the Northridge Meadows apartments, already facing several 
lawsuits in connection with the building's collapse in the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
have defaulted on a $14.7-million loan for seven other buildings they own, 
according to an investors' lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shashikant and Renuka Jogani, owners of Northridge Meadows and about 50 other 
apartment buildings, defaulted on Feb. 1 and owe $145,429 in back payments, 
according to a foreclosure suit filed Monday in Superior Court by a New 
York-based group of foreign investors, the WHC-One Limited Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the investors would not comment. But Jay Ford, a lawyer for the 
Joganis, said, "We are right now in the process of trying to negotiate a 
resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show the Joganis have recently faced several other foreclosures, 
but the suits ultimately were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven E. Glass, another of Jogani's lawyers, said foreclosure suits are not 
uncommon, especially during the recession, as lenders and building owners 
reorganize their payment terms to adjust for lost income and equity. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest foreclosure action involves properties in the San Fernando Valley, 
Jogani's attorneys said. Some, but not all, are in the quake zone and were 
damaged. None of the buildings in question were red-tagged, and Northridge 
Meadows does not appear to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In their suit, the investors are seeking a court-appointed receiver to collect 
rents and maintain the complexes, which have been purchased since 1986. In 
addition, the investors are asking the court to allow the receiver to hire 
environmental specialists, gain access to the buildings' plans and construction 
documentation and make sure the buildings are properly insured. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three years ago, Shashikant Jogani, an Indian immigrant who once worked 
as a hotel bellhop, was one of Los Angeles' largest landlords, controlling more 
than $375 million worth of residential real estate. The recession crippled him. 
But the quake dealt a crushing blow, damaging several of Jogani's buildings, 
including Northridge Meadows, where 16 tenants died. 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani said last month that the recession and quake had wiped out the equity 
he'd built in his once formidable empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, relatives of two women who died in the Northridge Meadows collapse 
sued the Joganis, as well as the builder, architect and engineer, alleging that 
negligence led to the collapse and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows will be demolished floor by floor next month under a court 
order that preserves evidence of the building's construction and materials.

SYLMAR MAN ORDERED TO START JAIL TERM FOR NOT PAYING TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sylmar man convicted in 1991 on three counts of failing to file state income 
tax returns was ordered to begin serving a 630-day jail sentence after the 
state appellate court rejected his challenge to the lower court decision, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Allen, 51, described by prosecutors as a tax protester, was ordered to 
report April 7 to Van Nuys Municipal Court, where he will be taken into custody 
to begin a County Jail sentence, said Mike Qualls, spokesman in the Los Angeles 
city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Court of Appeal issued the order to Allen last week, Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the appeals court challenge, Allen took the conviction to the Los 
Angeles Superior Court Appellate Department the same day he was sentenced in 
August, 1991, the release said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was convicted after a three-day trial a month earlier. Charges were 
filed against him after an investigation by the state Franchise Tax Board 
office in Van Nuys, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen failed to pay more than $7,200 in state income taxes and refused to file 
income tax returns between 1985 and 1987, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Cocek, a deputy city attorney who prosecuted the case, said Allen, an 
architectural drafter, failed to file state income tax statements for about 10 
years.

VALLEY BRIEFING: AFTERSHOCKS THERAPY; UNDERSTANDING EARTHQUAKES AND THEIR 
OFFSPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For millions of Southern Californians violently awakened in the darkness Jan. 
17, the events of 4:31 a.m. will live on in memory as a single, terrible 
instant in time -- the 1994 Northridge earthquake. However, it is important to 
realize that earthquakes are almost always part of a sequence of related 
seismic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists refer to the temblor with the largest magnitude as the 
mainshock. Smaller quakes before and after the mainshock are called foreshocks 
and aftershocks, respectively. Although the greatest amount of energy is 
released in the mainshock, much of the redistributed stress is later released 
along the fault in the form of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to seismologists, the mainshock of the Jan. 17 earthquake struck at 
4:30:55 a.m. one mile south-southwest of Northridge at a point approximately 11 
to 12 miles beneath the earth's surface. It was initially described as a 
magnitude 6.6 quake, but Caltech later upgraded the figure to 6.7. Using a 
different measuring system, the National Earthquake Information Center in 
Golden, Colo. placed the magnitude at 6.8. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, seismologists have identified more than 6,000 aftershocks to the 
initial earthquake, including 317 magnitude 3.0-3.9, 43 magnitude 4.0- 4.9 and 
seven 5.0-5.9. How Earthquakes Happen 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake occurs when rocks along a fault in the earth's crust slip 
suddenly, releasing energy in the form of seismic waves. Beginning at a single 
point known as the hypocenter, the quake actually represents a rupture along a 
varying length of the fault. The epicenter is the point on the earth's surface 
directly above the hypocenter. Living With Aftershocks 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of aftershocks declines quickly following the mainshock, the relative 
number of small to large aftershocks does not. Seismologists have estimated 
that for every magnitude 5 aftershock in a sequence, there will be roughly 10 
magnitude 4s, 100 magnitude 3s and 1,000 magnitude 2s. Therefore, a magnitude 5 
aftershock striking weeks after a larger mainshock is entirely consistent with 
previous recorded seismic activity. In fact, it should be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude difference between a mainshock and the largest aftershock 
averages 1.2, so a 6.8 earthquake would have few aftershocks greater than 5.6. 
A quake is considered an aftershock as long as the rate of seismic activity is 
greater than the rate preceding the mainshock. A Quake's Energy Earthquakes 
release energy that scientists measure in metric units called ergs. One erg is 
the amount of energy it takes to move one gram of mass one centimeter in one 
second. Some examples of an earthquake's energy force: Energy released (in 
millions of ergs): Energy released (in millions of ergs): 
20,000,000,000,000,000 Magnitude (not to scale): 7 Example or equivalent: 
Energy generated by Niagara Falls in four months Energy released (in millions 
of ergs): 600,000,000,000,000 Magnitude (not to scale): 6 Example or 
equivalent: Energy to launch 2 million NASA space shuttles Energy released (in 
millions of ergs): 20,000,000,000,000 Magnitude (not to scale): 5 Example or 
equivalent: Energy created by atomic bomb test in 1945. Energy released (in 
millions of ergs): 600,000,000,000 Magnitude (not to scale): 4 Example or 
equivalent: Kiloton of TNT exploding Energy released (in millions of ergs): 
20,000,000,000 Magnitude (not to scale): 3 Example or equivalent: Smallest 
quakes commonly felt Magnitude 5 Aftershocks 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jan. 17, seven aftershocks of magnitude 5.0 or greater have occurred in 
Los Angeles and Ventura counties, causing additional damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey have said that the region has a better 
than 1-in-3 chance of another magnitude 5 aftershock within the next year.

COUNTY TO REPLACE VAL VERDE WATER TANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $1.4-million water tank that serves Val Verde and was severely damaged in 
the Northridge quake will be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works will front the money for the 
huge tank, but the federal government will reimburse the department for all but 
about $57,000 of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The tank will hold 1.28 million gallons -- more than enough to meet the 
domestic and fire suppression needs of about 700 Val Verde residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing tank had the same capacity, but is now so damaged that it only 
holds about a third as much water. County fire officials said that is still 
enough water to fight fires during the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the new tank is scheduled to be completed by mid-July, long 
before the fire season reaches its height, Los Angeles County Fire Capt. John 
Nieto said. TRACEY KAPLAN

PARKING TICKETS UP 60% OVER PRIOR YEAR; TRAFFIC: SANTA CLARITA HAS BROUGHT IN 
$6,550 SINCE IT TOOK OVER ADMINISTRATION. IT NO LONGER HAS TO SHARE REVENUE 
WITH THE COURTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 60% more parking tickets have been written since the city began 
processing them instead of the courts, and explanations for the surge range 
from convenience to coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 California law mandated cities to assume the administration of parking 
violations by Jan. 1. The new law switched the violations from a criminal to a 
civil matter, allowing cities to ease the workload of crowded municipal courts 
and earn more per citation. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita took over the process in October. Officials didn't anticipate a 
change in revenues or the number of tickets issued, but ticket writing jumped 
more than half from the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies wrote 940 parking citations in Santa Clarita from October 
through December, said city Finance Director Steve Stark; it was a 58.8% 
increase from the 592 tickets issued during those months in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good trend," said Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson, a law 
enforcement officer for 31 years. "If we have a parking ordinance, we need to 
enforce it because otherwise people will ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are unsure what prompted the flurry of additional citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest that it's due to a new appeal process that's less inconvenient 
for deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 With parking tickets no longer settled through criminal proceedings, deputies 
don't attend court whenever someone contests a citation. A deputy may be more 
willing to write a ticket without the prospect of spending an afternoon in 
court to verify it. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have appealed only 27 parking citations in the past six months, with 
14 of them dismissed. The most common appeals have been for not having a 
current registration sticker or parking in a handicapped zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say parking citations are more apt to be written when the revenue comes 
to the city. Santa Clarita used to pay 11 cents of every parking ticket dollar 
to the courts to cover processing costs, but now keeps the full amount. 
</P>
<P>
 City and law enforcement officials reject that explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to realize that the city and Sheriff's Department, and I think any 
other public agency, don't see parking citations or moving violations as a 
source for revenue," said Sgt. Steve Mulcahy, who handles traffic matters at 
the Santa Clarita station. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding credence to that view is that while more parking tickets were written 
once Santa Clarita took over the process, little more revenue has come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita received $6,550 between October and December for parking 
citations, a slight increase from the $6,011 grossed the year before. After the 
11% removed for processing, the city earned $5,350 from parking citations in 
the fourth quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose (for writing parking tickets) is to keep the streets clear. I 
want to see enforcement, but I want it to be a measured enforcement," Pederson 
said. "I don't want it to become a policy of the city that it's a money 
generator." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita parking fines range from $25 for being in a red zone to $325 for 
parking in a handicapped zone. They were not increased when the city took over 
the administrative process. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say parking citations often rise and fall from year to year, and the 
recent surge is simply coincidental with Santa Clarita taking over the 
administrative process.

PONY LEAGUE RELEASES COACH CONVICTED OF INJURING 11-YEAR-OLD; SPORTS: DIRECTORS 
RECEIVE AN ANONYMOUS TIP ABOUT THE RETIRED SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. HE KNEED A BOY IN 
THE GROIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Palmdale PONY League released an assistant coach Tuesday after learning 
that the man was convicted last year of kneeing an 11-year-old boy in the groin 
on a Little League field. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired sheriff's deputy, Michael J. DiDonna, was sentenced to 90 days in 
County Jail and three years probation in May after being convicted of 
misdemeanor inflicting injury on a child. He was also convicted of misdemeanor 
battery, a charge stemming from an unrelated incident in which he punched a 
man. DiDonna has appealed the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 DiDonna was selected as an assistant coach late last month. After the PONY 
League's 15-member board of directors received an anonymous call about 
DiDonna's conviction, it decided to release the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Lechner, PONY League president, said, "When we found out the problem, we 
went through our steps and he's now eliminated. You can't ask anything more out 
of an organization." 
</P>
<P>
 DiDonna declined to comment beyond saying the anonymous tip was the result of 
a personal feud. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has 40 ball teams for youths aged 5 to 14 and at least 80 volunteer 
coaches and managers, Lechner said. Parents of the 500-plus youth league 
members who are interested in coaching fill out an application and are then 
selected by the board of directors. Lechner said the application does not 
inquire about criminal background. 
</P>
<P>
 Edd Freeman, assistant region director for the PONY baseball West Zone High 
Desert Region, said guidelines are followed in selecting coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've had any problems in the past with law enforcement, we kind of shy 
away from those kinds of people," he said. "If we have information that you 
have had problems in the community, we shy away from those people." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "We don't want anybody that's going to hurt the kids or embarrass 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
 An administrator with PONY Baseball Inc., the Pennsylvania-based nonprofit 
corporation that operates PONY Baseball/Softball, said the organization does 
not have any requirements or rules about who should be allowed to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each league is just a registered entity with PONY baseball," said Abe Key, 
administrative director for PONY Baseball Inc. "The local organizing people are 
responsible solely for organizing their local league. We play no part in 
telling them how to operate or who to select as coaches, although we try to 
educate them about the proper selection process. Part of our responsibility is 
as an educational organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Lechner said the league was not aware of DiDonna's conviction for kneeing the 
11-year-old boy until the board received an anonymous call last week. Then 
newspaper clippings about DiDonna's May, 1993, convictions arrived at the 
league office over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took an action after we became aware of the problem," said Lechner, noting 
that the season began March 12 and that DiDonna had done a fine job. DiDonna 
and his son, who plays in the league, will continue to be members.

TAKING ON MEXICO'S PEOPLE PROBLEMS; ECONOMICS: PRESIDENT SALINAS' SUCCESSOR 
WILL FACE THE COUNTRY'S OVERWHELMING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OR PRESIDE OVER AN 
INCREASINGLY STRIFE-TORN NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In nearly six years as president of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari has done 
a masterful job of taming inflation, reducing the nation's budget deficit and 
attracting international investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salinas' policies have exacted enormous social costs at the same time that 
Mexico's new respect in the industrialized world and approval of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement have raised expectations among Mexicans for a 
better life. 
</P>
<P>
 The next president -- most likely Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party's (PRI) newly designated candidate to replace 
assassinated candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio -- will have to focus on solving 
the country's overwhelming social problems or risk presiding over an 
increasingly strife-torn nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a much more deliberate approach to (solving) extreme poverty" 
and to improving education, health, housing and other basic services, said Nora 
Lustig, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' priority was fighting inflation, which has fallen to about 8% from 
more than 50% six years ago. But the campaign required reduced public spending 
and a tight money policy that aggravated the impact of the global recession -- 
particularly the slowdown in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaried jobs in Mexico shrank by 2% in 1993 as the country slipped into a 
recession in the last half of the year, according to official statistics. 
Unemployment, including people not formally included in the work force, is an 
estimated 25%. Mexicans who kept their jobs found their spending power reduced 
because prices rose higher than wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' programs have created a "sound financial base" and fiscal stability 
for Mexico but at a great sacrifice by most Mexicans, said Scott E. Kalb, a 
Mexico analyst with Smith Barney Shearson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to turn to matters of creating better equity, and you do that by 
spending on social welfare, on education, health care and improvements. You 
need infrastructure in place or you get bottlenecks. If you don't spend on 
education, your economic progress will be inhibited by the capabilities of your 
work force," Kalb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts said Salinas' fiscal policies have provided some leeway for the 
next administration to increase public spending without reigniting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critical point is that Salinas' progress in achieving stability has paved 
the way for greater spending on health, education, bridges and roads," said 
Salomon Bros. economist Larry Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, a 42-year-old Yale-educated economist who served Salinas as minister 
of budget and planning before leaving to direct Colosio's campaign, on Tuesday 
spoke of the need to more equitably distribute the nation's economic gains. 
</P>
<P>
 In accepting the PRI nomination, he pledged to "greatly enhance regional 
development in every region of the country, particularly those which have been 
left behind in the greater advancement of the country." He also promised to 
"further an economy of certainty based on healthy public finances that will 
directly benefit the standard of living of all Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Economists reacted favorably to Zedillo's designation as a sign of continuity 
from the Salinas regime. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also approval -- though restrained -- from investors. The Mexican 
Stock Exchange, which had dropped 3% Monday and continued downward in early 
trading Tuesday, rebounded with the news that Zedillo was named. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo "is the best candidate that PRI could get under these conditions," 
said Josue Campos Campuzano, an economist with the Wharton Econometric 
Forecasting Assn., a Philadelphia-based think tank that studies Mexico. "He 
knows the politics and the economics of the old guard and of the avant-garde of 
the PRI. He will work to consolidate them."  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his policies, Mexico's next president will be much more subject to 
outside political pressures and less free than Salinas to impose technocratic 
solutions, said Rudi Dornbusch, professor of economics at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic issues are going to be far more politicized than in the past," 
Dornbusch said. "Democracy has arrived and that makes economic policy-making 
much harder. Remedies to poverty will be far more important and politicized 
than in the past six years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico will become a real country. It's been the dream of a technocrat for 
the last six years," Dornbusch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advice? Dornbusch of MIT said his suggestions to the new president are an 
immediate 30% devaluation of the Mexican peso, a move that would create more 
demand for Mexican goods by making them cheaper on foreign markets. That, in 
turn, would create more manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a devaluation is not likely. But, even without such sweeping measures and 
despite last year's recession, most Mexico experts expected the country to 
bounce back with economic growth of 3% or more in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of us who look at Mexico on a daily basis, things have been looking 
up lately," said Lawrence Krohn, an emerging markets analyst with Lehman Bros. 
"Anecdotal evidence suggests that the economy is recovering in the first 
quarter in retail sales and manufacturing." Economy at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Taming inflation has been one of Mexico's greatest economic successes in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation rate: 9.0% But the tight money and other austerity policies used to 
fight inflation have been costly in terms of slower economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross domestic product (percent change): 2.3% And higher unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment rate: 10.8%

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HAS THE BEAR STARTED TO GROWL?; RISING GLOOM ON WALL 
ST. RAISES RISK OF MAJOR SELLOFF 
</P>

 Stock prices plunged Tuesday, reflecting a deepening pessimism that could 
herald the most severe market pullback since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 63.33 points to 3,699.02, marking its 
lowest close since Dec. 1 of last year after the sixth losing session of the 
last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was far worse in the broad market, where losing stocks outnumbered 
winners by a stunning 20 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the numbers is a spreading gloom on Wall Street that threatens to 
trigger a cascade of selling, reflecting investors' pent-up worries about 
rising interest rates and inflation, the Clinton Administration's political 
quagmire and a host of overseas problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's starting to snowball," warns James Stack, publisher of the InvesTech 
market newsletter in Whitefish, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 While stock pros have long been predicting a classic market "correction" -- a 
fast decline in stock prices of 10% to 15%, followed by a rally to new highs -- 
the debate has already moved beyond that level. Now, many Wall Streeters 
suggest that stocks could be in the throes of a true bear market that could 
hack 20%, 30% or more from prices and keep them down for a surprisingly long 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the notion of a bear market may seem absurd with the economy finally in 
a strong upturn, it is precisely that economic strength that has tripped 
markets this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Federal Reserve Board tightened credit in February for the first 
time in five years, investors have begun to see long-forgotten ghosts in every 
market corner: the ghost of inflation (from the 1970s), the ghost of soaring 
interest rates (from the early 1980s) and the ghost of market crashes (from 
1987). 
</P>
<P>
 Ghosts scare people, even people who ought to know better. And the greatest 
risk to the stock market today is that there are more players in it -- 
institutional and individual -- than ever before. It may require only that a 
relatively small percentage of them become afraid, and sell, to take stock 
prices well beyond the usual 10%-to-15% correction parameters, some analysts 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the market's sharply rising fear level today is the penalty for the 
general lack of fear over the past three years. As interest rates dropped 
gradually to 20-year, then 30-year lows between 1990 and 1993, so much money 
moved into stocks -- betting on the future -- that the broad market was pushed 
inexorably higher. The lack of volatility in stock prices lulled many investors 
into believing the market was a low-risk bet. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the Dow industrials have been ratcheting painfully downward 
since late January, just before the Fed's initial boost in short-term interest 
rates. The Dow now is off 7% from its peak. Smaller stocks, which had rallied 
even as the Dow languished earlier this month, have collapsed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet until now, many Wall Street pros have remained stoically bullish, 
maintaining that interest rate and inflation fears were overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, more of those bulls began to raise red flags, triggering a new 
wave of selling: 
</P>
<P>
 * Smith Barney Shearson, the nation's biggest retail brokerage, told clients 
to trim stock and bond holdings and hold more of their assets in cash. The firm 
had been recommending a portfolio of 55% stocks, 30% bonds and 15% cash. It 
changed the mix to 50% stocks, 25% bonds and 25% cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Acuff, chief investment strategist at Smith Barney, said his firm's 
caution reflects a higher level of risk in the market, as short-term interest 
rates have moved up and more investors look to take profits in stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuff says he's still in the "correction" camp, projecting, at worst, a 15% 
average drop in stock prices, from peak to bottom, in the near term. With the 
Dow already down 7%, the decline could be half over, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dean Witter Reynolds, another brokerage with a huge individual-investor 
clientele, made an even more dramatic shift in its recommended portfolio late 
Tuesday. The firm suggested that investors reduce stocks from 60% of assets to 
50% and bonds from 35% to 25%, and raise cash to 25% from 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Smith Barney's Acuff, Dean Witter investment strategist William Dodge 
professes to be turning cautious, not outright bearish. "The tendency (on Wall 
Street) will be to make this look like the beginning of the end" of stocks' 
bull market, Dodge says. He doesn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
 After another 6%-to-8% average decline in stock prices, Dodge expects the 
market to move higher over the next 12 to 18 months, tracking the expanding 
economy and rising corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 He could be right, of course. If interest rates stabilize and economic growth 
continues at a moderate pace, in theory there should be hordes of investors 
waiting to buy stocks at cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But note: What the Smith Barneys and the Dean Witters are counting on is that 
enough buyers will surface at the traditional market correction parameters to 
turn the stock market around before the decline becomes an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as many foreign stocks have plunged this year, the result has been much 
less interest in them, not more. Ditto for long-term bonds. So it's hard to 
understand why investors would treat plummeting U.S. stocks differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, stock indexes this week have fallen below key "technical" levels, 
triggering "sell" signals for short-term traders. Both the Standard & Poor's 
500 index and the Nasdaq composite, for example, have dropped below their 
200-day moving averages, important price levels at which buyers are supposed to 
emerge -- but haven't so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, widely followed investor advisory services, such as the Huntington 
Beach-based Telephone Switch Newsletter, have yet to issue "sell" signals but 
will be forced to do so if the market declines by a couple more percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, even for long-term investors eager to buy, the smarter strategy now 
may be to stay sidelined and let the market shake itself out. Since 1990, many 
people have only known how to buy stocks. They've never had good reason to 
sell. Suddenly, they're finding reasons, and they're acting on them. It would 
be nice to believe that the market can neatly right itself within the bounds of 
a 10%-to-15% decline, but rarely do stocks accommodate the masses so readily.

LENDERS SCRAMBLE TO KEEP HOUSING COMEBACK ALIVE; REAL ESTATE: RISING INTEREST 
RATES THREATEN A SOUTHLAND MARKET SHOWING SIGNS OF REBOUNDING AFTER FOUR BAD 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lenders are scrambling to keep the recent sharp rise in interest rates on 
fixed mortgages from scuttling a promising spring home-buying season in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Many financial institutions have begun aggressively marketing loans designed 
to keep their borrowers' initial monthly payments to a minimum, trying to take 
the sting out of a nearly one percentage point rise in mortgage rates in recent 
weeks that has added more than $100 a month to the cost of a typical $150,000 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents, meantime, are busy soothing the jangled nerves of home 
shoppers while they also struggle to complete deals that were reached before 
mortgage rates took their first big jump last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interest rates haven't risen enough to pull the plug on the market's 
comeback, but we want to make sure that (the recent increase) doesn't even let 
any water out of the tub," said Ann Carlton Bose, president of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers and owner of Estate Funding 
Inc. in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates on fixed, 30-year loans hit a record 25-year low of 6.83% last October, 
according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. After slowly drifting upward, 
they jumped sharply when the Federal Reserve Board raised the federal funds 
rate in early February and then surged again when the Fed boosted the rate a 
second time last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates now average about 8.04%, meaning that the monthly cost of a new, 
$150,000 loan is about $102 higher than it was just 10 weeks ago and $125 
higher than it was last fall. More upward pressure was put on mortgage rates 
Tuesday, when the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 7.06% from 7.01%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the rate hikes have come just as Southern California's housing 
market has been showing solid sales gains after spending most of the past four 
years flat on its back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new home sales in the West -- where 
California accounts for about half of all sales activity -- surged a surprising 
28% in February from January, compared to a modest 2% increase nationwide. The 
California Assn. of Realtors reported last week that statewide home resales 
rose 22% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Few real estate experts say the rate run-up will torpedo what so far promises 
to be the best spring home-buying season since the boom days of the late 1980s. 
However, some consumers say the rate increases are forcing them to rethink 
their home-buying plans. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wendy Veltroz started looking for a Riverside County home in the $115,000 
range two months ago, a banker told her that a 7% loan for about $105,000 would 
cost her $700 a month. But with rates now at 8%, she's been told that she will 
have to pay nearly $775. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy-five bucks might not seem like a lot of money to some people, but 
it's a whole lot of money to me," said Veltroz, a single mother who earns about 
$25,000 a year as a data entry clerk for a medical supplies company. "I'm not 
going to quit looking for a house, but I might have to look for one that's a 
little cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Keenly aware that the rate hikes have been especially hard on buyers on tight 
monthly budgets, many lenders have launched aggressive marketing campaigns, 
encouraging borrowers to choose adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with rates 
that start out more than two percentage points lower than the rates charged on 
fixed-rate loans. The lower initial rate can trim hundreds of dollars off a 
homeowner's initial monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When fixed rates were down in the 6% range, nobody wanted to talk much about 
ARMS," said Bob Barnum, president of American Savings Bank in Irvine. "Now 
fixed rates are close to 8%, but ARMs still start around 4%, and a lot of 
people are choosing an ARM so they can borrow more money and buy a much nicer 
house than they could with a fixed-rate loan." 
</P>
<P>
 With interest rates rising and the rush to refinance largely over, other 
lenders are trying to boost their mortgage business by offering more loan 
programs that require small down payments. 
</P>
<P>
 These so-called low-down loans were once marketed almost exclusively to 
cash-strapped first-time buyers. But with home prices off more than 20% from 
their 1990 peak, their appeal has been broadened to include existing homeowners 
who want to buy a new house but won't have much cash left over when their old 
one is sold and their current loan is paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downturn in values has created a whole new group of customers for our 
low-down-payment plans," said Bob Garman of Riverside-based Directors Mortgage 
Loan Corp., which has added three new programs that require down payments of 5% 
or less over the past two months and plans on adding two more soon.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: POINTS RULING COULD BE WINDFALL FOR 
HOMEOWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Internal Revenue Service ruling this week could create a bonanza for 
millions of homeowners, touch off a flood of amended tax filings and change how 
homes are sold and financed. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS, reversing decades-old practice, ruled that mortgage interest points 
-- one of the biggest up-front costs of closing a home loan -- are now 
immediately deductible even when the seller pays them. Points also are 
immediately deductible even if financed over the life of the loan, the IRS 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, points that were paid by the seller could not be deducted by the 
buyer. Points that were financed were usually deducted over the life of the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS ruling is particularly significant because it is retroactive to the 
beginning of 1991, which could allow millions of homeowners to amend past 
years' returns to claim refunds. Roughly 12 million homes changed hands during 
that three-year period and real estate agents estimate that well over half of 
those included seller-paid points, said Douglas Duncan, economist with the 
Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a study by the California Assn. of Realtors found that 80% of the home 
sales completed in 1993 included seller financing of a portion of the buyer's 
closing costs. The median amount that sellers paid was $2,500, said Mike 
Jacinto, vice chairman of the real estate finance committee at the California 
Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on these estimates, the Mortgage Bankers Assn. calculates that the new 
IRS ruling could free up more than $3 billion in tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the ruling could change the way homes are sold and financed. 
That's because buyers would have an incentive to pay more for a home in 
exchange for having the seller pay their points, financial experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Points are prepaid interest, calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. 
One point on a $100,000 loan, for example, amounts to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a hypothetical home buyer, John, who wants to buy a $150,000 
residence, but doesn't have quite enough cash for a 20% down payment, plus 
closing costs. John goes back to the seller and says he'd like the seller to 
increase the sales price of the home to $156,000, but pay John's mortgage 
points of $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If the seller agrees, he'll still walk away with $150,000 -- the $156,000 
sales price minus the points he agreed to pay in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 John, on the other hand, gets to complete the deal with significantly less 
cash. When the sales price was $150,000, he needed a $30,000 down payment, plus 
$6,000 in points and $1,000 in other closing costs -- a total of $37,000. In 
the revised deal, where the seller paid the points, John needs only a $31,200 
down payment (20% of $156,000), plus $1,000 in closing costs, or a total of 
$32,200. In addition, John gets an immediate $6,000 tax deduction, which is 
worth $1,860 in reduced tax, assuming he is in the 31% federal tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wouldn't John simply get a loan that required a lower down payment? 
Low-down-payment loans generally cost more than loans that are based on down 
payments of 20% or more. Additionally, because points are prepaid interest, the 
more points you pay upfront, the lower your overall interest rate on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the IRS also has clarified rules about deducting points that were 
financed by the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, tax authorities had maintained that you could deduct points in the 
year you took out the mortgage only if you paid those points in cash. If the 
points were financed, you were forced to amortize the cost over the life of the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the IRS says that if your cash down payment amounts to as much or more 
than the cost of the points, you can deduct the points in the year you buy the 
home. In effect, the IRS is saying that -- for tax purposes -- the first 
dollars you put into the purchase of a home are considered deductible points. 
</P>
<P>
 Some savvy tax accountants say they had been advising their clients to do that 
since 1992, when the IRS had "clarified" previous law and tax court rulings, 
indicating that full first-year deductions were allowable under these 
circumstances. However, many taxpayers didn't know about the subtle changes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, points paid in a refinance still may not be deducted up-front. They 
must be written off over the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who bought a home after 1990 where the seller paid some of the points, 
or where the points were financed, should review their past years' tax returns. 
If you did not get a full deduction for the points, you may amend the previous 
year's return by filing a 1040X. 
</P>
<P>
 When filing the amended return, attach a copy of your mortgage settlement 
statement showing the points paid by the seller -- or financed by the lender. 
If the seller paid the points, write "seller-paid points" in the top right-hand 
corner of the form. 
</P>
<P>
 For sellers the rule is a wash. In the past they were able to deduct points 
that they paid on behalf of the buyer. Now, they just reduce the home sales 
price by the value of the points the seller pays. For instance, if the sales 
price is $153,000, but the seller pays $3,000 in points for the borrower, the 
seller would now just report that the home was sold for $150,000.

JAMES FLANIGAN: JAPAN'S ECONOMY IS DEJA VU FOR AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind the loud and public trade disputes with the United States, important 
changes are occurring in Japan's economy that should be reassuring to 
investors, business people and politicians in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most immediate is recovery from recession. "We think the economy has bottomed; 
consumption is increasing and the economy is beginning to grow again," says 
Takashi Kiuchi, chief economist of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of 
the institutions most responsible for financing Japanese industry's rise to 
global prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's good news everywhere. With $3 trillion a year in goods and 
services, Japan's economy generates a lot of business worldwide, including 
about $60 billion from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that is less than the $100 billion-plus in goods and services that the 
United States buys each year from Japan, hence the trade problem between Tokyo 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to U.S. demands for a reduction of that trade deficit, Japan 
Tuesday announced deregulation measures for nine industries, from construction 
to insurance, opening them to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves were cautious and unspecific, however. They represent progress, U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Tuesday, although not enough to "meet 
U.S. concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 So trade arguments will continue, but most likely in a friendly manner. Both 
sides understand that the real issue is that Japan adapt its economy to the 
world, buying freely from other countries as well as selling to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, Japan has begun restructuring its industry in ways that will 
be familiar to Americans who have lived through a decade of downsizing, layoffs 
and intense business competition. In fact, if you think of American-style 
discount stores or of how the U.S. government handled the savings and loan 
crisis and the problem of ailing banks, you can predict developments in Japan 
in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese consumers will lead this economic recovery, a departure from the 
past. The discount store phenomenon is growing rapidly, attracting customers 
and the attention of international investment managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Steinberg, who analyzes Japanese stocks for Nomura Securities in New 
York, likes Kato Denki, an electronics chain that sells Panasonic, Sony and 
other brands at a discount because it buys in volume from the manufacturers -- 
a standard practice in U.S. retailing but a revolution in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lindsell, the Tokyo-based investment manager for GT Global Japan Fund, 
favors Autobacs 7, a company that is able to sell automobile accessories at 
prices half its competitors' because it imports Japanese auto parts -- from 
plants in Asia or the United States -- or it gets volume discounts from 
manufacturers in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Discounting is not a simple matter in Japan. On one hand, it is directly 
related to U.S. trade concerns. Japan used to be the land of controlled markets 
and prices, which gave Japanese companies high profits in the home market to 
make them more competitive abroad. Now, companies can't raise prices to earn 
profits, so they are being forced to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is leading to downsizing and layoffs and a shift in the informal 
Japanese retirement system. Japan's multiple-layered and controlled retail 
markets served as a kind of retirement plan for a system from which employees 
retire at age 55 with only small pensions. Jobs in small shops were a way for 
retirees to earn income, but such mom-and-pop stores can't survive in the 
competitive environment now growing up in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Major layoffs have not yet hit the big companies, says Lindsell. But almost 
70% of Japanese employees work for smaller firms, and more than 100,000 people 
are losing their jobs each year because small companies are going bankrupt, 
writes Alexander Kinmont, Tokyo-based investment strategist for Morgan Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has Japan's economy, which seemed impregnable a few years ago, hit such 
difficulties? Because the money stopped, just as it did in the United States 
when banks and S&Ls ran afoul of bad loans. In Japan, where real estate prices 
were bid up to giddy heights -- a square block of Tokyo was said to be worth as 
much as all of California -- problems were inevitable and have turned out to be 
huge. The major banks have been left with an estimated $250 billion of bad 
loans, a sum greater than all the losses in the American S&L mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's response has mirrored that of the U.S. government. The Bank of Japan, 
the equivalent of the Federal Reserve, is lowering short-term interest rates so 
banks can borrow cheaply, invest in long-term government bonds and earn profits 
to repair their balance sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the bad real estate loans are being placed in separate subsidiary 
companies -- Resolution Trust Corps. by another name -- and sold off to private 
investors at discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all of this, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is trying to change the 
political system to make government more responsive to urban voters and 
consumers. And he is encountering fierce opposition, with political opponents 
investigating his tax returns -- shades of his opposite number, President 
Clinton. 
</P>

 "I call Japan a clone of the United States," says a Japanese investment 
manager who finds deja vu reassuring. He notes that many of the problems Japan 
is facing today have been dealt with in the last decade or so by U.S. business 
and government. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just as predictions of doom regarding the S & L mess, competitiveness or 
bank loans proved wrong here, so Japan's economy and society are likely to 
emerge stronger from their present trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why some U.S. pension and mutual fund managers are investing in 
Japan's market today, as alarmists worry about trade wars and stocks tumble in 
both countries. Long-term investors know from experience that worry is loud, 
but progress is quiet.

 Amdahl Forms Alliance: The manufacturer of large-scale computers said its 
alliance to develop new database servers was a preemptive strike against rival 
IBM, which will announce its own server next week.Servers are computers that 
provide file storage and/or database access for a group of personal computers 
hooked together on a network. Amdahl also launched a broad range of new 
products as part of a new strategy for supporting its existing system/390 data 
server. Amdahl joined forces with software maker Oracle Corp., nCUBE and 
Information Builders Inc. to deliver the first advanced database servers 
employing massively parallel processing technology, which uses hundreds of 
thousands of processors to offer more power and speed than common servers.

 Lockheed Corp. to Cut 2,000 Jobs: The aerospace concern said its aeronautical 
systems unit will make the cuts by the end of 1995, reflecting further 
phaseouts of Pentagon programs that had been its mainstays.The cuts, scheduled 
to begin this summer, amount to about 17% of the unit's work force and about 
2.5% of parent Lockheed's 83,500 employees. It will be the largest staff 
reduction at the unit since it eliminated half its work force in 1989, when the 
C-5 military cargo plane ceased production, said Doug Oliver, a Lockheed 
spokesman. The cuts will be through both attrition and layoffs, he said.

U.S. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE HITS 4-YEAR HIGH IN MARCH; ECONOMY: CONFERENCE BOARD 
SAYS SURVEY SHOWED AMERICANS HAVE EVEN MORE POSITIVE EXPECTATIONS FOR COMING 
MONTHS. 
</P>

<P>
 American consumer confidence in the economy hit a four-year high in March, a 
sign that the United States is headed for a "reasonably vigorous economic 
expansion," the Conference Board said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The business research group said consumers expressed more positive views about 
the present, and even more upbeat expectations about coming months, in a widely 
followed monthly survey on consumer sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists noted that the numbers had risen despite publicity about the 
Whitewater affair that has dogged the Clinton Administration. Allegations of 
the Clintons' impropriety in pre-presidential land dealings, which have 
unsettled financial markets, evidently aren't playing a role in how consumers 
are behaving. 
</P>
<P>
 But economists who follow the Conference Board data said rising interest rates 
and a fading stock market could blunt any further rise in its measurement of 
consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board's index of consumer sentiment rose from 79.9 in February 
to 86.7 in March, the highest reading since July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The index, which uses a 1985 base of 100, is derived from a survey sent to 
5,000 households nationwide that solicits answers to questions on subjects that 
range from appliance purchase plans to local job conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists and financial market players see the consumer confidence index as a 
barometer of consumers' willingness to borrow and spend money. Consumer 
spending is thought to account for about two-thirds of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research 
Center, noted the consumer confidence reading was 26 points higher than it was 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such an impressive increase in confidence suggests that we may well be on the 
way to a sustained and reasonably vigorous economic expansion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc., a Lexington, Mass.-based 
economic forecasting firm, attributed the jump in confidence to stepped-up 
hiring by companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing some decent employment increases recently," he said. "That's 
the major item in consumer confidence for the average American." Consumer 
Confidence 
</P>

 From a monthly survey of 5,000 U.S. Households. Index: 1985 = 100.

VIACOM, CABLE GIANT TCI DISCUSS JOINT VENTURE; TELEVISION: THE DEAL WOULD ALLOW 
VIACOM TO GENERATE NEEDED CASH, AND WOULD GIVE TCI ACCESS TO BIG-CITY MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Viacom Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc. are discussing forming a joint 
venture to pool Viacom's cable TV assets with some of those of TCI, sources 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which would involve 1.1 million Viacom subscribers, would allow 
Viacom to generate the cash it needs to reduce debt it has taken on to buy 
Paramount Communications. The Viacom cable systems have been valued at $2.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom appears eager to shed assets that are not crucial to its ongoing 
operations. On Tuesday, the company said it sold its one-third stake in the 
cable TV channel, Lifetime, to partners Capital Cities/ABC and Hearst Corp. for 
$317.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 By spinning off assets, observers said, Viacom is signaling Blockbuster 
Entertainment that it doesn't need the home video retail giant's money badly 
enough to renegotiate the merger agreement it made during the Paramount 
takeover battle. The Viacom-Blockbuster merger appears stalled over 
Blockbuster's effort to extract richer terms.  
</P>
<P>
 Any deal between TCI and Viacom would be designed to settle out of court the 
acrimonious antitrust action Viacom filed last fall against TCI in the heat of 
the Paramount takeover battle. The suit is considered potentially damaging to 
TCI because it lays bare the alleged monopolistic practices of the nation's 
largest cable operator that have already caught the attention of federal 
regulators.  
</P>
<P>
 TCI would benefit by pooling its suburban holdings near San Francisco, Seattle 
and Nashville with Viacom's urban franchises in those three markets. Industry 
sources speculate that TCI and Viacom might combine their costly pay-TV 
services -- Encore and Showtime -- as part of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Viacom might also extract a pledge from TCI not to join with its 
music video rivals who are planning to launch channels to compete with Viacom's 
lucrative MTV operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal will only go forward if Viacom concludes that the venture will 
provide cash and defer taxes. The tax ramifications are still being studied, 
one knowledgeable source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both before and after the Paramount takeover battle, Viacom has searched for 
ways to wring new cash from its cable holdings, which rank 13th nationally in 
subscribers. The division generates about $200 million annually in cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, for example, Viacom considered a proposal to form a venture with 
Crown Media and Southwestern Bell, and one source insisted Tuesday that TCI is 
not the only company that Viacom is talking to now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the deal would be a pooling of Viacom's and TCI's systems in 
areas where the two operators are the major cable TV providers. Viacom and TCI 
have already worked together to coordinate construction of fiber loop to serve 
both the Seattle and San Francisco markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a deal with TCI would close the Viacom lawsuit, it might not be the 
end of TCI's legal woes. In a separate development, a spokesman for the 
attorney general's office in New York confirmed Tuesday that it launched an 
antitrust investigation late last year into TCI-backed Teleport Communications 
Group, which operates an alternative access telephone service for businesses. 
Cox Enterprises, Continental Cable and Comcast, three other large cable 
operators, also have stakes in Teleport.

KEMPER EXECS HAVE GENEROUS SEVERANCE PLAN; TAKEOVER: THE TOP 13 MANAGERS ARE 
PROTECTED BY GOLDEN PARACHUTES WORTH $19 MILLION, A PLAN PASSED WHEN DIRECTORS 
REJECTED GE CAPITAL'S BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The top executives at Kemper Corp. may be tempted to sell the company -- the 
target of a hostile $2.35 billion takeover by GE Capital Corp. -- because they 
have golden parachutes worth more than $19 million, analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help cushion the blow to Kemper management if GE takes over and it 
may also preclude Kemper from fighting for control," said Michael Lewis, an 
analyst with Dean Witter. "It won't stop GE from moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The rich compensation plan for the top 13 executives takes effect in the event 
the company is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 It was adopted by Kemper's executives on March 17, when its board unanimously 
rejected a proposal by the General Electric Co. unit to buy Kemper for $55 a 
share, calling it a "low ball" offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Grove, Ill.-based asset management firm disclosed the existence of 
the golden parachutes in a proxy statement sent Monday to shareholders. The 
plan does not need shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that (Kemper's management) can cash out any time reduces their 
incentive to hold out for a higher bid," said Mark Mitchell, a University of 
Chicago finance professor. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Kemper's directors and executive officers hold a relatively 
small stake in the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proxy statement, 11 out of 15 directors and executives held 
less than 1% of Kemper's shares as of Feb. 1. The biggest stake any single 
individual held was 4.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just protection for management in case they lose the battle," Lewis 
said. "My guess is that there would be a pretty good housecleaning if GE took 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 The compensation plan is evidence that Kemper's management is coming to the 
realization that GE, flush with cash, is eventually going to get what it wants, 
said one shareholder who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the company shouldn't enrich management at shareholders' expense," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The golden parachutes seem to be a little excessive," said Luther Jones, 
manager of corporate affairs for the Florida State Board of Administration, 
which holds almost 500,000 shares. "It's an issue we do want to talk to the 
company about." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper's shares were off 37.5 cents at $60.625 at the close of trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange, and General Electric's stock was down $1.875 at 
$102.375.

 Lorenzo Offered a New Hearing: A proposed new airline founded by Frank Lorenzo 
is getting a chance for a second certification hearing from the Transportation 
Department. The firm, ATX Inc., charged that the Transportation Department's 
review was prejudiced because an attorney on the department's public council 
staff has a brother who is a member of the Air Line Pilots Assn., an opponent 
of ATX's application.Transportation Department officials denied any prejudice, 
but offered to start the review process from scratch. An administrative law 
judge has earlier recommended that ATX Inc., be found unfit, in part because of 
the involvement of Lorenzo in the airline's operations. Lorenzo was previously 
a principal in Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lines, where he fought 
battles with unions. Both went bankrupt.

 Mentor May Continue to Sell Breast Implants: Mentor Corp. said it may continue 
to manufacture and sell silicone-gel breast implants in light of a pending 
$3.75-billion settlement that other manufacturers have reached with women who 
have had implants. The Santa Barbara-based medical devices company, the only 
firm selling silicone implants in the U.S., agreed to quit marketing them by 
1995 as part of a $24-million settlement of hundreds of lawsuits against the 
company.The agreement, however, allows for Mentor to continue selling silicone 
gel implants if a separate global settlement of implant lawsuits allows another 
company to market them. Mentor said it understands that other manufacturers may 
continue to sell gel implants as part of the global settlement that women and 
their lawyers reached with Dow Corning, Baxter International and other firms.

 GM to Take Charge Against 1994 Earnings: General Motors Corp. announced it 
will take a $758-million hit against 1994 earnings to adopt a new accounting 
standard.GM officials say that despite the heavy onetime financial blow, they 
plan to be profitable this year. The No. 1 U.S. auto maker posted $2.5 billion 
in 1993 profits after years of staggering losses. The $758-million charge, or 
$1.05 per share, will be taken in the first quarter of 1994.

Crystal Dynamics, the two firms said. Under the deal, BMG will handle marketing 
and distribution for Crystal and for Star Interactive -- a multimedia 
publishing start-up still in the planning stages which will have an exclusive 
distribution agreement with Crystal -- in all markets outside of North 
America.BMG is one of several big players from the traditional entertainment 
arena that have announced plans to get into the distribution end of the rapidly 
expanding multimedia industry in recent weeks. Crystal is a Silicon Valley 
start-up run by former 20th Century Fox president Strauss Zelnick. Zelnick, who 
does consulting for BMG, denied the persistent rumors that he is planning to 
take an executive position at the media conglomerate.

 Air Fare Sale Spreads Across Continental United States: Led by Trans World 
Airlines, the country's biggest carriers spread an air fare sale to more of the 
country, three days before the offer expires. The sale was started by USAir 
last week and offers round-trip fares of $198, $298 and $398.The cheapest fares 
apply to flights between Eastern cities and Florida, the $298 fares are for 
trips between the East and Midwest and the most expensive tickets are for 
transcontinental trips. United Airlines said it has applied the discounts to 
virtually its entire system in the continental United States, while Delta said 
it has adopted the sale in most markets. American Airlines said it will match 
TWA's expansion in markets where it competes with the St. Louis-based airline.

 Prices Up at Second Acid Rain Credits Auction: Proponents of market-based 
environmental rules praised the results, announced by the Chicago Board of 
Trade, of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's second annual auction of 
rights to emit acid-rain forming pollution. CBOT officials and the 
Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group, said that the increased 
number of buyers, mostly electric utilities, and the prices paid -- up from an 
average of $156 last year to $159 per ton of allowed sulfur dioxide emissions 
after 1995 -- showed that the process is working. Trading is meant to encourage 
utilities to lower their emissions even faster than federal regulations 
require, while giving utilities more flexibility in meeting those rules.

 U.S. Sets Strategy on Beijing Trade Status: The United States may consider 
selective withdrawal of trade benefits from China's state-owned enterprises 
instead of a broader sanction if Beijing fails to show enough human rights 
progress, a top official said. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, 
speaking to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said a targeted withdrawal of Most 
Favored Nation trade status would be aimed at lessening the impact of the 
action on U.S. business and other "innocent bystanders," such as Hong Kong and 
Taiwan.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; BRAZIL'S INFLATION RATE SURGES TO NEARLY 45%; LATIN 
AMERICA: DOUBTS ABOUT THE FINANCE MINISTER'S ECONOMIC STABILIZATION PLAN GROWS 
ON NEWS THAT HE MAY SOON LEAVE HIS POST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With inflation surging toward a monthly rate of 45%, Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso has been trying to apply a stabilization plan that so far has 
brought hope, uncertainty -- and more inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Further uncertainty is being generated by Cardoso's expected resignation to 
run in October presidential elections.  
</P>
<P>
 After meeting Tuesday with leaders of his party, who asked him to be its 
candidate, Cardoso left little doubt about his intentions. "If the party puts 
the victory banner in my hands, I am going to carry it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Itamar Franco has offered Cardoso's post to Rubens Ricupero, 57, 
currently the minister of environment. A lawyer and career diplomat who has 
specialized in international trade, Ricupero previously served as Brazil's 
ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricupero this week pointedly praised Cardoso's anti-inflation plan. But some 
analysts fear that a change in ministers may complicate the plan's 
implementation at a critical point. "The minister is acting like a mother who 
forgets her baby in the delivery room," charged leftist candidate Luis Inacio 
Lula da Silva.  
</P>
<P>
 Others contend that by returning to his Senate seat while running for 
president, Cardoso could bolster the plan's chances for continued political 
backing. His team of economists is expected to remain, including Central Bank 
chief Pedro Malan, who is a friend of Ricupero's. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's key element is a new monetary measure called the "real value unit," 
known as the URV. Roughly equal to a U.S. dollar, the URV provides a steady 
value for gauging inflation of the cruzeiro, Brazil's currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has begun requiring that all salaries be calculated in URVs. It 
also is recommending that the URV be used for wholesale and retail pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities set new cruzeiro values for the URV daily. So the cruzeiro value 
of any item is its steady URV value times the URV's cruzeiro value of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two or three months, the government plans to make the URV the official 
currency, calling it the "real." Government economists say the switch will 
suddenly stop inflation as everything's steady URV value becomes its price in 
new currency. 
</P>
<P>
 But showing apparent uncertainty over how the currency changeover will work, 
many businesses have been marking up cruzeiro prices at a faster rate since the 
URV appeared at the beginning of March. 
</P>
<P>
 Some independent economists say it may be difficult for the government to 
calculate how much new money to circulate in the sudden switch from a rapidly 
inflating currency to a stable one. If the new money supply turns out to be 
much greater than needed, it could stimulate inflation, and if it is much 
smaller it could cause recession. 
</P>
<P>
 And many economists say that unless the government does more to eliminate 
major causes of inflation -- such as deficit spending, official borrowing at 
high interest rates, and extravagant increases in the money supply -- relief 
from "super-inflation" will be temporary at best. Since 1985, a series of 
stabilization plans have sometimes dramatically cut inflation, but it has 
always returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco, elected vice president in 1989, stepped into the presidency after 
Fernando Collor de Mello's impeachment in 1992 on corruption charges. Cardoso, 
whose first job under Franco was foreign minister, has been finance minister 
since May, when inflation was running about 30% a month. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cardoso is a popular politician, he has been criticized for not taking 
action sooner against inflation. He announced his plan in December and, after 
delays getting congressional approval, began implementing it at the beginning 
of March. Some calculations put inflation during March at nearly 45%, or more 
than 8,500% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts predict that if Cardoso's plan succeeds in stopping inflation by 
October's first round of elections, he will reap a winning harvest of votes. 
"When the second semester comes and inflation has dropped, he is going to rise 
politically," said economist Salomao Quadros da Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paulo Robelo de Castro, another economist, asked what credit voters will 
give Cardoso in view of the fact that inflation increased steadily during his 
tenure as finance minister. "What he did was what he did," de Castro said.

 U.S. Rejects Japanese Trade Package: The Clinton Administration firmly 
rejected a new Japanese economic plan, saying the package falls short of U.S. 
demands and does not merit a resumption of stalled trade talks. The standoff -- 
on the heels of a summit failure last month -- rekindled fears of a possible 
trade war, although the White House stressed it was open to new offers.

 Italian Financial Markets Plunge: Italian investors, who drove Italy's 
financial markets to record highs for the year Monday on the prospect of a 
majority government, sent stocks and bonds lower as a right-wing coalition 
failed to win a decisive victory. The failure of the Freedom Alliance to win a 
majority in the Senate, combined with heightened factionalism within the 
alliance, could mean that media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the 
main party, may have to water down some of its more radical free-market 
policies, analysts said. The uncertainties sent the stock market down 208 
points, or almost 2%, to 10,911.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S FINAL FOUR; GETTING HIS DUE AT DUKE; HUMBLE 
GRANT HILL LEAVES HIS MARK ON BLUE DEVILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To those who know him intimately, on the floor and in the aisles of Cameron 
Indoor Stadium, he is Grant. But to the general populace, who know Duke as 
Christian Laettner's alma mater, as Bobby Hurley's old haunt, he remains, as 
always, taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider his placement on the Duke pyramid of success, which is forever topped 
by Mike Krzyzewski, the crafty Coach K, who has been out-consonanting and 
out-concentrating the opposition for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Laettner, the consummate pain in the keister, who not only 
angled for the spotlight at every turn but knew precisely what to do with it, 
as Kentucky basketball fans will be mumbling for the next 40 or 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Hurley, the gritty point guard who orchestrated the first 
consecutive NCAA titles since UCLA and now gets called to deliver inspirational 
speeches before Southeast Regional championship games. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, finally, one comes to Grant Hill. The Duke Who Devil. The 
all-but-invisible man who slinks here, skulks there and, with two more 
victories in Charlotte this weekend, will have three more Final Four 
championships than Glenn Robinson, Jason Kidd and Donyell Marshall combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Hill exists in the periphery of Duke basketball lore, always with a hand 
in the action but seldom his face. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when Hurley and Laettner lifted the Devils to their long-awaited 
first NCAA title with a stunning semifinal upset of undefeated Nevada Las 
Vegas, it was Hill who opened the game by grabbing a lob from Hurley and 
ramming it violently through the hoop, serving notice that David had come to 
Indianapolis with his slingshot fully loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, when Laettner made the miracle shot against Kentucky, the one now 
reprised and revised for ESPN by comedian Chris Farley, it was Hill who 
launched the 70-foot inbounds pass that made it possible. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1994, with millions of eyes trained on Purdue's Glenn Robinson, 
awaiting another 44-point explosion in the Southeast Regional final, it was 
Hill who fronted him and checked him and denied him the ball, frustrating 
Robinson into a six-for-22 funk and spiriting away a 69-60 Duke triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was named outstanding player of the Southeast Regional, in spite of his 
own 11-point offensive output. Typical Hill. While freshman guard Jeff Capel is 
heading the highlight shows with a behind-the-back bounce pass to Antonio Lang, 
Hill is winning the game with a defensive slide-and-hand-check. 
</P>
<P>
 The postgame scene was also typical Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 First he glanced across the microphone table at Capel and Lang and Chris 
Collins and bubbled, "I owe a lot to you guys. I love you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he thanked Cherokee Parks for rooming with him the previous night and 
getting him properly psyched for his toe-to-tow with Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cherokee would keep calling out, 'Big Dog! Big Dog!' and each time I would 
jump up and do slides across the hotel room," Hill said, giggling at the 
recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in the Duke locker room, he grabbed Lang, who had helped out on what 
Hill called "Robinson Awareness Night," and squealed, "Hey, Stacey Augmon! 
Spider Man! Elastic Man! You got yourself $2 million today! You just made your 
(draft day) party a whole lot nicer!" 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters crowded around Hill, asking him to rank this moment on his personal 
satisfaction meter. Finally, he had reached the Final Four on his own, with no 
assist from Laettner or Hurley. For once, he was the unquestioned leader of 
this Duke championship contender. He had made his mark, left an impression, 
silenced the NCAA's premier shot maker in the defensive effort of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Hill said, his "biggest moment, the proudest, may have been this game." 
Why? "Because when I got in foul trouble, I got to sit and see my teammates do 
so well." 
</P>
<P>
 The proudest moment of Hill's Duke career -- and he spent it sitting on the 
bench? 
</P>
<P>
 "If they hadn't played so well, probably a lot would have been written and 
said about us being inconsistent, about how Duke can't win without Grant," Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And we can't be having any of that, can we? 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is as reserved as Laettner was self-serving, perhaps the quintessential 
Krzyzewski player. It's not that Hill is without ego. He has an ego, a healthy 
one. Before his showdown against Robinson, Hill claimed that the only time he 
wasn't sure he was the best player on the court was when he played against the 
Dream Team. But Hill guards it as tightly as he does most opponents, 
subjugating it for the cause, which is to win more NCAA basketball 
championships in a single career than any player not to have worn the letters 
U, C, L and A on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 One more would give Hill, and fellow Duke seniors Lang and Marty Clark, three 
NCAA titles. That's Alcindor territory. Wicks and Rowe country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought a lot about that this year, to put ourselves in that position," 
Hill said. "If we can do that, it'll be something I can look back on and feel 
really proud of, because it's so tough to get here. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at all the Final Fours Duke has been to and think it's easy. It's 
not. It's a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially with this Duke team, which had to break in an all-new backcourt 
after the graduation of Hurley and three-year starter Thomas Hill, which meant 
Hill, for the first time as a Blue Devil, would be operating without a safety 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really expected us to do too much," Hill said. "I think back to Nov. 
1, in Greensboro for orientation day, where all the players meet the press, so 
to speak, and I said I felt we were going to the Final Four. The media laughed. 
They said that was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven victories later, Duke has arrived, precisely according to Hill's 
schedule. And if he won't come out and say it, longtime sidekick Lang will: 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best player I've ever played with," said Lang, who has kept company 
with several Duke jersey numbers now hanging from the Cameron rafters. "I think 
people take Grant for granted, for the simple fact that he's played, if you 
want to say, in the shadow of great players. Yet still, without Grant, we 
wouldn't have won any of these national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Grant easily could go out there and average 30 points a game, plus a 
triple-double every game if he wanted to. I think since he's such a team 
player, people don't appreciate that. People want to see someone go out there 
and score 40 points. But that doesn't mean a hill of beans without winning." 
</P>
<P>
 So, if Lang had a vote, he'd give the Naismith and the Wooden awards to Hill 
over Robinson? 
</P>
<P>
 Lang stopped in his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhhh, I don't know," he replied, smiling sheepishly. "Um. I mean, I feel he 
is the best player, but you can't argue with Glenn because Glenn has had a 
tremendous year. I mean, just having the chance to be able to play with Grant 
and the opportunity to play against Glenn Robinson, it's unbelievable. I think 
there should be two awards, two Naismith awards. A tie." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Duke dressing room, Hill is wearing an award of a different kind 
around his neck, the net that has just been cut down by the 1994 Southeast 
Regional champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice necklace, someone says to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill nods. If there is one thing Hill has learned in his four years at Duke, 
it's how to accessorize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm going to go to Charlotte," he said, "and try to get some bracelets to 
go with it."

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS WHITEWATER IS TEARS OF FANS

<P>
 Where was President Clinton when America's team needed him most? 
</P>
<P>
 When his brother Arkansans needed him most? When Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones 
needed him most? 
</P>
<P>
 Standing up at a wedding in Dallas and vacationing in California, that's 
where. Pretty flimsy excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 For shame, Mr. President. Your priorities, sir. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy and Jerry, the biggest breakup since Dean and Jerry, and what does our 
nation's leader do about it? Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 He could get Yitzhak Rabin to shake hands with Yasser Arafat, but could he get 
Jimmy back together with Jerry? No! 
</P>
<P>
 Too busy watching Arkansas players shooting baskets and Michigan players 
changing pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Where were the Dallas Cowboy peace talks? Where was the accord that could have 
spared Texans this bloody Jimmy-Jerry civil war? 
</P>
<P>
 Where was Hillary when all this was going on? Where were Harry and Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason? 
</P>
<P>
 We have a whole Congressional committee investigating that petty real estate 
thing, but not a soul looking into this serious Cowpoke scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Something peculiar here. I think maybe Kevin Kline is in the White House 
again, impersonating the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Clinton is a big, big sports fan. He proved that recently by naming the 
entire Arkansas Razorback starting lineup, their scoring averages, their jersey 
numbers, their shoe sizes and today's specials at the Fayetteville diner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Rodham Clinton likes her sports, too. She has agreed to toss out the first 
pitch at the Chicago Cubs' home opener, where, if she shows anything, she will 
be sent to triple A to work on her screwball and then return to the team by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The President will continue to cheer for Arkansas in the NCAA tournament and 
will expel Arizona from the union if it wins, leaving us with 49 states. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recently down there in Dallas, making sure his brother, Roger, didn't 
skip out on his wedding to go lay two bucks on some pony in Hot Springs. The 
President also took his Final Four First Family to a basketball game and was 
given a pair of Arkansas basketball trunks, one pair of which would fit a 
family of three. 
</P>
<P>
 But did he intervene in the big Dallas Cowboy spittin' match? He did not. He 
could have brought Jimmy and Jerry back together to the table for one more 
talk. Mr. Clinton is an expert negotiator. He could have opened up with some 
small talk. Could have recommended to Jimmy Johnson a really good Beverly Hills 
barber. He could have pointed out to Jerry Jones politely that any man who 
replaces Tom Landry and Jimmy Johnson in one lifetime is looking to be branded 
a horse's butt at the Big D ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 He could even have sent in Janet Reno, same way he did last time Texas had an 
explosive situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, the President kept out of it. He abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 He fiddled while Dallas burned. Or played the sax. America's team is having a 
leadership crisis. Football is vital to the American way of life. It is at 
least as important as baseball, which George Will finds time to write about. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, underneath a red-gray Confederate flag at Atlanta, the Cowboys of 
the Apocalypse rode to their second consecutive Super Bowl championship. They 
did so even with quarterback Troy Aikman having recently suffered a concussion 
that left him so confused, he thought Lorrie Morgan did triple flips and Nancy 
Kerrigan sang country songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jones, once again, contributed to the Cowboys' success. He signed their 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 As with a lot of rich boys with their toys, ol' Jer continues to believe Owner 
Knows Best. He almost lost Emmitt Smith, the stallion. Now he has lost Jimmy 
Johnson, the foreman. I'm afraid the Cowboy owner is what is known around Texas 
as a dang fool. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dumb-stunts department, Jerry Jones and Leon Lett are now square at two 
apiece. Yet all Leon ever loses is the football. Jerry loses people. 
</P>
<P>
 President and Mrs. Clinton, I do appreciate that y'all have a lot else to do. 
World peace is important. Health care is important. Razorback basketball is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 But America's team is in more turmoil than, well, America. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jones is an old Arkansas boy. Go talk some sense into him. 
</P>

THE COWBOYS' JOHNSON RIDES OFF INTO SUNSET; PRO FOOTBALL: COACH PARTS WITH 
JONES AND IS SAID TO GET $3.9 MILLION, FREEDOM TO JOIN ANOTHER TEAM AS PART OF 
SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The snit heard 'round Texas claimed half of the Cowboy hierarchy when Coach 
Jimmy Johnson, architect of consecutive Super Bowl championships, walked away 
from the job and his old college roommate, team owner Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has now fired Tom Landry and lost Johnson, the local equivalent of 
pulling two heads off of Mt. Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was given a fat settlement -- reportedly $3.9 million -- and can coach 
another team, all concessions from Jones. Johnson's contract, which had five 
years left, called for no compensation if he quit and barred him from working 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson then appeared at a news conference with Jones to assert that their 
most recent rift and Jones' barroom derision of his coach last week hadn't 
broken them up, all of which produced laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There shouldn't be any blame," Johnson said. "I mean, why should you be 
blaming when you've got two Super Bowl championships in the last two years? Why 
should you be blaming when you've got the best football team in the NFL? 
</P>
<P>
 "You should be very appreciative of where you are and look forward to the 
success of the coming year. There's no blame. It's just a matter of, we've gone 
through a little transition here." 
</P>
<P>
 The room erupted in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's a big transition," Johnson said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jones bought the team and sacked Landry in 1989, he presented Johnson, 
his teammate on Arkansas' 1964 national championship team, as his old friend 
and college roommate. By the 1992 season, when they won their first Super Bowl, 
their rift had become an open secret in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication of Skip Bayless' "The 'Boys" last summer let the secret out. 
Jones, who had given himself the title of general manager, wanted to be 
accepted as a football man. Johnson didn't want to give him any credit as such, 
or yield any control. Jones claimed he had pulled the trigger on the Charles 
Haley deal. Johnson said Jones wouldn't know Charles Haley from Alex Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 And that business about their being roommates? Johnson said room assignments 
for Arkansas trips were made alphabetically, denying that they had ever been 
buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders expected trouble down the line, but Johnson and Jones got there 
faster than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The '93 season began with Jones and star halfback Emmitt Smith in a contract 
impasse. Smith held out for two games and the Cowboys started 0-2. After the 
second loss, to Buffalo, Johnson was almost in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones caved in, Smith returned and the Cowboys righted themselves, but the 
rift began to show itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the NFC championship game against the 49ers, Johnson said he 
was "intrigued" by the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars' interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Jones said any change would be up to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of making a coaching change," he added. "To have this as 
an issue is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Super Bowl, Johnson, asked about his relationship with Jones, said they 
only spoke about once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the Super Bowl and embracing Jones on the sideline, Johnson 
appeared on David Letterman's show. He joked that the team had been given 
$60,000 for a Super Bowl party and Jones had pocketed $20,000. Jones, who 
wasn't laughing at much of what Johnson said, told confidantes he was upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last Monday night at the NFL meetings in Orlando, Jones walked up to a 
table where Johnson was having cocktails with former Cowboy defensive 
coordinator Dave Wannstedt, former offensive coordinator Norv Turner, and 
former assistant general manager Bob Ackles and toasted their contributions to 
the team's success. No one asked Jones to sit down, and he left angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones later: "I was upset with the toast, and I left." 
</P>
<P>
 He went to another bar where he told four writers and several bystanders that 
he might replace Johnson with Barry Switzer, the former Oklahoma coach, adding 
that 500 coaches would have won the Super Bowl with his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson heard about Jones' comments and bolted the meetings the next day, 
telling the Dallas Morning News he wanted to "reassess things." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Jones telephoned Johnson. Jones said they had a productive 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's version: "Nothing was resolved. I hung up on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith rallied behind his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what the situation is," Smith said. "Fire Jimmy, fire me." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Troy Aikman, who was upset with Jones when negotiations for a 
contract extension dragged on last season, rallied behind his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could have anticipated something like this happening, I would have been 
hesitant about signing a long-term contract with the Cowboys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he had a mental list of replacements for Johnson: Notre Dame Coach 
Lou Holtz (considered the favorite), Cowboy defensive coordinator Butch Davis 
and Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer told the Daily Oklahoman on Tuesday: "If I was offered the job, I 
probably would accept it. But it's too premature to talk about anything that 
would affect that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson returned to Dallas on Saturday and let three Morning News writers come 
to his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that Jones, who had once ensured him he had complete control, now 
wanted a different setup and tried to put it into writing when he doubled 
Johnson's salary last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me in all honesty, things have changed," Johnson said. "He said he 
wanted to be more a part of it. He said, 'I want it to be Jerry and Jimmy . . . 
not just Jimmy.' From that time on, it's always been a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas media pelted Jones, calling him "a card-carrying Jethro" and 
"insecure and unstable." He was likened to George Steinbrenner and nicknamed 
Jerry (Last Call) Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Johnson returned to his office in the Cowboy practice facility in 
Valley Ranch for his long-awaited confrontation with Jones. Reporters and 
camera crews clogged the halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Branch Davidians, day one," a Cowboy official told the Morning 
News. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was seen leaving with his dry cleaning over his shoulder, 
precipitating a rumor he was cleaning out his office. Everyone ran to the 
parking lot. Johnson said he was going to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:05, Jones sent for Johnson. At 4:30, the meeting broke up. Both men used 
words like productive and candid and avoided insulting one another, suggesting 
they were trying to patch it up. 
</P>
<P>
 They met again Tuesday morning for an hour. Afterward, Johnson steamed through 
a crowd of minicams without comment, wearing a stony expression. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1:30, a formal news conference was convened. Johnson and Jones said they 
had settled their differences, made up -- and decided to part company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about what Jerry did not like about me and liked about me," Johnson 
said. "And what I liked about him and didn't like about him, just back and 
forth. It was as good a conversation as we have ever had. And this morning we 
went back and forth over different things we might do. 
</P>
<P>
 "And almost at the same time, we said, 'Hey, it's time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones: "We have mutually agreed that if we don't look out, we'll take one 
of the greatest stories that's ever been told in sports in my view and we'll 
take all of the positives away. There are no negatives when you really look at 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he would ask Johnson for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that he would be always be a Cowboy, he simply wouldn't be on the 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate, there's no question about that," Aikman said. "All the 
players would have liked to see Jimmy stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, pilloried for a year after firing Landry, who hadn't won a title in 11 
years, faces worse for the departure of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like to go back to 1989," Jones said. "We have, I think, more 
fans today than in 1989. . . . I think in 1989, they had a reason to be 
concerned, to be skeptical. I would hope after the success we've had over the 
last five years, that might temper it some." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't count on it. Conquering and Dividing 
</P>
<P>
 A look at key events in the relationship between Dallas owner Jerry Jones and 
Coach Jimmy Johnson, who parted ways Tuesday after leading the Cowboys to 
consecutive Super Bowl championships: 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 25, 1989 -- Jones purchases the Cowboys and Texas Stadium from H.R. 
(Bum) Bright for $140 million and hires Johnson to become the second head coach 
in franchise history, replacing two-time Super Bowl winner Tom Landry. At his 
first news conference, Jones proclaims Johnson is worth five first-round draft 
choices and five Heisman Trophy winners. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 6, 1989 -- Jones gives Johnson a guaranteed 10-year contract, citing 
the need for commitment and continuity in rebuilding the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 5, 1989 -- The Cowboys defeat Washington in a nationally televised 
game, Johnson's first NFL victory. It is the Cowboys' only victory of the 
season. 
</P>

playoff berth under Jones and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>

championship as the Cowboys beat the Atlanta Falcons, 41-17. 
</P>
<P>

appearance on the Texas Stadium sideline with Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia in 
the third quarter of the team's 27-14 victory over the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 31, 1993 -- The Cowboys, playing in their first Super Bowl in 15 years, 
defeat the Buffalo Bills, 52-17. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 30, 1993 -- Johnson says he would be "intrigued" if he were offered the 
chance to become the first coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars. The comments come 
as the Cowboys prepare for their NFC East championship showdown against the New 
York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 31, 1993 -- Jones strongly rebukes Johnson's interest in working for 
another team. 
</P>
<P>

Bowl championship credit after the Cowboys beat the Buffalo Bills, 30-13. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 1 -- In an appearance on the "Late Show with David Letterman," Johnson 
jokes that the Cowboys were provided $60,000 for a post-Super Bowl party, and 
that Jones pocketed $20,000 of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 21 -- Jones toasts the success of the Cowboys at the NFL meetings in 
Orlando, Fla. Johnson reciprocates, but does not invite Jones to sit at his 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 22 -- Jones, in an early morning off-the-record barroom conversation 
with four reporters, suggests he might hire former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer 
to lead the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says later he is reconsidering his future with the Super Bowl 
champions after learning that Jones threatened to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 23 -- Jones says there is nothing for Johnson to assess. He calls it 
merely another day in the life of the Dallas Cowboys. "He didn't apologize to 
me and I didn't apologize to him," Jones says of his meeting with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 25 -- Johnson, in seclusion in Miami, says in a statement: "I'm deeply 
hurt that after five years of total commitment to the rebuilding of the Cowboys 
and after two consecutive Super Bowl championships, I have been treated this 
way." Johnson adds he would be back at work on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 26 -- Johnson speaks at Emmitt Smith's football camp in Pensacola, 
Fla., then returns to Dallas. He says he would not resign from the Cowboys 
without a job or compensation. He again bristles at the off-the-record comments 
made by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 28 -- Jones and Johnson discuss their future. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 29 -- Johnson resigns as coach of the Cowboys. JIMMY JOHNSON'S

HIGH SCHOOL OVERTIME GETS EXTRA MINUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Overtime periods in high school basketball games will increase from three to 
four minutes beginning next season, the National Federation of State High 
School Assns. announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation's basketball rules committee said the change was made in hopes 
of creating a better game situation, because a team with possession during a 
three-minute overtime often simply holds the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The change came as a surprise to many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know this rule was being discussed," said Ray Plutko, executive 
director of the Southern California Interscholastic Basketball Coaches' Assn. 
and a member of the rules committee in 1987-88. "I'm not necessarily opposed to 
the rule change, but it seems there are other more pressing issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Plutko said it does not make sense to add time to an overtime period and not 
the rest of the game. He favors 20-minute halves, rather than the eight-minute 
quarters now used. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner: "This is a major rule 
change, but I think it's a good one."

 Ray Mercer was acquitted Tuesday in New York of sports bribery. The 
heavyweight boxing contender had been accused of making a $100,000 mid-fight 
offer to an underdog opponent to take a dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer, 31, said he hoped to resume his career soon. He was accused of 
offering a payoff to Jesse Ferguson during their fight Feb. 6, 1993. 
Prosecutors said that Mercer, overweight and undertrained, wanted Ferguson to 
throw the fight so he could get a shot at then-champion Riddick Bowe's title 
and a $1.5-million payday. Ferguson won a decision over Mercer.

A SEE-WORTHY ADVENTURE; THESE SIGHT-IMPAIRED L.A. TEEN-AGERS LEAVE THEIR WORLDS 
BEHIND WHEN BOARDING THE ENCORE FOR FISHING AND FUN ON COASTAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deckhand Tom Nuno uses his thumb to remove the eye from a sardine before 
tossing it overboard. He thinks nothing of it. The little fish will swim in 
circles and attract larger fish to the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a common practice.  
</P>
<P>
 Anita Wright, however, suggests that Nuno use more discretion on this 
particular fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eyes are a real commodity around here," she says. "These kids would give 
anything for one of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality sets in immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 young anglers aboard the 75-foot Encore, though they maneuver about the 
boat with relative ease, are all legally blind. Some are able to see better 
than others. One has a prosthetic eye and is nearly blind in the other. Another 
was born with normal eyesight, but robbed of it while an infant by an abusive 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't see as well as it seems," says Wright, a youth program coordinator 
for the Braille Institute, "They just make do with what they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright has brought the teen-agers to San Pedro for a deep-sea fishing trip, 
courtesy of the West El Ley Rod & Reel Club and Roger and John Hess, owners of 
the Encore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the same thing last year and the kids really enjoyed it, and I really 
enjoyed it," Roger Hess says, as he pulls from the docks. "It makes their lives 
a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphins are swimming playfully off the starboard rail as the Encore leaves 
the harbor and Wright points them out to those who can see them. Others focus 
their curiosity on the bait tanks, which are teeming with live sardines. One 
leaps from the tank and lands at the feet of Veronica Vasquez. She shrugs and 
steps away, holding the rail and laughing.  
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Sampson, 17, who hopes to attend the University of Florida, is standing 
nearby talking basketball, predicting a Florida-Arkansas showdown for the 
national championship on Monday. "It'll be a good game, but the Gators will 
beat Duke (on Saturday)," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Casillas, 16, doesn't care much for basketball. "I signed up (for the 
fishing trip) because I wanted to see what fishing was like," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas wastes no time trying to learn. She reaches into the tank for a 
sardine. The first few squirm free, Casillas letting out a shriek and a giggle 
each time. She finally gets a handle on one, and with a firm grip provokes 
others into shrieking and giggling, by sticking the struggling fish in their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Nora Meza, 14, wants no part of it. She is trying to ward off the effects of 
the boat's constant rocking and rolling. Meza's looks pale, but insists she is 
"only a little dizzy" and wants to try fishing.  
</P>
<P>
 The Encore stops at a reef outside L.A. Harbor. Richard Mann, Bert Serden, Sid 
Levy, John and Jack Sidney and the rest of the volunteers from the fishing club 
grab sardines and bait the young anglers' hooks, instructing them in the use of 
their new rods and reels, donated by Daiwa. 
</P>
<P>
 Estela Carrillo, 17, tries to grab a sardine of her own but finds the small 
fish too cold and clammy, and much too lively. That she can't see the fish has 
to make the experience all the more unsettling. She backs off with a grin as 
wide as the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see that expression on their face -- that's what makes us feel like we're 
really doing something good," says Mann, president of the fishing club. "That's 
what makes it worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hess, co-skipper of the Encore, decides to liven things up even more. 
Standing atop the bait tank, he nets a small sardine and puts it in his mouth, 
holding its head with his teeth while it wriggles its tail as if trying to swim 
down his throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas sees well enough to catch that and says, "You don't know where that 
sardine has been," laughing so loudly she has to be scaring the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly aren't biting. 
</P>
<P>
 No complaints, though. For teen-agers who face daily challenges others take 
for granted, it seems to be a day to forget about life's harsh realities and 
just catch some rays, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty fun right now, anyways," says Carlos Flores, 18, a South Central 
Los Angeles resident making his second trip with the club. Flores has a 
degenerative condition that will probably leave him sightless in a few years. 
His smile is particularly rewarding to Wright and her assistant, Arlene 
Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes us all feel good," says Levy, who also volunteers as a tax 
consultant for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Torres, 17, of East Los Angeles, has tunnel vision, meaning he can see 
things straight out but not from side to side. His immediate concern, however, 
is what to do with any fish he might catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you catch a fish, can you take it home and keep it as a pet?" he asks.  
</P>
<P>
 When told that the idea is to either release the fish or take them home for 
dinner, Torres seems disappointed at first. Hesitating for a moment, he smiles 
and decides aloud: "OK, then I want to catch a fish to take home and eat. I can 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres and the rest finally get their chance, at an area off the Huntington 
Beach coast.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Larsen's rod bends, and he reels as fast as he can. A club member 
tells him what to do and he soon bounces an energetic mackerel onto the deck. 
Vasquez gets a hit and pulls in a small calico bass. Sampson hooks up, but 
loses his fish after only a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you looked good fighting it," Wright says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looked good for nothing," Sampson responds, then hooks up again, and lands a 
large mackerel.  
</P>
<P>
 Meza, who seemed to forget about her seasickness, is pulled from one side of 
the stern to the other by a large mackerel. Milton Beckman tells her to reel 
slowly, but she can't stop, reeling the fish all the way to the top eye of her 
rod. She doesn't want to touch the fish but does so after some coaxing by 
Wright, posing with it briefly before letting go and reaching out to get a hug 
from a laughing Jose Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, everybody is either hooked up or posing with a fish. Hermilo Jimenez 
grabs his fish from the deck and squeezes it as tightly as he can, but it still 
wriggles free. Flores refuses to take his fish from John Hess, instead lifting 
Hess' arm by the wrist to pose with his catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Pablo Catalan catches a mackerel, then lands a sand bass. He won't touch 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no, I'm not crazy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers try to keep up with it all, but it isn't easy. Everyone is 
hooking up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never done so much hooking and handing off," Levy says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Levy's job is getting easier. The young anglers seem to have temporarily 
forgotten about their blindness and mastered the fine art of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalan grabs a rod and runs to the rail, letting fly a perfect cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't fished much, but now I know how to fish," he says, waiting for 
another bite. "I may lack the experience, but I do know how to fish." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are some people in this world who know how to make a difference.

FROM RISING SUN A REGIMEN BEGINS; COMMITTED JAPANESE YOUNGSTERS THRIVE ON 
WORKOUTS THAT OFTEN LAST SIX HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Amid a steady drizzle, a crowd began to gather near the bullpen at Chaminade 
High. On the mound was 17-year-old right-hander Takahiro Yamazaki of Shizuoka 
Commercial High in Japan. On display was the Japanese approach to America's 
national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 The game between Chaminade and the visitors from Japan had just been canceled. 
But instead of heading for shelter, Yamazaki headed for the hill and started 
slinging in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I throw many pitches," Yamazaki said through an interpreter. "If it is 
raining, it makes it harder, but I still throw. I throw about 200 pitches a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred pitches? Every day?  
</P>
<P>
 "It is almost common sense in Japan," Yamazaki said. "Everybody does it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's ridiculous, you say? So do pitchers and professional trainers on this 
side of the Pacific. Regardless, the regimen is as routine as a high chopper to 
third in Japan, where practices are long and intense, and so is the high school 
baseball season. It might still be ichi , ni , san strikes, you're out at the 
ol' boru gemu , but matters run much deeper than that for those wearing 
baseball uniforms in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age members of Commercial, which won three of four games during a recent 
one-week visit to Southern California, typically practice six hours on school 
days, including two hours before classes. Sunday workouts not only are routine, 
they're lengthier, stretching as long as 12 hours. During summer and winter 
vacations, players head to baseball camps, where training becomes even more of 
a religion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after their arrival in Los Angeles, Commercial players and coaches 
were on the practice field at Santa Monica High shortly after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days during our visit, practices are much shorter, but the quality is 
good," Commercial Coach Katsutoshi Shimizu said. "In Japan, we practice, 
sometimes, more than 10 hours a day. That's not a lot. That's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's ace, Yamazaki (5-feet-11, 175 pounds) has thrown daily since the 
age of 6 -- that is, every single day, during the season and off-season, pain, 
rain or shine. Just the thought of subjecting one's arm to that kind of labor 
is enough to make a promising young pitcher cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sounds really dangerous," said Randy Wolf, a senior left-hander for El 
Camino Real High and last season's Times' All-Valley pitcher of the year. Wolf, 
who has signed to attend Pepperdine, said he enters the bullpen no more than 
twice between weekly starts and never throws more than 40 pitches in one 
practice stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Never, Wolf said, does he throw the day after a start. And his off-season 
training regimen is considerably lighter than it is during the spring. Wolf, by 
the way, pitched a no-hitter and a perfect game in successive starts last 
season, then picked up a save in Dodger Stadium as El Camino Real won the City 
Section 4-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your arm can only take so many throws," Wolf said. "If you throw too much, it 
will take a toll." 
</P>
<P>
 Such has long been the widely held philosophy among baseball minds: Throw too 
much and too often -- especially at an early age -- and say goodby to longevity 
as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Strasser, assistant trainer for the Dodgers and a consultant to two 
professional baseball teams in Japan over the past six years, said throwing an 
abundance of pitches on a steady basis is a widely accepted training philosophy 
in the Far East. But it generally is ill-advised among U.S. pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I would use (the word) outrageous, but 200 pitches does sound 
like way too much," Strasser said. "We would advise against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park, the 20-year-old right-hander from South Korea who is challenging 
for a spot on the Dodgers' opening-day roster, was raised on a similar 
throw-often philosophy, Strasser said. Coaches have spent spring training 
adjusting the young pitcher's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a lot of work when he first came over," Strasser said. "He thought he 
wasn't working hard enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartan-like training philosophy of the Japanese is difficult to 
understand for scholars of America's national pastime. Many American 
ballplayers who have played professionally in Japan have clashed with team 
management over policies such as pregame workouts that last up to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans don't practice long enough," Commercial catcher Shingo Oki said. 
"They don't spend as much time with baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimizu, the high school coach, said the Japanese "think differently" about 
baseball. "Over here, if the Americans lose, it's OK," he said. "You don't have 
to win all the time. In Japan, you have to win no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, perpetual practice has made near-perfect for the Japanese in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, the first year the International Youth Baseball Federation began 
sponsoring their visits, high school teams from Japan have made sushi of foes, 
posting a 25-1-1 record. The list of the vanquished includes Santa Monica, 
Santa Barbara, Dos Pueblos, Oxnard and Chaminade, as well as teams from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Shizuoka City High won all six of its games by a combined score of 
53-15. Last season, Commercial was 4-0, outscoring the opposition, 36-6, 
including Chaminade, which fell, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial's honorable on-field assault features a steady stream of bunts, 
relentless stealing and "scoring runs without getting a hit," Shimizu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played the little game very well and their execution on defense was 
masterful," Chaminade Coach Dave Desmond said. "We walked away thinking, 'Those 
guys are fanatical in their training.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In California, state high school rules prohibit pitchers from throwing more 
than 10 innings per week. Sunday practices are prohibited. And even teams that 
reach championship competition play only about 30 games during a season that 
lasts no longer than 3 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, there are no rules limiting the amount of practice. High school 
teams play between 70 and 90 games during a season that begins in March and 
culminates in August with a national championship tournament in ancient Koshien 
Stadium near Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-elimination tournament, which begins with 49 teams culled from 
nearly 4,000 schools, has become a national obsession since its inception in 
1915. Games draw more than 60,000 fans and are televised nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament "is unquestionably the country's single biggest sporting event 
. . . like America's Super Bowl and World Series all rolled into one," wrote 
author Robert Whiting in his 1989 book, "You Gotta Have Wa ," a study of 
baseball in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Players speak of the national tournament with reverence, and playing in 
Koshien Stadium is considered an honor to be cherished for life. Last season, 
Commercial came within one game of qualifying for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning and going to the national tournament is our only goal," said Oki, one 
of five returning players from last season. "Once you have lost, that's it. You 
don't play any more." 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, throwing continuously is believed to strengthen the arm, not hurt 
it, Shimizu said. Arm injuries among his pitchers, the coach said, have been 
rare. Shimizu said pitchers are coached to throw with proper mechanics at an 
early age and are closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt my arm once," Yamazaki said. "That was a long time ago. I'm not going 
to be in any pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Strasser of the Dodgers said that is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody believes that, but we're all human," Strasser said. "God didn't put 
any of us on Earth to throw baseballs. It's abnormal." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several years, Strasser has participated in research conducted 
by the respected Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in Inglewood. "Our belief is that the more 
innings thrown at an earlier age, the quicker or earlier the onset of possible 
arm injuries," Strasser said. "We're looking to see if there is a correlation 
between the amount of innings and the onset of injury. We think we'll see a 
correlation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Studies aside, the baseball world is filled with stories of pitchers with 
blown-out arms -- in the United States and Japan. Ohta, Misawa's hero of the 
1969 tournament, was washed up at 27. Indeed, many top pitchers in Japan burn 
out their arms young, according to Whiting, who worked for six years as a 
columnist for the Tokyo Daily Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't seem to bother Japanese players, who are urged to ignore 
pain. One reason might be the emphasis placed on the national tournament, which 
originated two decades before the first professional team was formed in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, practice can seem overwhelming even to the Japanese players. But the 
potential reward is considered great. 
</P>
<P>
 Oki, the Commercial catcher, raised three swollen fingers on his throwing hand 
during an interview, explaining through an interpreter that pitchers are not 
the only ones encouraged to "play through the pain" in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 "We practice, sometimes, till 9 or 10 at night," Oki said. "Before, I wanted 
to quit over 100 times. But when I hit a home run in the national tournament, I 
will forget all about that."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CHAN HO PARK HAS A BIG FAN IN PETER O'MALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a gathering with reporters Tuesday at Vero Beach, Fla., Dodger owner Peter 
O'Malley left little doubt over which player had drawn his fondest attention 
this spring -- Korean rookie pitcher Chan Ho Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has helped make this the most exciting spring for me in many years," 
O'Malley said. "He's a very exciting young man. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously believe he can play with us soon at the major league level. I 
hope he's with the major league club on opening day. I enjoy watching him 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Park, scheduled to start the Dodgers' final Grapefruit League game today, has 
a 2.37 earned-run average in five spring starts. O'Malley said he had not been 
as enthusiastic about the potential impact of a player since Fernando 
Valenzuela's rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reluctant to compare Chan Ho with Fernando, but, I've said this before, I 
think the most exciting era for me in Dodger history is Fernandomania," 
O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see (Park) making an impact not just in L.A., not just in America, but 
throughout the world. We're on the threshold here of something very, very 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Malley said he would leave the decision on when Park makes the major 
league team to his baseball people. Park currently appears set to start the 
season with the Dodgers as a long reliever -- but possibly could open in the 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do everything possible not to rush him, not to overload him," 
O'Malley said. "The decision whether or not Chan Ho makes the team will be 
based on what's best long-term for him, not what is best for the ballclub in 
April or May." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley also touched on several other topics: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the possibility of the Raiders playing at Dodger Stadium in 1994 if the 
earthquake-damaged Coliseum is not ready: "We have had no inquiries from the 
city, the county, the Coliseum commission or the Raiders. I would guess the 
Raiders will be playing at the Coliseum. By the 29th of March, we surely should 
have heard a call -- we've received no call." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the future of Manager Tom Lasorda: "He's in good health and he's doing 
an outstanding job managing. We're not going to be making this a distraction." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the status of Darryl Strawberry: "He seems to be letting his actions 
speak for him and that's good," O'Malley said before pausing to knock on wood. 
"I think he's a happy camper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Lasorda named Orel Hershiser to start the opener Tuesday against 
the Florida Marlins at Dodger Stadium. Charlie Hough is slated for the Marlins. 
. . . General Manager Fred Claire said there are no plans to leave Kevin Gross 
behind for extended spring training at Vero Beach. Gross, who has an 8.00 ERA 
this spring, is set to start one of the games of this weekend's Freeway Series 
against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers lost their fourth consecutive game, 6-1, to the Houston Astros, at 
Vero Beach. Newly-acquired reliever Al Osuna arrived in camp and pitched one 
scoreless inning against his old team. . . . Cory Snyder, who had been 
sidelined most of spring with back and rib injuries and lost his right-field 
job to Raul Mondesi, sprained a ligament in his right knee while batting in a 
minor league game Monday night. Snyder has not appeared with the major league 
team this spring, and is listed as day to day. TIM KAWAKAMI

ANGELS HAPPY TO GET REYNOLDS; BASEBALL: TEAM BELIEVES FORMER PADRE SECOND 
BASEMAN WILL MAKE THEM A CONTENDER. HE WILL PLATOON WITH HUDLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Harold Reynolds packed his bags and strolled 100 yards Tuesday morning, from 
the San Diego Padres' clubhouse to the visiting clubhouse, to greet his new 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a short way for Reynolds, but the Angels consider it a huge step, now 
convinced that they will be title contenders in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if we could contend in any division in baseball," Angel General 
Manager Bill Bavasi said. "But believe me, I know we're good enough to contend 
in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of Reynolds -- the Angels sent the Padres pitcher Hilly 
Hathaway -- gives them what they believe will be their opening-day roster. 
Reynolds, a three-time Gold Glove winner and two-time All-Star, will platoon at 
second base with Rex Hudler. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also released infielders Torey Lovullo and Mike Brumley, and relief 
pitcher Lee Guetterman, and optioned pitcher Brian Anderson to triple-A 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman J.T. Snow, infielder Rod Correia, catcher Jorge Fabregas and 
outfielder Steve Hosey are expected to be optioned to Vancouver by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think we can win this thing," said Manager Buck Rodgers, who watched 
his team win its third consecutive exhibition, 10-6, over the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who will be paid a base salary of $230,000 with $75,000 available in 
incentives, was passed over by the Angels during the winter. Instead they 
traded for shortstop Spike Owen and were hopeful that Kevin Flora would win the 
job at second. But when Flora was sent to the minors last week, and they were 
unable to acquire Bill Spiers from Milwaukee, they turned to Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch, he's going to be absolutely wonderful for the Angels," said Merv 
Rettenmund, Padre hitting coach. "He's going to have a career year." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a two-time All-Star, batted .252 last season at Baltimore. He 
appeared in 138 games at second base and ranked third in the league in fielding 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, 33, who lost his starting job this spring when the Padres decided to 
move Bip Roberts to second base, was grateful for the trade. He believes that 
he still is an everyday player and made a good impression by hitting a double 
and a triple Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want a chance," he said. "And I know I'll get it now."

 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Since finishing a disappointing second in the high jump at 
6 feet 8 inches in the Sunkist Invitational indoor meet last month, Fischer has 
been on a tear. He cleared a then-personal best of 7-3 on March 2 and followed 
that with a second-place mark of 7-2 in the National Scholastic indoor 
championships in Syracuse, N.Y., on March 13.On Saturday, he raised his best to 
7-4 to win the Santa Barbara Easter Relays at Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: With his 7-4 effort, Fischer added an inch to his Ventura 
County record and surpassed the region record of 7-3 1/4 set by Lee Balkin of 
Glendale in 1979. It also moved him into a tie for eighth on the all-time U.S. 
high school outdoor list and ranks second on the all-time state list. The state 
record of 7-4 1/2 and the national high school record of 7-6 appear to be 
within Fischer's reach, but the Wisconsin-bound jumper says he isn't obsessed 
with his standing on the all-time lists. "I don't really worry about lists or 
things like that," he said. "I'm happy because I'm jumping high consistently 
and I'm jumping well in the big meets. That's what is most important to me."

</P>
<P>
 YEAR: Sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Richardson, a 5-foot-5 right-hander, is 8-1 and has 56 
strikeouts in 57 innings. In her only defeat, she pitched a one-hitter.She has 
given up seven walks and four earned runs, and sports a 0.49 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Richardson might never escape the shadow of her older sister 
Laura, who pitched Camarillo to a Southern Section title in 1991 and earned a 
scholarship last season to play for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. But the younger 
Richardson last week matched her sister's greatest feat of 1993: a victory 
against Simi Valley. Last season, Camarillo -- behind Laura's two-hit, 
11-strikeout performance -- was the only team to beat Simi Valley, which 
finished 26-1-1 and won the Southern Section Division I title. A year later, 
Camarillo has given Simi Valley (8-1), the state's top-ranked team according to 
Cal-Hi Sports, its first loss. Richardson pitched a one-hitter with eight 
strikeouts and beat Sara Griffin (two-hitter, nine strikeouts), the 1993 state 
player of the year. "It was the best game intensity-wise that she has pitched 
for me," Camarillo Coach Darwin Tolzin said. "It kind of reminded me of her 
sister. Her concentration level was very high."

DIGEST: LIBERTY LEAGUE SEEKS CHANGE IN DIVIDING OF PLAYOFF PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Liberty League officials have submitted a proposal to the Southern Section 
that would change the way playoff profits are divided among schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current system, the section receives 50% of profits from each 
playoff game, and the participating schools split the other 50%.Under the 
Liberty League plan, all profits from playoff competition would be returned to 
the Southern Section and used primarily to reduce membership fees and expand 
coaching education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will be debated at the next general council meeting on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt a little uncomfortable that whether a team wins or loses 
determines how much money the school will be getting," said Eric Walter, 
athletic director at Oakwood School and president of the Liberty League. "If 
we're supposed to have a notion of cooperation rather than competition, then 
more schools would benefit. If nothing else this will get people thinking and 
change the status quo." Baseball

 The Van Nuys High baseball team has been forced to forfeit Saturday's 3-2 
victory over University in an L.A. Invitational tournament game after the 
disclosure that Jesus Bolivar of Van Nuys exceeded the state weekly limit for 
innings pitched.

<P>
 Bolivar pitched 13 innings, three over the maximum, including a complete game 
against University and six innings against Poly five days earlier.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LOVULLO SHOCKED BY HIS RELEASE AS HE MOVES ON

 Torey Lovullo, one of the Angels' most popular players, couldn't bear to stick 
around Tuesday morning after General Manager Bill Bavasi informed him he was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 He said goodby to Mark Langston and a few other early arrivals, and quickly 
left for home to tell his wife. He returned to clean out his locker after the 
team left for Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," said Lovullo, who batted .251 last season in 116 games for 
the Angels. "I really was shocked how it all happened. I guess it's really time 
for me to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad I'm leaving the Angels, but grateful for the opportunity they gave 
me. I knew the writing was on the wall when (Rex Hudler) walked in Monday. I'm 
not going to question their personnel moves, but they have a plan.

 Barring any last-minute trades or injuries, the Angels' opening-day roster 
will be:  
</P>
<P>
 Starting rotation, in order: Mark Langston, John Dopson, Chuck Finley, Phil 
Leftwich and Mark Leiter.

 Although the Angels say there is only a flicker of interest, they sent Moose 
Stubing to scout New York Met starter Anthony Young in his start Tuesday 
against the Atlanta Braves. Young drew rave reviews, pitching five shutout 
innings, and giving up six hits. The Mets sent Harry Minor to scout the Angels. 
. . . This will be the third time in Mike Brumley's career that he has switched 
teams in the final week of spring training. He's expected to be claimed by the 
Oakland Athletics, and will join them Friday. "I had a bad feeling when Whitey 
(Herzog) resigned," Brumley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson hit his team-leading fourth home run of the spring, and he also has 
a team-high 14 RBIs. . . . Davis played the outfield for the first time this 
spring, and handled his first ball when leadoff batter Bip Roberts hit a fly to 
him. Davis camped under the ball, but lost it in the sun, and it hit his chest. 
It was the only ball hit to him during his four-inning stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich (2-1), in perhaps his best outing of the spring, gave up eight hits 
and three earned runs in seven innings. . . . Butcher still is throwing in the 
low 90s, but his control continues to be a problem. He gave up four hits and 
three earned runs in one inning, raising his ERA to 12.96. He has given up 
eight hits and six earned runs in his last two innings. . . . The Angels are 
projecting Joe Magrane to rejoin the rotation on either May 5 or 6. Magrane, 
who has not pitched in a game since undergoing arthroscopic elbow surgery last 
month, is scheduled to pitch two innings today. . . . Catcher Chris Turner, who 
was hit by a foul pitch Monday, had negative X-rays. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 The Kansas City Royals asked waivers on outfielder Chris Gwynn for the purpose 
of giving him his unconditional release. Gwynn, 29, was batting .229 with two 
doubles, two triples, one home run and seven RBIs in 14 spring training games. 
</P>

<P>
 First baseman Kevin Maas, who hit 21 home runs in three months in a 
record-setting rookie season for the New York Yankees in 1990, was released. 
Maas, 29, hit .205 with nine home runs and 25 RBIs in 151 at-bats last year for 
the Yankees.

<P>
 The Florida Marlins shook up their bullpen, requesting waivers for the purpose 
of giving veteran left-handers Joe Klink and Rich Rodriguez their unconditional 
release. Both pitched last season for the Marlins, who will save about $1 
million by the move. . . . The Atlanta Braves settled on their opening day 
roster, with rookie outfielder Mike Kelly edging out pitcher Mike Birkbeck and 
speedster Jarvis Brown for the final spot.

 The Toronto Blue Jays traded first baseman Domingo Martinez to the Chicago 
White Sox for outfielder Mike Huff. . . . Michael Jordan got his first extra

EDISON TAKES CHARGE IN ALL-SPORTS CHAMPIONSHIP; COMPETITION: CHARGERS GO TO THE 
BANK WITH STRONG BOYS' BASKETBALL AND SOCCER TEAMS TO PASS LOS ALAMITOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Winter wasn't bitter for Southern Californians, and it wasn't bitter for 
several Orange County high schools pursuing the all-sports championship, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Several schools experienced unseasonably summer-like conditions as their 
athletic programs warmed up to the possibility of being crowned the best 
all-around sports champion for the first time in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, The Times will honor county all-sports champions in two 
divisions: Large school (1,200 or more students) and small school (fewer than 
1,200.) Edison currently leads the large-school division and Corona del Mar is 
the one to catch among the small schools with the spring season left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison replaces Los Alamitos, which led the large-school division after the 
fall season. The Griffins dropped to third while Mater Dei moved into second. 
Corona del Mar has led the small-school division from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we would have a pretty good winter," said Bruce Belcher, Edison 
girls' athletic director. "We were trying to run through the sports and see how 
well we'd do," in comparison to some of the top-ranked schools. Edison figured 
Los Alamitos would score high in girls' soccer and boys' basketball, and the 
Griffins did. But Edison, with key points in boys' soccer and basketball, 
scored even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the small-school division, Brea-Olinda takes over the No. 2 position 
previously held by Corona del Mar's Sea View League rival Newport Harbor, which 
fell to third. Brea made its move in girls' basketball. The undefeated Ladycats 
won their fifth State title and added 40 points to move up from fifth place in 
the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Corona del Mar led the small-school division as well as the 
overall standings with 170.3 points to Los Alamitos' 150.7. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, large-school leader Edison has the highest total with 237.7. Mater 
Dei moves from seventh overall to second with 235.7 points. Corona del Mar is 
third overall at 222.52, but has a comfortable lead over Brea-Olinda (197.1) in 
the small-school division. 
</P>
<P>
 Final standings will be posted and awards distributed to the winners at the 
end of the school year, when point totals from the fall (six sports, 240 
possible points), winter (five sports, 200 points) and spring (10 sports, 400 
points) seasons have been tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings are based on a formula that considers overall record (through 
Southern Section finals or league only, depending on the sport), league finish 
(points for first, second, third, and at-large playoff berths) and performance 
in section championship competition. 
</P>
<P>
 A school was left with no points for a sport if it went winless, did not 
compete in that sport, or did not report that team's results. Every effort was 
made, through correspondence and phone calls with schools and the section 
office, to obtain a point total for each team at every school. But records were 
unavailable in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how Edison reached its county-leading 237.7 points. Point totals are 
rounded off, allowing for one-tenth of a point discrepancy between the overall 
total and the sum of each sport's score: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chargers carried over 141.6 points from their fall sports. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The boys' basketball team finished 20-9 (6.9 points), fourth in the Sunset 
League (three points) and runner-up in section play (16 points). Total: 25.9. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Girls' basketball was 17-9 (6.5), third in league (five), but did not make 
it to the quarterfinals in section play (zero). Total: 11.5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Boys' soccer was 19-6-1 (7.5), third in league (five) and lost in the 
section quarterfinals (eight). Total: 20.5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Girls' soccer was 22-5-3 (7.8), second in the league (seven) and lost in 
the section quarterfinals (eight). Total: 22.8. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wrestling was 5-1 (8.3) and second in league (seven). No points in section 
competition. Total: 15.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei made its big move with a perfect 40-point performance in boys' 
basketball, and 34.6 in girls' basketball, 38.7 points in boys' soccer and 29.6 
points in girls' soccer. Boys' and girls' basketball and soccer won league 
titles. The Monarchs had two section champions, one runner-up and one semifinal 
loser. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sport where the Monarchs faltered was wrestling (two points). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of our coaches," said Gary McKnight, Mater Dei boys' 
basketball coach and athletic director. "They work awfully hard, and so do the 
kids. It's a tribute to their work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight also recognized the work ethic of other campus groups that don't 
score in the all-sports championship, singling out the Monarchs' spirit squad, 
which recently won a co-ed national title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt the success we had in fall would be carried on," he said. "We felt we 
should be ranked up in the top schools. . . . I just wish we could get our 
cheerleaders in on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher wished Edison's field hockey team could be in on the all-sports trophy 
chase. Field hockey in the winter, as well as gymnastics in the spring, is 
excluded from the competition because the section doesn't recognize official 
section champions in those sports. 
</P>
<P>
 If field hockey was an acknowledged sport, Edison would have picked up more 
points. The Chargers won the Sunset League title and reached the final of the 
Tournament of Champions, field hockey's unofficial section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the competition is full of what-ifs. If Edison had defeated Mater Dei in 
the Division I-A boys' basketball final, its lead over the Monarchs would have 
been a few points greater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't shocking that boys' basketball did well," Belcher said. "We knew 
what the kids were capable of, but it was somewhat of a surprise they came 
through that far. Too bad we didn't beat Mater Dei." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Monarchs' jump was impressive, the vault Capistrano Valley made, 
although not to the forefront, was equally eye-catching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars leaped from 20th to seventh place behind quality girls' soccer and 
wrestling teams. It's interesting to note that the Cougars' wrestling team, 
which won the South Coast League title, decided not to compete in the section 
dual-team competition to save its strength for the individual section 
championships, where it qualified 10 wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars would have fared well in section play, picking up all-sports 
points where they possibly could have caught sixth-place Sunny Hills, which 
added wrestling points (six) by reaching the quarterfinals of the section 
Division I dual-meet playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another noteworthy move in the large-school division was by Woodbridge, which 
moved up 10 spots to 21st thanks to its section champion girls' basketball 
team. And Marina, a perennial soccer powerhouse, jumped from 22nd to 12th 
largely on the basis of its soccer performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica made impressive advances in the small-school division with its boys' 
basketball team, which won a section title and reached the State championship 
game for the first time in the school's history. The Mariners went from 16th to 
eighth place in the division largely because of the basketball team's 39.6 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every school moved up. In the large-school division, Dana Hills dropped 
from fifth to 11th, and Valencia fell from eighth to 16th. Among the small 
schools, Laguna Beach took a dive, falling from fourth to 14th. Only the 
Artists' girls' soccer team scored more than five points in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 So now, the looming question becomes, can Edison hold its slim lead over Mater 
Dei during the busy spring season? 
</P>
<P>
 Although both schools enjoy nearly a 20-point lead over third-place Los 
Alamitos (216.9), the race could still be between Edison and Los Alamitos. 
Mater Dei, strong in baseball, softball and girls' track, simply doesn't have 
the depth across the entire playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparatively, Edison and Los Alamitos appear neck-and-neck in the spring. 
Edison's baseball program looks stronger than Los Alamitos', but the Griffins' 
softball team is better. Edison has a top-10 boys' volleyball team, but Los 
Alamitos is on equal footing in boys' tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 In track, both schools' boys' teams are average, but Edison's girls are 
top-five material. Neither school has a standout golf team, but Los Alamitos 
has the upper-hand in swimming, where the Griffins have quality girls' and 
boys' teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison believes it can hold its position, but won't fall into a funk if it 
drops a notch or two after the spring session. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lost to either (Mater Dei or Los Alamitos), it wouldn't be an 
embarrassment," Belcher said. "They both are very quality schools in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar's commanding lead in the small-school division could diminish 
this spring. The Sea Kings have a top-10 tennis team and highly competitive 
baseball, volleyball, boys' swimming, golf and girls' track teams. But Brea, 
with competitive girls' track, golf, softball, baseball and swimming programs, 
can't be ignored. Newport Harbor, strong in volleyball, tennis and track, 
trails Brea by eight points and might challenge the Wildcats to regain its 
runner-up place. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools are concerned that their lack of a badminton team will hurt them 
in the spring scoring. But Sunny Hills and Fountain Valley, in sixth and ninth 
place (75 and 93 points behind Edison), are the only top-10 large schools that 
field badminton teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In the small-school division, ninth-place Estancia -- a section badminton 
semifinalist last year -- could earn league and section points. Corona del Mar, 
a wild-card entry in the badminton playoffs in 1993, won't suffer like some of 
the other top small schools. Large-School Division Top 20

 SCORING -- Totals are reached using a formula that considers: 1. Winning 
percentage (overall record through Southern Section finals for basketball and 
soccer; league record only for wrestling). An undefeated season is worth 10 
points. 2. Place in league standings (10 points for first, 7 for second, 5 for 
third and 3 for fourth or at-large playoff berth); 3. Performance in Southern 
Section championship competition. (20 points for first, 16 for second, 12 for 
third and fourth (or semifinal losers), 8 for fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth 
(or quarterfinal losers)). A perfect score -- undefeated season, league and 
section championships) is 40 points. (Note: For purposes of this chart only, 
values rounded to 10ths. Rounding might create slight discrepancies between sum 
of individual figures listed and total). Teams that did not report or field a 
team in a sport received a score of 0.0.

 Basketball is still being played on the North Carolina campus this week, but 
it's the women's team and not Dean Smith's club that is close to a 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels (31-2) are making their first appearance in the women's Final 
Four against Purdue on Saturday. The men's team was upset by Boston College in 
the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>

 "The guys had their chance and they blew it, and we are still in it and we're 
not giving up this chance," said Tonya Sampson, the program's all-time leading 
scorer with 2,106 points.

 Arizona Coach Lute Olson says it's a new season, and he's through bashing the 
media.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's over with, this is Final Four week," he said in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Arizona clinched the NCAA West Regional title with a 92-72 victory 
over top-seeded Missouri. Olson had used the occasion to vigorously defend his 
team, which had exited the NCAA tournament in the first round the previous two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He contended the Wildcats had been unfairly attacked and his players were 
burdened by the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did that for one reason . . . . for the players and the abuse that the 
players have taken," he said. "And I've done it and the players are thankful 
that I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said he was irked by comments after the 1992 and 1993 tournament losses 
in which his players, whom he called "members of our family," were branded 
losers and chokers. 
</P>
<P>

 Florida has fed off the role of underdog all season, but Coach Lon Kruger said 
it won't necessarily be a source of motivation against Duke on Saturday in 
Charlotte, N.C. The Gators accept that few people believe they will beat the 
Blue Devils and intend to approach the game the way they did their first 36. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not any reason to do it differently," Kruger said. "You prepare for 
each game with the idea of doing whatever is necessary to give yourself the 
best chance to play as well as possible. Of course the stage is a little 
different, and the setting is a little different. But still, the preparation 
will be exactly the same."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: HOLLAND SEEKING A FEW GOOD MEN WHO 
ARE COMPETITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Cal State Fullerton basketball Coach Brad Holland what he's looking for in 
this year's recruiting class and he doesn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Competitiveness," he said, the word popping out as though a balloon had just 
burst. "We'll have a focus on that more than before. We want guys who really 
want to compete hard. You can watch kids play and tell how competitive they 
really are and we've been watching for that quality." 
</P>
<P>
 This is an important recruiting season for Holland and his assistants. Every 
recruiting period is important, of course, but it is magnified when a team is 
coming off an 8-19 season. It was the Titans' worst since going 4-23 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news, though, is the team played hard and got better as it went 
along," Holland said. "Our players can take that experience and use it to get 
better next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the second-season jinx, which sometimes happens to coaches struggling 
to put a program on solid ground. The Titans were a surprise in Holland's first 
year. Picked to finish ninth in the Big West, they wound up tied for fifth with 
a 10-8 conference record. The overall record of 15-12 was Fullerton's first 
winning season since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the team's top seven scorers will be back, with senior Greg Vernon the 
sole player departing from that group. The Titans also will have Chris Dade and 
DeVaughn Wright, who sat out as medical redshirts. But Holland still will be in 
a position to offer talented recruits an opportunity to play immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland has four scholarships available and he expects to fill them all in the 
signing period that runs from April 13-May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific needs? "We're looking for a couple of perimeter players who are 
athletic and can shoot," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic budgeting process is under way at Fullerton, but things will be a 
little different this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A student government committee will be part of the process for the first time 
after a student vote last spring endowed the athletic program with $14 per 
student per semester. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't come at a better time, as far as Athletic Director Bill Shumard is 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 The student funds are expected to produce an additional $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard says state money steadily has dwindled from the $2.5 million the 
school received for athletics the year he became athletic director in 1991. He 
expects state funds this year to be about $1.75 million, down from the $1.8 
million in the last budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The student committee will make its recommendations to me as part of the 
regular budgeting process," Shumard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five athletes will be members of the 11-member student advisory board. That 
group includes Tony Fetchel, baseball; Tom Casto, cross-country and track; 
Heidi Robertson, volleyball and softball; Kara Kolb, tennis, and Karena Mills, 
gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard's final budget proposal will require approval by the school's athletic 
council and the president's office. He plans to have it ready to present on 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans are back in the No. 1 spot in both college baseball rankings after 
two victories over Wichita State last week and a three-game sweep of San Jose 
State to open Big West play during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Collegiate Baseball rankings, Georgia Tech is second and Florida State 
is third. Baseball America has Florida State second and USC third. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's 24-5 record is the best in the Big West. Pacific had a three-game 
sweep of Nevada Las Vegas during the weekend and is 24-6. Pacific has won 18 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Wagner, with a 6-0 record and 1.08 earned-run average, continues to pace 
the Fullerton pitching staff. Mike Parisi has a 6-1 record and 1.66 ERA. The 
staff ERA is 2.62. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Gill leads the team in hitting with a .387 average. Jeff Ferguson is the 
leader among Titan players with more than 70 at-bats with a .367 average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Titan gymnastics Coach Lynn Rogers was pleased with his team's performance in 
winning the Big West title Sunday in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really proud of our kids, and they had gotten to the point where they 
were going to be pleased with their performance whether we finished first or 
second," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers thought Celeste Delia, who won the all-around title, had her best 
performance of the season. She was second on vault, tied for second on the 
uneven bars, fourth in floor exercise and sixth on balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Cristi Clifford and Karena Mills deserve a great deal of credit, too," 
Rogers said. "Clifford finished really strong in the second half of the season 
and Mills competed with a knee that is still bothering her after an injury 
three weeks ago. She was limping to the finish line, but I was really pleased 
with the way she competed." 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford was third in the all-around. Mills' highest finish was second on the 
balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton will be seeded third in the NCAA West Regional, highest since the 
Titans were also seeded third in 1990. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Bagalayos leads the Titan softball team in hitting with a .323 average. 
Melissa Hadfield has a team-leading 22 runs batted in. Jennifer Mortensen has 
the team's best pitching record at 8-9. . . . A men's team from Fullerton is 
scheduled to compete in the Intercollegiate Bowling Championships at Carson 
City, Nev., April 13-17. Team members are Dwight Tincher, Brad Petzel, Brent 
Breidinger, Jamie Spencer, David Walters and Jason Sjobom. Scott Poddig is the 
coach.

A BUTTERFLY FLUTTERS BACK FROM THE BRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENT WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising from the dead to dispute its own obituary, a fragile blue butterfly 
believed to have been extinct for more than a decade has been rediscovered on 
Navy land in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists had thought all Palos Verdes blue butterflies had been destroyed by 
development years ago, and virtually everyone had given up hope and stopped 
looking for the endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, in a surprising find demonstrating that nature may always mystify 
scientists, about 100 of the graceful butterflies have been found flitting 
around a pocket of deer weed at a Navy fuel depot next to Chevron's oil 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the "PV blue," the butterfly had been something of a cause celebre, 
its case often invoked by biologists to illustrate how endangered-species 
protection can come too late for animals and plants teetering on the edge of 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The pale blue butterfly with black spots was protected as an endangered 
species in 1980, but none had been seen since 1983, when the city of Rancho 
Palos Verdes rototilled a lot at Hesse Park to build a ballfield. Criminal 
charges were filed against the city, but a federal court dismissed them in 
1987, ruling that a municipality cannot be held criminally responsible for 
violating the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the same scientist who had originally reported them extinct 
discovered earlier this month that the PV blue is very much still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudi Mattoni, a visiting professor in UCLA's geography department, was the 
last scientist to see the butterfly alive 11 years ago, and had given up hope. 
Just last year, in the first sentence of a new scientific report, he referred 
to the Palos Verdes blue as "now certainly extinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on March 10, Mattoni and two other researchers were at the Navy's 
Defense Fuel Supply Point -- which had never been investigated for butterflies 
-- to trap insects as part of a biological survey of the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, bulldozers were digging up the area to replace part of a Chevron 
pipeline that runs through the naval base to the harbor, so Mattoni wanted to 
take a closer look at the habitat there. Suddenly, entomologist Rick Rogers 
yelled to Mattoni: "There goes a Palos Verdes butterfly!" They ran over and 
identified three of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just stumbled across them," Mattoni said. "It was a hell of a find. . . . 
This was total serendipity. We were there at the right time on the right day." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni asked Chevron's plant manager to stop the maintenance work, and he 
complied immediately. The next day, Mattoni went back and saw a dozen more of 
the butterflies, and in the past few days the discovery has been verified by 
entomologists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudi was the last one to see them before they disappeared, so it's only 
justice that he rediscovered them, since he has spent so much time on them," 
said John Hanlan, branch chief for federal projects at the Fish and Wildlife 
Service in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
 But the PV blue is not out of danger yet, and the federal wildlife agency is 
taking no chances. Mattoni was granted permission to net some of the 
butterflies and breed them in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of such reappearance cases have been reported nationally -- 
including the infamous snail darter in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare but not unheard of that a species should reappear," said David 
Klinger of the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinger said the federal wildlife agency routinely leaves species on the 
endangered list for years -- as it has with the PV blue -- even when they are 
assumed gone, because some insects can lie dormant as pupae in the soil for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never want to remove them totally from the list unless you are certain 
that all hope is gone," because once they are declared extinct it leaves them 
unprotected should the species reappear, Klinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery could reignite controversy over development on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, since it means that more thorough biological surveys must be 
conducted in the area before development projects are approved by the Fish and 
Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Land owners in the Palos Verdes area had hoped the butterfly would be removed 
from the nation's endangered list and classified as extinct, which would have 
streamlined the process for obtaining permission to build. Developers there are 
already facing restraints on use of their land because the California 
gnatcatcher, a tiny songbird, was listed as a threatened species last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The field inhabited by the butterflies is a rare area of undisturbed natural 
habitat left on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Only a few acres of deer weed and 
locoweed -- the plants where the butterfly lay their eggs -- remain, and all 
are fragmented. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't see a fragile butterfly for 10 years, you assume it's extinct, 
" Mattoni said. "They (the Navy) haven't paid any particular attention to the 
habitat, yet it hung on." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattoni said 100 to 200 of the butterflies exist at the Navy site, a number 
that entomologists believe is too low to ensure long-term survival. But Mattoni 
and Hanlan said they are confident that vegetation in the area can be fairly 
easily restored so the butterflies can survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "With insects, you feel like the species is endangered when it drops below 400 
or 500," Mattoni said. He said the Navy base had not been surveyed before 
because he had no idea it contained undeveloped habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he visited the naval base only because he got a grant from Rancho 
Palos Verdes -- the city accused of wiping out the species -- to survey the 
insect population. "I was there the day the bulldozers took it out. . . . Now 
here we are, full circle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another ironic touch, Chevron is known for TV commercials that spotlight 
its work to allow endangered species to coexist with oil fields and refineries, 
including the El Segundo blue butterfly, a species closely related to the PV 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron spokesman Rod Spackman in El Segundo said the company is working with 
the federal wildlife agency to find a way to maintain its pipeline without 
hurting the species and is paying for more field work by Mattoni. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanlan said the bulldozers working on the Chevron pipeline might have harmed 
some of the butterfly's habitat before the project was shut down. But he added 
that no action will be taken against the Navy or Chevron. There was no proof of 
damage to the butterflies or gnatcatchers. Rediscovered Butterfly

KING SAYS HE'S NOW SURE POLICE USED RACIAL SLUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys on Tuesday were unable to shake Rodney G. King from his 
insistence that police officers used racial slurs while beating him three years 
ago in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who previously expressed uncertainty about whether such slurs were used, 
sometimes appeared confused or rattled during six hours on the witness stand 
Tuesday, most of it under cross-examination by attorneys for the city and for 
15 present and former police officers named in his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the pressure to waver on his story, King reiterated that he heard 
racial epithets during the March 3, 1991, beating. He stuck to his statement 
that he never threatened officers and that he only sought to protect himself 
from the baton blows and kicks he received during the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in Tuesday's court session, Milton Grimes, King's attorney, played the 
audio version of the videotape, made by bystander George Holliday, for the 
jurors in an effort to support his client's assertion that the beating was 
racially motivated. It was the first time that the audio portion of the tape 
has been played in court. 
</P>
<P>
 King, 28, was asked if he could point out places in the tape where the racial 
taunts could be heard over loud distortions and helicopter noises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could do it with my head turned," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tape was played, King turned away from the monitor. There was a muddled 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "There, there it is," King said. He said he heard on the tape: "Nigger, put 
your hands behind your back!" 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers in the courtroom also said they could hear a voice shout the 
phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, outside court, defense attorneys said they were not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can hear whatever you want to hear," said Skip Miller, an attorney hired 
by the city as part of the defense team. "That's how you can characterize it. 
It was totally unclear." 
</P>
<P>
 King testified during last year's federal trial -- in which two LAPD officers 
were convicted of violating his civil rights -- that he heard some of the 
officers on the scene three years ago use the racial slurs. But later, under 
cross-examination in that trial, he said he could not remember if he heard the 
word nigger or killer.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, King, testifying for a second day in the suit, said that despite 
his previous hesitation, he is certain that he heard the racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys used the apparent contradictions in Kings' earlier statement 
to challenge his credibility under cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 But the witness insisted: "I'm telling the truth, the whole truth, the way I 
saw it on March 3, and the way I heard it." 
</P>
<P>
 King was reminded that a few days after the beating he had made public 
comments and had made statements to police that the incident was not racially 
motivated. On Tuesday, he said that he had been afraid of going back to prison 
and that his mother at first suggested that he not raise he issue of race. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he later told the truth during the federal trial. Then, he testified 
that officers had said during the beating: "How you feel now, nigger? What's 
up, nigger? How you feel now, killer? How you feel now?" 
</P>
<P>
 But also during the federal trial, King, under pressure from defense 
attorneys, conceded that he may not have been sure of what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You chose to lie to police investigators?" King was asked by defense attorney 
Michael Stone, who represents Laurence M. Powell, one of two police officers 
convicted of violating King's civil rights during the federal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes sir," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under further cross-examination, King admitted, as he has in the past, to an 
armed robbery for which he was sent to prison in 1989, and conceded that he had 
had problems with his marriage. King also again admitted that he had used 
marijuana and had been arrested for driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has accepted liability for King's injuries. King's attorneys have 
asked for $9.5 million to settle the lawsuit, but the city has not moved from 
its offer of $1.25 million plus attorneys fees. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James K. Hahn, who has been sitting in on the trial, said after 
Tuesday's court session that the city is still willing to settle the suit out 
of court. "We may look into it again when the plaintiffs finish their case," he 
said. "The door isn't closed." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first phase of the case, the jury will determine how much King 
should be awarded in compensatory damages. In the second phase, his lawyers are 
to argue that individual defendants -- including the four officers originally 
charged in the beating -- also should pay King punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon was convicted with Powell in the federal trial. 
Former Officers Theodore J. Briseno and Timothy E. Wind were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the four men were acquitted on all but one assault charge in a 1992 
state trial, whose verdicts sparked three days of riots in Los Angeles.

MRS. CLINTON TURNED $1,000 STAKE INTO $99,000 PROFIT; WHITE HOUSE: HER AIDES 
DETAIL INVESTMENTS MADE IN '70S AT DIRECTION OF BROKER WHO WAS LATER BARRED 
FROM TRADING.

<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, acting on the advice of a commodities broker later 
barred from trading for ethical reasons and the lawyer for one of Arkansas' 
largest state-regulated businesses, turned a $1,000 stake into a $99,000 profit 
in less than a year in the late 1970s, the White House disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that there was nothing improper in Mrs. Clinton's speculation 
in cattle futures and other commodities, saying she benefited from a bull 
market "when a lot of people made a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton bailed out of the high-risk venture 10 months after she started 
because, an aide said, she became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 But after closing out one account that produced spectacular profits, Mrs. 
Clinton opened a second commodities trading account, losing a little more than 
$1,000 over five months. She finally left the market in 1980 just after the 
birth of her daughter, Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
 The new information sheds light on the Clintons' approach to investing, which 
involved little cash and large amounts of expert advice from well-connected 
friends. And the disclosures raised new questions about Mrs. Clinton's 
relationship to commodities broker Robert L. (Red) Bone, who was disciplined by 
market regulators for "serious and repeated" violations of exchange rules 
before and after Mrs. Clinton opened her commodities trading account with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House released the additional information about the commodities 
investment in response to numerous inquiries about the profits and after 
Newsweek magazine claimed that Mrs. Clinton had not invested any of her own 
money and had benefited from a "sweetheart deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek has since backed off its report. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the White House issued a statement that said, "Mrs. Clinton put up 
her own money, invested it in her own accounts and assumed the full risk of 
loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton did, however, benefit from the market savvy of James B. Blair, a 
close friend of the Clintons and at the time the principal outside attorney for 
Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest poultry producer. He is 
now the company's full-time legal counsel and director of a number of the 
chicken concern's subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides said Tuesday that Blair advised Mrs. Clinton to get into the 
commodities market and, along with unidentified others, guided her trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House statement said Mrs. Clinton opened a "margin" account at the 
Springdale, Ark., office of the Ray E. Friedman & Co. commodities brokerage of 
Chicago. Her broker was Bone, a former professional poker player and executive 
at Tyson Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 A month before Mrs. Clinton opened her account, Bone had completed a one-year 
prohibition on trading commodities for his own account. The penalty was levied 
by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission over allegations that he had 
tried to manipulate the egg futures market in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton's initial investment on Oct. 11, 1978, was $1,000. By the next 
day, successful trading had swollen her account balance to $5,300 and the 
profits (and some relatively small offsetting losses) began accumulating from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1978, Mrs. Clinton showed net profits of $26,541. Through the 
first seven months of 1979, she had built profits of $109,600, offset by losses 
of $36,600, for a net gain of $72,996. She closed the account in October with a 
total gain of $98,537. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange disciplined Bone for 
"repeated and serious violations of record-keeping functions, order-entry 
procedures, margin requirements and hedge procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercantile Exchange also had received complaints that Bone had illegally 
allocated profits to favored investors in his office, but no such charges were 
ever proved. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions against Bone were first reported by Securities Week, an industry 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official said Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton "had no knowledge 
of any allocation of trades" by Bone. Further, the aide said, the First Lady 
was "not aware of his previous difficulties" with market regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide said Blair gave Mrs. Clinton advice on the timing of trades, sharing 
with her his deep knowledge of agricultural commodities gained from his work at 
Tyson Foods. But the aide insisted that Mrs. Clinton spoke with other people 
about her trading and did not take all of Blair's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published in Tuesday's 
editions, said Mrs. Clinton did not get special treatment in the investment. He 
denied that she benefited from the allocation of profitable trades to her 
account while losing cattle trades were dumped in other investors' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Mrs. Clinton said that, despite her remarkable success in the 
tricky commodities market, she decided to stop making the investments in July, 
1979, shortly after becoming pregnant with Chelsea because the quick movements 
of the markets and the increasingly large dollar amounts at stake were "too 
nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
 The aide said that "it was her (Mrs. Clinton's) account and her risk," and 
that as far as the aide knew, then-Gov. Bill Clinton was not involved in her 
investment activities. 
</P>
<P>
 All the profits were reported as short-term capital gains on the couple's 
joint income tax returns for 1978 and 1979.

COLUMN ONE; FACING THE HARD SELL IN HIGH SCHOOL; COLLEGES USE GLOSSY MARKETING 
CAMPAIGNS, CONSULTANTS AND COOKIES TO LURE TOP PROSPECTS. SOME ARE EVEN 
COURTING EIGHTH-GRADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He's no starting quarterback or flashy point guard. But 17-year-old Daniel 
Craddock has put up numbers that would catch any college recruiter's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3.8 grade-point average. A respectable SAT score. A transcript adorned with 
advanced college credits . . . and he is African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder that MIT, Cornell and Stanford began sending Craddock letters of 
interest early in his junior year at Lakewood High School, way before he had to 
commit. Yet it was a UCLA recruiter that beat them to the punch, persuading 
Craddock to skip his senior year and go directly to the Westwood campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being approached by UCLA, I thought about it and I said, 'Why not?' " said 
Craddock, who hopes to become a doctor. "They kept pushing me and pushing and 
they showed an interest in (my) attending UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Craddock's story illustrates what many say has been an evolving -- and 
sometimes disturbing -- trend in higher education: Locked in an escalating 
competition for the nation's top high school achievers, especially those of 
color, colleges are wooing younger students. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges traditionally concentrate their recruiting energy on students in the 
last half of their junior year or those starting their senior year who have 
taken the ACT assessment or the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In recent years, 
however, competition has led some colleges to begin indirectly cultivating 
those in the eighth grade or earlier. And in what some experts say is a still 
rare but problematic twist, more schools are signing up the most exceptional 
academic stars as "early admissions," plucking them from the talent pool before 
competitors fall into hot pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something we recognize that is beginning to happen and people are 
beginning to talk about it," said Jeffery Tanner, associate dean of admissions 
at Brigham Young University and president of the American Assn. of Collegiate 
Registrars and Admissions Officers, which represents academic recruiting 
divisions of 2,500 institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "To bring a student in at a much earlier age, two years younger than their 
peers, I'm not sure we're doing them a favor," Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocking -- if not robbing -- the scholastic cradle underscores a war for 
survival that has transformed college admissions offices over the last decade 
into powerful marketing enterprises that use extensive mailing lists, 
consultants and sophisticated computer programs to track potential applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when low-paid admissions officers paddled quietly in 
administrative backwaters, pushing papers and relying largely on institutional 
reputations or connections with high school guidance counselors to steer a 
choice student their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, admissions offices employ full-time, higher-paid talent scouts and they 
cater to special market "segments." USC's School of Architecture seeks out 
minority high school students with B+ averages and an interest in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools convene focus groups, put up billboards, create posters worthy of the 
movies and mount phone campaigns. At Cal State Hayward, 150 professors have 
taken a "telemarketing" seminar and are responsible for encouraging about 25 
applicants each. 
</P>
<P>
 For students, the recruiting blizzard can be so daunting that Hope College of 
Michigan has a gimmick to make its mail stand out -- literally. It uses 
oversized literature calculated to stick out of mailboxes. Ohio's Ashland 
University sends six-inch cookies from its school kitchens to 20,000 prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for such razzmatazz is simple: After feasting on World War II GIs 
and their baby boom progeny, colleges saw their primary market of 18-year-old 
high school graduates shrink from 3.2 million in 1979 to 2.4 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications were more foreboding for private schools, which statistics 
show depend on tuition for nearly 60% of their income compared to 21% for 
public institutions. But with legislatures cutting back on subsidies, all 
schools have found themselves competing for customers, not unlike companies 
peddling rival brands of shampoo, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colleges live and die by their admissions offices," said Jennifer Britz, 
editor of the Lawlor Review, a new publication that caters to university 
marketeers. 
</P>
<P>
 And those admissions offices have turned to what the Review dubs 
"techno-recruiting," the use of turbocharged computer programs and technology 
to track potential clients. Using categories such as race, family income, 
religious preference and the proclivity to move away from home, schools can 
order customized mailing lists from the millions of students who take tests 
administered by the College Board in New York and American College Testing in 
Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 colleges also buy the College Board's "enrollment planning" computer 
program, which is capable of breaking down students who take the SAT into 304 
"geomarkets," classifying them by 23 academic interests and identifying a 
school's most likely institutional competitors for a student. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a cottage industry of private consultants helps schools shape 
marketing strategy, remake their brochures -- even analyze potential applicants 
by "psychodemographics," whether families in their ZIP code are more likely to 
own station wagons or Land Rovers, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, admissions officials have ordered the names of 300,000 high school 
juniors for this year's mailing and they will field inquiries with a new 
toll-free telephone system, which automatically responds by mail within 24 
hours to any student who answers a series of electronic prompts. 
</P>
<P>
 And the marketing is not likely to stop. Although demographics show a new 
tidal wave of high school graduates will swamp the market soon, experts say 
admissions officers must work harder to persuade students and their parents to 
pay $100,000 or more for a degree at some private schools. They also say that 
the new techniques have ignited an arms race between schools scouring the 
country for the brightest students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recruitment of students has become one of the most competitive marketing 
climates in the country," said Ernest Boyer, former U.S. commissioner of 
education and president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching. "Without question, it's more intense than it's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the competition more intense than for top-notch minority scholars, 
who are attracting the kind of traffic once reserved for star athletes. 
Admissions officers say they are under great pressure to enroll more African 
Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos to diversify their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool of minority scholars is comparatively small. Only 1,691, or 2%, of 
black students nationwide scored at least 600 out of a possible 800 on the 
verbal skills portion of the 1993 SAT test, as well as 8,646 or 11% of Asian 
Americans and 2,292 or 3% of Latinos. That compares to 58,802 or 9% of white 
students. A 600 on both verbal and math are considered minimum scores for 
entrance into the country's top colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 That leads to ethnic-rich Southern California, where out-of-state schools have 
opened 15 new regional admissions offices in recent years. The reason: 
California's secondary school population, which will soon graduate more 
minorities than whites, will balloon 81% by 2009. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of colleges see California as a gold mine," said Edward Hu, Brown 
University's associate director of admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 One prize catch is John Lindo, who sports a 3.6 grade-point average as a 
senior at private Loyola High School in Los Angeles. More than 100 schools have 
sent him brochures and unsolicited applications. The University of Illinois has 
called repeatedly. Lehigh University in Pennsylvania sends monthly newsletters. 
And the University of Missouri at Rolla just cannot take the hint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after I declared I wasn't interest in attending that school, I still 
received mail from them, apparently hoping I would change my mind," said Lindo, 
an African American who hopes to double major in electrical engineering and 
instrumental music. 
</P>
<P>
 The scrambling is so fierce that schools are routinely offering minority 
scholars expense-paid trips to their campuses. They will be paired with student 
guides and will sit in on classes and be encouraged to soak up the ambience of 
dormitory life. Admissions officers say such campus trips are crucial because 
students are more likely to enroll in a school they have visited. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Ivy League has been forced to match these offers. Dartmouth College 
recently began paying for minority recruiting visits and rival Brown pays for 
several train cars of minority standouts from the Northeast to take an Amtrak 
caravan to its Rhode Island campus each year. One Midwestern college reportedly 
tried to impress a minority prospect by sending a limousine to transport her to 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The most desperate competition involves financial aid. College officials say 
they are in an escalating, hard-dollars bidding war for minority students, who 
often come from families who are unable to pay steep tuition. As a response, 
many schools offer merit scholarships or "preferred packages" of grants, loans 
and work-study jobs to minority standouts. Some schools are performing 
financial aid "leveraging" studies that show how to attract the greatest number 
of students for the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these tough economic times . . . there is so much consumerism among 
parents and kids that they are . . . shopping packages around," said Hu, adding 
that more students are paying acceptance deposits to competing schools to see 
which one will come up with the most money. "From our end, it's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard University officials were shocked in 1992 when only 55% of the 
eligible African Americans students decided to enroll, compared to its normal 
75%. A spokeswoman blamed competing scholarships from other schools, adding 
that acceptances were back to 67% last year after Harvard redoubled minority 
recruiting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at DePauw University in Indiana grumble about a top African American 
prospect who was snatched away by a rival institution that offered a $17,000 
scholarship -- although his father made more than $400,000 year. And at Pomona 
College in Claremont, dean of admissions Bruce Poch is still smarting over one 
recruit who switched after a Southeast school went directly to his parent with 
an offer of free tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Such overheated recruiting has a downside for some students who get to college 
only to find the work harder and the pace faster than they expected. "It is not 
enough to recruit minorities and leave them to founder in a hostile college 
environment," said Reginald Wilson, one of the report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution, university officials say, is to reach below the ranks of high 
school seniors to "grow" promising minority students and get them used to the 
idea of attending college because some may be the first in their family with 
the opportunity. Admissions officers work with community-based programs such as 
the Young Black Scholars, a Los Angeles-based program established to nurture 
African American scholarship, or they will sponsor their own summer institutes 
for minorities or other gifted students of all races. 
</P>
<P>
 Britz said such outreach programs are "sincere, genuine commitments to make 
schools more diverse." Yet recruiters also concede that these "seed-planting" 
activities pay indirect bonuses, allowing them to cultivate an emotional 
loyalty with younger students who are otherwise on campus to learn the finer 
points of debate or high school study habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good recruiting tactic," said Ken Woods, Southern California regional 
admissions director for the University of Denver, which sponsors two summer 
institutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Face it, you're dealing with a 14-, 15-, 16-year-old who is starting to call 
a faculty member, rather than Dr. Rosen, it is 'Hey, Al. Let's talk physics.' " 
Woods said. "They get to know professors on a first-name basis. It's a great 
soft sell (and) we're getting a database of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the pitch to younger students has become so important, said Mt. St. 
Mary's admissions director Katy Murphy, that the Brentwood Catholic women's 
school has decided to mail 10,000 letters of introduction to high school 
sophomores next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that schools are increasingly pushing exceptionally advanced 
younger students to sign up under early admissions programs, which allow them 
to bypass their senior year in high school and go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who are typically eligible for such jump-starts have raced far ahead 
of their peers, plowing through their high school requirements and piling up 
college credits at community colleges. But emotional maturity does not keep 
pace in many cases, college administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, president of the national association representing collegiate 
admissions officers, said members of his group have expressed a lot of concern 
about this growing trend. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the phenomenon is being spurred in part by the fact that a number of 
states -- including Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Utah -- allow fast 
learners to take a college course and earn both college credit and credit 
toward their high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 While UCLA snatched up Lakewood High's Craddock, UCLA admissions director Rae 
Lee Siporin said such cases are rare and that she enrolls fewer than six early 
admissions students a year. "They find us, I'm not looking for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But cross-town rival USC aggressively recruits sophomores for its competitive 
Resident Honors Program, allowing them to skip their senior year in high 
school. Last summer, USC sent 24,000 letters to students who scored high on the 
Preliminary SAT test, offering them the opportunity to trade a room at home for 
one in a campus residence hall if they took the SAT early in their junior year 
and scored 1,250 or above. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, USC took 52 students into the program, including three Latinos but 
no blacks, a school spokesman said. University administrators say that they 
take great care in selecting only those students who are socially and 
emotionally ready, and that the number is not expected to grow by much. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when USC turns down students for the program, the early contact is 
considered a recruiting boon. "It's a way for us to get them early to let them 
know that USC cares about them," said Pennelope Von Helmolt, the program's 
associate director.

MEXICO'S PRI PICKS ECONOMIST ZEDILLO TO SUCCEED COLOSIO; POLITICS: FORMER 
CABINET MEMBER IS PRESIDENT SALINAS' CHOICE AS RULING PARTY'S NOMINEE. HE 
PLEDGES TO UPHOLD HIS SLAIN PREDECESSOR'S IDEALS BUT FACES DIVISIVENESS IN 
RANKS. 
</P>

<P>
 The political party that has ruled Mexico for 65 years on Tuesday named 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, a Yale-trained economist and member of President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's inner circle, to replace its slain presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, 42, automatically becomes the front-runner in the presidential 
election scheduled for Aug. 21. But he immediately faces the challenge of 
uniting a party split by a bitter power struggle. He also must overcome heated 
opposition from many of its militants who oppose him because he was handpicked 
by the president and has little political experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony before a select gathering at the national headquarters of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, Zedillo accepted the nomination and 
pledged to continue the ideals of the man he is replacing, Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's assassination last Wednesday in Tijuana shocked Mexico and immersed 
the party in crisis. Zedillo was Colosio's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept (the candidacy) absolutely aware that the best man to carry the PRI 
to victory and to carry Mexico to its aspirations was at every moment Luis 
Donaldo Colosio," Zedillo said. He swore loyally: "For Colosio! For PRI! For 
Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement and Zedillo's speech were broadcast on Mexican television 
from PRI's Salon de los Presidentes, where a large photograph of Colosio was 
prominently displayed. Zedillo mentioned Colosio's name 39 times in the 
20-minute speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, about 2,000 rank-and-file activists, mainly from the nearby state of 
Mexico, stood in the blazing midday sun waving PRI placards and chanting, "Come 
out, come out." Instead, a Zedillo spokesman promised them a chance to file 
through a multipurpose room in small groups to meet Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely regarded as a brilliant but cold technocrat with little political 
experience, Zedillo had served as education minister before becoming Colosio's 
campaign manager. Previously, as head of the now-defunct Planning and Budget 
Ministry, he feuded over spending policies with Finance Minister Pedro Aspe 
Armella. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Colosio, Zedillo is from a modest background. Born in Mexico City, he 
attended public schools, including the unpretentious National Polytechnical 
Institute, before doing postgraduate work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the exuberant, striking Colosio, his successor has a professorial 
manner accentuated by wire-rim glasses and close-cropped hair. Zedillo is often 
praised for his ability to express complex concepts clearly and simply. 
</P>
<P>
 His selection was welcomed in world banking and U.S. business circles because 
Zedillo is expected to continue Salinas' free-market economic policies, which 
have modernized the Mexican economy and catapulted it into the world's largest 
trading bloc, in partnership with the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo is well known in global financial circles because, as an official at 
the Bank of Mexico, he renegotiated the private sector's international loans in 
the wake of the 1982 debt crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican stock exchange, which had dropped 3% Monday and continued downward 
in early trading Tuesday, rebounded with the news that Zedillo was named. It 
closed slightly higher, despite the drop in international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But within his own party, Zedillo may have trouble. Hard-line PRI 
traditionalists, who have felt their power erode under Salinas, had fought 
Zedillo's appointment because he is viewed as a Salinas protege. And some of 
the pro-democracy reformists also opposed Zedillo because they fear that he, 
like Salinas, will give priority to the economy at the expense of political 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The manner in which Zedillo was chosen -- by the dedazo, or the pointing of 
the big finger by Salinas, exercising the privilege that outgoing PRI 
presidents have claimed since the party's founding -- was a triumph for his 
mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salinas won the power struggle and was able to impose his candidate," said 
political analyst Denise Dresser. "But the hard-liners have not given up. The 
struggle within the party is not over." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only the hard-liners were disappointed. Reform-minded activists also 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disgruntled, not because of Zedillo himself, but because we are 
worried that a candidate selected this way cannot count on the support of the 
entire party," said Ramiro de la Rosa, political action secretary of Democracia 
2000, a movement of mainly young party activists bent on reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "A divided party will oblige us to commit massive fraud on Aug. 21 in order to 
stay in power," he warned, one of the few dissenting voices at the PRI 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The question on everyone's mind is whether Zedillo has the political savvy to 
unite the diverse and disgruntled in the PRI and to guide the party from its 
worst crisis ever to victory in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "Concretely, he must propose opening up his campaign team," said economist 
Rogelio Ramirez de la O. "He must extend a friendly hand to all the groups that 
have been in the conflict and . . . maintain a less belligerent dialogue with 
the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of the election may also help reimpose the PRI's renowned party 
discipline, Dresser said. Hard-liners, as well as other members of the PRI, 
know they must win the elections to survive, so they are likely to put their 
internal battles on hold until after August, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI discipline was much in evidence Tuesday as busloads of rank-and-file 
loyalists descended on party headquarters, carrying signs some hastily drawn 
with felt-tip pens and misspelling the candidate's name as "Cedillo." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to show our support," said Yolanda Aquino, 45, from the northern 
industrial suburb of Ecatepec. Asked why she supported Zedillo, she answered, 
"I really could not answer that." 
</P>
<P>
 But other party activists, who knew only that Zedillo had been Colosio's 
campaign manager, were quite clear about their reasons for supporting the new 
candidate. "Colosio was our hope," said one woman, who was swept away by the 
crowd before she could identify herself. "Our best revenge for his death is to 
win the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo was sympathetic to such feelings in his speech. "I assume this 
responsibility with the encouragement of knowing that the Priistas (PRI 
faithful) are not starting a campaign; we are continuing it," he said, adding 
later, "We are continuing the work begun by Luis Donaldo Colosio." 
</P>
<P>
 But a telephone survey released Tuesday by the demographic magazine Este Pais 
found that nearly a third of the 349 people polled believe that the PRI is 
behind Colosio's death and 70% expect a government cover-up of the murder. The 
survey has about a 4.4% margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about why Zedillo was not with Colosio in Tijuana have caused such 
speculation that the party felt compelled to explain in a news release that the 
campaign manager does not normally accompany the candidate at all of rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dresser said: "There will be a lot of sympathy vote. They can ride on 
Colosio's wave. PRI is virtually assured of a victory now because it has a 
martyr." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Zedillo accepted the nomination, there were signs the healing 
process had begun. Party Chairman Fernando Ortiz Arana, who had been Zedillo's 
principal rival for the candidacy, said early Tuesday that he was withdrawing 
from consideration in the interest of party unity. 
</P>
<P>
 That action was much more like the traditional PRI than the months of open 
bickering between Colosio and rival Manuel Camacho Solis or the six days that 
followed the assassination, when different factions openly supported various 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any conduct motivated by personal ambitions can provoke divisions in the 
heart of our party," Ortiz Arana said. "Any dissipation of PRI forces implies a 
serious risk for the (party's) union and stability. Especially in these times, 
it is absolutely necessary to maintain ourselves closely united." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the sort of attitude that the new candidate asked for a few hours 
later. "We must take from the tragedy a lesson in unity," Zedillo said, "in the 
strength in diversity, the nobility of the contest, brotherly respect and 
political civility." 
</P>

GAZA RAGE BOILS OVER AFTER PLO ACTIVISTS' DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid cries of "Blood for blood!" and "No peace after today!" the occupied 
territories exploded in violent protests Tuesday, the day after Israeli 
security forces in the Gaza Strip killed six supporters of PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest displays of rage further imperiled the Middle East peace process, 
already plunged into crisis by last month's massacre of about 30 praying 
Palestinians in a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, as Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank, wounding more than 75 and killing one, Palestine Liberation 
Organization leaders in Gaza City and the West Bank called for a suspension and 
"comprehensive re-evaluation" of the entire peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's violence also left four Israeli soldiers and three civilians 
wounded, among them a 70-year-old construction worker who was in critical 
condition after he was attacked with axes by two Palestinian laborers from Gaza 
in a town near Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO and Israeli officials met in Cairo on Tuesday, even as Arafat -- who 
denounced the Gaza killings as one "in a line of massacres that the Israeli 
army took part in" -- called an emergency meeting of his organization in Tunis, 
Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, officials said that the Palestinians killed late Monday night -- 
contrary to some earlier reports of the incident -- were not on any "most 
wanted" lists and that they had not fired at Israeli troops before they were 
shot. PLO officials in the occupied territories said local Israeli officials 
had apologized to them for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the closed Cairo sessions with the Israelis, PLO leaders stressed that 
they were not negotiations, or even discussions or meetings. The PLO said its 
representatives saw the Israelis in "a simple act of receiving answers" to 
Palestinian demands on a security agreement for Hebron and on questions arising 
from Monday night's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides thus failed to reach a predicted breakthrough Tuesday to restart 
formal talks on implementing the long-delayed Sept. 13 agreement for limited 
Palestinian autonomy, beginning in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 In his angry public reaction to the killings, Arafat, in an interview aired on 
Israeli television, demanded that Israel explain whether Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin was aware of his military's plans to slay his PLO supporters. He blamed 
their deaths on "a secret organization from within the Israeli army. . . . The 
crime is deliberate, the timing is deliberate and the aim is to sabotage the 
peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a prime mover behind the peace talks, 
insisted that the troops "had no sinister intentions." He called the shootings 
"regrettable," stressing, "It was not done by intention." 
</P>
<P>
 But in and around Gaza's largest, most squalid refugee camp, as families of 
the six slain members of Arafat's Fatah faction mourned and buried their dead, 
angry local leaders called Monday night's shootings "cold-blooded murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Zakaria Agha, Arafat's handpicked future governor of Gaza, said he knew all 
six dead men. He said he had advised Arafat to retaliate by suspending all 
negotiations with Israel for now. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he urged the PLO -- whose support is at its nadir in the territories, 
especially in Gaza -- to demand deployment of an international military 
observer force in the Gaza Strip, besides the West Bank city of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Palestinians must insist on the immediate withdrawal of all 
Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, which the "Gaza-Jericho first" agreement 
signed in September stated would begin last Dec. 13 and be completed before 
April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Agha and half a dozen witnesses asserted in interviews that Monday night's 
killings included at least one summary execution of a Palestinian by an Israeli 
undercover officer. The Palestinian witnesses insisted that the men were gunned 
down without provocation as they handed out leaflets in the Jabaliya refugee 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a running dispute as to whether the men were armed and whether they 
wore masks and dressed in camouflage, as described in official accounts given 
by Israeli military sources. But even Israel's version made it clear that none 
of the six men fired on the undercover unit before they were killed -- some of 
them by being shot repeatedly at close range. 
</P>
<P>
 When the undercover Israeli unit attacked, the six men were distributing 
leaflets encouraging support for Arafat's Fatah and urging the many Palestinian 
political factions to unite, witnesses said. The leaflets were signed by 
Fatah's "secret military wing," the Fatah Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have insisted they are trying to preserve the peace process, 
Israeli authorities have said they will continue to fire on armed Palestinians; 
several Gazans speculated that the men were killed when the undercover unit 
mistook them for members of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, which 
opposes the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described in detail how Nahed Odeh, one of the slain activists, was 
chased by an undercover agent as he tried to flee the gunfire while wounded. 
"One of the undercover men grabbed him from inside the shop, pulled him out 
onto the stairs, put his foot on the back of his neck and fired four times into 
his head," said Nowfal Abu Eida, who lives next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Agha, the local PLO leader, insisted at a Gaza City news conference that the 
six men were not even Fatah Hawks. He said they were veteran activists in 
Fatah's political wing and had spent years in Israeli prisons before the 
Israeli-PLO accord was signed in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Arafat suspended formal negotiations to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement when Baruch Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born extremist 
settler, massacred about 30 Palestinian worshipers in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday night's killings, most PLO leaders in the territories concluded 
they have little hope for the future of the Israel-PLO accord. "Mr. Rabin is 
just moving massacres from one place to another," declared Saeb Erekat, a West 
Bank PLO leader who added that he believes "the peace process is coming to an 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, brokers of the overall Middle East peace process that began 
more than two years ago, were cautious about the effect of Monday's incident on 
the talks. "There's a race here against time -- between the violence on the 
ground (versus) the political negotiations," a senior U.S. official said. 
'There's no way of telling which will overtake the other at any given time. But 
it's U.S. policy to push forward as hard as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs in the occupied territories Tuesday that the violence was 
winning the race. Palestinians in more than half a dozen towns traded stones 
for bullets in the street violence that has become a staple of life here since 
the Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 In the impoverished Gaza Strip, seething with fury and vows of revenge, local 
PLO leader Agha predicted, "Every action has a reaction. . . . Surely, we will 
face difficult days ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Musa Abdul Nabi -- a cousin of slain activist Jamal Abdul Nabi, 37, who left 
behind a wife and seven children -- observed of the violence and protracted 
talks with Israel: "It gives me the feeling of helplessness. All of these men 
who were killed were well-known supporters of the peace process. . . . Now, we 
need protection from the world -- to protect us from the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
 At the wake for Odeh -- the 29-year-old father of two and gate guard at a Gaza 
university who allegedly was hunted and executed by the Israelis after he was 
wounded -- his younger brother was numb with grief. "It was a shock. I just 
feel shock," Zohair Mohammed Odeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why his brother was killed, Odeh shook his head and said, "The Israelis 
think, they're leaving, so just kill these guys. . . . They just want to kill. 
Killing is in their blood. Before, everybody supported the peace process. But 
not anymore. They killed my brother. They killed my people. They're killing 
everybody, so why support this process?"

STUDENTS' SLAYINGS ANOTHER HARSH BLOW TO L.A.'S IMAGE; TOURISM: AFTER RIOTS, 
FIRES AND THE QUAKE, MORE VISITORS FROM JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE EXPECTED 
TO SHY AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of economic woes, unrest and other calamities, January's powerful 
earthquake rocked the Los Angeles region's vital tourism industry just as it 
was poised for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hotels suffered damage. Phone inquiries from prospective visitors 
dropped, and tourists canceled room reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 By a twist of fate, the quake's impact was not immediately felt. Hotel rooms 
were filled with disaster workers and residents displaced by the Northridge 
temblor, raising occupancy rates in January and February above those for the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a predicted decline in hotel bookings took hold this month, and a strong 
aftershock rekindled visitor concerns about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need any more bad news," tourism consultant Bruce Baltin said. "We 
need good news for the tourism industry to recover economically." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of getting a boost, the region's second-biggest industry was dealt yet 
another damaging blow within days. Two college students from Japan were slain 
Friday during a carjacking, setting off an international furor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question . . . this is going to hurt," Baltin said this week. 
"There's no way to tell how much and how long." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese tourists are the largest single bloc of overseas visitors to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost one out of six foreign tourists comes from Japan. And with a powerful 
yen, the Japanese spend six times more than the average tourist from the United 
States, pumping at least $480 million a year into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 500,000 Japanese visitors who come each year are "an enormously valuable 
market," said Michael Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles 
Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said intense media coverage surrounding the tragic shooting of 
students Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, outside a San Pedro supermarket 
Friday night could keep many Japanese tourists away. "Could they drop 10%?" he 
said. "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, Japanese television viewers, like those elsewhere, have 
seen pictures of the 1992 riots, the 1993 fires and the 1994 earthquake, said 
Ken Kohno, Los Angeles bureau chief for NHK Japan Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the deaths of Ito and Matsuura struck deeply in Japan, where 
earthquakes are an ever-present danger but random violence is relatively rare 
and guns are strictly controlled. "All of this makes L.A. (seem) very dangerous 
and not a good place to go," Kohno said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Collins said, the crime should be viewed as "a ghastly exception" to the 
experience of typical Los Angeles visitors who are drawn to the city's many 
attractions, from Hollywood to Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 On the brick-lined streets of Little Tokyo, the deaths of the students have 
reinforced the concerns of some Japanese tourists about visiting Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Idehara Kazue, a college student from Osaka, said through a translator that 
she had seen "so many beautiful places" on her visit here, but that the 
shootings had heightened her concerns for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always say it is dangerous to walk alone on the street in Los Angeles, 
so that makes me worried," Kazue said as she and two friends stood outside an 
upscale gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the customers who buy expensive leather handbags, designer 
clothes and towels, perfume, T-shirts and American gear are Japanese tourists, 
said gift shop salesman Rajesh Raja. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our bread and butter," Raja said. "If this kind of incident takes 
place, more and more we will be affected, no doubt about it. The Japanese are 
very delicate people. . . . They are guests. If they don't feel safe, they will 
not come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had hoped that tourism dollars, by creating jobs and generating 
hotel and sales taxes, would help fuel the region's recovery from prolonged 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 After three tough years, the industry had been anticipating a better year. The 
newly expanded Downtown convention center was opening and the city seemed on 
the verge of a recovery in visitor traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the quake, we had strong evidence this was going to be a good year," 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 After images of death and destruction were broadcast worldwide, forecasts of a 
gradual improvement in visitor spending were replaced by more conservative 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the quake, Baltin, the tourism consultant, predicted that the 
temblor would cost Los Angeles County's $8.2-billion visitor industry $308 
million this year -- a 3% drop from earlier forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact isn't huge," he said, "but it's definitely there and will be felt 
probably through the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltin told the Convention and Visitors Bureau that he expects "the impact to 
be felt, beginning slightly in March, building through June and then tapering 
off through the summer and fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Although local visitor attractions and virtually all major hotels were back in 
business soon after the quake, impressions linger about the effects on the 
region. And the 5.3-magnitude aftershock March 20 put quake-rattled Los Angeles 
on the national news again. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltin estimates that lower-than-expected visitor spending could translate 
into 9,200 fewer tourist industry jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 employees of the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Universal City 
already know that firsthand. Housekeepers, restaurant workers, front desk 
assistants, valet parking attendants and others have been out of work without 
pay since the quake struck Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-story high-rise across the street from Universal Studios is one of two 
large hotels in the region that have yet to reopen after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheraton Universal General Manager David P. Cocks said engineers found no 
structural damage to the building but there was extensive cosmetic damage to 
virtually all guest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel officials decided to complete a previously planned remodeling of the 
hotel's 444 guest rooms at the same time that quake repairs are made, Cocks 
said. The hotel now plans to reopen May 1 in time to host visitors to this 
summer's World Cup soccer competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Jennifer Skurnik, staff director of the Hotel and Restaurant 
Employees Union, said it has been a very difficult time for Sheraton Universal 
workers forced into the ranks of the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will get through this period with a lot of hardship," Skurnik said. 
"They spent their savings." 
</P>
<P>
 The other major hotel to remain closed is the Radisson Valley Center Hotel 
near the intersection of the Ventura and San Diego Freeways in Sherman Oaks. 
City inspectors red-tagged the 13-story building as unsafe after assessing the 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're under repair," General Manager Wes Calverley said. "We're taking 
advantage of the downtime to completely remodel and renovate the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 employees have been laid off, but at least 20 workers have been 
placed in jobs at other hotels, he said. The hotel now is scheduled to reopen 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage and related problems with power and water supplies forced the 
temporary closure of a number of hotels from Woodland Hills to Santa Monica. 
The venerable Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles suffered some minor damage 
but remained open. 
</P>
<P>
 Major tourist attractions, including Universal Studios and the adjacent 
CityWalk restaurant and retail area, reopened quickly after the quake. One 
attraction, a ride that simulates the effects of a major earthquake, was closed 
for several weeks out of deference to the community, Universal Studios 
spokesman Jim Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal, the county's biggest tourist destination is proceeding with plans 
to open new attractions this spring and summer and is looking forward to big 
crowds. Attendance has slowly started to pick up, but "we are not where we 
would have been had there not been a quake," Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther removed from the epicenter, Disneyland remained in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said the theme park experienced a drop in 
attendance for a couple of weeks immediately after the quake but is "already 
beginning to see what we believe is a strong rebound." Disney officials are 
optimistic that the quake's impact will not carry through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major visitor facility still closed is the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum, which suffered extensive structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor created a temporary opportunity for hotels, particularly those 
closest to the most heavily damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The flood of insurance adjusters, Federal Emergency Management Agency 
personnel, other government employees, Red Cross representatives and residents 
forced from their homes pushed hotel occupancy in the San Fernando Valley to 
94% in February, compared with 54% a year earlier, Baltin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But guests who were driven to hotels by the quake spent less money on food, 
beverages and entertainment than tourists do, Baltin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles County, hotel occupancy was up 4 percentage points, to 
66.2%, in January and February compared with the same period last year. Several 
large conventions in February pushed occupancy rates at Downtown Los Angeles 
hotels to their highest level in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the quake, forecasts of a small increase in the county's hotel 
occupancy rate this year have been scaled back. Baltin, senior vice president 
of PKF Consulting, said he expects a rate of 62% -- about the same level as 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1987 and 1993, a building boom increased the number of hotel rooms in 
Los Angeles County by an average of 3.3% per year, about three times faster 
than the increase in the demand for rooms, Baltin said. The result has been a 
downward slide in the overall hotel occupancy rate. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract visitors, tourism officials have given travel writers and 
convention and meeting planners the message that Los Angeles is open for 
business, the freeway system is functioning and major tourist attractions are 
welcoming visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said he hopes the area will receive special federal assistance to pay 
for a short-term advertising campaign to influence tourists' summer travel 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism officials also are preparing a plan to pool the marketing efforts of 
Los Angeles and surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said a major advertising campaign would give the area a chance to show 
the world: "We are not selling damaged goods here."

 Hotel occupancy in Los Angeles County has been on a downward slide for seven 
years. A building boom increased the number of hotel rooms in Los Angeles 
County by an average of 3.3% a year from 1987 to 1993, while the number of 
occupied rooms grew by only 1% annually, causing a downward slide in the 
overall hotel occupancy rate.

U.S. PROPOSES CURBS ON BOGUS ASYLUM CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration proposed broad changes in the nation's refugee 
asylum system Tuesday to curb a growing number of bogus claims while speeding 
up approval of immigrants genuinely fleeing political, religious or ethnic 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's revisions, which drew immediate criticism from private 
refugee groups, would impose a filing fee on asylum seekers and would force 
many applicants to wait twice as long for temporary work permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also would at least double the number of immigration judges and 
asylum officers assigned to handle the exploding caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a balanced system that embodies both compassion and control," said 
Doris M. Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current system, many applicants who have no legitimate claim for 
asylum file claims so that they can obtain temporary work permits and remain in 
the country while their cases are reviewed -- a process that currently averages 
18 to 24 months. Those applying for asylum can obtain work authorization in 90 
days. That period would be expanded to as long as 180 days under the new 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Several private refugee groups protested that the proposed filing fee of $130 
and the recommended delay for work permits would unfairly penalize legitimate 
asylum-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who come here have to have some way to exist," said Father Richard 
Ryscavage, head of migration and refugee services for the U.S. Catholic 
Conference. "Having to wait up to 180 days for work will create a serious 
burden on the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is mushrooming, all agree. Asylum applications nearly tripled to 
150,386 last year from 56,000 in 1991 and the backlog of unprocessed cases has 
grown to more than 370,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem we have faced in recent years," Meissner said at a news 
conference, "is that people with no legitimate claim to asylum are applying in 
record numbers, some brought by smugglers, some using fake documents and some 
overstaying the visas granted to them as visitors." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that many applications for asylum contain virtually identical 
information and are purchased by applicants to obtain a work permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, those abusing the system have captured public attention and 
exacerbated a large application backlog that puts legitimate asylum-seekers at 
a severe disadvantage," she said. The proposed changes will be published this 
week in the Federal Register, with a final version expected by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new INS system, in the first year or so, would focus only on new 
applications. Clearly meritorious cases would be approved within 60 days while 
questionable applications would take up to six months. Work permits would be 
granted only after a case was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Asylum applicants would have to pay a $130 filing fee unless they showed that 
they could not afford it. Meissner said that each application costs an 
estimated $615 to process. "We believe it is only fair to apply some of the 
costs of asylum adjudication to the people who benefit from it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, however, said that obtaining a waiver for the filing fee could be 
difficult and could add to the backlog of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS is asking Congress for $64 million in fiscal 1995 to more than double 
the number of asylum officers, to 334 from 150. The parent Justice Department 
also is expected to double the number of immigration judges, to 170 from 85. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the immigration service will begin fingerprinting asylum 
applicants to eliminate duplicate applications in different U.S. cities under 
different names. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugee organizations critical of the new filing fee and the new waiting 
period for work permits include the Catholic Conference, the U.S. Committee for 
Refugees, the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. and the Open Society 
Institute. Asylum Leaders 
</P>
<P>
 The top 25 nationalities of asylum applicants make up 88% of the 150,386 
applications filed during fiscal year 1993. The leading nationalities: 
03,06,13,12 Rank Country Applicants 1. Guatemala 34,681 2. El Salvador 15,362

STATE ECONOMY IN RECOVERY, UCLA FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After California's dispiriting slide into the depths of recession, a 
long-awaited recovery has finally begun, according to a UCLA analysis to be 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of a slow recovery is the first by a prominent forecasting group 
that the state's deepest slump in six decades has ended and a fragile expansion 
is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the analysis may signal a broader shift in perceptions about 
California's economy in light of surprising recent data on jobs and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a revision to be made public Friday, the state Employment Development 
Department now estimates that California added payroll jobs in January and 
February -- the first consecutive two-month gain since mid-1990. Similarly, 
California shared in a national jump in consumer confidence in March, it was 
reported Tuesday, although the state level remains lower than the nation's. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you read this, California will be in recovery!" exclaimed 
economists Larry J. Kimbell and Tom K. Lieser in the new UCLA report, which 
cites earthquake rebuilding aid as a short-term catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
 There are limits to the enthusiasm, however: Job gains are expected to be 
frustratingly slow and uneven in the emerging recovery, and the aerospace 
squeeze will continue. Thousands more high-paying defense jobs will vanish in 
the next few years, often replaced by less lucrative jobs in service 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even a lukewarm upturn would be a striking shift from the four-year 
barrage of bleak economic news, a traumatic period in which the state lost 
between 600,000 and 800,000 jobs. For the first time since 1990, the UCLA 
analysis says, Californians have reason to anticipate an increase in jobs, 
incomes, retail sales and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 To make their case, economists at the UCLA Business Forecasting Project 
selected from a growing if tentative array of evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Payroll jobs rose 15,900 in February and 7,300 in January -- a month in 
which officials earlier had counted a decline, according to state Employment 
Development Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business failures in January, as gauged by Dun & Bradstreet, fell 23.3% in 
California compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sales of existing homes have been running about 20% higher than year-ago 
levels, a rally that could boost purchases of everything from curtains to 
carpets to kitchen cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've changed our thinking," said Adrian Sanchez, a regional economist at Los 
Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, which is revising its forecast in light 
of the improved economic news. "California is clearly close to a recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 The public mood is improving, albeit from very low levels, according to a 
survey released Tuesday by the privately funded Conference Board. The report 
found that consumer confidence in the Pacific region, largely reflecting 
California, jumped a healthy 6.8 points on the board's index, the same increase 
registered nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, economists have generally viewed the California economy as having 
hit bottom, almost like a sunken ship creeping along the ocean floor but too 
weak to climb back up. 
</P>
<P>
 A recovery, while a somewhat inexact term for a state economy, suggests steady 
lift in a range of economic gauges, particularly jobs. Some economists, such as 
the UCLA forecasters, had expected a slow ascent to begin in the second half of 
the year; other analysts had not anticipated a revival before year's end or 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, not everyone is persuaded that a bona fide upturn is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to drink a bottle of Dom Perignon just yet," said Joseph A. 
Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "Companies are 
still laying off people and going out of business. This is not a recovery in 
the real sense of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Key evidence will become available Friday, when March job totals are reported, 
showing whether the gains of January and February have been sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists also are monitoring the recent sharp rise in interest rates. Low 
rates have boosted the state and national economies by making houses, autos, 
factory equipment and other items cheaper to buy on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the UCLA forecast, the fledgling upturn will become more apparent 
in the coming months as personal income -- a broad measure that reflects 
re-employment, added working hours and more -- grows in the 5% range, a pace it 
may maintain for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales also are expected to improve this year. The state's jobless rate, 
which has been hovering in the 9% to 10% range, should decline gradually to 
7.6% by 1996, the UCLA researchers estimate, with more than nine out of 10 new 
jobs in construction, trade and services. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp rise in home building also will help the economy, analysts said. The 
state's battered home building industry appears to have hit bottom last June, 
when new homes were started at an annual rate of about 80,000. By December and 
January, the pace had edged up to 90,000 -- still a far cry from the booming 
rate of a quarter-million in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anecdotal evidence we're getting from the builders suggests there's quite 
a bit in the pipeline," said Ted Gibson, principal economist at the state 
Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Such areas as tourism, recreation and international trade will be among the 
sources of rising employment, the UCLA report said. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate is expected to exceed the nation's through the late 
1990s, however. In the next couple of years, more unemployed people will leave 
the state, drop out of the labor force and settle for jobs that pay less than 
their previous ones, the UCLA economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, the Jan. 17 earthquake may help revive the regional economy, 
adding 20,000 jobs in the next year, according to the UCLA analysis. It might 
also accelerate a drop in the unemployment rate, partly through new jobs and 
partly through the more painful measure of people moving away. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer term, the study said, the quake's effect on Southern California's 
economy will be very small but negative, as some businesses choose to stay out 
of the region, cutting job growth by about 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis is not the first time that UCLA's forecasters have stood apart 
from the pack. A series of gloomy forecasts during the recession by Kimbell's 
predecessor, David Hensley, upset many in the state's business Establishment, 
although the dramatic forecasts proved on target. California Unemployment Rate 
</P>
<P>
 California's unemployment rate has risen steadily from the 5% range before the 
recession began in mid-1990 to levels of more than 9%. February '94: 9.0% NOTE: 
The 1994 monthly figures are not technically comparable to earlier months, 
because of changes in methodology.

THE CLASS WITH A BEAT -- POLICE BEAT THAT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL MECHANIC, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The course syllabus reads like a police academy brochure. Instructors are 
moonlighting FBI agents, police chiefs, district attorneys, cops and 
detectives. Lectures include "Bombs and Guns," "Rape Prevention" and "Federal 
Crime Reporting." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in this unusual course at UC Berkeley get self-defense training and 
licenses to carry Mace. For homework, each of the 28 students must patrol the 
campus in four-hour shifts in an effort to deter crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Donning bright yellow jackets emblazoned with a logo, they peek into nooks and 
crannies with flashlights and report suspicious activities to campus police 
using the cellular phones strapped to their belts. 
</P>
<P>
 The course, "Crime and Safety on the Berkeley Campus," was first offered last 
spring through a program called Democratic Education at Cal. Students who pass 
get three units toward graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This class is more about knowing what's going on in your neighborhood, while 
other classes are more long-term and have less to do with your everyday life," 
said junior Michael Caravantes, a biochemistry major who is considering a 
career in police forensics. 
</P>
<P>
 The class allows students to bring their safety concerns directly to the top. 
In a recent class, students grilled UC Police Chief Victoria Harrison and Vice 
Chancellor Russell Ellis about lighting on campus and the scaling back of a 
service that provides escorts for people who walk on campus at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students are considering careers in law enforcement, but the class is 
hardly a recruiting tool. Senior Susan Vasquez has no plans to wear a blue 
uniform but wanted to get Mace training and learn self-defense for her own 
safety. Sophomore Kris Withrow, who once envisioned a career in the 
intelligence field, said the class has soured him on law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "You basically have to be a pure person all your life," he said, referring to 
the strict screening process for prospective law enforcement agents. 
"Technically, if you smoke (marijuana) once in your life, you don't pass. 
That's bull. I mean, I lived in Mendocino County for three years!" 
</P>
<P>
 The class evolved from CalWatch, a program that uses student volunteers to 
patrol the central campus at night. The volunteers were meant to be a presence 
on campus, checking to make sure buildings were secure and reporting light 
outages, unlocked doors and windows, and crimes in progress. They were 
instructed to be non-confrontational and let police deal with suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Michael Shipman, head of the UC police crime prevention unit, said he 
gets inquiries every month from other universities interested in setting up 
student patrols. But without the offer of pay or academic credit, student 
volunteers are hard to get. 
</P>
<P>
 CalWatch was launched in spring, 1992, with $5,000 in seed money -- but by 
fall the original 12 volunteers had dwindled to four. By building a course 
around the patrols and offering academic credit, coordinators have had no 
problem reaching their goal of 25 to 30 students each semester. 
</P>
<P>
 A few say they are in it just for the units, but most students say they take 
their nighttime duties seriously. As one noted: "Berkeley is not too safe these 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the course, students must complete three shifts for a total of 12 
hours on patrol. Some find the patrols a bit scary. "We did not turn our 
flashlights off the whole time," one freshman woman said, "because there were 
two of us, both 5-3, and a lot of dark bushes where someone could jump out." 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime on campus decreased after the late 1980s, but is on the rise. 
According to UC police statistics, 55 violent crimes were reported on and 
around campus last year, up from 32 in 1992. Many students, women in 
particular, fear walking alone on campus at night. 
</P>
<P>
 To really deter crime, some class members said, CalWatch would need more 
volunteers than the class provides. "Before this class, I had never seen any 
CalWatch volunteers," Vasquez said. "I had never even heard of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Adrian Chin, who is considering policing as a career, said the campus 
should be patrolled by police. "I think any kind of official presence helps," 
he said, "but we really can't do anything if something happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Only two UC police officers routinely patrol the 177-acre central campus at 
night, when there is little foot traffic. The department focuses most of its 
efforts on the streets south of campus. But the semi-deserted campus can make 
lone students and faculty feel vulnerable to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for the night escort service on campus has more than doubled during the 
past few years, Harrison told the class. Dr. Christina Maslach, vice chairwoman 
of the psychology department and a sponsor of the class, said the student 
patrols can contribute to campus life by quelling student fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people think it's dangerous, they won't go out," she said. "A lot of study 
groups, review sessions, concerts and lectures take place in the evening. If 
people choose not to partake in these things, it could be detrimental to their 
education."

ON CALIFORNIA: MINUTES THAT SEEM LIKE HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Malibu City Council convened Monday at 6:30 p.m. sharp. It adjourned, less 
sharply, at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. There had been no close votes, no unexpected 
decisions, just plenty of discussion. The five council members and their 
audience had wrangled over bicycle lanes, public cable, residential setbacks, 
disaster escape routes, indemnity clauses and assorted other municipal issues 
arising from the vagaries of nature and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone was often contentious. Citizens wrangled with council members. 
Council members wrangled with council members. And everyone wrangled with the 
staff members, who munched secretly on pretzels to maintain energy. 
</P>
<P>
 As I write this now on the morning after, benumbed, I have trouble recalling 
just what theme had drawn me to this marathon of democracy. It had something to 
do with Malibu's emergence as a symbol of Southern California's run of 
disasters, and also with a curiosity over how a new government was holding up 
through its test of floods, wildfires, earthquakes and mudslides. Only three 
years ago, Malibu arose and shook itself free of the shackles of county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today," one council member had said early in the meeting, "is the three-year 
anniversary of Malibu cityhood." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiled and waited for applause. It never came. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council met, as it always does, at the Hughes research facility on Malibu 
Canyon Road. The near capacity audience of about 150 Malibuites was like a 
Dodger crowd: It arrived late and left in the middle innings. Many seats still 
were empty when an older fellow with a ruddy face moved to the podium and wove 
together a complaint about NAFTA, prison construction, J. Edgar Hoover, 
homelessness, corporate greed, genocide, education funding, Sherman Block and 
what, it appeared, had been his eviction from a hobo encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What an idiot," someone in the back hissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go again," sighed another voice. 
</P>
<P>
 And so they went, through discussions of the dangers of offshore bacteria, the 
progress of state "superscooper" legislation, the need for a $50,000 study of 
bicycle traffic flows on Pacific Coast Highway. In this last matter, cyclists 
who told gruesome stories of death and maiming on the highway shoulder were 
challenged, however, by an elderly resident. Sounding a lot like Ross Perot, 
she held aloft a copy of "Government Racket: Waste From A to Z," and quoted 
from a chapter entitled "Pork." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually -- a useful word when narrating a Malibu city meeting -- the 
council moved to the most volatile issue of the agenda. It dealt with 
negotiations between the city and residents who lost homes in the last fire. 
Before granting permits to rebuild, the city wanted written promises that 
homeowners would not sue in the event of mudslides. "Call me simple-minded," 
one resident complained, "but I still don't understand what a fire has to do 
with geology." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, things got rough. The next speaker asked for a show of hands from the 
audience of those who lost homes in the fire. Hands went up everywhere. He 
asked how many of the victims felt "the city was insensitive to our needs." The 
hands stayed up. "I see a smirk," he said, staring down a staff member. The 
council members studied their paperwork, heads down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, most of the burnouts -- as they call themselves -- went away more 
or less satisfied, and the agenda rolled forward, to discussions of mudslide 
remedies, and land use variances, and changes in the Brown Act, and approval of 
a new city insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking this one right to the wire," said Councilman John Harlow, noting 
that the old policy expired Tuesday, March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said a colleague, looking at the clock. "We already crossed the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 So they did. By now, the audience had dwindled to three -- two reporters and a 
man who appeared to be a consultant for a building project. "Sometimes," he 
said, "when you want to talk to someone, you have to wait a long time." He 
seemed cheerful enough; only later would it occur to ask whether he was billing 
his client by the hour. Who could be expected to think that fast at 1:30 a.m., 
after seven hours of Malibu city business? 
</P>
<P>
 As the meeting wound down -- the mayor yawning, the secretary slumped in her 
chair, eyes closed -- I made a note to myself. Any community that has survived 
as much as Malibu, I reasoned, most likely can survive as well the birthing of 
a city government. Now, though, in the morning light, I'm not so sure I want to 
be held to the notion. I could report, in closing these unofficial and greatly 
expurgated minutes, that as its last piece of business the council discussed, 
at some length, how to shorten its meetings. But who would believe it?

FINANCIAL WOES SURROUND JACKSON TV SPECIAL; CONCERT: CHARITIES WILL RECEIVE 
$100,000 OF THE ESTIMATED $4.5 MILLION RAISED EVEN THOUGH PRODUCTION WAS BILLED 
AS A BENEFIT. PRODUCER SAYS CAST AND CREW ARE STILL OWED ABOUT $2 MILLION, AND 
MONEY FROM TICKET SALES HAS BEEN TIED UP.

<P>
 The "Jackson Family Honors" NBC-TV show was brutally panned by critics when it 
aired Feb. 22, but the mishaps on camera were nothing compared to the financial 
imbroglio unfolding behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks after the show was taped at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas, the 
producer says the cast and crew of the 200-member production are still owed 
about $2 million -- with little evidence of money to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, only $100,000 of the estimated $4.5 million raised from the 
musical benefit will ever reach charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry and I'm embarrassed," said Gary Smith, the Emmy-winning executive 
producer of the telecast, who said he has received only partial payment on his 
$400,000 producer fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jacksons refuse to pay the money they owe me, and as a result I'm unable 
to compensate the people I hired to work on the show. The most frustrating part 
is how arrogant they act about it. In fact, Jermaine (Jackson) has never even 
called me since the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The financial problems stem in part from the fallout of sexual molestation 
allegations made against Michael Jackson last summer by a 13-year-old boy. A 
series of complications resulted, including the loss of corporate sponsorships, 
debts incurred by postponing and moving the event to Las Vegas, and slow ticket 
sales. Since the event, financial disputes over possible ticket refunds have 
tied up concert proceeds, and revenues from foreign broadcast fees are still 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and others affiliated with the production also accuse members of the 
Jackson entourage of running up expenditures on security, wardrobe and 
limousines in the days leading up to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Various sources said the Jacksons spent at least four times more on room 
service than the $5,000 going to the Library of Congress' American Music 
Program -- one of several charities advertised as a beneficiary of the 
concert's net proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody here has heard a word from the Jacksons since the show," said Jill 
Bret, a public affairs officer at the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Jermaine Jackson, executive producer of the show and president of Jackson 
Communications Inc., said his family did not waste money from the charity 
event, but acknowledged that bills are still outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this negative stuff is just being cooked up to take away from the beauty 
of what took place," the 39-year-old performer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sick and tired of people picking on the Jacksons. This family did not 
spend hardly any money in Vegas. I didn't make one penny off this show and I 
mean, really, how much can clothing and limousines cost? I'm doing the best I 
possibly can. These people will get a check as soon as I get paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether the production crew gets paid, the charities -- who were 
promised the show's net proceeds -- will receive no more than $100,000 from 
Jackson Jubilee, a New Jersey-based nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica will receive about $50,000 
with another $50,000 to be divided between the Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center, the Library of Congress, the Friends of Conservation, the Red Cross and 
the Salvation Army, according to officials of the Studio City-based Permanent 
Charity Committee of the Entertainment Industry, which could receive as much as 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lure of it being Michael Jackson's first formal stage performance 
since halting his world concert tour, the "Jackson Family Honors" event raised 
only half the projected $2.2-million ticket gate -- even though the price of 
thousands of mid-level seats were slashed from $350 to $150 after 
representatives of the pop superstar threatened that he would not appear if the 
house was not full, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the discount failed to stimulate sales, sources said an estimated 3,500 
tickets were given to Jackson associates, MGM employees, casino patrons, Nellis 
Air Force base personnel, charity groups and youth organizations from Las Vegas 
to Los Angeles at the last minute to fill the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fallout, TicketMaster, which handled the sale of tickets for the event, 
has refused to turn over nearly $500,000 in proceeds after demands for refunds 
from customers who paid $350 for tickets only to find themselves seated next to 
people who paid $50 or nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM Grand hotel has frozen an additional $400,000 in box office proceeds 
after encountering similar ticket complaints and also to cover room service 
charges and labor costs associated with the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a show doesn't turn out exactly the way it's planned, everybody starts 
pointing fingers," said real estate attorney Robert Petrallia, chief executive 
officer of the Iselin, N.J.-based Jackson Communications. "As soon as we have a 
full accounting of where all the money is, we will pay those whom we owe." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the concerts aid the family cannot possibly take in enough 
money to pay off the $5.7 million accrued in bills. The production was deeply 
in the hole before a single performer set foot on stage at the MGM Grand Garden 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The special -- originally scheduled to be taped Dec. 11 in Atlantic City and 
broadcast Jan. 10 -- lost $2 million in corporate sponsorships and incurred $1 
million in debts because of the postponement after Michael Jackson went to 
Europe to reportedly treat a drug addiction that he said stemmed in part from 
the 13-year-old's allegations of sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson Communications secured $2.6 million from NBC for broadcast fees in the 
United States after moving the show to Las Vegas. But even if the Jacksons 
collect the $700,000 in outstanding foreign broadcast fees and recover the 
$900,000 frozen by MGM Grand and TicketMaster, the foundation will come up at 
least $1.7 million short. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear where the remaining $1.1 million from NBC went. Sources 
speculated that Jackson Communications -- which collected a $300,000 fee -- 
spent the money on advertising, security, travel arrangements, plus legal and 
accounting fees and other costs associated with the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insiders associated with the production have also begun to question the 
legitimacy of the Jackson nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jacksons advertised this concert as a charity benefit, but all they 
really ended up doing was throw themselves a big lavish party," said another 
executive close to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Petrallia -- who 
organized the event with Jermaine Jackson and his parents -- was the target of 
a 1978 securities fraud investigation and pleaded guilty in 1982 to a tax 
misdemeanor after being indicted for conspiracy and mail fraud by a New Jersey 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrallia said the Jackson Jubilee was incorporated under New Jersey law Nov. 
8, 1993, and that applications were filed for nonprofit status soon after. The 
Internal Revenue Service, the New Jersey Charities Registration Office and the 
California Registry of Charitable Trusts have no record of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am offended that anyone would try to turn all the work I've done for Mrs. 
Jackson and the Jackson family into something seedy and improper," Petrallia 
said. "These allegations are absolutely erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
 Jermaine Jackson agreed. "This organization was set up solely to help people," 
he said. "We have integrity. We're going to make good on our promises."

POLICE UNION ADDS SUPPORT TO GARAMENDI; POLITICS: OFFICIALS ALSO DONATE $50,000 
TO CAMPAIGN. BACKERS OF RIVAL KATHLEEN BROWN SAY THEY'RE NOT WORRIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, the state's largest and 
oldest police union, announced Tuesday that it has endorsed Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi in the June 7 Democratic gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said they chose Garamendi over state Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
for substantive and stylistic reasons. Skip Murphy, the group's president, said 
Garamendi's support of the death penalty and his interest in community 
policing, boot camps and other crime prevention measures accounted for much of 
his appeal. But the union's board members were also impressed, he said, by 
Garamendi's straight-talking manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Garamendi is very relaxed. He immediately built a comfort zone with the 
members. He was talking to and with us, not talking down or making a platform," 
Murphy said. "Kathleen Brown just kind of made the blanket statements that 
potentially we wanted to hear. That was the way it was felt -- that she was 
making the pitch to us, telling us what she thought we wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, which Murphy said will also mean a $50,000 contribution to 
Garamendi's campaign, is the latest of several endorsement successes for the 
underdog candidate. Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina endorsed 
Garamendi last week, just days after Garamendi succeeded in denying Brown her 
expected endorsement by the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Reese, a spokesman for the Brown campaign, downplayed the importance 
of the union's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It matters when you're 22 points back and don't have any money, I suppose," 
he said, referring to Garamendi's lagging numbers in polls and fund raising. "I 
sure would not be dancing in the streets when I only had 58,000 bucks and I was 
22 points back. I mean, get real." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Reese noted that Brown has won many more endorsements than Garamendi 
-- most recently, from the United Auto Workers, the International Brotherhood 
of Electrical Workers and the California State Employees Assn. So far, the 
campaign has received no endorsements from law enforcement groups, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we will," he said. "Garamendi has gone after the IBEW and worked as hard 
as he could work -- and we got it. He worked hard to get CSEA. And we got it -- 
the first time in 63 years they'd endorsed in a primary. . . . He's got some, 
we've got a lot more. And we're going to get even more before it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's ability to court law enforcement groups is complicated by her stand on 
capital punishment. Brown has said that she personally opposes the death 
penalty, but would enforce it if she were elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, whose group represents more than 38,000 rank-and-file police officers 
statewide, said that although the death penalty issue was "not the tiebreaker" 
that made the union go for Garamendi, it was an important factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it: With law enforcement officers who deal with the absolute 
bottom rung of society on many occasions, the death penalty to us is a really 
big issue," he said. "I don't think (Brown) has any choice but to enforce it. 
But what kind of judges would she potentially appoint to the Supreme Court? 
Would they be those who support her views or who support the views of the 
public?"

BILL'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE; FROM SEA WORLD AND SAN DIEGO ZOO TO DOWN-HOME 
EATERIES AND THE WORLD'S ONLY BIKER COMEDIAN, EVERYONE WANTS TIME WITH CLINTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If this presidential vacation were a movie it would be called "Inviting Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, wants President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, daughter 
Chelsea and even Chelsea's unidentified school friend to come calling for a 
little fun and conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 The barest rumor that the Clintons might be en route is enough to make usually 
unflappable institutions such as Sea World, which hosts 3 million visitors a 
year, snap to. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquatic theme park began readying for a possible visit after Sea World 
officials heard a media-fanned rumor that 14-year-old Chelsea wants to become a 
marine biologist. Shamu, the park's headlining killer whale, was put on alert 
for a possible VIP visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to give them a grand tour, behind the scenes, up close to Shamu, 
everything," Sea World spokeswoman Diane Oaks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Zoo, the city's most popular tourist attraction, is gathering 
zoo souvenirs and working with its Washington lobbyist in hopes of luring the 
Clintons to the zoo. A special glass sculpture of an eagle, with appropriate 
inscription, is being prepared for the President, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do visit the zoo, and if, perchance, a member of the First Family asks 
why the panda grotto is empty and forlorn, zoo officials will be pleased to 
explain that the Clinton Administration's secretary of the Interior is blocking 
the importation of two pandas from a Chinese zoo for a breeding and education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clintons are hungry, Arkansas House, a down-home barbecue joint in 
blue-collar La Mesa, stands prepared to serve pork ribs, rotisserie chicken, 
sweet potato pie, gumbo and more. This is friendly political turf. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a picture of the President and First Lady in the window. The special 
this week is the Clinton Dog, an all-beef frank smothered in chili, cole slaw 
and mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up eating them that way and I'm sure President Clinton did too," said 
owner and former Clinton-Gore volunteer Karen Huff, who once lived in Pine 
Bluff, Ark., and opened the 12-stool eatery four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff, who attended the President's inauguration, says she is suffered through 
lots of jokes from customers about the Clinton Dog, like the guy who said 
"Clinton Dog? That must mean it's not what it appears to be." Huff has been 
known to show such jokers the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday the Secret Service paid a visit, leading Huff to believe her 
invitation to her political idol has a chance of being accepted. One agent said 
they were acting as the President's food tasters. 
</P>
<P>
 If the President gets antsy while staying in Coronado and wants to slip out 
for a little late-night partying, a group of politically active motorcyclists 
has invited him to a fund-raiser at a honky-tonk in downtown San Diego called 
Checkers. If he brings his saxophone, he can play a lick or two with the Blonde 
Bruce Band. If not, he can listen to the humor of Wild Willy Parsons, billed as 
the world's only biker comedian. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a kick-butt, rock 'n' roll comedy party," said biker leader New 
York Myke in his official invitation to Clinton. "I'll be honest with you. I'm 
not your biggest fan -- might even be your loudest detractor. But you're our 
President. Come on down and bring Hillary. Just tell them at the door you know 
New York Myke." 
</P>
<P>
 The bikers would like to lay a little message on Clinton about the perfidy of 
helmet laws. They were buoyed when they saw pictures on television of Chelsea 
and her girlfriend riding their bicycles Monday -- without helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to think he feels helmets are a matter of choice," said biker 
Steven (Red) Barron, "and so he let Chelsea make her own decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous golfers -- including politicians and military brass -- have been 
inviting Clinton to hit the local links. One presidential aide said the 
would-be foursomes are claiming to be "friends of friends of friends" of the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, nothing has worked. None of the supplicants were included in Tuesday's 
golf outing at Coronado's North Island Naval Air Station course. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego-area politicians have been waiting at their phones hoping they might 
be summoned to a presidential audience, jog or snack. Some have not been 
content to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Councilman Juan Carlos Vargas on Monday morning stood in the street 
outside the seaside manse where the Clintons are staying and waved a sign 
reading: "President Clinton, We Need the NAFTA Train," a reference to a 
proposed $7-million trans-border train line. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton left in a limousine, he gave a thumb's up to Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 The gesture was enough to encourage Vargas to return Tuesday. Arriving at 5:30 
a.m., Vargas was ready with his sign when Clinton emerged for a jog at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Clinton provided a thumb's up and a soothing, "I know, I know." 
Vargas counted that as progress and vows to return Wednesday at daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want is two minutes," Vargas said. "I'll even jog with him in my suit." 
</P>

INJURED JOIN SERVICE FOR SOLDIERS KILLED IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Injured soldiers were rolled on gurneys or in wheelchairs into a memorial 
service Tuesday for 23 paratroopers killed in a military plane crash last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the sons of America, the very best our nation had to offer," said 
Maj. Gen. Mike Steele, commander of the 82nd Airborne Division. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,500 soldiers and civilians jammed a gymnasium and stood outside 
during the hourlong service. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 83 injured soldiers walked into the gym with bandaged hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened last Wednesday when two planes collided on their 
approach to Pope Air Force Base, which is adjacent to Ft. Bragg. One plane 
landed safely; the other, an F-16 fighter, crashed and burned, skidding into a 
staging area where paratroopers were preparing for a daylight jump. The crew of 
the fighter safely ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 During the service, farewell speeches were punctuated by babies' squeals and 
the muted "huh-rah" from paratroopers using the traditional grunt to signal 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Other soldiers' faces wrinkled as they struggled with emotions while the name 
of each of the 23 victims was called, and a buddy saluted that soldier's rifle, 
boots and helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 The casualty toll was the highest for the division in a single incident since 
the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regimental commanders of the soldiers who were killed praised their valor in 
trying to rescue others even after they sustained severe burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They truly have an unconditional love for their comrades," Lt. Col. Lloyd 
Austin said.

PROJECT WILL TRY TO LIGHT WAY TO REFORM; PRIVATE FIRM TO RUN THREE PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS IN MASSACHUSETTS. ACCENT IS ON EXPERIMENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The promise of a nationwide string of high-quality, moderately priced private 
schools that would light the way to education reform while turning a profit is 
on indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
 But architects of media entrepreneur Christopher Whittle's Edison Project 
still are betting they can deliver significantly improved schools and, 
eventually, make money at it. Three years after launching its plan to compete 
with public schools, Knoxville-based Whittle Communications is celebrating its 
first "partnership" with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Edison Project (named for the inventor who created the 
light bulb instead of merely improving the candle) was chosen to design and run 
three new public schools in Massachusetts. The state's new "charter" schools 
program will give Edison Project designers the opportunity to try the ideas 
they have been working on for more than a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison schools in Boston, Lowell and Worcester -- which the company 
expects to open in 1995 for elementary grades and operate in partnership with 
local political, education and civic leaders -- will feature rigorous 
academics, a longer instructional day, an extended school year, an emphasis on 
ethics and values and a big role for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be an emphasis on technology, including a promise by company 
officials to put a computer into every student's home. Faculties will include 
several beginning teachers who will work in teams led by an experienced 
colleague. Students will stay with the same teams of teachers for two or three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials expect initially to invest around $2 million per school on 
top of what the state will provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Benno C. Schmidt, who left the presidency of Yale University to lead the 
Edison Project venture, said project designers knitted together the best ideas 
from reform efforts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "No single element will strike you as something you've never heard or thought 
of before," Schmidt told a recent Senate subcommittee hearing. "Ours are 
schools whose essential features are being tried somewhere and, when you get 
right down to it, are pretty self-evident." 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts' choice of the Whittle group, along with 12 nonprofit 
organizations for other schools, reflects a growing willingness across the 
nation to experiment with alternatives to highly regulated public schools, 
including allowing private organizations to run them. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other states, including California, are experimenting with charter 
schools, which basically turn over funding and responsibility for a public 
school to a group that is freed of most state and local regulations in return 
for its promise of providing a good-quality alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the contracts to run the schools are for a period of a few years, 
during which the operators must show they are getting results. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter schools movement has gathered steam in the last two to three 
years, a compromise between those who want to provide tax-dollar vouchers to 
help parents pay for private schools and those who favor the status quo in 
overseeing public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, some reformers are calling for a larger role for private 
firms, based on their belief that entrepreneurs can cut through bureaucracy and 
get faster results. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning schools over to private operators has drawn its share of criticism. 
Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a vocal 
skeptic of the trend, said there is virtually no evidence private firms can do 
a better job with public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the timing is good for Whittle, whose problems in raising capital forced a 
hold on his original, highly publicized plan -- to build a state-of-the-art 
chain of profitable private schools with tuitions roughly equal to the 
per-pupil spending of local public campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials also have applied to operate five schools in Virginia and are 
aggressively seeking contracts with districts around the United States to run 
existing campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Their quest puts them into head-to-head competition with the pioneering 
Education Alternatives Inc., a Minnesota-based, for-profit firm that has been 
running public schools in Baltimore and Miami and is expanding into other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said private operators and charter schools are ideas whose time has 
come: "The country is ready for at least some of its public schools to be 
really different."

PRO-ISLAM PARTY STUNS TURKEY, WINS KEY VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cries of "Allahu Akbar!" -- God is great! -- greeted the news Tuesday that the 
pro-Islamic Welfare Party had captured the mayor's seat in Ankara, Turkey's 
capital, in one of a series of municipal election victories that have shaken 
the 70-year-old republic to its secular roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked Turks have been glued to television sets since Sunday's election, 
watching in disbelief as this nation's electoral system handed more than 
one-third of Turkey's provincial centers to the Islamists, including the 
biggest city and financial center, Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
 As the leftist vote collapsed, the Islamists did unexpectedly well among 
recent arrivals in big cities; they appear to have been fed up with a corrupt 
political Establishment that has failed to manage Turkey's inflation and 
mounting economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 80% of Turks did not vote for the Welfare Party, and many 
expressed great worry about the intrusion of religion in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamists, for example, challenge Turkey's membership in the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, its application to join the European Union and 
the very basis of the republic set up in 1923 by Kemal Ataturk along 
modernizing, Western, secular lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But more sage commentators are urging Turks and their Western allies not to 
panic or to think that this conservative, Sunni Muslim country will go down the 
Islamic revolutionary path chosen by its neighbors in Shiite Muslim Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 The election "is an earthquake shaking republican Turkey. But it should not be 
exaggerated. The Welfare did not present itself as a party advocating the 
introduction of Islamic Sharia law," wrote Gungor Mengi, chief commentator of 
the newspaper Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also noted that Turkish mayors are not as powerful as many are in the 
United States. They have no control, for example, over education, police or 
liquor licensing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bigger picture, the polls have strengthened Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller's position, showing that her conservative True Path Party is Turkey's 
biggest, with 22% voter support. Turkey's first female prime minister and her 
9-month-old coalition government with the Social Democrats can probably now 
continue in power until the next parliamentary elections in 1996.

COLLABORATOR TESTIFIES ON KILLINGS OF 7 JEWS; WORLD WAR II: THE FIRST FRENCHMAN 
TRIED FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY INSISTS HE 'TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER SOLUTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier, his voice barely a whisper at times, testified 
in his defense Tuesday, giving a detailed account of the decision to execute 
seven Jews during World War II and portraying himself as a troubled functionary 
acting only under German orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right to the end, I tried to find another solution," said Touvier, 78, the 
first Frenchman ever brought to trial on charges of crimes against humanity. 
Shown photographs of the slain Jews, mouths and eyes wide open in death, 
Touvier sputtered, "These photos . . . it's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier, the former intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia, has 
been on trial for 10 days in a court in Versailles, where a jury of nine is 
deciding his fate. The maximum penalty under French law is life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, and the legal battle waged to bring Touvier to court after his 
arrest in 1989, has renewed a painful, 50-year-old debate in France over the 
Vichy government's collaboration with the German occupation during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier, who was hidden for 45 years by right-wing Catholic priests and monks, 
has admitted that he handpicked the men who executed the seven Jews in 
Rillieux-la-Pape, near Lyons, on June 29, 1944. The executions were in reprisal 
for the assassination by Resistance fighters of the Vichy regime's propaganda 
chief, Philippe Henriot, after the D-Day landing. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier testimony, Touvier had claimed memory lapses. But Tuesday, he said 
he wanted to give a full account of the events leading up to the executions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had just returned to Lyons from Vichy on June 28, 1944, when his 
French superior, Victor de Bourmont, told him of Henriot's death and of the 
decision by Lyons Gestapo chief Werner Knab to respond with "a spectacular 
execution of 100 Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 "De Bourmont was panic-stricken, and I was panic-stricken too," Touvier 
testified, noting that an agreement then was struck, cutting the number of Jews 
to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to reduce the number of victims from 30," he said. "I said we would 
do seven at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier said Knab became preoccupied with other matters and didn't notice the 
change in number. Touvier's aide, Albert Reynaud, chose the seven prisoners, he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not avoid the catastrophe," Touvier had testified earlier. "But I 
did, even so, save 23 human lives." That is the crux of Touvier's defense: that 
he was following German orders and that, by his actions, some lives were saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven refugees, ages 23 to 64, were lined up against the wall of a 
cemetery in Rillieux and shot one by one, first in the back, then in the head. 
"It had been decided. It had been done," Touvier said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the executions, "I spent a very bad night," he testified. And the next 
day, he said, he saw a Jesuit priest and confessed. "I never forgot this 
tragedy," he testified. "I said Mass. Mass for Jews is valid." 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier's fate rests in large part on whether the jury decides that the 
executions fall under the legal definition of a crime against humanity, which 
is a crime willingly carried out as a deliberate policy of genocide. And a key 
question is whether the Vichy regime had, on its own, a policy of genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Paxton, a historian at Columbia University in New York and author of 
two acclaimed books on France under the occupation, testified Monday that the 
Vichy government "adopted a policy of exclusion of the Jews from the economy 
and culture, for its own reasons and not to please the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton argued that in 1942, when the Vichy government turned Jewish refugees 
in unoccupied zones over to the Germans, "the French services became 
accomplices in the 'final solution.' "

SERBS, CROATS AGREE TO RENEW CEASE-FIRE; BALKANS: HAGGLING OVER KRAJINA REGION 
INDICATES OVERALL TRUCE IS FAR OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Serbian rebels and the Croatian government early today agreed to renew a 
flagging cease-fire to pull back troops and artillery in their suspended war 
for control of the contested Krajina region. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement came after nearly 18 hours of talks at the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb, the Associated Press reported. The haggling over what will be largely a 
symbolic first step toward reuniting ethnically divided Croatia indicated that 
an overall peace settlement remains far off. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire is to take effect at 9 a.m. local time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Russian diplomats mediating the talks between the Balkan war's 
original adversaries had pushed hard for the truce in hopes of adding to the 
momentum that has halted the shelling of Sarajevo and reunited Croats and 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two sides -- which have waged an on-again, off-again battle for the 
disputed Krajina region -- formally signed the truce, first proclaimed more 
than two years ago, both held fast to intransigent positions that virtually 
exclude a peaceful conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said that he will resort to a 
military offensive if the current U.S.-Russian diplomatic effort fails to 
restore his rule over Krajina. He contended he would have the support of the 
international community to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they fail to agree, Croatia, in accordance with the relevant (U.N.) 
Security Council resolutions concerning the integrity of its territory, could 
resort to other means, and in that case it would have on its side the rest of 
the world," Tudjman said of the Serbian rebels who have seized one-third of 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if by "other means" he was alluding to armed forces to recover Serb-held 
territory, Tudjman replied, "Ultimately, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 He also took pains to identify Croatia's 600,000 Serbs as a minority with 
fewer rights than the Croatian majority and no claim to territorial autonomy 
from Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Serbs showed up in the military uniforms of their 
self-proclaimed independent Republic of Serbian Krajina to underscore their 
refusal to be considered any part of Croatia. They also insisted on poring over 
each of 34 detailed maps of the proposed U.N. deployment areas, arguing over 
every inch of the cease-fire line in apparent expectation that it would 
eventually become the permanent boundary of their rogue state. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajina's Serbs are plagued by infighting. But all rebel factions support 
independence and eventual inclusion of their captured territory in a Greater 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 The detailed marking-off of the current confrontation lines was meant to 
provide a starting point from which both sides could pull back their troops by 
1,000 yards and their heavy artillery by six miles. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little muscle in the agreement wrestled out of the reluctant 
parties. That leads some observers to fear that neither side will make much 
effort to abide by the withdrawal provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire and separation of forces are aimed at providing breathing space 
for two more crucial phases of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediators from the United States, Russia, the 12-nation European Union and the 
United Nations next want the combatants to restore transport and 
telecommunications links to build confidence between the rival communities. 
</P>
<P>
 They then hope to work out a political settlement that would return Serb-held 
areas to Croatian government control, in exchange for some degree of autonomy 
for the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs rebelled against Croatia's June, 1991, declaration of independence from 
Yugoslavia and seized one-third of the country in a six-month war that was put 
on hold in January, 1992, by a U.N.-mediated cease-fire. More than 14,000 U.N. 
troops have been deployed to the contested region.

BRITAIN ENDS RESISTANCE; EU OKS EXPANSION COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending weeks of bitter wrangling, the 12 European Union countries forged a 
compromise Tuesday to end a dispute that has blocked plans for the group to 
expand to 16 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough came not in Brussels but on the floor of the House of Commons 
in London, where British Prime Minister John Major announced that Britain will 
end its refusal to accept changes in voting procedures considered an essential 
part of the enlargement. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Parliament, which must ratify the terms of enlargement, had 
already made it clear that it will not give its approval unless the procedures 
are altered. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned changes, which would take effect once the four new members joined, 
would make it more difficult for a few nations to block the will of the 
majority within the EU. 
</P>
<P>
 While Major's comments were hardly enthusiastic, his shift of position removes 
a major obstacle to the planned Jan. 1, 1995, accession of Sweden, Finland, 
Norway and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise proposals "meet many, though not all, of the government's 
concerns," Major told Parliament in a statement explaining his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, which had also opposed the changes, agreed last weekend to go along 
with them, leaving Britain isolated from the other 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the EU's vote distribution system, the 12 countries have a total of 76 
votes, with large nations such as Germany and Britain wielding 10 each, smaller 
nations having fewer and the smallest, Luxembourg, only two. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassadors from the EU's 12 members are scheduled to meet here today to 
formally endorse the changes, which will raise the minimum number of votes 
needed to block new legislation to 27 from the present 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the compromise, the countries agreed to seek common ground 
prior to a final vote, once a minority of 23 votes is reached, and to review 
the entire voting procedures again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain also won written assurances that it would not be isolated under the 
new rules on any law related to social issues -- matters generally dealing with 
the EU's mandatory employee fringe benefits, with which Britain has 
consistently refused to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Tuesday's breakthrough, the proposed enlargement still faces hurdles, 
including parliamentary votes and referendums in all four candidate countries 
on terms of entry into the Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Austria and the three Scandinavian countries would give an 
important push to the drive for greater European integration. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been slowed by a series of factors, including the huge shifts that have 
swept the Continent since the Iron Curtain fell more than four years ago; 
Europe's worst economic recession since the 1930s, and the rise of 
nationalistic sentiments in several countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of four rich new members would also put the EU in a far stronger 
position to reach out -- later in the decade -- to struggling democracies in 
the formerly Communist east. That is a step many see as crucial for the 
Continent's long-term stability.

UNREST WON'T HARM S. AFRICA VOTE, OFFICIAL SAYS; POLITICS: COMMISSIONER ACTS TO 
REASSURE CITIZENS. MEANWHILE, ZULUS DELAY SUMMIT WITH GOVERNMENT AND ANC TO 
DISCUSS CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to reassure a traumatized city and a frightened nation, the head of the 
independent electoral commission calmly insisted Tuesday that the blazing gun 
battles and chaos that swept the central business district here Monday will not 
derail or delay next month's democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, it does not seem to impact directly on the prospects of 
substantially free and fair elections," Judge Johann Kriegler told a news 
conference. "It may have major political implications . . . but I'm pretty 
certain it will have no effect on the electoral process." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kriegler added that a hastily formed task force had gone overnight to 
KwaZulu, the volatile Zulu homeland run by Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, 
to determine if free and fair balloting will be possible there given 
Buthelezi's increasingly strident opposition to the elections and record levels 
of political violence in surrounding Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force has until April 5 to make its report. All-race elections for a 
national and nine provincial parliaments and the first post-apartheid 
government are scheduled for April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 If necessary, Kriegler said, the voting could be postponed in selected parts 
of KwaZulu until stability is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Johannesburg, police said Tuesday that at least 34 people, including 
three police officers, were killed and 173 wounded by gunfire and marauding 
mobs downtown on a day that one newspaper here dubbed "Bloody Monday." An 
additional 18 people were killed in related factional violence in and around 
the black townships of Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, there had been a confusing series of wild shooting sprees involving 
the police, African National Congress security guards and thousands of 
anti-election Zulu protesters aligned with Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. 
Most of the Zulus marched through the streets armed with traditional weapons 
like spears and clubs, but many pulled out automatic pistols and assault rifles 
when the shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
 Each group blamed the others for instigating Monday's violence. But witnesses 
and participants gave vastly differing accounts of who fired the first shots. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also impossible to prove widely accepted reports that snipers or agents 
provocateurs had opened fire from high-rise office buildings onto Zulus 
gathered peacefully in a grassy plaza in front of the main library. 
</P>
<P>
 The downtown remained tense and filled with rumors Tuesday, but most shops and 
offices reopened, and trains and taxis resumed service. Sporadic shooting was 
reported, and unidentified gunmen in a speeding minivan fired at the heavily 
guarded ANC headquarters. No one was injured, and the gunmen escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC guards killed eight Zulus at a back corner of the headquarters, a 21-story 
office tower, in the worst single incident Monday, after armed protesters 
repeatedly circled the building and fired shots at ANC workers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a team of police forensic experts investigated the blood-stained 
pavement and shattered windows nearby, in part to determine if the ANC guards 
had fired into the crowd from an overhead balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes that the tragedy could spark a sense of urgency and force the feuding 
parties into a truce were dashed when the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, 
postponed an emergency, two-day peace summit at least until after Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials had announced late Monday that President Frederik W. de 
Klerk, ANC President Nelson Mandela, Buthelezi and his nephew, the king, would 
meet this week for the first time to discuss the political crisis and the 
growing violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter to De Klerk, Zwelithini said negotiations must wait until 
"people have been given the opportunity to bury their dead and until such time 
as the fierce anger in their breast has abated somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
 A scheduled meeting between Mandela and the king earlier this month was called 
off after ANC officials reported assassination threats against their leader, 
who is expected to become the country's first black president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zulu leaders oppose the election and the country's interim constitution 
because they say it does not guarantee them the autonomy they seek for the 
estimated 8 million Zulus. The tribal Zulu homeland, created under apartheid to 
separate the races, is to be reincorporated into the new South Africa after the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pretoria, the Transitional Executive Council -- a multi-party group set up 
to oversee the government in the run-up to the election -- ordered the drafting 
of regulations needed to declare a state of emergency in Natal province. Among 
other things, that declaration could allow the dispatch of troops to quell the 
violence there. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kane-Berman, head of the Institute of Race Relations in Johannesburg, 
said Monday's violence increased pressure to delay elections until Zulu 
concerns can be addressed and an all-inclusive solution can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the events here drive home to politicians and foreign governments that 
the notion of holding a free and fair election in a month's time is a pipe 
dream," he said in an interview. "The sooner people realize that and stop 
living in cloud cuckoo land, the better. . . . We now have to think of the 
unthinkable -- postponing the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 But Desmond Tutu, the Anglican archbishop and Nobel laureate, said in Cape 
Town that a delay is impossible. "The elections must happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle of Johannesburg marked the first time that the brutal factional 
fighting that has ravaged black townships for years moved into the 
white-dominated city that is the commercial and political hub of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel declared central Johannesburg and 10 
surrounding districts "unrest areas," giving police enhanced powers of search 
and seizure, curfew and arrest to curb gatherings and quell disturbances.

IMPROPER GIFT OF STATE COMPUTERS TO YOUTH CENTER ACKNOWLEDGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's office acknowledged Tuesday that Wilson a year ago 
improperly gave about a dozen state computers to a Korean community center in 
Los Angeles that had an Administration official on its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers, it turned out, had not officially been declared surplus. And 
the group that got them -- the Korean Youth and Community Center -- was not 
registered with the state to receive the unused property, which might have gone 
to schools had normal procedures been followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears a mistake was made," said Sean Walsh, Wilson's press secretary. 
"We will endeavor to make sure this doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said Wilson was unaware at the time that Chong W. Ha, director of the 
state's Teale Data Center and a board member at the community center, had 
steered the computers to the Korean group without following state regulations 
for disposal of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson announced the donation in April as he visited the center a few days 
before the verdicts in the second Rodney G. King beating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 His stop there was part of a two-day tour by the governor to promote efforts 
to rebuild Los Angeles after the 1992 riots and to reassure a nervous city that 
the state would respond quickly and forcefully to any repeat of the violence 
that marked the days after the first King verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Pitkin, a spokesman for the Business, Transportation and Housing 
Agency, which oversees Ha's department, said Ha became aware of the community 
group's need for computers and knew that his center had some machines no one 
wanted that were sitting in a warehouse for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 IBM and ITT personal computers had limited memory capacity and were of 
no use to the state, Pitkin said. He said they had "negligible, if any" market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there are state regulations which specify how machinery is to 
be given away, and the Teale Data Center did not follow those regulations," 
Pitkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after the computers were donated, Pitkin said, did the Department of 
General Services complete the paperwork to declare them surplus government 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitkin said the state does not intend to take the computers back from the 
community center. He said Ha has not been disciplined but has been counseled to 
follow the rules in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was called on the carpet," Pitkin said. "I think the message has been 
received." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha was not available for comment Tuesday. A spokeswoman said Ha was not aware 
of the regulations at the time he arranged the gift and was following informal 
procedures commonly practiced by state government for many years.

ROUGHED-UP VETERANS TO GET $79,000; MILITARY: ARMY AGREES TO SETTLEMENT OF 
LAWSUIT OVER INCIDENT AT PRESIDIO DURING GROUP'S DELIVERY OF ANTI-WAR MESSAGE. 
THE ACTION SPRUNG FROM A 1991 PARADE SALUTING GULF WAR GIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Army has agreed to pay $79,000 to a group of peace-loving veterans who 
were assaulted by military police as they marched in a parade celebrating the 
end of the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, unveiled Monday, settles a lawsuit filed by members of the 
Veterans Speakers Alliance, who claimed that the Army violated their 
free-speech rights by interrupting their delivery of an anti-war message in the 
parade at the San Francisco Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased because we feel we weren't treated very well," said John Wike, 
one of seven alliance veterans who sued. "The military went too far. They 
should have just let us have our say and go on our way, but they jumped us 
instead." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit sprung from the May, 1991, parade staged by the Army and the San 
Francisco Chamber of Commerce to welcome home Gulf War veterans. The sponsors 
organized the event in part to blunt criticism of the city after the Board of 
Supervisors declared San Francisco a sanctuary for those opposed to the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Veterans Speakers Alliance, like other Bay Area veterans 
groups, accepted an invitation to participate. When the alliance marchers 
reached the reviewing stands, where Gov. Pete Wilson and various Army 
dignitaries sat, they unfurled banners and placards reading, "Veterans Say No 
to War" and "Study War No More." 
</P>
<P>
 Military police promptly tried to seize the signs and pushed six of the 
veterans against a wire fence when they resisted. The marchers were handcuffed 
and detained for several hours, released only after being issued orders banning 
them from the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, those pursuing 1st Amendment claims on military installations 
have had little luck. Courts have given the government broad latitude to 
regulate and prohibit forms of speech on bases because of national security 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, however, the veterans argued that the parade was a political 
event and that its sponsors were required to allow the full range of 
perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you open up a military base for a parade -- and invite people to 
participate -- you can't pounce on them just because you oppose the message on 
their signs," said Alan Schlosser of the American Civil Liberties Union, which 
represented the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Attorney Michael Yamaguchi, whose office handled the case for the Army, 
called the settlement fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the government's going to allow a public display of support (for the 
war)," he said, "it should also allow in the same context a contrary opinion. 
This simply reaffirms that principle." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, which was approved by U.S. District Judge Saundra Brown 
Armstrong, the Army will pay court costs, attorneys' fees and give each 
plaintiff $5,626. The agreement also lifts the order barring the veterans from 
the Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Veterans Speakers Alliance is a Bay Area group of about 250 combat 
veterans who speak to schoolchildren about their experiences and views on war. 
Members said they participated in the parade to welcome home Gulf War veterans 
and remember those who died fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message was an appropriate statement of the realities of war," veteran 
Paul Cox said, "to remind people death and destruction should be mourned, not 
celebrated."

COLOSIO GUARD CHARGED AS 'CO-PARTICIPANT'; INQUIRY: SPECIAL PROSECUTOR HEADS

 As a special prosecutor was about to begin trying to unravel the increasingly 
mysterious case surrounding the assassination of Mexico's ruling party 
presidential candidate, a security guard was formally charged Tuesday in the 
capital with being a "co-participant" in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also seemed to spend much time seeking to dispel the myriad rumors 
sweeping the nation about the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the 
candidate who was gunned down here a week ago today but had been widely 
expected to be Mexico's next president.

 * U.S. officials downplayed allegations by Mexican investigators that the 
chief suspect in the case, Mario Aburto Martinez, had links with gangs or other 
unspecified groups in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican authorities insisted that they will run a meticulous, impartial 
investigation. They sought to refute the widespread suggestion of a conspiracy 
involving Mexican officials in Colosio's killing, which would taint the ability 
of government investigators to fairly probe the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican officials also have insisted that Colosio was slain by two shots -- 
not three, as some reports suggested -- and that the gun they have in evidence 
is, indeed, the weapon used in the assassination. New questions have arisen 
about the weapon because of its appearance in a widely broadcast, brutal 
videotape of Colosio's wounding at point-blank range. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators Tuesday intensified their focus on the security team assembled 
by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for Colosio's fatal campaign 
stop here. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two security guards in the PRI-arranged force, both former policemen, 
may have had previous contacts with the accused assassin; both former officers 
were at the assassination site in a poor Tijuana barrio, with one reportedly 
arriving in the neighborhood with Aburto on the day of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas -- a guard who authorities say was seen with 
Aburto in a Tijuana park a week before the killing -- was flown to a 
high-security prison near Mexico City and charged as a "co-participant." 
Authorities said he may have cleared the crowd to let Aburto near Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Sanchez said Tuesday that the former policeman is innocent and 
never knew Aburto, the accused assassin. "He's incapable of doing this," Maria 
Ramirez Sanchez said of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The other guard, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, was initially arrested in the 
melee following the shooting but later released. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. officials downplayed a suggestion by the Mexican attorney 
general's office that Aburto had links with unspecified "groups" and "gangs" in 
the Los Angeles area, where the suspect had lived in recent years. "That's 
purely speculation at this time," said John Hoos, the FBI spokesman in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials provided little substantiation for their claim of Aburto's 
Los Angeles links other than noting that he had a nickname, "Eagle Knight," 
after an Aztec warrior symbol, which is a popular emblem of Mexican 
nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 A police gang expert told The Times the symbol has no special significance for 
Los Angeles gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Montes Garcia, a former Supreme Court justice named as special 
prosecutor in the case, was scheduled to arrive in Tijuana late Tuesday to 
oversee the high-profile inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotella reported from Tijuana and McDonnell from Los Angeles.

'REVITALIZED' OVER WHITEWATER, MCDOUGAL SAYS HE'LL SEEK OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James B. McDougal, the Arkansas business partner of the Clintons in the failed 
Whitewater real estate deal, announced a bid for Congress Tuesday, saying that 
the controversy has "revitalized" him after years of bankruptcy, bad health and 
mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal is under investigation by Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske 
Jr. in connection with a variety of actions arising from the Whitewater project 
and the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which he owned.He declared 
his candidacy in Arkansas' 4th District, which includes his current residence 
of Arkadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just decided it's time for me to come out again and give these 
Republicans a fight," McDougal told a packed gathering of reporters in the 
state Capitol rotunda in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat is currently held by Republican Jay Dickey of Pine Bluff, who was 
first elected in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said that he is not planning to advertise much because the Whitewater 
scandal has made his name well known. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater figure said that he would not have a large campaign budget 
because he is broke, living on approximately $1,000 a month in Social Security 
disability payments and a small inheritance. He is living in a borrowed bedroom 
in a friend's house in Arkadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal, 53, suffered a stroke in 1986 and said he has been battling manic 
depression for several years. He said Tuesday that he takes the mood-altering 
drugs Prozac and lithium. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his former wife, Susan, were equal partners with President and Mrs. 
Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corp., a 230-acre retirement property 
project in northern Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is examining the real estate venture and its relationship to now-defunct 
Madison Guaranty. Madison's failure in 1989 cost taxpayers at least $47 
million.

ALL-MALE JAIL BOOT CAMP RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia's military-style boot camp for young felons is unconstitutional 
because women are not allowed to participate, a federal magistrate ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen E. Conrad ruled in favor of Jennifer West, 23, who challenged the program 
after spending 357 days in prison for possessing cocaine with intent to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 If West had been sent to the boot camp, she would have been released on 
probation in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy with the ruling," said West's attorney, Deborah Wyatt. "We hope 
this will create a different mind-set in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeking to change the system so women coming down the line won't be 
treated more severely than men who can go to the boot camp," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the attorney general's office said lawyers were reviewing the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight states have or are starting similar prison boot camps, and all 
but eight exclude women, Assistant Atty. Gen. Pamela Sargent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's boot camps are part of a five-year pilot program that began in 
1991. They are for nonviolent felons ages 18 to 24 with no prior incarceration 
as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 The boot camp program, which includes physical, academic and job-training and 
drug-abuse education, is seen as a way to reduce prison crowding and repeated 
criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 After 90 days in the camp, participants are released and placed on probation 
for at least a year.

JOB RETRAINING BACKED BUT CLINTON PLAN HAS OBSTACLES; EMPLOYMENT: SOME EXISTING 
AGENCIES RESIST CHANGE. THE SEARCH FOR A MODERATE APPROACH DOES NOT PLEASE 
EITHER SIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As President Clinton delivered his State of the Union speech in January, a 
group of middle-class voters rounded up by his pollsters sat in a rented room 
in Dayton, Ohio, turning dials attached to a meter to record their approval or 
disapproval of his words. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, Clinton has been telling aides and associates that the highest 
point the approval lines hit was when he talked about a proposal to improve 
services for the unemployed and help train workers for new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, aides say, the President is gilding the lily a bit -- the true high 
point on the charts came when he endorsed the anti-crime "three strikes and 
you're out" proposal. But re-employment came in a close second -- besting 
health care, welfare reform, education and the rest of Clinton's panoply of 
policy proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there tangible public support for the idea of helping unemployed 
workers, but also there is, across the political spectrum and in constituent 
groups ranging from labor unions to business leaders, a fair amount of 
agreement on what steps to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fundamental elements of the nation's unemployment insurance system have 
changed very little since the program was begun almost 60 years ago, even 
though . . . the labor market in which it operates has undergone enormous 
change," said Janet L. Norwood, former head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
and now head of the government's Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation, 
in recent testimony before a House panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwood's advisory committee, made up of representatives of business, labor 
and state and local government, was unanimous in the belief that the 
unemployment insurance program "must be adapted to meet the income maintenance 
and re-employment needs of long-term unemployed workers more effectively," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich unveiled the 
Administration's re-employment proposal on March 9, one might have expected 
widespread cheers. Instead, even as Clinton spoke, Administration officials 
were canvassing interest-group representatives in the hopes of identifying 
changes that might attract additional support to their plan. And despite 
hopeful predictions by Reich that the Administration's bill could become law 
"this spring," many congressional aides and representatives of competing 
interest groups predict that the proposal will be lucky to emerge this year at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems facing the re-employment initiative are "a case study in the 
movement from high concept to legislative detail," said a White House official 
who has monitored the issue. It is a process that, in miniature, reflects many 
of the problems that have bedeviled Clinton and his aides on larger issues, 
such as health care and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to wipe the slate clean, whatever you're embarking on," 
Reich said in an interview. "There are good reasons and bad for that. The good 
reason is that institutions are there, and you want to use them. The bad 
reasons are there are also interests there that have gotten used to what they 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plan would consolidate existing federal training 
programs, with their complicated eligibility formulas and disparate levels of 
help, into a single program open to all dislocated workers. The plan would 
transform unemployment offices into "re-employment" centers -- operations 
designed not simply to provide money to tide workers through hard times, but to 
actively help them seek new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would cost about $13 billion over the next five years -- largely 
spent on grants to states to expand their services for the unemployed. The 
Administration would pay for the plan primarily by shutting down six existing 
federal worker-training programs and trimming other federal domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the agreement that the current unemployment system has failed, 
badly, the institutions that have grown used to it have proven notably 
resistant to change. Moreover, the Administration's approach -- trying to find 
a "moderate" pathway that would avoid the ideological paths of liberal 
Democrats and conservative Republicans -- has on this, as on other issues, left 
Clinton's aides in a no-man's land between camps, shot at by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to prevent their plans from adding to the budget deficit, Clinton and 
Reich have had to limit their benefit proposals to levels that fail to excite 
much support from potential allies, such as labor unions and liberal groups. 
With no extra money in the budget, the Administration has been unable to do 
what government typically has done -- placate existing interest groups by 
adding new programs without eliminating old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, because the proposals would expand benefits, they have 
excited the suspicions of conservatives and business leaders who worry that 
Clinton's small-scale program will turn out to be an initial wedge for 
something larger and much more costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in trying to change existing programs, the Administration has 
offended those -- from bureaucrats to labor unions -- who benefit directly from 
existing systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition from entrenched interests does not necessarily mean that 
Clinton's proposals will fail. As with health care reform -- another seriously 
troubled Administration initiative -- members of Congress have a powerful 
incentive to approve something along the lines of what the Administration 
wants, even if not the exact proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every member of Congress, Republican or Democrat, I talk to gives me horror 
stories about constituents who have lost jobs and say there is nothing out 
there to help them," Reich said. "That's why the system is going to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope with all of this is that everybody likes it enough that they'll get 
on board. We hope the groups will determine on the basis of their own interests 
that it's a mistake to make the best the enemy of the better." 
</P>
<P>
 But that sort of appeal to compromise is exactly the reverse of the logic that 
animates most Washington-based interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 On the re-employment bill, for example, Administration officials had hoped 
that labor unions would be key allies. After all, they argued, the bill would 
expand services to many jobless workers -- by the end of the decade roughly 
doubling the number of unemployed people receiving federally assisted job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the tight federal budget, the Administration cannot afford to 
launch its new program without closing existing ones. And so far, organized 
labor has been reluctant to part with the existing programs, particularly the 
Trade Adjustment Act, which labor won in 1962 in exchange for its support of 
free-trade legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade law provides benefits for workers who lose their jobs because of 
imports, and "we believe it should continue with a separate identity because it 
is part of a commitment" made years ago, AFL-CIO official Mark Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions would also like to use the Administration's proposal as a vehicle to 
strengthen the so-called WARN law, which requires companies to provide notice 
to workers before closing a plant. The law, passed over President George Bush's 
objections in 1992, has several major loopholes that unions and their allies 
would like to see closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, which supports a tougher law, at one point considered 
including WARN amendments in its re-employment proposal. The assumption was 
that workers who received more notice before losing their jobs could make 
earlier preparations for finding new work, reducing the length of their stay on 
unemployment. But business groups vowed that any attempt to strengthen the 
plant closing law would cause them to oppose the re-employment bill, so the 
Administration backed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders remain cool to the Administration's plan, worried that the 
proposal to expand worker training funds would become an open-ended, and 
expensive, new entitlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich met recently with 50 corporate executives seeking to calm their fears 
and attract support, but business lobbyists have yet to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
 Another set of attacks comes from the competing representatives of state and 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its birth as part of the New Deal, the nation's unemployment system has 
been a joint state-federal effort. The federal government provides the overall 
structure and some of the funds; the state governments actually run the 
programs and supply the balance of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The element of the Administration's new plan that would convert existing 
unemployment offices into re-employment centers would provide a range of 
services to workers with the primary emphasis on those facing long-term 
unemployment. States would be required to screen unemployed workers when they 
apply for benefits and focus attention on those at risk of long-term 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government would help pay for the new services. But in exchange, 
the states would have to introduce an element of competition -- allowing 
private enterprises, such as community colleges and nonprofit groups, to 
compete with existing state employment services for some of the business and 
federal grants. A new system of performance standards and reports would give 
information to unemployed workers about which programs actually succeed in 
helping people find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the people who run existing state employment services look 
askance at the idea of competition, fearing that they will be squeezed out. And 
the government worker unions who represent employment service workers are 
similarly cool to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, local government representatives argue that because labor markets are 
regional -- not statewide -- they should have greater control of where the 
money goes. The nation's governors argue that control should remain at the 
state level. The Administration, trying once again to steer a compromise, has 
made both sides unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official described the difficulties in language that could apply 
to any number of troubled Administration initiatives: "One of the problems is 
that it's not easy to bring order into a field that has grown in an unplanned 
and incremental fashion over the decades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are dozens and dozens of programs that have to be brought into 
reasonable relationship with one another," he said. "Superimposed on that, you 
have federal-state relations." In addition, "the entire basis of the system has 
to be shifted. It has to be rethought." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you pile those three layers of complexity together and then on top put 
the financing in a tough fiscal environment, you have a recipe for a complex 
policy process," he said with a sigh. "It's not easy."

VALUE OF MANY JOB TRAINING EFFORTS DOUBTED; EMPLOYMENT: TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO 
LOOK FOR WORK SEEMS BEST. CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION OFTEN APPEARS TO HAVE LITTLE 
WORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Displaced workers, mothers on welfare, teen-agers with poor job prospects: 
Clinton Administration officials often have seemed to have a single 
prescription for all of them -- job training. 
</P>
<P>
 But a raft of analytical studies over the last decade raise considerable 
questions about whether many job training programs actually work. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyses do contain one piece of good news: The sort of program that seems 
to work best -- helping people simply learn how to look for a job -- is also 
the cheapest to implement. On-the-job training programs also appear to work 
reasonably well. 
</P>
<P>
 But classroom training in occupational skills -- taking unemployed machinists, 
for example, and teaching them how to work computers, often seems to accomplish 
little. The least worthwhile sort of training, experts now agree, are short-run 
programs that do not invest enough time and energy on each participant to 
actually impart many new skills. Unfortunately, in the past, government 
officials have supported many programs that offer precisely that sort of 
training because they are much cheaper than long-term programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of such research -- and because of the cost -- the 
Administration's ardor for expensive training appears to have cooled 
considerably over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton advisers once talked broadly of a federally supported network of 
training centers that would offer up to two years of training or retraining to 
virtually any American who felt a need. Budget realities -- and questions about 
the efficacy of training -- have led to a drastic reduction in such plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's re-employment proposal, unveiled March 9, would provide 
assistance for unemployed workers, focusing on those in danger of long-term 
unemployment. Most of them, however, would receive only counseling and what 
policy officials call job search assistance -- access to computerized listings 
of jobs plus help in getting through the process of preparing resumes, filling 
out applications and interviewing with prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the roughly 2 million workers each year who become permanently displaced 
from their jobs, only a little more than 200,000 per year would receive 
training that would last more than six months -- the length of existing 
unemployment benefits. And that figure would be reached only at the end of the 
decade when the Administration's plan is fully phased in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration initially would provide extensive training only to workers 
who have been on their current jobs for at least three years before being laid 
off. Eventually, that tenure requirement would drop to one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of such a tenure requirement is to prevent workers who have never 
actually settled into a job from hopping into subsidized training slots. The 
proposal would, however, have one potentially bad side effect, noted Walter 
Corson, who directs research into job training programs at Mathematica Policy 
Research in Princeton, N.J. Experience shows that younger workers are more 
likely to benefit from training than older ones, Corson said. But tenure 
requirements tend to screen out younger workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's largest current training program, the Job Training 
Partnership Act, does show some positive results, according to a national study 
of nearly 16,000 JTPA participants begun in 1986 and released earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult men who went through JTPA training earned, over the next 2 1/2 years, an 
average of 8% more than similar groups of men who were not trained, according 
to the study, which was conducted for the Labor Department by Abt Associates, a 
consulting firm. Adult women had more positive results -- a 15% increase in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program did not appear to improve the earnings of out-of-school 
youths. Neither did it have much impact in reducing welfare use, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women who enrolled in classroom-type training programs sponsored by 
JTPA had only small increases in their eventual earnings, which could have been 
the result of random chance, the study's authors said. Because of that, "there 
is no firm evidence" that classroom training helped those who enrolled in it, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, those who received a combination of job search assistance and 
on-the-job training enjoyed a considerably larger increase in their earnings. 
The study's authors noted, however, that JTPA program staff members tended to 
send the "most employable" participants to on-the-job training programs -- a 
tendency that could well have influenced the study's results.

ADMINISTRATION ACTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF CRIME ISSUE; LEGISLATION: OFFICIALS SEEK 
TO CONTROL DEBATE OVER MEASURE PENDING IN HOUSE. REPUBLICANS CALL THE PROPOSALS 
'TOUGH TALK, WEAK SUBSTANCE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to build public enthusiasm for a controversial anti-crime bill in the 
House, the Clinton Administration Tuesday claimed some advances in its war on 
crime but said that further progress depends on passage of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, flanked by other top policy-makers, presided at a White 
House briefing apparently designed to take firm control of the crime issue and 
to repel demands from Republicans in Congress for tougher laws targeting 
hard-core criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The House was unable to act on the crime-fighting bill before its two-week 
Easter break began last Friday because of a partisan dispute over the ground 
rules for debate. Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said the bill will be the 
first item of business when lawmakers return April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the controversial issues in the legislation are provisions that would 
expand the federal death penalty, require life sentences for three-time violent 
offenders and allow 13- and 14-year-olds to be tried as adults for certain 
serious crimes. Floor battles seem assured over proposals to limit appeals of 
Death Row inmates and to allocate $2 billion in grants to crime-prone 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republican leaders have called the Administration-backed bill a 
combination of "tough talk, weak substance and misdirected spending." The 
Senate passed its version of the crime bill last November and, after the House 
completes its work, a Senate-House conference committee will work out 
differences between the two measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said cooperation between federal and local law enforcement officials is 
beginning to show results. But she emphasized that more federal money is needed 
to help states build new prisons and carry out crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to be a Pollyanna or pretend that the crime problem is being 
solved," she said. "We've made some headway but we've got more to do. . . . I 
think the American people want us all to work together in a nonpartisan, 
thoughtful way to get this crime bill passed." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that a provision in the Senate-passed crime bill that would help 
cities put 100,000 more police officers on the street over the next five years 
would produce a 40% increase in the national force of 250,000 law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller-scale Justice Department program already under way has allocated $75 
million to more than 100 cities and towns to pay for more than 1,000 new police 
officers, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those that got the first grants tell me they are making a difference," she 
added. "Everywhere I travel, local officials say they need this help." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry G. Cisneros, secretary of housing and urban development, said a new 
"Operation Safe Home," which focuses federal enforcement efforts on crime in 
public housing projects, has resulted in 24 arrests, 14 indictments and the 
recovery of 25 weapons and $300,000 in drugs and cash during its first month.

 His department also will make available $232 million in grants to local public 
housing managers for programs designed to fight drug trafficking and 
drug-related crime in federal projects, Cisneros said, noting that $500 million 
has been provided since the program's inception in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pledge to join the attorney general in her efforts . . . over the next 
several weeks to do everything we can to pass the crime bill," Cisneros said. 
"That means going around the country, talking to citizens who in turn can 
express their opinions to their legislators, working as part of the White House 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald K. Noble, assistant Treasury secretary for law enforcement, reported 
positive results from the first month under the new federal law that requires a 
five-day waiting period for purchases of handguns while police do background 
checks. In Houston alone, he said, 199 persons have been stopped from buying 
guns since the law took effect. Forty-eight were denied guns in Dallas.

POLICE ACQUIRE TAPE OF SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As mourners eulogized two college students who were shot to death in a weekend 
carjacking, Los Angeles police confiscated a videotape taken by a bank 
surveillance camera during the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Sandra Castello said homicide detectives plan to study the tape for 
possible clues to the identity of the gunman who killed Takuma Ito and Go 
Matsuura, both 19, in a San Pedro parking lot Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape was recorded by a Bank of San Pedro security camera at an automatic 
teller machine that faces out across the parking lot to the scene of the crime, 
the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the camera was scanning the area -- a Ralphs supermarket parking lot 
-- from about 80 yards away at the time of the slayings.

PASSION FOR MOVIES UNITED SLAIN FRIENDS; TRAGEDY: STUDENTS KILLED IN CARJACKING 
LIVED AND BREATHED FILMS. A SHRINE RISES IN THE PARKING LOT WHERE THEY DIED.

 To Ralphs assistant manager Ric Gibbs, the two were simply "the film guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura constantly talked movies when they stopped at the 
San Pedro supermarket late at night to buy soda or toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the two 19-year-old Marymount College students were gunned down Friday 
night outside Ralphs and were transformed into international martyrs of violent 
crime in Los Angeles. Now their stunned friends are filing through the 
supermarket to buy candles for the impromptu memorial garden of daisy bouquets, 
Easter lilies and potted chrysanthemums that has sprung up on the pavement 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bought almost all the candles we had," said Gibbs, who gave one of the 
friends $10 to buy more candles for the parking lot shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers remembered the two students in English and Japanese at a private 
memorial service Tuesday in the Marymount chapel that drew between 200 and 250 
people, including the young men's families, students, faculty and staff, a 
college official said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the students' photos flash on television screens around the world, those 
who knew Ito and Matsuura say they are struggling with the loss of two young 
men that they describe -- not as international figures -- but as good-humored, 
talented young men. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are two students who were unusually directed," said their faculty 
adviser, Pat Kelley. "When the (film) class ended, they wanted to take the 
videotape home and watch it again." 
</P>
<P>
 The two frequented a Blockbuster video store near Ralphs and combed Los 
Angeles in search of new films. For a recent class assignment, Ito wrote an 
essay explaining that he needed a girlfriend because he wanted someone to watch 
movies with. 
</P>
<P>
 Their writing teacher, assistant professor Sandra Ross, recalled how the two, 
who both favored baseball caps, would stop by her office to report on films 
they had seen that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Their favorite actresses were Jodie Foster and Geena Davis, but their biggest 
hero was director Steven Spielberg, and they applauded the accolades heaped on 
"Schindler's List" at the recent Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and teachers say the two loved being in the United States. When Ito's 
grandfather died several weeks ago, Ito traveled back to Japan and recorded his 
impressions of the transpacific journey in an essay that Kelley read from this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving in Japan, he wrote: "When I had Japanese soup, my body absorbs 
it like dry sands. I found that I am really Japanese at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also described wanting to eat hamburgers "like American people." He added: 
"Though my home country is Japan, I wanted to go back to the U.S.A. like a 
refugee." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in Japan, his death is the subject of newspaper editorials. 
</P>
<P>
 One remarked: "Among the world's advanced nations, there is no country except 
the United States in which it is so easy to obtain firearms. Viewed from the 
outside, America's gun society can be seen only as abnormal. We want Americans 
to more seriously face that fact." 
</P>
<P>
 At the flower shrine outside Ralphs, someone has added a simple, handwritten 
sign: "We must have gun control. Who is next? Your child?"

KUNSTLER SAYS 4 IN BOMB CASE ASK HIS SERVICES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal-defense lawyer William M. Kunstler said Tuesday that the four 
defendants convicted of bombing the World Trade Center have dropped their 
attorneys and asked him to represent them at their sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler also said in a letter to Judge Kevin T. Duffy that he would move for 
a new trial for the four on grounds that they received "ineffective assistance 
of counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 The four Muslims were convicted earlier this month of all charges that they 
carried out the Feb. 26, 1993, bombing, which killed six people and injured at 
least 1,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler has repeatedly criticized the defense attorneys, saying they did not 
do enough to question the government's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler said the men made their request in a phone call from federal prison 
in Lewisburg, Pa. The defendants, Mohammed A. Salameh, Mahmud Abouhalima, Nidal 
Ayyad and Ahmad Mohammad Ajaj, are expected to be sentenced May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin Campriello, Ajaj's lawyer, said he was unaware of any plans by his 
client to switch lawyers.

THE SON NOW SHINES IN FATHER'S 'PROPAGANDA ROOM'; BROADCASTING: UCLA PROFESSOR 
FOLLOWS IN PARENT'S FOOTSTEPS AS DIRECTOR OF VOICE OF AMERICA TO BRING U.S. 
NEWS TO A CHANGED WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Geoffrey Cowan was a child, the library in his home in Connecticut was 
called the "propaganda room" because it was stocked with great works about the 
forces that shape public opinion. What the books said, his father Louis G. 
Cowan explained to him, was that there is only one way to influence people: 
tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Cowan was able to put that creed into practice. From 1943 to 1945 he was 
the second director of the Voice of America, the United States' most famous 
government-run news arm, which provides radio broadcasts in native languages 
and English to countries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later it is the younger Cowan's turn. A UCLA professor, author and 
playwright, Cowan, 51, in effect took over the propaganda room earlier this 
month when he became the 19th director of the Voice of America. 
</P>
<P>
 He is beginning the job at a time of great change for the U.S. radio voice, 
which was created to combat the totalitarian thought-control machinery of Nazi 
Germany and later the communist regimes of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview recently in his office, Cowan outlined his three main tasks as 
the head of one of the world's largest news organizations. One is to take 
advantage of new technologies; the second is to find new ways of distributing 
the news and information that Voice of America already produces for its 1,000 
hours a week of broadcasts, and the third is to define the station's role in 
the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan -- who is on leave from UCLA -- also will have to help cut about $20 
million from Voice's annual budget to $244 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Voice broadcasts news about the United States and the outside world to 46 
countries in English and 45 countries in other languages. But because it is 
government run, Voice is barred from broadcasting in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two U.S. government news organizations, Radio Liberty and Radio Free 
Europe, were created to deliver news to people behind the Iron Curtain about 
events in their own countries. Radio Liberty broadcasts to Russia and the 
former Soviet republics, Radio Free Europe to the rest of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan argued that events since the end of the Soviet Union in 1990 demonstrate 
that the "VOA is at least as important as it was during the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
 First, he said, a number of countries still have repressive regimes that 
control the news, including Haiti, China, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Tibet and 
the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, "we are living in a period of what one historian calls 
'turbulence,' an unsettled period of ethnic hatred, fierce nationalism and 
confusion about values." In some countries, including Russia and even Germany, 
"the possibilities of democracy and fascism" coexist, competing for power. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a world, Cowan argued, Voice of America has the potential to be one of 
the country's most eloquent demonstrations of democratic values, providing 
accurate, balanced and comprehensive information as well as news about American 
concerns and policy positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Cowan's philosophy about accuracy and honesty, however, most Voice 
news reports tend to be different from those of commercial news organizations, 
if only because they tend to emphasize American policy rather than to point out 
conflict or to look for potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan has a background well-suited to the challenges of new technology. He 
noted that Voice of America has just moved onto Internet, the free computer 
database system, that will make its scripts available in all languages to 
anyone with a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan may represent a return to tradition, compared with some of his recent 
predecessors, who were more intrigued by television than he is. Cowan thinks 
there is something about the character of radio that makes it better for 
communicating ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although PBS television is a great service," he said by way of analogy, "if 
you wanted to influence minds in America, National Public Radio would probably 
be more effective." 
</P>
<P>
 In his career as an attorney and professor, Cowan has focused on 
communications. A graduate of Harvard and of Yale Law School, Cowan was a 
public-interest lawyer whose work led to several landmark Federal 
Communications Commission decisions and to a teaching job at UCLA, where he 
helped found the school's Communication's Law Program and more recently became 
director of the Center for Communications Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the author of two books, including "See No Evil" about television 
censorship, and more recently "The People v. Clarence Darrow: The Bribery Trial 
of America's Greatest Lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a playwright, the author of "Top Secret: The Battle for the Pentagon 
Papers," and also a television producer, whose "Mark Twain and Me," a two-hour 
movie starring Jason Robards, won an Emmy Award in 1992. Cowan chaired the 
commission that wrote Los Angeles' ethics and campaign finance law.

OTHER DOCTORS TO HELP WOMAN IN PAIN, KEVORKIAN LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several doctors have volunteered to help relieve the pain of a severely 
arthritic woman whose suffering prompted Jack Kevorkian to threaten to resume 
assisted suicides, his lawyer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Through lawyer Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian on Monday said he might go back on 
his word and help the woman kill herself unless a doctor provides her with 
stronger painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to get out of jail in December, Kevorkian promised a judge not to 
help others kill themselves until an appeals court rules on the 
constitutionality of Michigan's ban on assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieger said a woman in her 70s whom Kevorkian has been counseling is in so 
much pain that the retired pathologist considers himself "unbridled" from that 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants somebody who will give her stronger medication to make the rest of 
her life more comfortable," Fieger said. "In the absence of that, Dr. Kevorkian 
will no longer feel constrained under the promise that he previously made." 
</P>
<P>
 Fieger said Tuesday he had been contacted by seven doctors interested in 
trying to help, including the woman's own doctor, who said he would make a call 
to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieger would not identify the doctors except to say they were from the Detroit 
and Traverse City areas, and would give no detail on what the woman's doctor or 
the others said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian can't prescribe drugs because his medical license has been suspended 
in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a videotape played at Fieger's office, the woman, who was not identified, 
said she has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for 26 years. She described 
losing an eye, having her left leg amputated four years ago and losing her 
right leg two weeks ago. She showed her deformed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she was considering suicide, she replied, "I think that would be the 
best thing for me." She said she got pain medication but it was not strong 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieger had said Kevorkian would act if no help is found for the woman by the 
time of his April 19 trial on an assisted suicide charge. Judges have dismissed 
three similar charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, 65, has been present at 20 deaths since July, 1990. The Legislature 
last year banned assisted suicides to stop him.

 Licia Joy Galinsky, 30, and her supervisor, Roy Peterson, filed a complaint

JUDGE OKS COLOMBIA FUNDS FOR AMES' SON; ESPIONAGE: DISPUTE RAGES OVER WHETHER 
BANK ACCOUNT BELONGS TO BOY'S GRANDMOTHER OR IS PAYMENT FROM RUSSIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Tuesday allowed accused CIA spy Aldrich H. Ames and his wife, 
Rosario, to draw $500 a month from a Colombian bank account to pay for the care 
of their 5-year-old son while they await trial behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the money in the account is a matter of dispute, with U.S. 
District Judge Claude Hilton finding that $111,000 had been transferred to the 
Colombian account from funds the Russians allegedly put in Ames' Swiss bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 But William B. Cummings, Mrs. Ames' attorney, contended that the Colombian 
account contains only her mother's pension money. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not the Ameses' money," Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Cecilia Dupuy de Casas, the boy's maternal grandmother, who has 
not been implicated in the espionage case, plans to take him to her homeland of 
Colombia this week because media attention has prevented the boy, Paul, from 
returning to school or otherwise living a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, a former counterintelligence officer for the CIA, and his wife were 
arrested last month on charges that they sold information over a nine-year 
period in what could be the longest and most damaging penetration of the CIA by 
a spy for the Soviet Union -- and later Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton delayed ruling on a government motion to hold the couple in contempt 
for failing to obey his order to transfer to the United States $2.2 million in 
funds deposited in accounts in Switzerland, Italy and Colombia. The money 
allegedly was paid to them by the Russians for their spying. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge indicated that he is hopeful that prosecutors and defense attorneys 
will reach agreement on transferring the funds to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plato Cacheris, Ames' lawyer, said the order violates the U.S. 
Constitution's protection against self-incrimination by requiring "us to 
acknowledge ownership of those accounts and we are not prepared to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the hearing, Cacheris and Cummings made clear that they are open to 
discussions about a possible plea bargain with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "All options are open," Cacheris said. "We're always interested in pursuing 
discussions," Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government could find two advantages in resolving the case under an 
agreement with Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 First, prosecutors could avoid disclosing classified materials that Ames 
likely would want to use for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they could obtain the defendants' assistance in assessing the damage 
allegedly caused by Ames, who had access to some of the agency's most sensitive 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Government sources familiar with the case said they doubt that prosecutors 
could offer any likelihood of leniency for Ames but might be more flexible 
toward his wife and in helping to achieve acceptable arrangements for their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguments over use of the funds for the boy, prosecutor Mark J. Hulkower 
said the money in the overseas accounts "could only have come from Russian 
money" and thus was no different from that recovered "in a bank robber's bag." 
They have "no more right to it than the bank robber." 
</P>
<P>
 All of Ames' legitimate CIA salary has been traced as spent, Hulkower said. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that before any money is released, the Ameses should first bring 
back to this country funds that the Russians allegedly paid them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton turned to the Colombian account as a source of money for the boy after 
Hulkower cited FBI evidence showing that between 1987 and 1990, Ames had made 
13 wire transfers totaling $111,000 from his Swiss account to the Colombian 
account.

NEW CHILDPROOF, EASILY OPENED PACKAGING TO BE UNVEILED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble Co. and the Consumer Product Safety Commission today will 
unveil new packaging intended to be both childproof and easy for adults with 
arthritis to open. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal safety agency will use the announcement to debut a new approach to 
product regulation that is low-budget and high-profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble officials said the new package "uses adult reasoning skills 
rather than brute force" to solve the problem of creating a container that 
cannot be opened by a curious child but can be manipulated by a person with 
arthritis or some other condition that limits strength or dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said the new packaging will be used on mouthwash and a new 
non-prescription pain medication. They would give no other details. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the importance of the new packaging, Procter & Gamble will receive 
the agency's first "Chairman's Commendation for Significant Contributions to 
Product Safety," an award created by commission Chairman Ann Brown, who took 
office three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is trying to revive an agency that was cut drastically by the Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush administrations and that still is facing budget cuts 
from a more sympathetic Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
 With no money for initiatives and Bush appointees holding two of the 
commission's three seats, Brown told a group of reporters Tuesday that she will 
use persuasion and publicity to promote her product-safety agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her techniques will be to praise publicly those companies and 
industries that voluntarily embrace such product-safety improvements as Procter 
& Gamble's new packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not endorsing the style of the cap, we are endorsing the concept," 
said Brown, who has made improving children's safety packages for medicines and 
other products one of her top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Childproof caps can be so difficult to open that many people simply leave them 
off, she said, and most cases of poisoning today result from children ingesting 
material from a childproof container that was not properly closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she has ordered the agency staff to come up with a new approach to 
the problem before the end of the year.

CONVICTED KILLER OF 5 STUDENTS APOLOGIZES TO VICTIMS' FAMILIES

 Danny Harold Rolling apologized Tuesday to the families of his victims as a 
judge considered whether the convicted killer should live or die for slaying 
five college students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever I might have to say at this moment is overshadowed by the suffering 
I've caused," Rolling told Circuit Judge Stan R. Morris. "I regret with all my 
heart what my hand has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling pleaded guilty last month to the August, 1990, murders of five 
students at the University of Florida and Santa Fe Community College. At the 
end of a penalty hearing last week, the jury voted to recommend death on each 
of the five murder charges.

TACO BELL EXTENDS HEADQUARTERS SEARCH IN O.C.; FAST FOOD: AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN 
TO KEEP COMPANY IN STATE MAY BE FACTOR. DECISION EXPECTED IN 'NEXT FEW WEEKS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Granelli, Susan Christian and Debora Vrana. It was written by Granelli.

<P>
 Taco Bell Corp., which said it would reveal by Thursday a possible relocation 
of its headquarters, has instead expanded its search to include new Orange 
County sites and told employees that it will need a few more weeks to consider 
its options. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay came after a meeting Monday at Irvine City Hall between Taco Bell 
executives and members of a task force of county business leaders and local and 
state public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called red team, a nickname the Wilson Administration has given to such 
task forces, presented the company with its "best and final offer" of what 
public agencies could provide the Mexican fast-food chain in incentives and 
inducements, several sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Gov. Pete Wilson telephoned senior corporate executives Friday 
and, in a long conference call, urged them to keep the company in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged that they have delayed a decision," said Terry Hartman, 
president of the Irvine Chamber of Commerce. "It means they have heard some 
additional information that is making them do some additional thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Spectrum business park is a longtime contender for the new 
headquarters. But among the new locations being considered is South County land 
owned by the Mission Viejo Co., a development company whose executives 
acknowledged talks with Taco Bell but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which employs nearly 1,000 full-time workers and consultants at its 
headquarters in Irvine, also would not discuss the new sites it is considering. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay in its self-imposed deadline was caused by the "complexity" of the 
issues surrounding a possible relocation, the company said. It also said that 
it will continue to analyze sites in Orange County and the Dallas-Ft. Worth 
area before making "a final decision in the next few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The red team's full-court press to keep Taco Bell in California is part of the 
state's response to the growing number of companies considering fleeing the 
state for what they believe to be more hospitable business climates. From the 
state Legislature to city halls, politicians over the past year have eased tax 
and regulatory burdens on corporations and have become more active in promoting 
California's advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's search for new quarters is a test of the willingness and efforts 
of local and state governments to work with business and to attract and keep 
major corporations. Meantime, six months of indecision have taken their toll on 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all very annoying," said a secretary as she walked to the Taco Bell 
parking lot during lunch Tuesday. "They told us they still don't know if 
they're going to relocate -- but they said that even if they do, it will be 2 
1/2 years down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who declined to give her name, described the uncertainty as 
"stressful" for Taco Bell employees. "They might only take upper-management 
people," she said, "so I don't know if I'd be offered the option of going to 
another city." 
</P>
<P>
 Another secretary, munching on a Taco Bell quesadilla in the employee 
cafeteria, agreed that being in limbo is difficult. "I have no idea what's 
going to happen," she said. "I'm just stunned. I have a family here, so it 
would be hard for us to move. And whether or not we would even want to depends 
on what city the company finally decides on." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who also requested anonymity, said employees are abuzz about the 
possible relocation. "We wouldn't be normal if we weren't all talking about 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The fast-growing company, with 4,500 eateries nationwide, alarmed public 
officials as well as its own employees in September when it announced it was 
considering a move. It also said then that it was possible that it might remain 
in its 12-story mirrored building, but spokeswoman Janis Smith said last week 
that that statement would be "inaccurate today." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is looking for up to 600,000 square feet of space in a campus-like 
array of buildings on up to 25 acres -- enough room to allow it to double in 
size in a few years. It currently occupies 285,000 square feet in a building 
near Jamboree Road and the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said last week that the company's decision will be based on "economics, 
transportation and, for Texas, a central location" in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell has been looking at five sites in Orange County, including the 
Irvine Spectrum and sites outside the Irvine city limits, said Paul O. Brady, 
Irvine's city manager and a member of the red team. He said the city's effort 
has been to persuade the company to build on Irvine Spectrum land, the huge 
business park near the junction of the San Diego and the Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brady would not discuss any details or identify the latest sites under 
consideration. Real estate sources, however, said Taco Bell is talking with the 
Mission Viejo Co. about vacant land it could buy from the developer. A specific 
site was not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have talked to Taco Bell," said Wendy Harder, a Mission Viejo Co. 
spokeswoman. "But we cannot comment on anything until a deal closes."  
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell is believed to have rejected locations on either side of UC Irvine, 
one presented by UCI and the other promoted by the Irvine Co. UCI submitted a 
proposal to Taco Bell in February for a campus-like headquarters as part of a 
planned $150-million corporate park, which would include 300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there have been no recent discussions with Taco Bell," said Linda 
Granell, a UCI spokeswoman. "It's now their decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of limiting its choices, the company earlier this month ruled 
out the greater Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., areas. In addition, a spokeswoman 
for the city of Dallas said the company stopped considering downtown Dallas 
"several months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas business and civic leaders said the company is being wooed by Ft. Worth 
business barons Ed Bass and H. Ross Perot Jr., son of the 1992 presidential 
candidate, to sites northeast of Ft. Worth or in western Plano, a north Dallas 
suburb. Who's Leaving Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 A complete list of companies that have pulled up stakes and moved out of 
Orange County is not available because such moves are not officially tracked. 
But this partial list of companies that have left since 1989 shows 
manufacturers leading the exodus. List pertains to relocations and does not 
include jobs lost as a result of shutting down or selling off operations.

PACIFICARE GETS OK TO JOIN STATE HEALTH INSURANCE ALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare of California, a subsidiary of PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., said 
Tuesday that it has received approval to participate in the Health Insurance 
Plan of California, the state's alliance through which small businesses can 
purchase health-care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced in July, 1993, the state insurance plan covers 2,500 businesses and 
44,000 Californians. The program offers coverage to small employee groups of 
five to 50 employees through a pool of health-care and insurance companies. 
PacifiCare will be one of 23 such members in the state plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Cypress, PacifiCare is one of the largest managed-care organizations 
in the state, serving more than 830,000 customers.

LG&E POWER TO TRANSFER SOME WORKERS, FUNCTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 LG&E Energy Corp.'s LG&E Power unit said it plans to relocate several 
functions from its Irvine headquarters to Louisville, Ky., as part of a 
restructuring plan announced last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will relocate an unspecified number of employees from 
Irvine and will fill about 30 managerial and seven clerical and administrative 
staff positions through local hiring and a national recruitment effort over the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Campbell, a spokeswoman at LG&E Power, said there were no job cuts 
involved in the relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to Louisville is designed to maximize planning and marketing efforts 
in the growing segment of wholesale power development and marketing, Ed Casey, 
group president of LG&E Energy Services, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 LG&E Power's engineering, construction and plant operations staff will remain 
headquartered in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, LG&E Energy Corp. consolidated its various businesses into LG&E 
Energy Services, which will oversee all wholesale power products, development 
and marketing, and Louisville Gas and Electric Co., which will focus on retail 
utility services in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplier of electricity and gas made the consolidations in anticipation of 
intense competition in the closely regulated utility industry.

EXXON IS NEW LEADER OF FORBES PROFIT 500 LIST; CORPORATIONS: OIL GIANT KNOCKS 
PHILIP MORRIS FROM TOP. ROCKWELL HEADS SEVEN O.C. FIRMS MAKING AT LEAST ONE OF 
FOUR LISTS.

<P>
 Exxon Corp., the oil giant whose 1993 profits gushed 10% higher to $5.3 
billion, knocked Philip Morris Cos. Inc. from the top of Forbes magazine's 
Profits 500 list, the publication said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In its April 25 edition, Forbes' 26th annual survey said New York-based 
cigarette and food company Philip Morris, whose earnings slumped 28% last year 
to $3.6 billion, dropped to fourth place, a victim of a tobacco price war that 
punched holes in the company's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., another tobacco company, did not make the list 
after losing $3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many California companies that made the list, seven are based in Orange 
County. Most made the list for the companies with the biggest revenues last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But three local concerns -- Allergan, Rockwell and Fluor -- also made the list 
of companies with the largest profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the Big Three auto makers -- Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. -- 
cruised back on Forbes' chart, holding the fifth- and sixth-place slots. They 
had been bumped off the list because of big losses in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors, with 1993 sales of $138 billion, made the top of Forbes' Sales 
500 chart for the ninth year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp., whose profits soared 378% to $2.4 billion, was in seventh 
place on the profits list, a major comeback from its 98th-place showing in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co., another no-show on the earnings list in 1992 after 
losing $2.1 billion, was in eighth place, with profits of $2.4 billion. 
American Express Co. also did well, rebounding to 22nd place from 110th as a 
result of a 178% leap in 1993 earnings to $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Chrysler and American Express, only three other firms among the Top 
50 on Forbes Profits 500 list posted profit increases of more than 100% in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel Corp., the nation's biggest computer chip maker, racked up a profit gain 
of 115%, moving up to 10th place from 35th. 
</P>
<P>
 Citicorp, with a net profit jump of 166%, climbed to 17th from the 62nd spot. 
Amoco Corp. held the 19th position after holding onto the No. 48 spot in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Orange County companies, the giant Seal Beach technology conglomerate 
Rockwell had the highest rankings on the lists for both profits and sales. 
Rockwell, which makes products for businesses from aerospace to automobiles, 
placed 85th on the list for profits with $584 million. It was 82nd in sales at 
$11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell ranked 87th in market value, at $9.5 billion, and 203rd in assets, at 
$9.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor, the worldwide construction company, ranked 126th in sales -- $8.1 
billion -- and 302nd in profits with $175 million. It also ranked 237th in 
market value -- $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen Brunswig, a drug distributor based in Orange, placed 150th on the sales 
list at $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Allergan, an Irvine maker of eye-care products, made the list for profits, 
ranking 418th at $109 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer maker AST Research in Irvine finished in 471st place for sales with 
$1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on one of the lists was Fountain Valley's FHP International, a health 
maintenance organization that placed 427th in sales with $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 And Newport Beach's Downey Savings & Loan Assn. ranked 452nd in assets with 
$3.5 billion. Where O.C. Firms Rank on Forbes 500 Lists 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Orange County companies appear on the 1993 Forbes 500 lists of the top 
U.S. companies. Forbes has four separate 500 rankings: sales, profits, assets 
and market value. 
</P>

BRIEFCASE: SMALL AND MINORITY BUSINESS; VIETNAMESE PHONE CENTER TO ASSIST 
25,000 CALIFORNIA FIRMS

 Ordering an 800 number or discussing the fine points of a customized telephone 
service for a business can be confusing enough without the added complication 
of a language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 So Pacific Bell recently initiated its Vietnamese Business Center, designed to 
help the 25,000 Vietnamese businesses in California.The center has bilingual 
service representatives who can counsel customers in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Tustin, the center officially opens its doors April 15, although 
customers have been able to place calls there since January by dialing (800) 
799-2828. The center already receives about 70 calls a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here 10 years ago, and I remember how difficult it was to learn 
English," said Mai Nguyen, director of the Vietnamese Business Center. "Nobody 
can learn a new language overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the center were underway long before the United States opened trade 
with Vietnam earlier this year, said Linda Bonniksen, a spokeswoman for Pacific 
Bell. "It has been a long-term goal of the company," she said. "It was dictated 
by the evolving needs of our customers in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Pacific Bell opened a Hispanic Business Center and a Korean Business 
Center in 1991, both based in Los Angeles; and a Chinese Business Center in San 
Francisco two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to provide customers with service in the language they prefer to 
do business in," Bonniksen said.

ONCE-BELOVED BEETLE COULD BE BACK SOON; AUTOMOBILES: VOLKSWAGEN HOPES TO TAP 
INTO AMERICAN NOSTALGIA WITH UPDATED VERSION OF CAR THAT STILL SELLS ELSEWHERE 
BUT VANISHED FROM SHOWROOMS IN U.S. MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. IRVINE DEALER 
REPORTS INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Volkswagen Beetle, the much-loved and fondly remembered car that 
disappeared from auto showrooms more than a decade ago, may be coming back to 
U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 If Americans like the idea, a sleek futuristic version -- complete with 
convertible top and environmental controls -- could be sold in the United 
States as early as 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The German auto maker is tapping into American nostalgia to reverse a sharp 
decline in its overall U.S. sales, which totaled only about 50,000 cars in the 
United States last year -- down from more than 10 times that in 1970 when the 
Beetle was a hot seller. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ray Fladeboe Volkswagen in the Irvine Auto Center, sales manager Woody 
Woodward said he was getting at least 10 calls a day from buyers interested in 
the updated Beetle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be an incredible hit, especially in Orange County," 
said Woodward. "There are a lot of young, successful people here and this is an 
affordable convertible. It's a fun car and there is some nostaglia involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Volkswagen officials parlayed the news about the updated Beetle -- 
called the Concept 1 Cabriolet -- to promote its new Golf and Jetta models at a 
news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clive Varlo, president and chief executive of Volkswagen of America, 
acknowledged the steep decline in Volkswagen sales. It has been "difficult to 
sit and watch -- it's been a great disappointment to me," he said, adding he 
expected the situation to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volkswagen Beetle was pulled from the U.S. market after costly air 
pollution and safety requirements made it obsolete. The company hopes to price 
the latest model between $12,000-$13,000 to make it attractive to U.S. buyers. 
Volkswagen still sells 400 a day in Mexico and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing strategy could fail if the American consumer tires of nostalgia 
before the new Beetle returns, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the question then becomes, 'Will the retro look be totally passe?' "

METALCLAD GETS SAFETY CLEARANCE FOR MEXICO PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metalclad Corp. said Tuesday it had convinced the Mexican state of San Luis 
Potosi that a hazardous-waste treatment plant the company wants to build is 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Metalclad had said in January that it had all the permits to build the plant. 
At that time, the company also said it wanted to consult with local officials 
first to avoid criticism caused by inadvertently ignoring local customs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said Tuesday that it had held three meetings with local officials 
and their scientific advisers since January, and that they had determined that 
the plant would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Metalclad said it is now negotiating with a Mexican construction firm.

ON THE ROAD, AGAIN!; RESIDENTS OF THE REMOTE O.C. FOOTHILLS LEARN TO BE 
CREATIVE IN THEIR COMMUTING ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sweat gleaming on his face as his arms and legs pump rhythmically, Randy Case 
is doing what he always does after completing his commute to Rancho Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of going home at the end of his workday, he heads straight for the new 
Family Fitness Center half a block from his condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stop off here to reduce the stress of driving and my job," he says, pumping 
away on a computerized exercise bicycle. "I drive a lot on my job." 
</P>
<P>
 A computer salesman whose territory spans San Diego to Santa Barbara, Case is 
typically on the road up to four hours a day several days a week. He had just 
driven back from Santa Monica, although lately he's been spending a lot of time 
in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And how does he describe the drive? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mess," he says. "It's very unpredictable. Sometimes you can sail the 
freeway in 45 minutes; other times it might take you two hours. That's the most 
frustrating part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The stress and frustration of commuting are nothing new to Orange County 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of Rancho Santa Margarita and the other new foothill communities 
of South County who drive to work spend a lot more time in their cars than 
their counterparts in other parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although an overwhelming majority of foothill community residents view 
the area as a "very favorable" place to live -- 82% according to The Times 
Orange County Poll -- living in such a remote portion of the county can be 
frustrating.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of foothill community workers drive 30 minutes or more each way: 
44%, or more than double the number of workers throughout the county with such 
long commutes. Only 38% of poll respondents spend 20 minutes or less on the 
road, compared to two out of three in the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that foothill community residents are as likely as other 
employed South County workers to work in South County (61% to 60%), while 29% 
work in North or Central County, 8% work in Los Angeles County and 2% work 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of where they work, traffic congestion during their commute is 
viewed by more than half (56%) of foothill community residents as a problem, 
with 14% calling it a "big problem."  
</P>
<P>
 It's a problem for Tom Broadbent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Santa Margarita resident leaves between 6 and 7 a.m. for his hour 
drive to work in Garden Grove, where he owns a fire extinguisher company. His 
drive home at night typically takes an hour and a half, "sometimes even 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the El Toro "Y," the infamous convergence of the San Diego 
and Santa Ana freeways and the bane of Broadbent's commuting existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very bad," Broadbent says. "Every morning and every night, that's the 
only bad part of the whole commute." 
</P>
<P>
 How bad is the "Y"? 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Susan Lokietz, a Rancho Santa Margarita resident, who says she has 
sat in traffic at the "Y" -- "until you figure out other ways." Her solution? 
"You follow cars that seem to know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "People who live out here know all kinds of ways to avoid the El Toro 'Y,' and 
if I told you, you'd be amazed," she says. "Like you go down Bake to Barranca 
and you get on the 133 and then it dumps you off at the 405 north, or you could 
go onto the 5 north." 
</P>
<P>
 A long commute is the price residents of Rancho Santa Margarita and the new 
foothill communities pay for living in an area known as one of the most 
secluded in Orange County. But for most of these foothill residents, it's worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Case, 31 and single: "I moved out here because I like the area -- it's 
quiet, clean and the houses are affordable." As he sees it, "the commute is the 
only thing that is a drawback." 
</P>
<P>
 Early residents of Rancho Santa Margarita and the surrounding areas remember 
when the only major road in and out of the community was Santa Margarita 
Parkway -- then a two-lane road that took them several miles to congested El 
Toro Road, followed by an additional five miles down to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commute -- at least to the freeway -- has greatly improved in recent 
years and planners say it's going to get even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief has come in increments. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Santa Margarita Parkway was widened to four and then six lanes. (That 
included a second bridge over Arroyo Trabuco parallel to the first, with each 
bridge now handling three lanes in each direction.) That took care of one of 
the worst bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Alicia Parkway was extended from Mission Viejo into Rancho Santa 
Margarita in early 1992, providing residents another access route to Interstate 
5. Indeed, after the opening of Alicia Parkway, a Santa Margarita Co. study 
showed a 25% decline in traffic along Santa Margarita Parkway during peak 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a new stretch of Oso Parkway -- in conjunction with an Antonio 
Parkway extension -- opened a few months later after years of red-tape delays 
and construction setbacks, the transportation milestone was marked with all the 
hoopla of a returning Olympic champion: balloons, a parade and even a blessing 
from a Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating residents enthused that they could not only get to their jobs 
quicker, but they also gained speedier access to hospitals and emergency 
services. Not to mention shopping malls and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "All along we recognized our obligation to get these roads built," says Al 
Hollinden, a consultant who provides transportation planning for the Santa 
Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he says, the Santa Margarita Co. and a dozen other major landowners 
in the area are founding members of the Foothill Circulation Phasing Plan -- a 
$250-million public-private transportation venture that is paying for the 
street expansions and part of the Foothill tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 As various roads and pieces of roads were opened, Hollinden says, "each one of 
them alleviated the traffic to a certain extent." And, he says, "the same thing 
was happening on the other side of El Toro Road as well. Bake Parkway was 
extended, Lake Forest Drive was extended up to Portola Parkway and Portola 
Parkway itself was completed down to El Toro Road." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the extension of Alton Parkway up to Portola Parkway 
will be completed within the next year or two. And Oso Parkway currently is 
being extended from Antonio eastward, which will serve the residents at the 
south end of Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 But the completion of the Foothill tollway to the eastern edge of Rancho Santa 
Margarita sometime before June, 1995, could be the biggest boon of all to 
foothill commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time," Hollinden says, "Santa Margarita people will be like 15 
minutes away from Irvine or less away from the (Irvine) Spectrum, without them 
having to go on to the heavily congested (Interstate) 5 and the (El Toro) 'Y.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Hollinden says, there are 8,000 trips a day on the completed half 
of the tollway, which opened last year. And, as he says, "that's 8,000 trips 
less on the other streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollinden says that "all the parkways and everything are designed for the 
ultimate population, so when the (tollway) is complete, everything will be in 
good shape out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, commuters must be willing to pay 50 cents to enter the tollway. But 
there's no need to convince Lokietz, a CPA who already takes the completed 
portion of the Foothill tollway for her 50-minute commute to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of these fast-track users of the tollway," she says. "It takes 10 
minutes off my overall commute and it's beautiful: You're not in 
bumper-to-bumper traffic or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 There's even good news for those who continue to take El Toro Road or the 
parkways down to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited widening and remodeling of the El Toro "Y," now underway and 
due for completion in the summer of 1996, is expected to carry 400,000 vehicles 
daily. That, Caltrans officials say, is about 100,000 more than it handles 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the popularity of living in South County, there will never be any 
getting away from the long, sometimes frustrating drives for those who have to 
commute to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, says UC Irvine urban sociologist Mark Baldassare, "people in the 
new suburbs have put up with longer and more annoying commutes for the benefits 
of being farther away from the city, and certainly for people who are 
contemplating a move to, say, Oceanside or Moreno Valley, the new towns are 
very attractive alternatives."  
</P>
<P>
 Commuting from the new suburbs in the hills of South County, he says, "is 
going to be a lot shorter and a lot less annoying than commuting from the 
Inland Empire or northern San Diego County, which are the other places that 
would give you that feeling of newness, that sense of being on the edge of the 
suburbs." How the Poll Was Done 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 adult residents in Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de 
Caza, Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and Robinson Ranch was 
conducted Feb. 10-13 on weekday nights and weekend days. A computer-generated 
random sample of telephone numbers was used. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of error for all respondents is plus or minus 4%. For subgroups, 
the error margin would be larger.

values drop, and on many developers, who had to restructure their plans.

 TUESDAY: Families are flocking to the new suburbs, where parents praise the 
many activities for youngsters. But for the teens, there's not much to do.

E-MAIL'S MOUTHPIECE; IN JUST A YEAR, WIRED MAGAZINE HAS BECOME THE GUIDE DOWN 
THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe launched Wired magazine last year, they 
weren't just aiming for a successful publication -- they wanted to make 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized we were in the middle of a (computer) revolution," says Rossetto, 
"but there was no journal for the people making it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The business partners, who met in Europe in 1988, became immersed in 
leading-edge technologies while working on an Amsterdam-based magazine called 
Electric Word. While focusing on such exotic specialties as multilingual 
computing and speech synthesis, they were also watching technology spread into 
everyday life with the growing tide of PCs, modems, camcorders, CD-ROMS and 
other electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Metcalfe: "We began to realize that suddenly this technology was allowing 
people to accomplish things that had been the domain of giant companies with 
big budgets." 
</P>
<P>
 And that led to the vision behind Wired: Although there were 4 million readers 
of computer magazines, what Metcalfe and Rossetto conceived was something 
different -- a lifestyle publication that gave an anthropological context to 
the high-tech revolution. So in 1991, they returned to the United States and 
pulled together a business plan for Wired, which boldly promoted itself as the 
"mouthpiece of the digital revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossetto and Metcalfe then knocked on doors of publishers of mainstream 
magazines ("They looked at us with incredulity and pity," Rossetto says). Then 
they tried computer and consumer publishers without success.  
</P>
<P>
 They finally connected with Nicholas Negroponte, founder of the famed 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab which, for two decades, has 
pioneered research on converging technologies and their impact on individuals.  
</P>
<P>
 "He totally understood what we were doing and signed on, both as an investor 
and a contributor," says Rossetto, 44. "That gave us instant credibility."  
</P>
<P>
 By July, 1991, they had raised enough money to rent a San Francisco loft and 
"worked like maniacs" to bring the magazine to life in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went right to the newsstands with no focus groups, no direct mail and no 
promotional advertising," says Rossetto, who has an MBA from Columbia. "We only 
did a low-cost campaign of bus billboards in major cities that Wired had 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 With a newsstand price of $4.95 (a 12-month subscription is $39.95), Wired's 
circulation has climbed to 110,000 in its first year. The magazine jumped from 
bimonthly to monthly ahead of schedule and it is averaging more than 50 pages 
of ads per issue, Rossetto says. "On all scales, we are around 50% over 
projection."  
</P>
<P>
 It seems Metcalfe and Rossetto were in the right place at the right time. 
Wired's first edition hit the newsstands the day President Clinton's 
inauguration ushered in an Administration whose new buzzwords included 
information superhighway . And for the first time, both a President and a vice 
president had E-mail addresses.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much talk about technology and the mainstream media didn't 
really know where to go," recalls Metcalfe, 32, an international affairs 
graduate of the University of Colorado. "We kind of wandered onto the stage 
with language they (journalists) could understand." 
</P>
<P>
 John Barth latched onto Wired early. He is senior producer of "Marketplace," 
American Public Radio's daily half-hour show produced at USC for more than 200 
stations. Always looking for someone to discuss the economy in everyday 
language, Barth immediately signed up a Wired editor for a monthly interview.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have the same goals we do," Barth says. "Trying to get the big picture 
across to listeners who are buying this confusing electronic stuff and trying 
to understand what this technology is going to do to their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Wired, which one magazine reviewer described as a cross between the 
counterculture's Mondo 2000 and Vanity Fair, has attracted readers in Silicon 
Valley, on Wall Street, in Washington and throughout the entertainment 
industry. Their two largest reader groups are the 18-to-24 Microsoft generation 
and the over-40 crowd, Metcalfe says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being Wired is not an age, it's a mind-set," Metcalfe adds. "We have the 
chairman of the board and his daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the issues of our day which have to do with technology," 
says Managing Editor John Battelle, 28, who had covered the converging 
technologies for trade magazines during the 1980s. "What does it mean? Who are 
its idols and antiheroes? Its economics? What issues are being framed and 
discussed? What issues are being ignored?" 
</P>
<P>
 That information is packaged by Wired's designer, John Plunkett, in a 
break-the-mold graphic style that, Battelle explains, "indicates the way we are 
getting information -- it's coming at us fast and from all directions."  
</P>
<P>
 The magazine broke a lot of rules in typography and design, Battelle says (too 
many, complain some readers, of the battling typefaces), utilizing fluorescent 
inks and an unusual type format. The result is a glossy, techno-trendy package 
that has received both praise for its creativity and grumbling from readers 
sometimes forced to pick through two stories juxtaposed like the teeth of two 
combs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But they find lots to read. While other computer magazines focus on technical 
bits and bytes, Wired offers in-depth reporting, fiction and profiles of the 
"digerati." Its busy pages are packed with insider updates, reviews and gossipy 
features, such as "Jargon Watch" (" Dittoheads : People who are in perfect 
alignment on an issue, an idea or a belief system.") and gossipy "Netsurf" 
bulletins from life on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Wired has featured novelist William Gibson (who first defined cyberpunk ) 
viewing Singapore as "Disneyland with a death penalty," technology guru Michael 
Schrage's examination of the future of advertising, and "Jurassic Park" author 
Michael Crichton's proclamation of mass media as the new dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's December cover story, an in-depth look at video game giant 
Sega's plan to dominate the world of interactive entertainment, spotlighted 
Sonic the Hedgehog as Wired's Man of the Year. And January's first anniversary 
issue was highlighted by "Microserfs," Douglas Coupland's much talked about 
fictional diary that chronicles the routine of computer nerds at the Microsoft 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine examines both the dark side of the wired world (how the 
government is playing Big Brother with your driver's license) and its brighter 
aspects (the real revolution in health care will be technological).  
</P>
<P>
 And its April issue caused a stir in Canada this week with an article 
discussing how Canadians are getting around a media ban on a sensitive murder 
trial by reading about it on the Internet. Concerned that the article itself 
broke the ban, a number of Canadian distributors removed it from the 
newsstands. Charging "free speech violation," Rossetto issued a press release 
announcing that the banned story is available on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 He is editor-publisher and Metcalfe is president of Wired, but, he says, "we 
sort of slop over into each other's territory in hopefully synergistic ways." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their office, in San Francisco's "multimedia gulch" south of Market Street, is 
an open loft one visitor described as "a mix between journalism and nerd 
heaven" with its sophisticated desktop equipment and absence of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do all our work with authors electronically," says Executive Editor Kevin 
Kelly, former editor of the Whole Earth Review. Like Battelle, Kelly had been 
eyeing the world of digital technology as the next frontier when the Wired 
project came along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there was an intellectual niche, and our circulation explosion from 
nothing to more than 100,000 in a year confirmed there is an unsatisfied hunger 
for this kind of information," Kelly says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wired's pioneering extends to electronic communications. With its own presence 
on the Internet, the magazine offers electronic texts of back issues, accepts 
subscriptions by electronic mail ( subscriptions@wired.com ) and encourages 
feedback from readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers also find it easy to interact with authors, Kelly says. "We were the 
first magazine I (know of) to list the on-line addresses of people who write in 
and also all our authors."  
</P>
<P>
 Steven Levy -- author of such books as "Hackers" and writer of the second 
issue cover story, "Crypto-Rebels" -- says he got a huge amount of E-mail 
feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I even heard from people who wanted to ask something about one of my books or 
articles for earlier magazines but just hadn't written to the publisher," he 
says. "You're much more likely to write to someone's E-mail. I'm still getting 
queries about that article, because it's available electronically." 
</P>
<P>
 He likes to write for Wired because the magazine, he thinks, is "really onto 
something. Like Rolling Stone in 1968, they're a little ahead of the culture in 
general." 
</P>
<P>
 Ad Week magazine concurred and named Wired its "Start-up of the Year" winner: 
"Wired got there first, got there smarter, and is going places faster and more 
engagingly than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Staying ahead of the culture can be exhausting. "I'm here eight hours a day, 
which is part-time," Kelly says. "There were people sleeping here for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The original staff of 12 has grown to 40 full-time workers and a handful of 
additional consultants and free-lancers, programmers, writers and editors.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're still short staffed," Rossetto says. "There is nobody scheduling what's 
happening with the media right now and yesterday we had five different 
companies parading through our offices -- everybody from Oprah to Australian 
Television."  
</P>
<P>
 Metcalfe and Rossetto, a couple in personal life as well as business partners, 
live across the Bay in the Oakland Hills with a "bunch of laptops." They try to 
juggle their time between running a magazine and keeping tabs on the 
communications revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spend about 18 hours a day awake, trying to run this stuff down and also 
run a business," Rossetto says. "I spend time on-line talking to all our 
editors and contributors. I read magazines and newspapers. I could literally go 
to conferences all the time -- I'm trying to do the ones that seem the most 
valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 And how does the spokesman for the Wired revolution envision life in another 
decade?  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time predicting what's going to happen in a year," Rossetto 
confesses. "The challenge of this era is to keep on top of it. My sense is that 
everything is only going to get more complicated."

NEW SURGERIES -- JUST FOR MEN; HEALTH: PROCEDURES TO WIDEN AND LENGTHEN THE 
PENIS ARE GAINING FAVOR -- AND SPARKING DEBATE OVER NECESSITY AND SAFETY.

 Between operations at his Culver City office, Dr. Melvyn Rosenstein, dressed 
in surgical greens, leans back and discusses his booming business: penis 
enlargements. 
</P>
<P>
 His interest in male sexuality, he says, stems back to the early 1970s, when 
during his urology residency at New York University School of Medicine he 
learned to do penile implants. But over the years, he learned that there were 
other issues that transcended impotence. Many men believed that their penises 
were not large enough. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, Rosenstein, 54, teamed with marketing expert Ed Tilden, who 
had approached the doctor with a business plan. Since then, Tilden has opened 
and staffed nationwide sales offices, arranged more than 60 radio interviews 
and several TV shows, and launched a massive advertising campaign coast to 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women (Tilden says about 20% of the calls are from females) who 
respond to the ads or hear the talk shows telephone Tilden's sales personnel, 
who invite them in to discuss the operation plus view diagrams and photographs. 
Customers are told they can pay for the operation through a signature loan 
arranged with a finance company. Men who want the operations are sent to 
Rosenstein's medical office for the outpatient surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of patient referrals and the ads -- which cost $200,000 a month -- 
26 sales offices now take more than 2,000 calls a day, consult with 1,500 
patients in person a week and net Rosenstein more than 150 operations a month. 
("They're flying in from all over now," Tilden says. "We just took a credit 
card over the phone from Guam.") 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ed Tilden sits in his sixth-floor executive suite in the Gateway West building 
on Avenue of the Stars. It's here, overlooking the bustling Century City Mall, 
that he has three salesmen fielding about 130 calls a day. 
</P>
<P>
 They purvey penis widening and lengthening operations, two procedures that may 
be on their way to becoming the most controversial cosmetic surgeries since 
breast enlargements. Like breast augmentations, they are sparking serious 
debate in the medical community: Some doctors question not only the necessity 
of the surgeries, but also the aggressive marketing techniques some employ. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also contention over the safety of the procedures -- potential 
physical and psychological risks include nerve injury, embolism and inhibited 
erections. 
</P>
<P>
 And squabbles persist over the absence of studies done on the cosmetic use of 
these surgeries. Proponents argue that there is no proof that they are unsafe, 
while opponents maintain that because they are unproven, they shouldn't be done 
except as investigational procedures under the auspices of an institutional 
review board. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the cross-fire, Tilden's sales team (called "medical assistants") funnels 
patients to Rosenstein, a board-certified urologist and one of at least two 
dozen doctors nationwide performing the operations. But unlike most others, 
this physician -- with Tilden's marketing expertise -- has made enlargements 
his nationally advertised specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 One ad reads, "Most Patients WILL double in size . . . DREAMS DO COME TRUE," 
and gives an 800-number for a free 20-minute consultation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein has performed about 1,500 widening and lengthening procedures on 
about 900 men since 1991. (The package costs $5,900.) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Penis enlargements involve transferring a man's body fat to his penis' shaft 
and shifting part of the penis's root outside the body (about one-third of the 
penis is inside). With penile implants, a device is inserted to aid in 
erection. 
</P>
<P>
 Most doctors who do the operations agree that men want the procedures not 
because their penises are abnormally small or dysfunctional, but simply because 
they want to be bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 And that troubles Dr. Perry Nadig, a University of Texas clinical professor of 
urologic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its only purpose is to cosmetically change a perceived deficiency in body 
image," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "The emotional and psychological implications of the perceived abnormality of 
the penis go far beyond the ground that other types of cosmetic surgery tread 
on," adds Nadig, who helped draft a recent American Urological Assn. statement 
that says the two penis procedures are unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your ears don't match, there may be a good reason for surgery," he says. 
"But for something lurking out of sight most of the time, who are they doing it 
for? These men need psychotherapy, not surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ridiculous," Tilden counters. "Do women get psychotherapy for breast 
enlargements? For liposuction? For rhinoplasty? Anyone should be able to choose 
to satisfy themselves." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Penis-lengthening operations were first done about 50 years ago for boys born 
with retracted or deformed penises. The penis-widening operation is newer. It 
started in 1990 when a Miami plastic surgeon began experimenting on patients; 
others followed suit. Although both cosmetic operations have been conducted as 
a package for about three years, their recent popularity has mobilized doctors 
to express reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frederick Grazer, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Corona del Mar, 
says he informally polled colleagues about the procedures. Reports Grazer: "For 
the most part, nobody in their right mind would support it."  
</P>
<P>
 And urologist E. Douglas Whitehead, director of the Assn. for Male Sexual 
Dysfunction in New York, says most urologists feel "very negatively" about the 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're cutting a ligament (in the lengthening procedure) that's very near 
important blood vessels and nerves," says Whitehead, who is also an associate 
clinical professor of urology at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York. 
"This is a potential danger. And the vast majority who have the surgery are 
very unsatisfied because their expectations are not met by results. I would not 
do it without psychiatric clearance: There may be adverse psychological 
reactions after the operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Rosenstein says. He says his operation does some men "more good than 
10 years of psychotherapy. Why recommend psychotherapy?" he asks. "The only 
criteria are the way the man feels about his size, how he feels in the locker 
room. Psychotherapy doesn't change that, and it's a lot more expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Brian H. Novack, who performs penis 
enlargements, agrees that some men need professional counseling. "(The 
operation) is not a panacea. It's like penicillin: It works, but it doesn't 
cure cancer. In many cases, I certainly recommend psychotherapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave, a patient of Novack's who asked that his real name not be used, doesn't 
think any amount of counseling will change the way most men feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most guys think they're not big enough," he says. "It's purely a man thing -- 
all in his (mind). But once it's in there, it starts to take its toll and the 
only thing that'll cure it is to be larger. There was nothing a psychiatrist 
could've said to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What should a patient expect? 
</P>
<P>
 There are no guarantees with penis enlargements, Rosenstein says, but he says 
90% of his patients add two inches in length and double in diameter. The 
largest length increase, he says, has been more than three inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other doctors who perform the operations, Rosenstein says the newly 
exposed part of the penis is significantly longer whether erect or flaccid. And 
Rosenstein claims -- unlike other doctors -- that his patients retain 90% of 
the added girth, although a "small percentage" do opt to return for additional 
fat transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 Novack says a couple of inches in exposed length is "very rare." Most are in 
the "one-inch range," and most of that gain is only in the flaccid state. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, he performed his first fat injection to a penis and 
began studying lengthening techniques; a year ago, he went to China to work 
with Dr. Long Daochou, a penis-lengthening innovator who Novack says has done 
600 operations since 1984. Novack -- who charges $5,000 for the package -- says 
he has performed 50 penile package operations and 100 fat-transfer operations, 
and has given seminars on the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just at the beginning of what I think is going to be a very popular 
surgery," he says. "But there's a tremendous amount of incorrect information 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most men before the surgery are "completely average" with an erection, Novack 
explains. "But in the flaccid state, there's a lot of retraction. The surgery 
makes the penis hang lower." 
</P>
<P>
 Novack says about 70% of the added fat is reabsorbed within four months of the 
initial transplant. "But after two or three operations, they can eventually get 
one to two inches that'll last in girth." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Miami urologist Harold M. Reed, who has enlarged about 500 penises since 
1986: 
</P>
<P>
 "The best results I get are seen in girth -- I guarantee an inch -- with the 
next best results in the flaccid length and the least consistent in the erected 
length. And this makes men happy, because they're really getting the operation 
out of embarrassment at being exposed to others in the locker room." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rosenstein, Reed has started advertising nationally, a practice that 
until recently was not widely done by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, advertising is not something ethical doctors do, but it's 
widely done now. Most doctors feel their own reputations should be the thing to 
announce themselves, but we're in a new world now," Nadig, of the University of 
Texas, says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of Novack's or Rosenstein's patients were willing to release their real 
names or telephone numbers, but about a dozen called The Times at their 
doctors' requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very skeptical at first," says John, 28, a San Fernando Valley 
firefighter who, after seeing Rosenstein's newspaper advertisement, had the 
operations in July. "After all, I only have one (penis). But it's made a huge 
difference in my whole overall attitude. I feel so confident now." 
</P>
<P>
 John, who says he's confided in no one about his operation, describes himself 
as an "average guy who just wanted to be a little bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 "You think about it subconsciously," he says. "And you take showers in front 
of other guys and wonder about yourself. I just figured, if I could have this, 
then why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 John says the operation increased his penis's erect and flaccid length by 1 
3/4 inches and widened it by about 40%. He hasn't noticed any loss in width 
since the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still getting used to it," he says. "But I definitely feel better about 
myself. It's an internal thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave, who calls himself an "average middle-class guy in his early 30s," says 
there was no specific event that made him start feeling insecure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been told by women that I'm a good lover," he says. "But guys 
just give other guys a hard time and you start to wonder: Am I big enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, he says, he saw Novack on a television show and phoned the 
doctor, who told Dave that he was average when erect and that when flaccid, he 
simply constricted more than other men do. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave paid $5,000 for the operation, which made his penis a "good inch" longer 
in the flaccid state and an inch wider. As Novack predicted, much of the 
initial added girth disappeared, so Dave paid an additional $1,000 for another 
transplant, which "took better." He says he may go back a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more comfortable both outside the house and inside the bedroom," he says. 
"It does wonders for your mind." He pauses. "Size matters. I know it sounds 
ridiculous, but we're men, and that's all there is to it."

 It began as a cart of books pushed by concerned parents and professionals who 
worked with developmentally disabled patients. 
</P>
<P>
 It has grown into a full-service resource center for those who seeks answers 
on mental retardation, autism, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and other disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koch/Young Family Resource Center, at the Frank D. Lanterman Regional 
Center on Wilshire Boulevard, opened its doors at a dedication ceremony last 
Friday. The resource center, which receives money from both Lanterman and the 
state, has been in the works since October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The core of the center is a multimedia library that makes available books, 
videotapes, support groups, on-line computer services and a telephone help line 
to those who want to know more about a particular disability, said coordinator 
Leslye Sneider. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone calls in with any type of question, they can get help within 24 
hours," Sneider said.

SOME CONTEND THAT THE RISKS FROM THE TWO PROCEDURES ARE MINIMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a cosmetic surgery package, the phenomenon of combined penis operations for 
length and width have been popular for only about three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry watcher Gary Griffin, Palm Springs author of a self-published book 
called "Straight Talk About Surgical Penis Enlargement," says that nationally, 
there are more than two dozen doctors performing the surgeries as significant 
parts of their practices. Most are urologists and plastic surgeons; not all are 
board certified. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more doctors jumping on board every month," says Griffin, who also 
publishes a newsletter on the subject. "The procedure is gaining more 
credibility, but it's not the panacea patients imagine and not all doctors have 
skills necessary to provide optimal results. I've even heard that a 
dermatologist tried getting in on the act." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin estimates that 3,000 men have undergone enlargements, most gaining 
less than one inch in exposed length and about an inch in girth. Griffin 
predicts that an additional 5,000 men will have the procedures done this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While techniques differ, the lengthening surgery today is usually some 
variation of the following:  
</P>
<P>
 An incision is made in the pubic region, allowing access to the hidden part of 
the penis's root in the pelvis. (About a third of the penis is inside the 
body.) A portion of the suspensory ligaments that hold the penis at an upright 
angle during erection is snipped; the penis is then pushed out from inside the 
pelvis and re-established via stitching that prevents retraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors close the wound by shifting a flap of the pubic area's skin over 
the penis, accommodating it to its new exposed size. Some later hang weights on 
the penis to help maximize results. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most doctors claim that no one has been seriously damaged by the 
lengthening surgery, they agree that effects have included a 30-degree or more 
drop in the angle of erection, a penis that "pivots" at the base, pubic hair 
growing on the newly exposed front part of the penis and development of scar 
tissue at the suture line.  
</P>
<P>
 And one Miami urologist, Harold M. Reed, says one of his 500 patients suffered 
a serious nerve injury and two others reported inhibited erections three and 
six months following surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Reed: "While generally of low risk, the potential for serious 
complications should deter . . . one who is not well versed in urological 
anatomy." 
</P>
<P>
 The penile-thickening procedure involves suctioning a small amount of fat from 
areas such as the abdomen and injecting it into the penis shaft. (The head, or 
glans, cannot be enlarged.) Uneven absorption of new fat cells can cause 
indentations and lumps -- "refills" may be needed. LESLIE KNOWLTON

EXIT THE GIANT; EUGENE IONESCO, INTERPRETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Sylvie Drake, former theater critic for 
The Times, is now an artistic associate of the Denver Center Theatre Company 
and director of media relations and publications for the Denver Center for the 
Performing Arts. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a jolt to hear the newscaster on National Public Radio announce early 
Monday that playwright Eugene Ionesco had died. 
</P>
<P>
 Not possible. Ionesco was one of the giants, not only for having radically 
changed the face of theater in 1950 with his "The Bald Soprano," but for having 
continued to write such mind-blowers as "Rhinoceros," "The Chairs," "The 
Lesson," "Jack or the Submission," "Exit the King," "Voyage Among the Dead" -- 
all plays that were well ahead of their audiences. There were remarkable prose 
works, too, startling notebooks and journals and at least one screenplay -- for 
a film about human inertia called "La Vase" ("Slime"), in which Ionesco himself 
was the sole, silent player with a group of inquisitive cows. 
</P>
<P>
 We met in the late '70s at USC, after a special showing of "La Vase." I was 
assigned to interview the playwright chiefly because I spoke French and because 
he had successfully managed never to learn English. When he saw the piece in 
the paper the next day, he cut to the chase. "I had someone translate your 
article," he told me. "You quoted me accurately." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, I discovered, a declaration of friendship. After that, when Ionesco 
and his inseparable tiny dynamo of a wife, Rodica, came to the United States, 
he'd often ask for me as his interpreter. We were a good team. He spoke slowly, 
which gave me time to think of the words, and he trusted that I wouldn't 
distort his meaning. I loved the perfect logic of his mind and his dry, 
uncommon wit. As a friend pointed out, without Ionesco there would have been no 
Monty Python. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ionescos loved California and visited often. For a while, we repeated this 
double gambit all over Los Angeles and beyond: when Paul Verdier of Stages 
Theatre held his first Ionesco Festival in the early '80s (Verdier had been a 
performer in the Paris "Bald Soprano"); when the Los Angeles Drama Critics 
Circle held an open forum at which Ionesco spoke and fielded questions; when he 
lectured at the First New York International Festival of the Arts in '88; at 
conferences at USC and at UCLA, where Ionesco took on Edward Albee, while John 
Houseman moderated. (They were dynamite; every time Albee paused to think, 
Ionesco, like an eager schoolboy, impishly offered to take the question for 
him!) 
</P>
<P>
 A diabetic, he was forbidden alcohol except for the occasional glass of wine. 
Once at a party at the Verdiers, I followed him into the kitchen where glasses 
of a rich Bordeaux were waiting to be ushered into the dining room. Gulping 
down two, he grabbed a third. Then turning pointedly to me, he said, "You 
didn't see this," and left the room. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not always fun and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Depression was a perpetual enemy. In New York in '88, he was brooding and 
re-reading Kafka. Fame was important to him, more than he liked it to be. He 
felt overlooked when Samuel Beckett won the Nobel Prize. (He was overlooked, 
shamefully.) On recent visits to his Paris apartment, almost his first words to 
me were, "I think I'm being forgotten in America. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of oblivion was as abiding as his well-publicized fear of death. In one 
way or another, it is the subject of all his plays. Transience and incoherence. 
Panic. The impossibility of communication and coming to terms with life. His 
favorite quotation was Macbeth's "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,/Creeps 
in this petty pace from day to day/To the last syllable of recorded time:/And 
all our yesterdays have lighted fools/The way to dusty death. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 This mantra seldom left him. But even though I saw Ionesco battling his 
anguish and his deteriorating health too many times, another image will stay 
with me longer. It is that of his elation when museum curator Josine 
Ianco-Starrels, the daughter of his good friend, painter Marcel Ianco, came to 
see an exhibition of Ionesco's paintings at Stages. They chatted in Romanian. 
She told him how much she liked what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supreme fulfillment. When she left, Ionesco jubilantly announced: "I 
have made a decision. From now on I will write no more plays. For the next 50 
years, I'm going to paint. And after that, I'm going to dance." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the perfect epitaph. The King is dead. Exit the King.

<P>
 How many days later did he sleep with another (of your) friends?  
</P>
<P>
 -- A "Sally Jessy Raphael" booker on the phone with a potential female guest, 
as shown in an NBC News story about daytime talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let your children read this. It could terrorize them. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a horror story about society's vilest creatures. Steer clear of them 
or else. They're awful. They're selfish. They're untrustworthy. They're evil. 
They're maniacal. They're amoral. They're vicious. They're violent. They're 
your worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 You know who they are. You see them every day. They're the most bloodthirsty 
of animals, the most despicable of minorities. Beware of . . .  
</P>
<P>
 MEN!!! 
</P>
<P>
 What's especially insidious is that the little boys you see, even the sweetest 
cherubs of the lot, will grow up to be them. 
</P>
<P>
 Men lie. Men cheat. Men run around on their spouses. Men rape and pillage. Men 
murder. Men beat their wives. Men beat their kids. Men sexually molest. Name 
it, men do it. 
</P>
<P>
 All men? Just about. You learn this from watching daytime talk shows. Day 
after day, these profitable, produced-on-a-shoestring hours symbolically do to 
men what Lorena Bobbitt did to John. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that the dysfunction they regularly focus on extends to all areas of 
life, creating the broad impression that just about everyone is in conflict and 
miserable, except the inevitable psychologists and other experts -- usually 
women -- who are brought on to advise the deviant misbehavers and their victims 
how to live better lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, men are not the only ones getting clobbered. There are other bashees. 
A recent topic on Maury Povich's show on KCAL-TV Channel 9: "Women Imprisoned 
for Murder." A recent headline from Montel Williams' show on KCOP-TV Channel 
13: "Girls Who Beat Their Mothers." Another from "Jane Whitney" on NBC: 
"Freeloading Relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 And hardly a week passes without a talk-show dose of battling lesbians or 
battling nuns or epic-breasted women getting screamed at by other women who 
accuse them of willingly becoming sex objects. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one thread connecting daytime talk shows when it comes to gender, 
though, it is the relentless depiction of males as victimizers, and, by 
extension, the portrayal of women as eternal, helpless victims. On just about 
any given day, there is a talk show somewhere beating up on men. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a given that humankind would not be as screwed up if not for men, and 
that the globe's historic patriarchy of power has often shoved us to the edge 
of disaster. Moreover, perpetrators of violence in some of the today's hottest, 
bloodiest spots -- from South Africa to Bosnia-Herzegovina to the 
Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- are almost 
always triggermen, not triggerwomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, maledom is hardly the monolith of wickedness that you'd believe from 
watching much of daytime TV. As the daytime audience is predominantly female, 
these shows obviously believe that what follows is exactly what women on the 
home front yearn to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for example, found "The Montel Williams Show" doing a two-parter on 
a man claiming on the air to have raped more than 90 prostitutes (although he 
later issued a denial to police). During a station break, the show advertised a 
coming topic: "Women Confront Men Who Date-Raped Them." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, KCBS-TV Channel 2's "Geraldo" last week was headlining "Women Who 
Take Back Their Unfaithful Husbands." Viewers of "The Bertice Berry Show" on 
KTTV-TV Channel 11 were introduced to "Murder and Rape on College Campuses." 
Guess who was doing the murdering and raping? 
</P>
<P>
 On to last week's "Jane Whitney" and "Former Wives Confront a Bigamist." Then 
to "Sally Jessy Raphael" on KNBC-TV Channel 4 and "A Couple Believes Their 
Son-in-Law Murdered Their Daughter." Then to KCOP-TV's "Jenny Jones" and 
"Indecent Proposals Lead to Divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 As for this week's monstrous males, Monday found Oprah Winfrey commiserating 
on KABC-TV Channel 7 with a woman whose daughter was clobbered by a teen-age 
boy: "This is a boy you trusted?" Male trustworthiness is obviously an oxymoron 
in this environment. After the commercial break on "Oprah," viewers met the 
mother of a 15-year-old girl fatally shot by her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, KABC viewers saw this promo: "Is your dad causing your man 
problems? Watch the next 'Oprah.' " And Sally Jessy was plenty mad at "Men Who 
Teach Their Sons to Be Sexist." Nor was she letting up today, scheduling 
"Pregnant Women Abused by Their Spouses." No, not gay spouses. That was another 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geraldo," by the by, was tackling "Teen Mothers and Deadbeat Fathers" this 
week. Bertice Berry was back with "Four Divorcees Discuss Their Common Former 
Husband," "Jane Whitney" promised lots of heat with "Women Who Believe Their 
Mates Left Them Because They Were Pregnant" and Montel Williams was scheduled 
to deliver the goods on "Gigolos." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, just who is behind all of this? Who controls the television 
industry that encourages this nasty, spiteful daytime programming that so often 
unfairly targets one gender? Who runs nearly all of the stations that run these 
programs and profit from this bullying of males? The familiar villains. 
</P>
<P>
 Men.

Q&A WITH JOE PESCI; HOLLYWOOD'S LITTLE BIG MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRONWEN HRUSKA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cloud of aftershave and cigar smoke announces Joe Pesci is about to enter 
his suite at the Regency Hotel. He wears a black shirt, black slacks and, 
around his neck, a hint of gold. At 51, Pesci looks more like a "GoodFellas" 
mobster than a Hollywood star.  
</P>
<P>
 And while he's played opposite Robert De Niro in "Raging Bull," won an Oscar 
as Tommy DeVito in "GoodFellas," and broke the bank in both "Home Alone" 
movies, he says his favorite character may be his latest -- Jimmy Alto -- a 
never-has-been actor trying, and failing, to make his mark.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy Hollywood," which opens today, marks his 18th movie, but Pesci says 
he's avoided the trappings of a celebrity lifestyle. He lives in New Jersey, 
and has a few choice words for the studio system that made him a star. "The 
casting system sucks," says Pesci, who will appear as a homeless person living 
below Harvard's Widener Library in "With Honors" next month. His voice is a 
softened version of that throaty New York streetspeak his fans usually 
associate with the four-letter words his characters spew.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is it about "Jimmy Hollywood" that touched a nerve in you? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It shows what's really going on in Hollywood. People still think it's 
a magical place where dreams are made. Actually, it makes for broken dreams. 
It's almost impossible for a young actor today to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When did you come to Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In the early '70s. I'd been acting since I was 5. My father drove a 
forklift truck for GM/Chevrolet, then he worked in the Budweiser brewery at 
night. He felt I had some kind of talent because I was brazen and had nerve. He 
started schlepping me back and forth for auditions and lessons between New York 
and Newark, N.J., where we lived. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happened in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Everybody who goes out there has this dream about becoming a movie star, 
getting their picture on the cover of a magazine, driving a Rolls Royce -- 
myself included. It wasn't until I came back (East) -- till I quit -- that I 
realized I just wanted to be a working actor, and I wound up being successful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've got the roles flooding in these days. What was it like for you back 
then trying to get parts in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There were so many rejections. I remember one time I went in for a part, it 
was just like that scene in "Jimmy Hollywood." I went in and the girl was 
handing me these applications without even looking up. They never look at you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How'd you react when she wouldn't pay attention to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was trying to find out if the reading was on schedule. The casting woman 
only said, "Sign your name, sit down." She gave very rude, snappy answers. I 
finally told her to pick up her fat ugly head and look at me. She looked up, 
horrified. I said, "There, that's better." Then I looked at her and said, "Oh, 
maybe it's not." I was really, really angry. Then I told her to get up off her 
fat ass and find out if I could read when I was scheduled. The director and 
producer came out and said, "You'd better leave." I kicked the table and walked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Needless to say, you left Hollywood shortly after that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You let everybody (expletive) on you and you lose any drive and 
self-confidence you have. That's the worst thing you can do to an actor. So 
yeah, I quit, I walked away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you do after you left? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I went to Las Vegas, lived with a friend and worked for a mason, mixing 
cement and carrying blocks. From there I went to the Bronx, where I was 
managing an Italian restaurant and singing at tables. Then I got a call from 
Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese asking me to read for "Raging Bull." They'd 
seen me in (the B-movie) "Death Collector" and liked me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel like you've been typecast by Hollywood ever since you played 
Jake La Motta's brother in that movie? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure, Hollywood tries to typecast you right away. Whatever was successful 
for them, whatever films make money for them, that's what they want you to do. 
But I try to jump around a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What have you liked more, drama or comedy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I like drama, because in drama there's everything anyway. Light comedy 
isn't bad. But I don't think I'll be doing any more slapstick. De Niro and I 
may do something again with Scorsese. Then probably another "Cousin Vinny." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tommy DeVito is one of your most famous characters -- he's ruthless, 
paranoid and completely on the edge. Do you have any of Tommy's explosiveness 
in real life? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think everyone has that thing where they can explode. Why do you think 
the vigilante movies Charles Bronson made were so popular? I try not to let it 
happen in my real life. But when it comes I will say what's on my mind 
immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've convinced a lot of people with your mobster characters. In fact an 
article in the current (and final) issue of Spy magazine accuses you of being 
"business partners" with Joe Denti, whom the author, John Connolly, calls a 
member of New York's Lucchese crime family. 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not true at all. My name does not appear on anything. Joe Denti was 
nice to me when we worked in the Bronx in a restaurant together. I think the 
gentleman in question has been crime-free for a long time. If he's doing 
anything, I certainly don't know about it. The company he's affiliated with, 
Metropolitan Productions -- they're trying to produce pictures. He came up with 
a project I liked that I wanted to do. That may be the affiliation they were 
talking about. I don't have any reason to get involved in any wrong-doing. And 
I don't see anything wrong with helping someone who helped me who's been a 
friend for long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your life like now -- do you feel comfortable in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not into that Hollywood stuff. I don't need to go to parties anymore. 
It kills my whole night. When I was trying to get somewhere, I went to all the 
parties, trying to meet people who could get me a part. Now people are trying 
to meet me so I can introduce them to somebody who can get them a part. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So what do you do with your spare time? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My wife (Marty) and I -- we're divorced but we're back together now -- we 
have a quiet lifestyle. We live on the Jersey shore. I don't have a Rolls-Royce 
-- I don't even have a car. When I go to L.A. for work, I rent a car and a 
place to stay. But for the winter, L.A. is better -- for golf, which is a big 
thing in my life as I'm getting older.

ACADEMY, NETWORKS AGREE TO ROTATE EMMY AWARDS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to quell network animosity over who gets to broadcast the annual 
prime-time Emmy Awards, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and the four 
major broadcast networks have agreed to rotate the awards show beginning next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend 364 days a year beating up on each other and we decided we could 
take one day to unite and pay tribute to television," Ted Harbert, president of 
ABC Entertainment, told a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came in response to the protests of executives at CBS, NBC 
and Fox, who were outraged at the TV academy's four-year exclusive telecast 
agreement signed last year with ABC. At the time, the academy went for the 
money, as ABC's bid for exclusive rights was about $2 million more than what 
the academy would have received with a rotating arrangement.  
</P>
<P>
 In response, the other three networks boycotted last year's Emmy show and each 
network refused to buy ads in the academy's Emmy magazine. They also scheduled 
competitive programs opposite ABC's Emmy broadcast in an effort to dilute its 
ratings.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Emmys are a celebration of television and common sense dictates that they 
should be presented by all the networks," said Rich Frank, president of the 
academy. "Taking ABC's offer last year was very good for the academy, but not 
very good for the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank would not disclose the financial terms of the new deal, saying only that 
the academy can live very well with it.  
</P>
<P>
 ABC will broadcast the Emmys this year, on Sept. 11, under the deal signed 
last year. The rotating schedule will begin in September, 1995 -- moving from 
Fox to ABC to CBS to NBC.

STATE ECONOMY IN RECOVERY, UCLA FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After California's dispiriting slide into the depths of recession, a 
long-awaited recovery has finally begun, according to a UCLA analysis to be 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of a slow recovery is the first by a prominent forecasting group 
that the state's deepest slump in six decades has ended and a fragile expansion 
is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the analysis may signal a broader shift in perceptions about 
California's economy in light of surprising recent data on jobs and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a revision to be made public Friday, the state Employment Development 
Department now estimates that California added payroll jobs in January and 
February -- the first consecutive two-month gain since mid-1990. Similarly, 
California shared in a national jump in consumer confidence in March, it was 
reported Tuesday, although the state level remains lower than the nation's. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you read this, California will be in recovery!" exclaimed 
economists Larry J. Kimbell and Tom K. Lieser in the new UCLA report, which 
cites earthquake rebuilding aid as a short-term catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while Orange County economists agreed with the UCLA analysis that the 
state's economy may be in recovery, they said the Southern California economy 
has much further to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the state as a whole, it may be correct to say it's in recovery, but 
that's definitely not correct for Los Angeles County and we're certainly not 
going to have job growth of any consequence in Orange County this year," said 
Walter Hahn, an economist with Kenneth Leventhal & Co., an accounting firm. 
"Basically, Southern California as a whole will probably lose jobs this year 
while the rest of the state will do OK." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other limits to the enthusiasm, however: Job gains are expected to 
be frustratingly slow and uneven in the emerging recovery, and the aerospace 
squeeze will continue. Thousands more high-paying defense jobs will vanish in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even a lukewarm upturn would be a striking shift from the four-year 
barrage of bleak economic news, a traumatic period in which the state lost 
between 600,000 and 800,000 jobs. For the first time since 1990, the UCLA 
analysis says, Californians have reason to anticipate an increase in jobs, 
incomes, retail sales and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This solidifies trends we saw at the end of 1993; trends like a drop in 
unemployment, increased home sales and consumer confidence up. I think what 
you're seeing now is the beginning of the growth cycle," said Dennis Aigner, 
dean of the UC Irvine Graduate School of Management. "Orange County has always 
been a bit of a favored area in this recession. It's not as if we've been 
immune but we have not been hit to the extent Los Angeles has." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Aigner predicted Orange County was still in for some economic pain as 
continued defense restructuring and the closure of El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station will put more people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "While there are still all of these positive signs of the recovery there is 
still the issue of the base closures," Aigner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county must work to retain its businesses, he added, noting that a UC 
Irvine survey shows an increasing number of Orange County-based companies are 
considering relocating. In 1992, only 20% of the local companies were 
considering moving, Aigner said, but by last October that number had increased 
to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's surely not a good sign for Orange County or the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make their case, economists at the UCLA Business Forecasting Project 
selected from a growing if tentative array of evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Payroll jobs rose 15,900 in February and 7,300 in January -- a month in 
which officials earlier had counted a decline, according to state Employment 
Development Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business failures in January, as gauged by Dun & Bradstreet, fell 23.3% in 
California compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sales of existing homes have been running about 20% higher than year-ago 
levels, a rally that could boost purchases of everything from curtains to 
carpets to kitchen cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've changed our thinking," said Adrian Sanchez, a regional economist at Los 
Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, which is revising its forecast in light 
of the improved economic news. "California is clearly close to a recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 The public mood is improving, albeit from very low levels, according to a 
survey released Tuesday by the privately funded Conference Board. The report 
found that consumer confidence in the Pacific region, largely reflecting 
California, jumped a healthy 6.8 points on the board's index, the same increase 
registered nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, economists have generally viewed the California economy as having 
hit bottom, almost like a sunken ship creeping along the ocean floor but too 
weak to climb back up. 
</P>
<P>
 A recovery, while a somewhat inexact term for a state economy, suggests steady 
lift in a range of economic gauges, particularly jobs. Some economists, such as 
the UCLA forecasters, had expected a slow ascent to begin in the second half of 
the year; other analysts had not anticipated a revival before year's end or 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, not everyone is persuaded that a bona fide upturn is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to drink a bottle of Dom Perignon just yet," said Joseph A. 
Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "Companies are 
still laying off people and going out of business. This is not a recovery in 
the real sense of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Key evidence will become available Friday, when March job totals are reported, 
showing whether the gains of January and February have been sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Orange County, job expansion won't take place till at least the third 
quarter of this year," said Esmael Adibi, director of the Center for Economic 
Research at Chapman University. "Then we will start to add jobs to the local 
payrolls." 
</P>
<P>
 Economists also are monitoring the recent sharp rise in interest rates. Low 
rates have boosted the state and national economies by making houses, autos, 
factory equipment and other items cheaper to buy on credit. "I think they're a 
major wild card," Sanchez said of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the UCLA forecast, the fledgling upturn will become more apparent 
in the coming months as personal income -- a broad measure that reflects 
re-employment, added working hours and more -- grows in the 5% range, a pace it 
may maintain for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales also are expected to improve this year. The state's jobless rate, 
which has been hovering in the 9% to 10% range, should decline gradually to 
7.6% by 1996, the UCLA researchers estimate, with more than nine out of 10 new 
jobs in construction, trade and services. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp rise in home building also will help the economy, analysts said. The 
state's battered home building industry appears to have hit bottom last June, 
when new homes were started at an annual rate of about 80,000. By December and 
January, the pace had edged up to 90,000 -- still a far cry from the booming 
rate of a quarter-million in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anecdotal evidence we're getting from the builders suggests there's quite 
a bit in the pipeline," said Ted Gibson, principal economist at the state 
Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Such areas as tourism, recreation and international trade will be among the 
sources of rising employment, the UCLA report said. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate is expected to exceed the nation's through the late 
1990s, however. In the next couple of years, more unemployed people will leave 
the state, drop out of the labor force and settle for jobs that pay less than 
their previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, the Jan. 17 earthquake may help revive the regional economy, 
adding 20,000 jobs in the next year, according to the UCLA analysis. It might 
also accelerate a drop in unemployment, partly through new jobs and partly 
through the more painful measure of people moving away. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer term, the study said, the quake's effect on Southern California's 
economy will be very small but negative, as some businesses choose to stay out 
of the region, cutting job growth by about 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seismic risks in Los Angeles and California in general are well known, 
but the earthquake serves to remind investors of those risks," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis is not the first time that UCLA's forecasters have stood apart 
from the pack. A series of gloomy forecasts during the recession by Kimbell's 
predecessor, David Hensley, upset many in the state's business Establishment, 
although the dramatic forecasts proved on target.

 Amid plates of tacos, enchiladas and rounds of Mexican beer, the meeting was 
called to order. Assembled were a United Parcel Service truck driver who can

Hawk, a self-described "troublemaker" from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly your run-of-the-mill environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 But between forkfuls of frijoles, the 35 men and women who came to Dana Point 
a year ago from Oceanside to as far north as Pacifica formed California's first 
Coalition of Surfing -- an umbrella for 17 surf clubs more intent on fighting 
for environmental causes than scouting the next kegger party. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the proceedings was a smiling Jake Grubb. As executive director of 
the Surfrider Foundation, a San Clemente-based beach conservation group, Grubb 
played a key role in shaping the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, as the foundation prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 
August, the coalition has become the foundation's chief ally in exercising a 
unique and powerful brand of environmental activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have six people in an office in San Clemente dictating what's going 
to be done in California and the nation," Grubb said. "Our future calls for us 
getting a network of environmental watchdogs. And, the only way we can do that 
is by building coalitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing the new coalition wave is Eugene Eudaly, 47, a Laguna Beach 
cabinetmaker and Surfrider Foundation member, who was selected to head the 
coalition. "We can now have our own lobby group. We think it could become a 
blueprint for beach activism that can take the Surfrider Foundation into the 
21st Century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Can it be that 10 years have rolled by since the Surfrider Foundation first 
emerged while opposing plans to drain a nearby creek that would have ruined the 
famed Malibu surfing beach? 
</P>
<P>
 It began, said founder Glenn Hening, 43, to help improve what was then 
surfing's outlaw image, which made surfers "one step above bikers." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that struck me back then," said Hening in a recent 
interview from his Oxnard home, "was that some biker organizations were doing 
Toys for Tots projects, something good for the community. And I told myself 
surfers never do anything like that. But we should." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Surfrider has 27,000 members in 21 chapters in seven coastal states 
including Hawaii, said Grubb. It has affiliates in Australia, Japan, France, 
England and Canada. It has an environmental issues team that sends experts on 
conservation, coastal law and biology to testify before Congress. It has waged 
successful court battles against major polluters. And it has begun Respect the 
Beach, a touted program that has recruited hundreds of high school students to 
test ocean waters for fecal bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfers are so blessed because of what they've been able to enjoy in the 
ocean," said Hening. "If they don't do something to maintain the ocean for 
future generations, they won't get through St. Peter's gate because Peter will 
be saying, 'You can't come in, because you didn't leave anything for future 
generations.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This call to conscience has been heeded. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Eudaly, who is also president of the 200-member Doheny Longboard 
Assn., said Doheny surfers donated $2,500 from their dues to Surfrider. He 
added, "We all share that sense of responsibility, that if we don't give 
something back, then who will?" 
</P>
<P>
 Can it be that a maturing process has mellowed these once hellbent 
Californians whose main mission in life was to ride primo waves? What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "We got old," said Pierce Flynn, Surfrider's 40-year-old communications 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 37% of Surfrider's membership are primarily surfers in their 30s and 
40s. The membership supports about 75% of Surfrider's annual $500,000 budget. 
The group relies on private grants and individual donors for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of its members were weaned on surfing during the '60s. It was a time of 
rollicking good fun, long boards and Dick Dale music. But the old VW vans with 
psychedelic paint are long gone, replaced by minivans with cruise control. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn describes the older, ahem, mature surfer as surfing's new vanguard of 
eco-surfers. A look at Surfrider's membership finds many teachers, chemists, 
biologists and lawyers -- people with families and the economic means to make a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, many surfers would drive to the ocean and park. If they saw an 
oil sheen or untreated sewage, they would surf nonetheless. Irritated skin and 
hacking coughs came with the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they're more likely to report the pollution. Not only has this approach 
caught on, and is encouraged by Surfrider and many other beach conservation 
groups, but Surfrider has added an environmental militancy to the mix. If 
polluters refuse to shape up, it could mean a legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am quite aware of the (Surfrider) group," said Port Hueneme City Council 
member Dorill B. Wright, a longtime member of the California Coastal 
Commission. "They have appeared before us on many occasions, generally with 
helpful and constructive things to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 When Surfrider joined with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and won a 
major court battle two years ago, Flynn said, it prompted then-EPA 
Administrator William K. Reilly to remark, "The EPA likes surfers. We consider 
them the new indicator species." 
</P>
<P>
 ("Basically, they're watching us to see if we mutate," Flynn said.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I did say that. That's true," Reilly said this week, laughing. The veteran of 
the Bush Administration is now a fellow at Stanford University. "Surfers are in 
the elements every day. No one is as intensively exposed to the elements as 
surfers -- air, water, pollutants and all the rest. They often tell us about 
pollution and things we don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 10 years, some of Surfrider's activities have included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Helping to persuade Chevron in 1993 to extend an outfall emissions pipe to 
two-thirds of a mile offshore. Previously, the pipe dumped directly into the 
surf zone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joining with the EPA and winning a $5.8-million settlement in fines -- the 
second-largest Clean Water Act lawsuit in U.S. history -- in 1991 against two 
pulp mills in Humboldt County. The mills also had to spend $50 million to 
reduce toxic discharges from their oceanfront pulp mills near Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 * Helping to block a proposed marina that the foundation believed would have 
destroyed a historic natural wetlands as well as miles of sandy coast at Bolsa 
Chica State Beach in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaigning to divert a major Los Angeles storm drain, which had been 
polluting the beach and forcing its closure for years, into a sewer system for 
proper treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating a Blue Water Task Force program that includes Adopt-A-Beach, a 
storm drain stenciling program that warns the public against dumping toxics 
that spill into the ocean, and recruiting school students to test ocean water 
for pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing a restoration proposal for San Juan Creek in Dana Point to 
prevent continued beach closures from sewage spills during heavy rains. The 
project, if successful, can become a blueprint for restoring wetlands across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bringing a complaint before a state regional water quality control board 
alleging that the city of San Diego underreported a massive pipeline leak that 
spilled untreated sewage between December, 1992, and June, 1993. The city was 
fined $830,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Lacter, a spokesman for Portland-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp., said the 
corporation has acquired a healthy respect for Surfrider. In 1991, 
Louisiana-Pacific and Simpson Paper Co. agreed to pay nearly $5.8 million in 
fines and stop polluting the ocean off Humboldt County because of the lawsuit 
brought by the EPA and Surfrider. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were once an adversary, I hope not anymore," Lacter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said Surfrider had documented more than 40,000 violations of the federal 
Clean Water Act. The agreement was the second-largest ever under the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfrider officials also point with pride to the fact that Louisiana-Pacific 
has stopped bleaching its pulp with chemicals laced with dioxins and has 
eliminated use of any toxic chlorine, the first pulp mill in North America to 
do so. Simpson Paper has since shut its plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark settlement not only put Surfrider on the map as an environmental 
group to be reckoned with, but also nearly caused its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the settlement called for Surfrider to receive $350,000 to make 
environmental improvements in Humboldt and $500,000 in legal fee awards. The 
problem emerged when Surfrider's attorney split the fees with another law firm 
that had helped on the case -- a move that caused a storm on the Surfrider's 
board of directors and jeopardized the organization's private, nonprofit 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 "For two years, our board haggled over this and it was just one fight after 
another," Grubb said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Surfrider hasn't completed the improvements even though it has 
been 2 1/2 years since both companies created the $350,000 fund. The original 
plan was to build solar-powered showers and a conference center at the beach. 
But Grubb said local surfers did not want those two projects and Surfrider 
hasn't been able to come up with good alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working with the Bureau of Land Management on alternatives and 
we're trying to satisfy Louisiana-Pacific, because according to the court 
settlement, we need to work as partners," Grubb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, Surfrider's communications director, said it marked a turning point. On 
one side were members of Surfrider's board who still thought the group was just 
a bunch of surfers. On the other side were board members who saw the 
organization growing into a nationally respected conservation group with legal 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visionaries won out," Flynn said. "For us, it was time for surfing to 
grow up."

CSUN GARAGE BUILDER WINS COUNTY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the first projects of its kind since the Northridge earthquake, the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday awarded the first phase of a 
$19-million contract for a high-rise parking garage to a firm that built the 
Cal State Northridge parking facility that crumbled in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But executives of the winning bidder, A. T. Curd Constructors, and county 
officials say the new project will be significantly different from the CSUN 
facility, strengthened by lessons learned in the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't in good conscience build them like we used to, knowing what we have 
learned in the Northridge earthquake," company President Andrew Curd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which will oversee construction of a seven-level, 3,000-car 
garage at County-USC Medical Center, was the lowest of four bidders on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Stewart, director of the county's Internal Services Department, which 
oversees awarding of construction contracts, said all four firms that bid for 
the contract had been involved to some degree in projects that suffered damage 
in the Northridge temblor, although some firms disputed that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Curd said that after the Northridge quake, his engineers have redesigned the 
county project to improve the flexibility of columns and strengthen walls, two 
lessons learned from the collapse of the CSUN garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are significant differences from any (garage) we've done in the past," 
Curd said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the CSUN garage, square supporting columns gave way because they were too 
brittle to hold up under the pounding and swaying brought on by the earthquake, 
engineers found. 
</P>
<P>
 Curd said the columns to be used at the County-USC garage will be of an 
octagonal shape and with significantly greater steel reinforcement. Curd said 
engineers estimate that the new design will enable the structure to withstand 
four to five times more movement than the old design. The new garage will also 
have reinforcing shear walls to give the structure greater strength, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the changes are not required under the building code, Curd said they 
are being integrated into the project at his company's expense, which he 
estimated to be several hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said that to ensure that the garage will have the latest improvements 
and design innovations, the plans will be submitted to two independent peer 
review committees. The design reviews will also be coordinated with the state's 
safety design experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the best-studied parking structure in the history of the Western 
United States," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, officials for the state university system adopted changes in 
construction policies that require the same design improvements being included 
in the County-USC project. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Ross, president of the Structural Engineers Assn., whose members have 
extensively studied damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake, said the planned design 
changes should make a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said a second large parking structure on the CSUN campus, which sustained 
little damage, had shear walls. That, Ross said, may have made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,500-space CSUN garage that was heavily damaged in the earthquake had 
neither shear walls nor extra steel reinforcing in its vertical columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural engineers have long said buildings with shear walls are generally 
more resistant to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But designers are often reluctant to use them because they make the buildings 
less open, and can cause security and ventilation problems.

ANOTHER PR NIGHTMARE FOR O.C.'S TOURIST TRADE; TRAVEL: OFFICIALS WILL TRY TO 
REASSURE JAPANESE IN WAKE OF SLAYINGS. STRATEGY MAY INVOLVE A DISTANCING FROM 
L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Having endured the effects of riots and earthquakes, Orange County tourist 
officials say they are frustrated by the battering their $4.8-billion industry 
has taken following problems in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the latest setback -- the vicious slayings of two Japanese students 
in the Los Angeles seaside community of San Pedro -- local tourism executives 
say they need to take immediate steps to reassure Japanese tourists as well as 
forge a long-term, countywide tourism strategy -- possibly one that is more 
independent of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to emphasize how safe Orange County is, and we have the figures to 
back it up," said Diane Baker, president of the Huntington Beach Conference and 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Though San Pedro is a dozen miles away from the Orange County border, the 
killing has tarred all of Southern California, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farther you get from anyplace, the more the geography gets clouded," said 
Bruce Baltin, who heads hotel services for PKF Consulting in Los Angeles. The 
county could try to sever the connection with Los Angeles in tourists' minds, 
he said, but "it just takes lots of marketing dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 These issues are sure to be at the forefront at an upcoming countywide tourism 
summit being organized by Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and William G. Steiner. 
"In Orange County, we have created a safer atmosphere for tourists as well as 
business, and we need to find an effective way to carry that message," Vasquez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While long-term strategy is important, local business owners say the immediate 
concern is the Japanese market. With the world recoiling at the news of the 
killings, they fear that tourism may take yet another drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Orange County may be better prepared this time, since it has been 
gradually trying to move out of its larger neighbor's shadow -- particularly 
with the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Los Angeles riots in 1992, more Japanese tourists have been asking 
to stay nights in Orange County where they perceive they are safer, according 
to Shigeto (Chuck) Mayumi, who directs package tour planning for Japan Travel 
Bureau International in Los Angeles, a large agency that specializes in 
vacation packages for traveling Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "More are going directly to Anaheim," he said. And with the rising popularity 
of team sports like professional hockey in Japan, more Japanese are becoming 
aware of Anaheim's distinct identity because of the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, foreigners are increasingly taking West Coast package tours that 
circumvent the usual port of entry, Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Hilton and Towers, for instance, is involved in marketing packages 
to Asians that make San Francisco their gateway to the United States. From 
there, they fly to Las Vegas and Orange County through John Wayne Airport. Some 
may never set foot in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore the program, the hotel is hosting 80 top Japanese travel agents 
next month, and chances are they will see very little of Orange County's 
northern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a way of combatting all the media problems we are having in Southern 
California," said Andrew Fransen, the Hilton's Japanese-speaking director of 
leisure sales. 
</P>
<P>
 While they do not show up in the greatest numbers of any nationality -- that 
distinction usually goes to the Canadians -- Japanese visitors are highly 
prized because they are a major market and tend to spend heavily. The average 
Japanese tourist stays seven to 10 days in the United States and shells out 
$3,000 to $4,000, according to Elaine Cali, spokeswoman for the Anaheim Area 
Visitor & Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the 800,000 Japanese who visit California stop off at Disneyland. 
"That doesn't mean they all stay in Orange County, but a good portion of them 
spend at least a night here," Cali said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local hotels routinely offer native meals, hosts and other enticements to 
attract Japanese visitors. Some have even put together wedding packages for 
Japanese couples who elope to escape their country's ritualistic -- and 
expensive -- marriage process. 
</P>
<P>
 So the last thing that local tourism executives want is the kind of media 
attention in the Japanese media that has befallen Los Angeles since the weekend 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito, both 19, outside a San Pedro 
supermarket have struck deeply in Japan, where violence is rare and guns are 
strictly controlled. Though Orange County had its own disaster last year -- the 
brush fires in Laguna Beach that razed hundreds of homes -- it never was viewed 
as a personal safety threat to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dravinski, general manager of the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, said that 
the media tidal wave rolling from San Pedro to Japan is insurmountable. He said 
that individual hotels need get hold of their customers and reassure them that 
all is well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Area Visitor & Convention Bureau, which has a $4.5-million annual 
advertising budget, has yet to launch the kind of a fax counterattacks to 
travel agents in the wake of the San Pedro killings that usually follow 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the right mix of local and regional appeal is tricky, Cali said. "It's 
a real thin tightrope you walk on those issues. We are close to L.A. (but) you 
don't want to be interpreted as taking advantage of someone else's 
disadvantages."

SLIPPERY 'SEAMAN'; NAVY FROGMEN ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE A TRAINED SEA LION THAT 
WENT AWOL IN CHANNEL ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy launched an all-out rescue mission off the Ventura County coast 
Tuesday for one of its own -- an injured California sea lion named Pumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea lion, one of 125 sea mammals trained to recover dummy explosives 
during exercises by the Navy's explosive ordnance detachment in San Diego, went 
AWOL during a routine training mission last week in the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy air and sea search, Navy personnel Tuesday found Pumpkin on 
Gull Island south of Santa Cruz Island, said Navy spokesman Tom LaPuzza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of our sea lions and we're responsible for it," LaPuzza said. "We 
won't leave it behind." 
</P>
<P>
 The sea lion, a male, was apparently injured in a fall from a 25-foot cliff 
when Navy rescuers approached the frightened mammal from the air. Rescuers 
stabilized the injured seal Tuesday afternoon and were awaiting an airlift from 
a boat off Gull Island when the 17-year-old sea lion broke loose from its 
harness and dived back into the sea, LaPuzza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frogmen remained on the scene, attempting to coax Pumpkin back to the boat 
with bait. "At last report, Pumpkin was cavorting 300 yards off the shore," 
LaPuzza said. "He apparently was not injured as seriously as we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The rescuers' task was complicated after the harness -- equipped with a 
locational beacon -- came off, LaPuzza said. The harness is designed to break 
free after extended exposure to sea water so that escaped animals can survive. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPuzza said the Navy trains its sea mammals not to forage for food on their 
own, and that the frogmen hoped Pumpkin would eventually respond to the offer 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pumpkin is recaptured, he will be returned to the Naval Command Control and 
Ocean Surveillance Center at Point Loma in San Diego for treatment by Navy 
veterinarians, LaPuzza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sea lions are weird creatures," LaPuzza said. "They get a wild hair every 
once in awhile, go off and check out the local natives -- the females mostly." 
</P>
<P>
 Pumpkin is one of 20 sea lions in the Navy's Marine Mammal Program that are 
trained to listen for an acoustic beacon emitting beeps inside dummy mines and 
attach a recovery device to the mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sea lion is trained to attach a toggle bolt to the explosive and return 
to the ship, where we give him a bucket of dead fish and reel in the device," 
LaPuzza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the sea lions, the Navy has also trained 100 dolphins and five other 
sea mammals -- including a beluga whale and several false killer whales -- to 
perform the same mission, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sea lions swim into action after completion of mine-clearing exercises by 
frogmen with the Navy's explosive ordnance detachment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose a lot of mines," LaPuzza said. "It becomes an expense thing. Whenever 
we have an exercise, we retain all the devices instead of just half of them." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPuzza said the sea mammals are most often trained by Navy personnel, who 
often grow fond of their animal companions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere, the trainer who is responsible -- a sailor probably -- is feeling 
way bad for Pumpkin," LaPuzza said.

 "Finally I can do everything I've always wanted to do," said a delighted 
Trinka, who has been holding down two jobs to support herself. "I don't have to 
work 12 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she didn't work at all Tuesday, choosing instead to revel in her 
newfound wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the local Lexus dealer, intent on replacing the 1986 Chevrolet Nova 
that has taken her 130,000 miles. She visited the local California Lottery 
office, where security officers determined she did, indeed, hold the winning 
ticket from last Wednesday's drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 She even fielded two wedding proposals from unknown callers on a radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how attractive you get when you have money," Trinka said, laughing 
merrily. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinka could hardly stop laughing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her $12.6-million prize marks the third largest jackpot ever awarded in 
Ventura County. The wine shop will receive one-half of 1% of the prize -- about 
$65,000, in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alice Mills, a clerk at the store, saw Trinka on Tuesday afternoon she 
screamed and hugged her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to love it. You're going to love it," Mills told her. "The 
house, the car. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The time off," Trinka added. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinka said she can't remember the last vacation she took. She works days as a 
financial clerk at Ventura County Medical Center and nights at a medical clinic 
in Oxnard. Last weekend, she worked Saturday and Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 She had just finished working both jobs when she stopped by the wine shop 
about 8 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 She handed the clerk the Lotto ticket with five Quick Pick combinations 
selected randomly by the computer a week earlier. When the clerk put the ticket 
through the computer, it came back a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "She shook my hand and I thought she was joking," Trinka recalled. "I looked 
at the ticket, and there were so many numbers I thought the machine was 
broken." The ticket revealed that her random pick -- 4, 7, 10, 12, 43, 47 -- 
was worth $12,620,483. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinka was shaking so hard that she called her niece, Jessica, to pick her up. 
Tuesday morning was filled with calls from friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't believe it's me, that they know someone, a millionaire," she said 
breathlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel rich," she told reporters at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But she's still not sure what she will do when the first installment of the 
jackpot arrives in three to four weeks. Trinka expects to drop at least one 
job, but she will hold on to the Ventura condo she's renting until she decides 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wisconsin native, she doesn't expect to return there. She has been in 
California about five years, but might consider moving to Phoenix, Ariz., where 
her sister lives. Maybe she will buy a house. And one for her sister. And a 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 And a car. She plans to buy her niece a Ford Mustang, but for herself, Trinka 
wants something a bit more elegant. Perhaps a Lexus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, she's not worried about haggling with the car dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for once in my life, I'm not going to negotiate," she said.

3 CONDORS CAPTURED, TAKEN TO L.A. ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three California condors were captured in the mountainous Ventura County 
backcountry Tuesday and trucked to the Los Angeles Zoo, where they will live 
out their remaining years in the captive condor breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds, which had not eaten since March 14, eagerly attacked a calf carcass 
that biologists set out for them, officials said. Then, while the condors' 
heads were in the carcass, biologists who had been hiding in the surrounding 
brush since daybreak fired cannons that shot a huge net over the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate to bring the birds in," said Robert Mesta, coordinator for the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Condor Recovery Program. "But at the same time, we're all 
relieved to have them out of there. They were spending too much time on the 
power lines" that killed three of the birds last year. Another condor died 
after drinking antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The three birds, which now weigh 16 to 17 pounds and have wingspans of nine 
feet, were placed in individual flight kennels and taken by truck back to the 
zoo where they were hatched about 30 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ignoble ending to the days of free flying in the wild for the three 
birds that were transported to the Sespe Condor Sanctuary by helicopter amid 
fanfare on Oct. 19, 1992, and released two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public must be patient with scientists working in uncharted territory 
to bring the giant vultures back from the edge of extinction, said Randall 
Snodgrass, director of the endangered species campaign for the National Audubon 
Society.  
</P>
<P>
 "It took mankind more than 100 years to endanger these birds and we won't be 
able to recover them overnight," Snodgrass said. "Our society, our country owes 
it to these birds to at least try to bring them back." 
</P>
<P>
 The capture of the three birds leaves six endangered California condors still 
in the wild in a remote section of the Los Padres National Forest in Santa 
Barbara County about 35 miles north of Ojai. Those six -- five 1-year-old birds 
and one 3-year-old bird -- are doing well in that location, learning to fly and 
forage in the wild, said Marc M. Weitzel, project leader for the Condor 
Recovery Team. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five or six more birds will be released into the wild late this year, 
Weitzel said. In addition, it is possible that the three captured birds, which 
each represent distinctive genetic lines, will be replaced with birds of like 
lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 Condors, which once roamed the skies of North America by the thousands, were 
down to 22 or 23 birds in 1983. The last wild bird was captured in 1987 and has 
since become part of the captive breeding program at the Los Angeles and San 
Diego zoos and a third facility in Boise, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the three birds captured, the six still in the wild and a hatchling 
that emerged from its shell on Monday, there are now 81 California condors in 
the world, said Mike Wallace, curator of conservation and science at the Los 
Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 He said veterinarians at the zoo rearranged schedules to be ready to examine 
the three returning birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready for them," he said. "We'll move them into isolation for a few 
days and let them settle down and relax" before full medical examinations, he 
said. The birds, which should weigh about 20 pounds, were also fed again 
because the stress of the capture made them vomit the meal they were devouring 
when captured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sespe Condor Sanctuary in Ventura County was the original site for the 
release of the first two condors in January, 1992. One of the two died in 
October that year after eating antifreeze. Six more were released that 
December, including the three captured Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But three of those six died over the next year in collisions with power poles 
and from electrocution from power lines. Last November, in an attempt to move 
the curious birds away from hazards like power poles and other trappings of 
civilization, scientists captured the remaining four birds and moved them to 
the Lion Canyon area. Five chicks joined them there on a rocky outcropping that 
overlooks the rural Cuyama Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of the four Sespe birds, Xewe, has remained at the remote Lion 
Canyon site with the five younger birds and is helping them learn to forage. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three other Sespe birds returned to their first home in the Sespe on 
March 14, and despite a lack of food refused to leave. Scientists decided to 
trap them and return them to the zoo rather than leave them to die of 
starvation or accident in the Sespe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be of much more use in a captive breeding program than they would 
be lying dead under some power pole," Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzel said the capture is not a setback to the 12-year, $15-million effort 
to reintroduce the endangered California condor to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just part of the process," he said.

BUENA AND VENTURA HIGH MOVING TO BUILD BRIDGES; EDUCATION: DISTRICT CONSIDERS 
JOINT ACTIVITIES FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO DISPEL THE VIEW THAT ONE IS 
INFERIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to discourage negative comparisons between Buena and Ventura high 
schools, Ventura school district officials are seeking ways to increase 
cooperation between the cross-town rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena High Principal Jaime Castellanos and Hank Robertson, who will become 
principal at Ventura High in July, have begun discussing ways to bring together 
students and teachers from the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea is for teachers in various departments at Buena High to meet with 
their counterparts at Ventura High to compare curricula, textbooks and teaching 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Under another proposal, Ventura High students would be able to go to Buena to 
take German or other courses not offered at their school, while Buena students 
could go to Ventura High to study Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, Robertson said, is to dispel what officials called a widely held 
perception that Ventura High is inferior to Buena by emphasizing the schools' 
similarities and playing down their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, he said, the two schools are very much alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we stood on the moon and looked back at the two schools, we wouldn't see 
much difference," Robertson said. Robertson, who is now principal of Balboa 
Middle School, was named last week to replace Ventura High School Principal 
Jerry Barshay in the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to bringing together teachers, another idea suggested by Supt. 
Joseph Spirito is for student leaders from Buena and Ventura to begin meeting 
to plan joint activities for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they hope the increased cooperation between the two schools 
will discourage comparisons between the schools' academic programs. But they 
consider the intense athletic rivalry between Buena and Ventura High to be 
healthy, and said they expect it to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Every fall, before the Buena and Ventura football teams meet, Ventura High 
holds a Buena Nerd Day, when many students come to school dressed in Buena's 
school colors of blue and black. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Buena High has a day each year when school administrators dressed 
in the Ventura High colors of black and gold amuse students by going onto the 
school basketball court and playing basketball very badly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rivalry is always going to be there because of sports," Spirito said. "That's 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said: "Academically, there shouldn't be any competition between the 
two schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Buena High was built as the city's second high school in the early 
1960s, the older Ventura High has been dogged by a public perception of being 
second-best, a perception that some Ventura High teachers say has been fed by 
real estate agents promoting homes in the Buena High area. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics show the differences between the two schools are relatively 
small. 
</P>
<P>
 About one in four Buena High seniors goes on to a four-year college, compared 
to one in five seniors for Ventura High. But Ventura High sends more students 
to community college. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura High had a significantly better score on the reading portion of 
the latest statewide assessment test, while Buena scored slightly better in 
writing and math. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools have identical graduation requirements and almost exactly the same 
course offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A student can easily flip-flop between the two high schools and not miss a 
heartbeat," said Robert Collins, a Ventura High counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, teachers in some departments at the two schools meet regularly to 
compare notes about how and what they are teaching. But the communication could 
improve, officials said, and it could set an example for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If students can see programs going on and teachers cooperating and 
administrators cooperating, they can see the competition is all in fun," said 
Jim Sargent, social studies department chairman at Ventura High. "Teachers and 
administrators could set the example." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Buena High students also said they would like to see changes in the 
public perceptions of the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could make students think that Ventura is just as good as Buena," said 
Beth Denger, a Buena High student government leader, "we could have community 
pride, instead of just pride in our school." Comparing Ventura's 2 High Schools 
Number of students Buena High: 2,099 Ventura High: 1,711 Seniors who go to 
four-year colleges Buena High: 20% to 24% Ventura High: 18% to 20% Seniors who 
go to community colleges Buena High: 61% to 64% Ventura High: 70% Students who 
scored in top three performance levels on the California Learning Assessment

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRE DEPARTMENT STUDY IS EXTENDED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens committee examining problems in the Ventura County Fire Department 
will have two more weeks to complete its study, the Board of Supervisors 
decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors approved the committee's request to extend its report deadline 
from April 7 to April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members said they were having difficulty finishing their work because of 
the resignation of their chairman, Bill Esty, who quit several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors established the committee in October after the 
auditor-controller's office concluded that the department was top-heavy with 
managers, spent too much on overtime and was lax with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors asked the group -- which has about a dozen active members -- 
to identify ways to make the department more efficient. Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee said she agreed to grant the panel the extension because she wants to 
make sure it can complete the task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see them finish the evaluation and see if they can come up with a 
plan," she said. TINA DAUNT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOSPITAL NURSES URGE COMPROMISE ON PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warning that they are poised to strike, several Ventura County Medical Center 
nurses on Tuesday urged county supervisors to force hospital administrators to 
compromise on a long-simmering contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the nurses flatly rejected what hospital administrators say is 
their best and final offer, and no new contract talks are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the nurses say they still hope to work out the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the administrators' contract proposal, the hospital would switch some 
shifts to trim overtime costs and allow managers to lay off nurses from 
individual units rather than by seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the nurses say the proposal -- which could come to the board for 
approval next month -- would undermine seniority rights and weaken the quality 
of patient care at the county's only public hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want this contract shoved down our throats without them at least 
trying to meet us halfway," said nurse Sharon Madonna, who attended the 
supervisors' meeting. "Hey, get a clue. We are very important to what goes on 
at the Ventura County Medical Center." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors listened as Madonna and others spoke, but the board members 
did not comment during the meeting on the nurses' request. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Supervisor John K. Flynn said the county is in a difficult position 
because the hospital has been losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have to be sensitive to the nurses' needs, but we do have a financial 
difficulty there," Flynn said. "We have gone from a well-off county to one that 
is struggling because of the economy." TINA DAUNT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FANFARE GREETS NEW STOREFRONT POLICE 
STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amid balloons, speeches and the strains of a high school band, Ventura 
officials opened the city's first storefront police station Tuesday as part of 
an effort to bring beat officers closer to the community they cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront, at 6368 Bristol Road, will serve the Montalvo neighborhood on 
the city's east end, much like Oxnard's two substations in the Southwinds and 
La Colonia neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Two officers will work out of the donated retail space in Ventura, using it as 
a base for bicycle and walking patrols or undercover operations. Eventually, 
the storefront will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but hours will vary until 
enough volunteers are trained to take reports and answer the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 During a ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday afternoon, Ventura Police Chief 
Richard Thomas hailed the storefront as the keystone in the department's new 
effort at community-based policing, a trend that has been embraced by hundreds 
of police departments in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, someone threw a rock at the storefront's plate-glass window, 
cracking it. Thomas said that incident only showed how much the storefront is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be too many crimes that occur here that we won't be right on top 
of, that we won't know about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Jim Cubitt, a 24-year veteran of the department, said the storefront 
will "empower the people" of the Montalvo area by allowing them to tell police 
what the biggest crime problems are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some have indicated it's the beginning of neighborhood blight. . . . Others 
have mentioned drugs and gangs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing to the back of the crowd gathered for the ceremony, 50-year-old 
Alfred Valenzuela said the increased presence was sorely needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know what's going to happen anymore; it's scary," he said, 
mentioning gang fights, drive-by shootings and drug dealing. "Somebody's always 
getting shot, somebody's always getting stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what it's all about," Valenzuela said, gesturing toward a group of 
children performing from Montalvo School. "The kids. We want them to grow up. 
We don't want it to be like L. A." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they hope to open a second storefront in the Ventura Avenue area 
in the next year, although no firm plans have been made. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN BRANCH PLANS ITS OWN GRADUATION

<P>
 For the first time in its 20-year history, the Ventura campus of Cal State 
Northridge will hold its own graduation ceremony in Ventura in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In what university officials call a "coming of age" for the growing satellite 
campus, as many as 250 students will receive diplomas or teaching certificates 
in the May 27 ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 University President Blenda J. Wilson is expected to award the degrees and 
deliver the commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our time has come," said Joyce Kennedy, director of the Ventura campus. "It's 
been 20 years. This is a major milestone in our history." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Alessandro Drive campus has no space large enough for the ceremony. 
So university officials expect to use a site at Ventura College on Telegraph 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Ventura graduates have traveled to the Northridge campus and 
received their diplomas with the students there. Nearly half of the Ventura 
campus students are from the cities of Ventura and Oxnard, according to 
university statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will be open to family and friends, as well as faculty, students 
and alumni of the Ventura campus. Those who need additional information can 
call 654-4575. PHYLLIS JORDON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY UNVEILS UNIFIED PUSH FOR BUSINESSES 
</P>

 Oxnard officials on Tuesday unveiled the city's latest effort to lure new 
businesses and the tax dollars they generate. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials announced that four agencies -- the Greater Oxnard Economic 
Development Corp., the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Oxnard & Harbors 
Tourism Bureau, and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce -- will all operate out of 
the city's Heritage Square office complex. 
</P>
<P>
 With the groups under one roof, agency representatives say, they will be able 
to consolidate their push to boost the city's economic base. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an idea whose time has come," said George Lauterbach, chairman of the 
Economic Development Corp. "We are off to a very quick start and I think you 
are going to be pleased with the results we have in the very near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the unified team can claim partial credit for persuading GTE 
California to move to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks-based telephone company announced last week that it will 
establish a customer service center in Oxnard, a move that will bring 650 jobs 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials say they believe more businesses will follow, especially now 
that the consolidated effort exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city has always been at the forefront of economic development," 
Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "Now we are embarking on a new method of addressing 
the need for economic development." FRED ALVAREZ

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CITY REJECTS BID TO REPAIR POLICE RADIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about hindering police response during emergencies, the Simi Valley 
City Council has rejected a bid by a company that said it could take up to five 
days to repair damaged police radios. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff had recommended that the council award a $124,000 contract to 
Motorola Communications and Electronics to tend the Police Department's 387 car 
and motorcycle communication radios. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract would have also required the company to maintain the Police 
Department's dispatch center and radio control center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Bill Davis said he was worried that the lag in radio repair 
time could jeopardize the safety of residents, especially during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that five-day delay you could easily have four or five cars sitting 
around without radios," Davis said. "If an emergency like the earthquake 
strikes, that's going to be a major problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the council agreed and sent the contract back out to bid with the 
stipulation that repairs must be made within three days or replacement radios 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 A new recommendation is expected to be before the council within 30 days. SARA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; 5-YEAR-OLD'S OFF-ROAD RIDE FUELS DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 5-year-old boy's talent for riding motorcycles has put him and his father in 
the middle of a controversy involving off-road vehicles in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Alessi was riding his 24-inch-high Yamaha 50cc motorcycle on vacant 
property near Arroyo Las Posas on Monday with his father standing nearby when 
sheriff's deputies turned up and cited him.  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Alessi, Michael's father, said he could not believe the deputies gave him 
a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You're after the wrong people. Why don't you go after the big dirt 
bikes?' " Alessi said. "Taking it out on a 5-year-old is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and builders working on new developments in the area see things 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to have known this was a problem," said Mike Owens, a site manager on 
an Urban West development near the arroyo. "It's been a problem since I can 
remember. I don't mind kids going out and having fun, but people should have 
the right to their peace and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Michael won a national motorcycle championship in his age division. 
His dad said Michael is "technically the fastest 5-year-old (on a motorcycle) 
in the country" and needs a place to ride.  
</P>
<P>
 The noise from unmuffled dirt bikes tearing up terrain along the arroyo is a 
recurring problem for area homeowners, said Detective Stan Webber of the East 
County Sheriff's Department Off-Road Detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, homeowners desperate for peace and quiet have taken to writing 
letters of complaint to Moorpark city officials. In turn, the city has called 
the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 complaints have been on the rise over the last six months, Webber said, adding 
that a homeowner association complained last month that parents were teaching 
their children to ride in the arroyo.  
</P>
<P>
 Monday's sweep by two deputies patrolling the area on dirt bikes netted just 
Michael and his father, but Webber said the single citation helps reduce the 
problem by sending the message to other off-roaders that they could be next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, when we do go out we don't give any breaks," Webber said. "It 
seems the best way to stop the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Alessi vowed to fight the citation in court. He said he thinks he can 
prove he and his son were on private property, in a place where they now have 
permission to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boy asked me this morning if he was going to jail," Alessi said. "I had to 
tell him you didn't do anything wrong. I mean, I wouldn't take him to a place 
that's illegal to ride." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE; MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN BANK ROBBERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lompac man has pleaded guilty to a robbery of a Citibank branch in Westlake, 
FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Aaron Lee, 51, appeared before Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. in the U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles on Monday and pleaded guilty to the December 
robbery, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee entered the Citibank branch at 974 Westlake Blvd. on Dec. 23 and demanded 
money from a teller, FBI officials said. He fled the bank with $629, FBI 
spokesman Gary Auer said.  
</P>
<P>
 A Citibank employee and another witness who followed Lee saw him discard some 
clothes into a dumpster and enter a nearby grocery store, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The witnesses contacted sheriff's deputies, who arrested Lee as he left the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is scheduled to be sentenced June 6. He faces a maximum 20 years in prison 
for the robbery, Auer said. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; NEW LIMIT BACKED FOR HOUSING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks city planners swiftly settled a contradiction between the city's 
General Plan and efforts to limit construction on 29 acres near Warwick Avenue 
by recommending a General Plan amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners voted Monday night for the change in the General Plan, which 
would reduce the number of homes that could be built on the property from about 
20 to about 14, the landowner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which must be approved by the City Council, came despite the 
developer's contention that limiting construction on the property constituted a 
partial taking of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city's intent is to downsize the property for the public's benefit, in 
this case it is clear that you must compensate the property owner," said 
Kathryn McMenamin-Torres, attorney for property owner John Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 McMenamin-Torres said she had not expected the Planning Commission to budge on 
the General Plan amendment because commissioners unanimously approved a zoning 
change in September that reduced development on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, which has a small reservoir, is near the center of Thousand 
Oaks, just south of Conejo Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the zone changes and several previous attempts at developing the land, 
surveyor Thomas Wolfington said Chang still plans to develop the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to work with the city," Wolfington said. "It just seems that 
every few years we see new restrictions. We expect there will be a development 
there, and it's now up to the City Council to decide if what we have proposed 
is reasonable." MATTHEW MOSK

TABLES ARE TURNED AS PARENTS GO TO SCHOOL; OAK PARK: THEY BECOME FRESHMEN FOR A 
DAY TO EXPERIENCE FIRSTHAND WHAT IT'S LIKE -- INCLUDING BEING TOLD OFF FOR 
BEING LATE.

 Oak Park High School's dean of students, Cliff Moore, delivered a stern 
lecture Tuesday to a student tardy on her first day. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't usually punish first offenders, but Moore made an exception for 
school board member Jeri Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox and 20 other Oak Park parents became freshmen for the day to see firsthand 
what high school is like. And Fox got more than she bargained for when Moore 
summoned her to his office with a dreaded "blue slip." 
</P>
<P>
 "At times, you are going to be late. But, remember, if it's a pattern, there 
are consequences," Moore said. "This is your first day here. Maybe you don't 
understand what the rules are." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox fidgeted in her seat and offered an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to starting at 8," Fox said. "Seven-fifteen is really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore laid down the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have to get with the program here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like their sons and daughters, the parents who spent the day at school 
sat in on group discussions, heard lectures, watched videos and some even 
apparently sneaked off campus during lunch without a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Sterling said he participated in the third annual event to sample the 
courses that his 10th-grade daughter will be taking next year. Sterling, 44, 
fit in with the class as he scribbled notes from a chemistry lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stuff must have left an impression somewhere, because it's coming back to 
me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School seems different than when he was there 25 years ago, said Sterling, who 
also serves as chairman of the school's site council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've made a transition from being teacher-oriented to 
student-oriented," he said. "I see now teachers are more facilitators. Students 
are more accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Bernard wanted to be able to understand and communicate better with her 
ninth-grade daughter by seeing what her school day is like. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, when she comes home commenting about classes or teachers, I know 
firsthand what it's all about," Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Blasman, whose husband, Wayne, is president of the school board, even took 
a test on "Romeo and Juliet" that her eighth-grade son might face in English 
class next year. As in other classes, the students did not take multiple-choice 
tests but had to explain their answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'd pass high school now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was not all that challenging for Eileen Nilsen and several other 
mothers who took a break in the sun at the end of classes before lunch. Like 
teen-agers gathered for gossip, they huddled together to talk schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to relax on a few things. The classes are a lot bigger than I'm 
used to, but I understand they're small for around here," said Nilsen, 40, who 
recently moved from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best teachers are the ones who kind of roll up their sleeves and work 
with students rather than just lecturing to them," Bernard said. "They know how 
to maintain control, command respect and do what needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 With the lunch bell, sidewalks filled with students, and the parents set off 
for food. Bernard was headed off campus. Reminded by Nilsen that Principal Jeff 
Chancer had issued no off-campus passes for parents, Bernard replied: "I didn't 
hear that part." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other parents, Bernard disappeared during the 40-minute lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, the school's disciplinarian, responded: "We'll have to take care of 
that."

CITY COUNCIL OKS 2-YEAR EXTENSION FOR PERMITS; SIMI VALLEY: OFFICIALS ARE 
CONCERNED THAT NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS MAY FALTER IN THE WAKE OF THE 
EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to shore up the city's post-earthquake economy, the Simi Valley City 
Council has agreed to extend for two years most permits for new construction 
that will expire this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension follows the council's decision in January to waive fees for 
design plans and building permits required to repair damage caused by the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With the construction industry's attention focused on quake repair, however, 
city officials are concerned that new projects will falter. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said he hopes that the two-year delay will encourage 
companies to forge ahead with new development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fairness issue and an economic issue," Davis said. "We'll keep our 
fingers crossed, and it should work very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The extension will allow the city to push back for two years any building 
permits set to expire between Jan. 17 -- the day of the quake -- and Dec. 31. 
Permits are usually good for two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law enacted in the fall extended permits for housing subdivisions to 
bolster flagging construction. The city ordinance grants that extension to 
commercial and industrial developments as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be in front of the curve," said Deputy City Manager Brian 
Gabler, who helped prepare the proposal presented to the council. "By doing 
this, we're going to have a better chance of keeping jobs and development going 
in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In other quake-related action, the city has applied for $142,000 in federal 
funds to pay for a soil stability study of a severely damaged area on the 
southeastern side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began pursuing the study after residents complained about large 
cracks they said are continuing to spread under their homes and through their 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's request, the state's mines and geology division agreed to 
conduct the study. The study will begin once funding from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency is approved, said Jim Davis, a state geologist who heads the 
division. Approval is expected later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists are expected to complete the study by June, he said. They will test 
the soil along the Arroyo Simi from Kuehner Drive to Stearns Street, compare 
aerial photographs taken before and after the earthquake, and monitor the 
ground in the neighborhood to determine if it is still moving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be taking a close look at the area," Davis said. "The intention is to 
have the state develop some conclusions using our particular expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a three-month, $45,000 contract to pay a consultant 
to help inspect buildings and check plans for post-quake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the city is seeking FEMA reimbursement for the consulting work, 
Councilwoman Sandi Webb encouraged the city's building and safety staff to 
return to the council for more funds if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that fireplaces and some of these other earthquake projects sometimes 
take five or six inspections," Webb said. "If this funding doesn't look like 
it's going to be enough, come back for more."

DEVELOPER'S PROPERTY WILL BE EXAMINED FOR RARE BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks planners will turn to bird experts to determine if a rare 
species of cuckoo is nesting in willows on the property of developer 
Nedjatollah Cohan.  
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre twist to the decade-long debate over Cohan's 47-acre parcel in 
Newbury Park, city planners pored through bird books in search of information 
on the western yellow-billed cuckoo, which reportedly was spotted on the Cohan 
property in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent counts show that 32 to 42 breeding pairs of the endangered cuckoo can 
be found in California, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cursory examination of the land, city officials determined the bird was 
"either a fall transient or a misidentification" and was not nesting in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohan's son, Albert Cohen, said the search for cuckoos on the land was 
"another attempt to find an excuse which will prevent us from using it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Planning Commissioner Linda Parks said she had great concern for the 
endangered bird and asked city staff to do a more extensive survey to determine 
if the cuckoo was nesting on Cohan's land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a professional observer saying there was an endangered species seen 
on property that we're talking about developing," Parks said at the Planning 
Commission meeting Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we're talking about a couple of hundred dollars to prevent the possibility 
of hurting an endangered species, I don't see how anyone could be opposed," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the commissioners, reluctant to spend city money on an extensive 
survey, said they would turn the matter over to the Conejo Valley Audubon 
Society or other bird experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since it was just one sighting and we don't know if it was accurate, it 
doesn't really make sense to go through an expensive survey," said Commission 
Chairman Irving Wasserman.

VENTURA DELAYS DECISION ON FIRE DEPT. AMBULANCE SERVICE STUDY; SAFETY: THE CITY 
COUNCIL VOTES TO GET AN ESTIMATE OF REPORT'S COST. FIREFIGHTERS, LOBBYING TO 
TAKE OVER PARAMEDIC DUTIES, WANTED IT COMMISSIONED IMMEDIATELY. 
</P>

<P>
 Moving cautiously on a major decision that could change ambulance service in 
Ventura, city leaders have delayed ordering a study on whether firefighters 
should take over paramedic and ambulance services. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the City Council voted unanimously Monday to first get an estimate of 
how much a study would cost before voting on whether to ask for such a report. 
The council in three weeks will debate whether to go ahead with the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if (the study) will cost $25,000, $5,000 or $250,000," 
Councilman Steve Bennett said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura firefighters, who are lobbying to assume ambulance and paramedic 
services, had recommended that the council commission a feasibility study 
immediately, to be completed before June. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Fire Chief Vern Hamilton criticized the council's decision 
to delay the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, it's a little disappointing," Hamilton said. "The council told us to 
find new revenues, new ways to do business, and we're ready to move on this." 
</P>
<P>
 However, private ambulance company Pruner Health Services, which provides the 
city's paramedic and ambulance services, praised the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner executives are battling the firefighters' proposal because it would 
mean a substantial loss of business for the Thousand Oaks-based company. About 
31% of Pruner's business in Ventura County comes from the city of Ventura, said 
Steve Murphy, chief administrative officer for the company. He declined to 
release sales figures for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they need to be very cautious," Murphy said of proceeding with the 
firefighters' proposal. "They have a system that works very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle said city leaders will not be hurried on their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of money at stake," Tuttle said in an interview. "I think 
everyone is afraid to make the wrong move and saddle the city with another tax 
burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters say assuming paramedic duties and transporting patients would be 
a logical extension of the first aid they already provide. The department would 
also have the opportunity to generate cash for the city, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that there is some money in it," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Fire Department report by Hamilton, start-up costs could be as 
much as $362,000, and would include buying three ambulances and adding nine 
paramedics. Annual operating costs would total about $1 million, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues would come from voluntary contributions from residents and direct 
billing of patients, Hamilton said. The city would bill patients about the same 
amount that Pruner does and could make an annual net profit ranging from 
$150,000 to $500,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner officials say they charge a base rate of about $300 for non-emergency 
transportation and about $530 for emergency transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner executives argue that their company's paramedics already do a good job 
and that switching to firefighters would cost taxpayers money and expose the 
city to more lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the county of Ventura, which regulates emergency medical care, 
pays Pruner only $20,692 annually to cover some of the costs of servicing poor 
residents in the city of Ventura. Pruner writes off about $327,000 yearly for 
taking care of low-income patients in the Ventura area, Murphy said. If Ventura 
firefighters assumed Pruner's duties, the city would have to pick up those 
costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Pruner will submit its own report in a few weeks and respond to 
the financial estimates in Hamilton's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we can raise some questions that will be of value," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner has a contract with county officials to provide ambulance services to 
most of Ventura County. The contract expires June 30, and the company is 
seeking to renew it. Pruner receives about $99,000 annually from county 
officials to cover some costs for poor residents countywide, but the company 
makes most of its money through billing patients for paramedic and ambulance 
services, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council endorses the Fire Department's proposal, firefighters will 
compete against Pruner for a contract to provide service to Ventura. Any 
changes in paramedic or ambulance services would probably occur in July, 1995, 
at the earliest, fire officials said.

SHORTFALL EXPECTED IN UNITED WAY DRIVE; CHARITY: OFFICIALS SAY GRANTS TO LOCAL 
AGENCIES PROBABLY WON'T BE CUT AND THAT FUND-RAISING EFFORT PLEASES GROUP'S 
DIRECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With their annual fund-raising drive scheduled to end Thursday, United Way 
officials say that this year's campaign will probably fall short of its 
$5.3-million goal. 
</P>
<P>
 About $4.9 million in donations and pledges -- nearly 8% less than the target 
-- has been received so far, interim campaign Chairman David Harris said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is projecting that the drive will end up with $5.1 million as money 
continues to trickle in during the next several weeks. He said the charity's 
directors are satisfied with this year's campaign even though they have not 
reached their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the economy has taken its toll, but we are pleased with how 
supportive this community has been," Harris said. "We raised $5 million to 
benefit local agencies and that's a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the $200,000 shortfall, Harris said, the United Way probably will not 
cut grants to its 62 member agencies this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest decline in giving occurred in the campaign's federal division, 
which includes donations from employees of post offices and other federal 
government sites. Some of those contributions are earmarked by employees for 
charities outside the county, so the loss of those dollars is not as crucial to 
Ventura County agencies, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all of that money is earmarked for local charities, so that $200,000 loss 
is not felt by our communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors will make allocations for the 1994-95 fiscal year next 
month, he said. The 62 nonprofit agencies provide food, shelter, housing, 
medicine and education to county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruthanne Begun, director of the Conejo Youth Employment Service in Thousand 
Oaks, said she is anxiously waiting to see how the United Way board distributes 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need is up and the dollars are down," Begun said. "We really count on 
that United Way money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks charity offers job-search help, training and placement for 
youths ages 13 to 25. It relies on the United Way for 15% of its $90,000 annual 
budget, Begun said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really would like it to be a bigger percentage," she said. "But even if 
they don't quite make their goal, I still think they have had a successful 
year, considering the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign leaders said Ventura County's sluggish economy, which prompted some 
county businesses to trim their work forces, shut down or move elsewhere, is a 
key reason for this year's fund-raising decline. It is the second time in three 
years that campaign receipts have fallen short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions fell $500,000 short of a $5.8-million target in 1991-92. Last 
year, the United Way lowered its expectations and then exceeded its 
$5.1-million goal by $200,000. The 1993-94 target of $5.3 million was based in 
part on last year's giving, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said he is optimistic that giving will bounce back in next year's drive 
as the economy improves. United Way officials will continue their strategy of 
raising dollars in individual communities rather than focusing on a countywide 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark had the most successful campaign this year, exceeding its goal of 
$50,000 by nearly 30%. Teachers and other employees of Moorpark College pledged 
over $9,000, the largest contribution for that area, United Way officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving increased on campus as more people became aware of the effects of a 
prolonged recession and high unemployment, said Jim Niles, campaign coordinator 
for the college. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer this economic slump lasts, the more we all know someone who has 
been laid off," Niles said. "It's raised our level of consciousness on how bad 
unemployment is and how real the needs are." FYI 
</P>
<P>

1339 Del Norte Road, Camarillo 93010. Donations are accepted year-round. United

* REBECCA S. CARTMAN; RETAIL MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Rebecca S. Cartman was born, the czar reigned in her native Russia and 
Wilbur and Orville Wright were still dreaming about powered flight. 
</P>
<P>
 And during the course of a 102-year-long life that ended Tuesday, the 
Camarillo resident was noted for a strong sense of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She saw so much history during her life," said her daughter, Zelda Robinson, 
79, also of Camarillo. "She marveled at things like the first moon walk and 
when the Soviet Union fell apart. She thought these things were miracles." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Lomita resident, Cartman moved to Camarillo's Leisure Village 15 
years ago and was known among residents for the blue golf cart she drove after 
giving up her driver's license at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartman immigrated to the United States as a child and lived in Los Angeles 
with her father, Jacob Schwartz, who was credited with starting the city's 
first soda pop bottling plant. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Cartman served as a trouble-shooter for Douglas Aircraft 
Co. But it was in her role as manager of bridal departments for May Co. stores 
that Cartman shined, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She used to attend her customers' weddings on a regular basis -- she wanted 
to make sure everything was just right," Robinson said. "But after the father 
and the daughter would start down the aisle, she'd leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Cartman had been a widow since 1929, when her husband, Simon J. Cartman, died. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong Democrat, Rebecca Cartman voted religiously throughout her adult 
life, and cast her ballot during the 1992 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton was her fair-haired boy," Robinson said. "But she always said she 
really voted for Mrs. Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Also surviving are grandsons Steven C. Seal of Alameda, Andrew D. Seal of San 
Francisco, and Jonathan R. Seal of Seattle.
