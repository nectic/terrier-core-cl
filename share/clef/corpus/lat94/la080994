 DISNEY MAJOR: A lot of people take Mickey Mouse courses in college, and pay 
for it later. Robin Allan did, and got his Ph.D. . . . Allan got the honor from 
the University of Exeter in England for his thesis on "Walt Disney & Europe." 
He studied the role of European illustrators in Disney's early films. Exeter 
wasn't his first choice. Other schools, he says, "didn't think it was high 
art." 
</P>

 POTHOLES: War was declared Monday on some Valley streets. The Department of 
Public Works will use extra workers to fix thousands of potholes. During 
"Operation Pothole," workers in 12 two-man teams will be sent out each day this 
week to work on square-block areas in each of L.A.'s 15 council districts. Call 
(818) 760-2259 to report a pothole near you (B2).

 SWEET GIFT: What do you give to the couple that has everything? Try candy. And 
so that's what Frank Sheftel (above), a candy-maker in Sherman Village, was 
asked to do for Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley (B1). . . . The 
chocolate bars are being sent to Jackson's estate in Encino, his Westwood 
production company, Elvis' Graceland mansion, and the Trump Tower in New York.

 DEJA VU: Higher sales, lower prices -- the Valley real estate market sounds 
like a recording. In July, single-family house sales went up 22% from a year 
ago, with prices down 9%. The lower prices, realtors say, have a lot to do with 
quake-damaged properties for sale. . . . And don't expect things to change. 
There are tons of potential bargain hunters, and interest rates remain low. See 
Valley Business, Page 4.

 WHAT RECESSION? What's wrong with Woodbury University in Burbank? It acts as 
if this recession business is no big deal. In fact, enrollment is growing. . . 
. Woodbury is not alone. Other private universities, colleges and trade schools 
do quite well by specializing. "I think we are distinctive," says Paul Sago of 
Woodbury, which turns out architects and fashion designers. See Valley 
Business, Page 10. Michael Arkush

 COURTROOM DRAMA: Starting this week, court officials are assigning all new 
felony cases to Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch (B1). So what's the big 
deal? . . . Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury had ordered prosecutors to 
disqualify Storch from hearing new criminal cases, contending that the judge is 
biased. Now the judges are fighting back. . . . "What they (prosecutors) 
expected was that they were going to just put Judge Storch out of business and 
tell us who to have sit on criminal cases," defense attorney George Eskin said.

 ACT OF VALOR: Oxnard officials today will honor policeman Joe Marino, who was 
recently named "Officer of the Year" by the American Legion of California. . . 
. The 14-year veteran was given the award for his role in chasing down the 
gunman who killed four people and wounded three others at an Oxnard 
unemployment office last year. It is the first time that a Ventura County 
officer has won the statewide award. . . . "We're extremely proud of him," 
Cmdr. Jamie Skeeters said. "It says a lot for this county and for this 
officer." 
</P>

 ELBOW ROOM: Hoping to ease overcrowding, Pleasant Valley School District 
officials are about to open a badly needed elementary school on Camarillo's 
east end (B1). . . . Starting next month, Tierra Linda School will house more 
than 700 students from kindergarten to third grade. . . . "This is going to be 
a great place to teach students and a great place for them to learn," school 
board President Jan McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 PRIVATE LESSONS: Looking for a good college? You might want to check out 
private schools. . . . Some private universities and trade schools are boosting 
enrollment by carving out specialized academic or career programs in the 
education marketplace (Valley Business, Page 10). . . . "We tend to be 
chameleons to the marketplace," said Michael Gould, president of 
Chatsworth-based Learning Tree University, which expanded to Thousand Oak in 
the early 1980s. "We'll figure out what sells even in slow economic times."

AL MARTINEZ: A NIGHT OF TEARS AND CANDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Candles flickered in the gathering dusk like fallen stars, adding tiny 
pinpoints of light to a corner of the large parking lot in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Muted voices rose from the cluster of those who held the candles, and 
passersby along Ventura Boulevard could hear fragments of comment about the 
horror of children dying and the cancerous growth of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, very few took much notice, except for three carloads of youths who came 
by at different times, shouting and laughing at the 50 who had assembled to 
mourn the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another candlelight vigil in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 400 in the past 10 years large enough or important enough to 
be mentioned in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Candle-bearers have stood in hot summers and in wet winters to light fires for 
racial equality and AIDS awareness. They have marched along endless boulevards 
to protest drugs and to feed the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reasons have been as frivolous as the anniversary of Elvis Presley's 
death and as serious as world peace. They have come by the dozens and by the 
thousands whenever life's problems seemed too large to bear alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday night, they gathered again. 
</P>
<P>
 This too was for an anniversary. It was held across the street from Taft High 
School, about 100 feet from where a young student was stabbed to death at a bus 
stop almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was Lamoun Thames. He died, dreams unfulfilled, at the hands of gang 
members who mistook him for an enemy. "He was my dear, special child," his 
mother said that soft and candle-lit night. "Now he's everyone's child." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't go to many of these vigils because I can't take the frustration. We 
stand around holding little specks of light, talking to others who feel pretty 
much as we do, then go home and do nothing until the next candlelight vigil 
comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can actually do something hardly ever come. Suzanne Lewis, who 
organized Saturday's observance, telephoned and sent letters to every member of 
both the City Council and the Board of Supervisors and a lot of others "to 
stand as witnesses for peace and nonviolence," but none of them showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Braude sent a deputy, Rita Walters sent a bus for the family, and state 
Sen. Tom Hayden sent a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them didn't even return my phone calls," Lewis said as we stood amid 
the flickering candles. A warm breeze blew across the asphalt, carrying the 
faint aroma of night-blooming jasmine. "I can't believe they would care so 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 She put the memorial together because her daughter attended school with Lamoun 
Thames and often waited at the same bus stop where he was killed. Lewis felt it 
could have been anyone's child who died that night, and, in the sense that 
Lamoun's mother meant it, he was everyone's child. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus arranged by Rita Walters carried Lamoun's family to the vigil from 
South-Central. The irony of his death was his parents sent him to Taft to 
escape violence and he died at the hands of those who perpetuate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin Squires was there too. She's the mother of Marc Squires, who was shot to 
death four years ago at a party by someone who wanted his pager. She held a 
large picture of him high above her head and said, "He was the baby brother in 
the family. No one should shoot a baby brother. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I heard so much anguish that night, expressed in the same terms of anger we 
all feel. "They're killing our children," Marc's mother said. "I'll never 
forget my boy," Lamoun's mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others talked about the fear they felt for their own sons and daughters in 
today's world. "How would you feel," one asked bitterly, "if you sent your kid 
to a school with a sign on the door that said: 'No weapons allowed' "? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all afraid," Suzanne Lewis' daughter said. She still attends Taft. "You 
bump into someone in the hall and they turn around and call you names. You 
don't know what they might do. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure how much good candlelight vigils do. Remembering, I suppose, is a 
way of easing the sorrow that accompanies the dying of a young person. Does it 
ever get better? Lin Squires replied in a way meant to include us all. "Being a 
victim of violent crime," she said, "is forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Imprinted on my own memory of this night of tears and candles are the 
photographs of the two young victims displayed for all to see: Marc with a 
smile of innocence that claws at the heart, and Lamoun looking determinedly out 
at a future that died at a bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mothers have organized separate groups against crime. To achieve any 
significant impact, a long, hard road lies ahead. Sadly, its dark route will 
continue to be lighted by candles for our children.

A-BOMB DROPPED ON HIROSHIMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "War Anniversary Hard to Celebrate," by Greg Mitchell, Commentary, Aug. 3: 
</P>
<P>
 The annual bleeding-heart derby of one-sided tunnel-vision history 
revisionists has once again begun. They can never convince me that it was wrong 
to drop the bomb. I'll tell you why. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the attack on Hiroshima was devastating. Yes, there were some 100,000 
civilian dead. But it, together with the follow attack on Nagasaki, ended the 
war in the Pacific. And it prevented, by various military estimates, at least 
400,000 American casualties.  
</P>
<P>
 When the news that an atomic bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima was reported, 
because of my point-count status, I was aboard a transport ship en route back 
to the States for "temporary rest and recreation." I had come off of Iwo Jima 
and had fully expected to return for the assault on Japan. Instead, I was 
briefly assigned as a separations counselor at Fort Dix where we began 
discharging thousands of low-point soldiers who were being transshipped from 
Europe to the Pacific theater in preparation for the expected bloody invasion 
of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 No one who has seen actual Japanese bunkers and the thousands of American 
graves on the Pacific islands and who knows the ferocity of the Japanese 
defense regrets dropping the bomb. It spared the lives of hundreds of thousands 
of American soldiers, allowing them to come home, have families and participate 
in the normal activities of life. 
</P>
<P>
 IRV JUSTMAN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Columnist Greg Mitchell is yet another example of a revisionist's view of 
America's participation in World War II. Whether he believes it or not, 
America's strategy to end the war in the Pacific by dropping atom bombs on 
Nagasaki and Hiroshima, as a last resort to obtain Japan's unconditional 
surrender, enjoyed the total support of the American people. Indeed, those of 
us who had fought our way from Leyte Gulf to the shores of Japan hailed the 
bombing of Hiroshima. The contemporary saying among us GIs was "home alive in 
'45." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, our young people today are being taught by revisionists that 
"America has never come to terms with the atomic bombings." Nothing could be 
further from the truth. My generation understood what had been done and we 
never looked back. We knew the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of young 
American lives for which we were thankful.  
</P>
<P>
 EARL BARACKMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Because my life was probably saved by bombing Hiroshima, I celebrate that 
event every year. Further, I believe my friends who made the Bataan death march 
and who were in Japanese prison camps also celebrate it. 
</P>
<P>
 My ship, the North Carolina, was to be the second through Sagami-Wan Bay in 
the invasion of Japan and was expected to take 100% topside casualties, had the 
atomic bombing not forced the Japanese to surrender. My battle station was nine 
decks above the main deck, topside by any definition. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, I expect all of those Asians whose countries were brutally conquered 
and occupied by Japan also celebrate the bombing of Hiroshima.  
</P>
<P>
 Until Japan faces up to the carnage for which it was totally responsible, 
there are still millions of us living who thank Harry Truman for having saved 
us by using the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID W. HARLOWE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At least Hiroshima was no Pearl Harbor! As a widow of a Japanese language 
officer who went ashore with the Marines, I can tell you that I was overjoyed 
at the news of Hiroshima and of Japan's subsequent surrender. Better Hiroshima 
than a special telegram delivered at the door!

ROSENFIELD ON HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The column ("Reform Has Been DOA Since Day One," Commentary, July 29) on 
health-care reform by Harvey Rosenfield contains serious factual errors 
regarding the role of Health Net in a lawsuit involving the denial of coverage 
of an experimental treatment for a patient suffering from an advanced stage of 
breast cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 Health Net is second-largest health-maintenance organization in California. 
The company's 23,000 physicians and 360 hospitals serve more than 1 million 
Californians. Our success is a direct result of the high-quality medical care 
our members receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net does not and could not pay its managers bonuses or allow its 
physicians to receive personal financial gain by denying patients requests for 
medical coverage. Such behavior would be a violation of state law.  
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the plaintiffs never contended -- nor will the facts support such an 
assertion -- that Health Net's decision regarding coverage has any bearing on 
the patient's eventual death. The treatment sought by the patient was not 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Autologous bone-marrow transplants have been successful in the treatment of 
some forms of cancer such as leukemia, but the procedure is still considered 
investigational in the treatment of advanced stages of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield's disregard for the facts merely abets the campaigns of various 
special-interest groups to conceal from the public the real facts: Of all the 
health-care reform models being discussed today, HMOs are the only one that is 
already working. Here in California, one out of three people is covered by an 
HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 ROGER F. GREAVES, Chairman 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net, Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield's health-reform diatribe contains numerous blatant inaccuracies and 
not one constructive suggestion for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield says California's Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) 
"caps the amount of compensation a jury may award to a malpractice victim." 
MICRA only caps awards for pain and suffering at $250,000. There is no limit 
for the amount that can be awarded for actual damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield contends that research data shows MICRA hasn't lowered malpractice 
premiums for doctors or health-care costs in California. The truth is, MICRA 
has a far more dramatic effect on malpractice premiums than Rosenfield's Prop. 
103 has had auto insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 20 years of inflation, California doctors today pay malpractice 
premiums that are approximately one-half of what insurers were proposing when 
MICRA was passed in 1975. California has the lowest cost malpractice insurance 
of any urban state and doctors across the nation view MICRA as a model for 
malpractice tort reform.  
</P>
<P>
 The most reckless of Rosenfield's untruths is his statement that MICRA's 
"single effect has been to enrich insurers and allow dangerously doctors to 
escape justice." Actually, the opposite is true. Most of California's doctors 
currently buy their malpractice insurance from five companies formed by doctors 
as a result of the malpractice crisis in 1975. As chairman of the board of one 
of those companies for eight years, I can say absolutely that these 
doctor-owned firms are committed to using profits to return premiums to doctors 
and to lower rates.  
</P>
<P>
 While the AMA and the CMA have been pursuing health reform for nearly a 
decade, Rosenfield cynically suggests that we scrap all efforts this year and 
start over next year with a reform plan "that puts consumers first." According 
to UCLA, 2.6 million people in our county have no health insurance. Our 
uninsured rate is a third higher than California's and nearly twice as high as 
the rest of the nation. We have more to lose through inaction than anyone else.

HAITI'S GEN. CEDRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see how Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras in Haiti will dodge 
U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright's latest ultimatum to get out or get shot. 
If he reads the papers he'll see we really don't mean it. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid in Somalia. He's back in full bloom, living 
off military and civilian supplies brought in by courtesy of the American 
taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's North Korea. We had the Navy, the Marines and the Air Force on 
super-alert and had started a program to anesthetize the American public to the 
possibility of another Korean war. When Kim Il Sung died, we sent our heartfelt 
condolences and withdrew the fleet to home port. 
</P>
<P>
 The current villain is Cedras. If he's smart, he'll reduce the island speed 
limit to 90 miles an hour. That way, the outside world won't be able to tell 
Haiti from Southern California and Madam Albright can lay claim to another 
victory of democracy in the Caribbean.

 I see that U.S. Marines will be leading an invasion of Haiti, if that is 
necessary. I trust that President Clinton will find men and women more willing 
to serve this nation than he was when he evaded the draft as this nation 
battled in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 As a person drafted in 1966, and the brother of a brave Marine killed in 
Vietnam, I find it ironic that Clinton is asking soldiers to do what he was 
unwilling to do.

 We were pleased that LaVera Porter Williams recognized Pat Harvey as an 
important local anchor (letter, Aug. 4) However, we must point out that Harvey 
can be seen weekdays on KCAL TV Channel 9, not Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey has been an integral part of KCAL's award-winning "Prime 9 News" 
efforts since the program's inception in March, 1990. The co-anchor of the 
station's 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. newscasts, Harvey was recently honored with Emmys 
for her "Sex & Aids in Russia" series, both for program content and for her 
excellence as the host.

ONE VOTE THE STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS; WASHINGTON IS SO CLOSE TO TRULY HELPING 
CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans are worried about crime. They want more prisons, more police and 
anything else that will make them feel safer. The $33-billion federal omnibus 
anti-crime bill promises help, but an almost unfathomable alliance between 
political opposites in the House is holding up this legislation. One prays that 
good sense will prevail and that by Wednesday this bill will be closer to the 
President's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 A powerful Democratic voting bloc against the next vote on the bill includes 
gun-control opponents -- mostly from rural districts -- and at least half of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, who are protesting the truly unfortunate loss 
of the racial-justice act, which would have allowed the use of statistics to 
prove racial discrimination in death-penalty challenges. Caucus members are 
standing on principle because the bill expands the death penalty and African 
Americans are disproportionately sentenced to die. But, admirable as its stand 
is, the caucus risks billions of dollars earmarked for cities, where most of 
their constituents live and suffer disproportionately from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents remain open-minded, like Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles). 
He is reassessing his position. His reason is admirably pragmatic: He has 
tallied up everything in the bill for California crime-prevention programs and 
law-enforcement efforts. It adds up to $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, other opponents will never compromise. The National Rifle Assn. 
and its allies hate the assault-weapons ban, which, in spite of their earlier 
efforts, passed both the House and Senate. Championed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) the ban would prohibit 19 types of military-style assault weapons. 
It is stronger than the California assault-weapons ban because the federal 
prohibition would outlaw the generic features typical of military-style arms, 
including folding stocks, pistols grips and high-volume detachable ammunition 
magazines. That would close a loophole in state law, which allows manufacturers 
simply to change model numbers or alter individual weapon design. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's opponent in the current Senate race, Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara), voted for the assault ban in the House. But, as Dixon and others have 
been, he is now said to be undecided on the key procedural vote needed to allow 
the bill to advance to a final vote in Congress. His support would greatly 
benefit California, which could not otherwise afford 10,000 new cops, thousands 
of new prison cells, new military-style prison boot camps, special drug courts, 
additional treatment for nonviolent drug offenders and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House wants this anti-crime bill badly, and is mounting a full-court 
press with the help of police chiefs, prosecutors and mayors. Any Californian 
concerned about crime should also weigh in -- urging the state's House members 
to support it.

NO FREEDOM FROM RELIGION; SOCIETIES THAT IMPOSE THE FAITH RAISE INSUPERABLE 
BARRIERS FOR WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of religion in 
a society that was, de facto, overwhelmingly Protestant. This freedom was also 
extended, if a bit grudgingly, to Roman Catholics and Jews. But the religions 
of the American Indians were generally confined with their practitioners on 
reservations. And when Native American religion was offered as the basis for a 
claim to land, American religious tolerance quickly reached its limit. Land 
ownership, by the Founders' consensus, was simply not a religious question. By 
a more recent, more embattled consensus, abortion has also been recognized as a 
question that religion will not be allowed to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 The fervor with which the Indians fought to keep their land and the violence 
of recent clashes over abortion may remind us that in religious conflict the 
stakes are often extremely high. And in a shrinking world, conflicting 
presuppositions about what authority a religion may or may not claim are doomed 
to come into progressively more abrasive contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Secular societies all believe that the state may guarantee to its citizens the 
right to change from one religion to another, to abandon the practice of 
religion altogether and to criticize religion. Some Islamic governments -- and 
passionate parties within some otherwise secular or tolerant societies where 
Islam is statistically dominant -- regard changing from Islam to another 
religion or to atheism as apostasy and criticizing Islam as blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous victim of this view is Salman Rushdie, condemned to death as a 
blasphemer and presumptive apostate by the government of Iran. Another case 
recently in point is that of a feminist Bangladeshi novelist, Taslima Nasrin. 
When she dared to suggest that the Koran should be revised, Islamic radicals 
demanded her death and a weak government has agreed to hold a blasphemy trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Western, secular societies such as Britain, which has protected Rushdie, a 
British citizen, have the right to enforce their own understanding of what the 
free exercise of religion entails. Past that point, when confronted with a 
"domestic" case like that of Nasrin or of persecuted Christians in Iran, they 
must make it clear that a society that imposes a religion by force places an 
insurmountable barrier between itself and societies like ours that do not.

CARRY ON, LITTLE SAIGON RADIO; RADIO STATION UNDETERRED BY THREATS OVER 
INTERVIEWS WITH HANOI LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California's radio stations appeal to diverse audiences with programs 
ranging from talk shows to rock, in a host of languages. Most offerings do not 
prompt death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, anonymous callers have vowed to kill employees of Little 
Saigon Radio and to bomb the station in Santa Ana. The menacing callers were 
upset with the station's debut two months ago of British Broadcasting Corp. 
programs that include interviews with Vietnamese government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The station's managers and supporters have shown a welcome familiarity with 
the First Amendment of their adopted land, with free-speech provisions that 
protect their right to air the interviews they want and the right of their 
opponents to protest peacefully. Earlier this year, hundreds of 
Vietnamese-Americans in Little Saigon demonstrated against the establishment of 
U.S. trade relations with the communist government in Hanoi. They, too, wisely 
took steps to ensure the protest remained nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus station officials are cautious but not overly concerned by the threats. 
The Times Poll recently found that more than half the refugees and immigrants 
from Vietnam supported full diplomatic relations between Hanoi and Washington. 
That is a remarkable turnabout from the virulent anti-Hanoi climate in the 
Vietnamese communities in Westminster, Garden Grove and Santa Ana a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a Vietnamese newspaper publisher died in a firebombing at his Garden 
Grove office after publishing advertisements for firms that some 
anti-communists considered fronts for the Hanoi government. Travel agencies 
offering trips to Vietnam were forced to scrap them. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence against those seeking better ties with the home country's current 
regime has declined in recent years. But the anti-communists of Little Saigon 
need to continually remind their followers of U.S. laws and be sure they 
understand the protections given both to free speech and to peaceful protests.

COLUMN RIGHT/ PHILIP M. CRANE: IT'S CURTAINS FOR FEDERAL ARTS FUNDING; THE NEA 
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, UNFAIR, UNWISE AND UNNECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP M. CRANE, Rep. Philip M. Crane (R-Ill.) is a ranking member of the 
House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Endowment for the Arts was established in 1965 ostensibly so that 
the federal government could help discover the next Ernest Hemingway living 
amid the beanfields of Illinois. Congress is now in the process of determining 
the NEA's appropriation for its 30th anniversary, a fitting time to look at the 
future of this agency. I submit that it is time for the NEA to go the way of 
communism in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 My primary objection to the NEA has always been contained within the larger 
debate regarding the proper role of the national government. Simply stated, I 
do not believe that the NEA is a constitutionally defensible responsibility of 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Constitutional Convention in 1787, delegate Charles Pinckney 
introduced an amendment calling for the federal government to subsidize the 
arts in America. The Founding Fathers overwhelmingly rejected that idea, wisely 
believing that the federal government should be more concerned with responsible 
tasks, like providing for the common defense. 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress has created a nearly $5-trillion national debt, we need to get our 
fiscal house in order. We must prioritize our scarce resources and we can start 
by ridding our federal budget of nonessential government spending. How can we 
rationalize spending millions on the NEA when we do not even have enough money 
to effectively deal with the illegal immigration crisis or the crime in our 
streets? 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment I introduced on the House floor would have completely eliminated 
funding for the NEA. The $171.1 million of taxpayer money for the NEA could 
easily be replaced from a very gracious private sector, which provided more 
than $9 billion to the arts and humanities in 1993. In fact, this argument 
could best be demonstrated in California, where the entertainment industry has 
provided working capital to some of America's finest artists, who, in turn, 
have been able to show their works all over the world, without subsidies from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal money always comes with federal control. Congress has the right and 
duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are wisely spent. In the case of the NEA, 
federal control typically comes in the form of content restrictions. While I 
realize that the NEA funds some very distinguished art and artists, the agency 
has been notorious for funding some art that the majority of Americans find 
offensive. In these instances, Congress has every right to place restrictions 
on NEA-funded art. If the arts community wants to retain its independence, it 
should totally reject federal funding of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area of concern relates to the disparity of NEA grant distribution. 
For example, more grant money was given to Washington, D.C., (which is smaller 
than my congressional district) than to the entire state of Illinois, even 
though Illinois had 350 more grant applicants than Washington. Surprisingly, 
the district received more money than 48 states. If the next Ernest Hemingway 
(who did not receive government subsidies) is living in Illinois, it appears 
that the NEA would not "discover" him. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans and the arts community would be far better off without the federal 
government sitting in judgment of art and artists. Due to the obvious budgetary 
implications of such a policy, the NEA cannot possibly fund every artist asking 
for a federal handout. It must pick and choose. Currently, the NEA awards 
grants to one in four applicants -- rejecting three out of four. These grants 
are, by NEA design, seed money for artists, who, having received a blessing 
from the NEA, now have the attention of private donors. Thus, by the NEA's own 
admission, in practice, the federal government has become the most powerful art 
critic in America, and is in the position of determining the future of one 
artist over three others. One would think that the concept of the federal 
government determining what art should prosper in America would be anathema to 
the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the NEA is not constitutional and is not necessary to the survival 
of art in America. Given a choice between relying on Washington bureaucrats to 
continue to fund the arts or the gracious private sector, I say give the arts 
back to the people!

COLUMN LEFT/ JONATHAN FREEDMAN: URBAN VOTERS GET A CHANCE TO BE HEARD; A 
NON-BINDING REFERENDUM ON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL APPEAR ON SOME CITY 
BALLOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is a writer in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decline of American civilization proceeds from the neglect of its cities. 
The fabric of the whole country is threatened by urban problems -- violence, 
homelessness and social breakdown. But our presidents tragically ignore the 
root causes of decay, exploiting popular fear for political gain. Or they 
propose grandiose and unworkable federal programs, while disregarding local 
initiatives that actually work. 
</P>
<P>
 A fundamental reason for this national dereliction of duty is political: We 
elect presidents from places like Hope, Ark.; Kennebunkport, Maine, and Plains, 
Ga., because the political machines that once produced urbane candidates like 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy have been scrapped by political 
reforms. Today, the road to the White House leads through rural Iowa, 
snow-white New Hampshire and the "Super Tuesday" South. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, New Hampshire was so distant from the problems facing America that 
its Democratic primary was dominated by steamy tabloid coverage of Gennifer 
Flowers -- anything to warm up the frigid Puritan temperament. When liberal 
Democratic candidate Larry Agran, the former mayor of Irvine, injected urban 
issues into the primary, proposing to send the so-called peace dividend 
directly back to cities, his qualifications were questioned and he was excluded 
from the debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban issues finally caught the nation's attention on April 29, 1992, when Los 
Angeles exploded into flames in the worst urban riots in American history. Only 
then did George Bush and Bill Clinton drop into L.A. to mouth a few empty 
promises. But Californians didn't get to vote until June, when the nominations 
were already sewed up. To bridge this gap, California's primary will be moved 
up to March in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in metropolitan areas across this country, who comprise 80% of the 
electorate, must have a primary role in choosing the first president of the 
21st Century. Agran dreamed of a national urban primary while waging his 
quixotic campaign. His candidacy failed, but his dream gained support among 
mayors, struggling to balance city budgets starved by federal budget cuts. In 
mid-1992, the U.S. Conference of Mayors recommended a national urban 
presidential primary. "We must invent the means" for presidents to hear urban 
voters, said James Scheibel, former mayor of Saint Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, that dream came closer to reality: CityVote, Agran's nonprofit, 
nonpartisan election group, announced that at least six cities -- Pasadena, 
Baltimore, Minneapolis and St. Paul and Tacoma and Olympia, Wash. -- will host 
presidential preference balloting three months before the New Hampshire 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 CityVote will work like this: 
</P>
<P>
 On Labor Day, 1995, declared presidential candidates will be invited to 
participate in four televised debates. On Nov. 7, 1995, voters in municipal 
elections in a dozen cities (at least) will also register their preference for 
president. The balloting will be non-binding -- no convention delegates will be 
selected as a result -- but the outcome will be widely broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Agran, himself out of the running, has taken pains to make sure the CityVote 
forum rules will be fair and inclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of CityVote is to provide a diverse mix of urban voices from big and 
small cities, on both coasts and in middle America. Pasadena is the first 
California city to sign on; San Bernardino and Santa Barbara are considering 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, some pols will quail at the idea of a national urban primary and 
may try to stop it. Luckily, CityVote won't need approval of party 
organizations or political authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are drawbacks. CityVote will extend the campaign to a full year, and 
it's vulnerable to being ignored, which would further erode city dwellers' 
faith in the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 But these risks are worth taking for urban voters to play their rightful role 
in the nominating system. If 5 million Americans participate in CityVote, as 
Agran predicts, both Democratic and Republican candidates might have to answer 
difficult questions like these: 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the peace dividend for our cities? What about revenue 
sharing, which gives local control of spending, in lieu of unwieldy federal 
programs? How do we put people to work rebuilding our cities or deal with the 
root causes of social problems? How can we make cities safe? 
</P>
<P>
 CityVote is a significant attempt to enfranchise urban voters and invigorate 
municipal elections by putting presidential hopefuls on the same ballot as 
local candidates and measures. America's first national urban primary could 
change the face of presidential politics.

JUDGMENT DAY COMES FOR ALL IN POLITICS; WASHINGTON: BECAUSE MAKING THE RIGHT 
CALL IS INTUITIVE, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE INVESTIGATIONS LIKE WHITEWATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK VALENTI, Jack Valenti was special assistant to President Johnson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching a young man writhing under the televised wrath of a Senate committee 
investigating Whitewater is not a congenial sight. One aches with compassion. 
Particularly when the young Treasury Department official, laden with academic 
credentials (Yale, Oxford), a civilized, educated, literate young 28-year-old, 
stirs in visible discontent. If he had been offered a blindfold and a 
cigarette, the scene would have been complete. 
</P>
<P>
 But his torment is an object lesson in one of the least publicized requisites 
for any young man or woman who aspires to be in any kind of high public office. 
The requirement is all the more stringent if that aspiration takes him or her 
to that icy, thinly populated level of the presidency and the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 That requirement is judgment. Sound judgment. Wise judgment. It is the 
dividing line that marks the difference between the mostly right and the mostly 
wrong decisions. It is the distinction, as Mark Twain said, "between lightning 
and the lightning bug." It is not to be found in academic degrees or SAT test 
scores or grade averages nor does it necessarily reside within the great 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Judgment is that inner voice, that tiny elf who lives somewhere in the brain 
and gut of a public official, and who from time to time whispers, "Go this way; 
don't do that because it will get you in trouble." It is an intuitive nostril 
that twitches and notifies the senses whether the political environment that 
day is fair or foul. It's what separates war from war games. It is a nameless 
instinct that guides the public person through hidden political mines on which 
judgment-less mortals blithely step and are blown to bits on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime specifications for a presidential or Cabinet aide are: loyalty -- 
without loyalty nothing counts -- and judgment, which is learned often through 
bitter experience, or is genetically inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 If you examine every great issue that presses against the Oval Office or 
within the committee rooms of Congress, there is not one where the facts are 
clear, the direction precise, nor any comfort level in an estimate of results 
down the road. Every great decision taken emerges from shadows without a 
certainty of outcome. Or to put in more mystical terms, as one philosopher 
said, "Men must leap into faith as they do into darkness, without any 
reassuring proof that God is there." 
</P>
<P>
 In my service in the White House I was never once witness to any presidential 
decision where the President had all the facts he needed. Inevitably, data, 
information, knowledge thin out, the pathway grows dim and then the President 
walks down an unlighted corridor. At the moment when he must decide, it is his 
judgment -- call it instinct, intuition, sixth sense -- which he now summons, 
without any proof he is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one day, some researcher will come up with a blood test that will 
gauge the "judgment level" in each of us. Meanwhile, the committee hearings and 
investigations will continue as they have since the birth of this republic, all 
targeting the judgment or the lack thereof of discomfitted witnesses.

 On the Caruso Watch: When "NYPD Blue" begins filming its second season today, 
David Caruso will be on the set to portray Detective John Kelly -- but it's 
anybody's guess how long he'll stay. "Steven Bochco Productions and David 
Caruso have settled their differences, and David Caruso will be back to work on 
Tuesday," ABC said in a statement Monday, responding to reports that the 
redheaded star is leaving the show that was recently nominated for a 
record-setting 26 Emmys to pursue a feature film career. But other sources 
insist that Caruso has reached an agreement with series creators Bochco and 
David Milch to leave shortly after production resumes. One described the 
problems between Caruso and the producers as "a thicket" that is not just about 
Caruso's desire for a bigger salary, as has been reported. The TV producers 
apparently have little leverage to keep Caruso -- who reportedly earned $1 
million to star in Fox's upcoming film "Kiss of Death." If Caruso were to break 
his multiyear "NYPD Blue" deal, he contractually could not work on any other TV 
shows, but he could still work in feature films.

 Dunaway to Sing Sondheim: Actress Faye Dunaway may not be singing Andrew Lloyd 
Webber tunes in "Sunset Boulevard" but she plans to sing a Stephen Sondheim 
song on Fox-TV's "The Simpsons," the actress told The Times. Her friend James 
Brooks, "Simpsons" executive producer, asked her to sing on the show, she says, 
and the song she hopes to sing is "Loving You," from Sondheim and James 
Lapine's Tony-winning new musical, "Passion." The TV segment, in which she will 
play a torch singer, tapes at the end of the month. Dunaway, who was abruptly

 Roaring About Similarities: Dozens of Japanese cartoonists have joined those 
citing similarities between Disney's blockbuster "The Lion King" and a 1960s 
Japanese cartoon series. About 50 cartoonists and 150 others from related 
fields have signed a letter to Disney officials seeking credit for the 
cartoon's creator, citing what they think is more than a passing resemblance 
between "The Lion King's" Simba, and Kimba, the hero of a popular Japanese 
series inspired by the late Osamu Tezuka's comic book, "The Jungle Emperor." 
Meanwhile, the president of Tezuka Productions Co., which owns the rights to 
the Kimba series, says the company is rethinking its original stand that any 
similarities were merely a form of flattery. "Now we will reconsider what 
position would be most appropriate," Takayuki Matsutani said without 
elaborating. POP/ROCK

 Michael Appeals: Attorneys for pop star George Michael on Monday asked 
London's Court of Appeal to overturn a June ruling upholding a $12-million, 
multiyear contract the singer signed with Sony Music Entertainment in 1988. 
Michael, who claimed during a 74-day high court hearing that Sony refused to 
back his change of direction from sex symbol to serious musician, has called 
the contract "professional slavery." His appeal is based on the grounds that 
his Sony contract amounts to restraint of trade and violates the European Union

JAZZ REVIEW; PASADENA FEST REACHES FOR CHALLENGING, SATISFYING MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The setting very nearly stole the show at Sunday's all-day installment of the 
Pasadena Jazz Festival. With the Ambassador Auditorium Mall overflowing with 
outdoor restaurants and free music events, with a welcoming greensward and a 
cool breeze to temper the August sun, the afternoon's concert acts -- singer 
Nnenna Freelon and guitarist Earl Klugh -- had plenty of appealing open-air 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Freelon, coming indoors was well worth the effort. A singer 
with extraordinary technical faculties, she was as comfortable with the 
soaring, lyrical imagery of "Skylark" as she was with the more verbally 
demanding convolutions of "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered." Still at an 
early stage in her career, Freelon is not yet a fully formed talent, but she 
clearly has the capacity to make a significant impact on the jazz vocal scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Klugh would have been better off outside on the mall. His light and frothy 
music is not the stuff to experience while sitting in a concert venue. While 
Klugh's guitar playing is adroit, and his way with a tune skillful, his band's 
briskly efficient performance had neither the improvisational urgency nor the 
propulsive swing one hopes for in first-rate jazz. Heard as background sound in 
an amiable atmosphere of white wine and summer skies, it might have found its 
perfect arena of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups that provided the free mall music -- the Rickey Woodard Quintet 
and the Frank Vignola Trio -- in fact offered considerably more than background 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard, heard to advantage on Saturday night's program, continued to offer 
convincing evidence of his rapid growth as a major jazz artist. His major name 
ensemble, which featured Bill Cunliffe on piano, Ray Brown on trumpet, John 
Littleton on bass and Ralph Penland on drums, could easily have been a festival 
headliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Vignola played an easygoing set, bristling with mainstream 
improvisation and brightened by the inclusion of such unexpected items as 
"Tico, Tico" and "String of Pearls." 
</P>
<P>
 The Benny Green Trio opened the evening event with a performance that was a 
pyrotechnical delight. Green's phenomenal pianistics -- replete with 
mind-blurring octave runs and string-busting, percussive chording -- were 
matched at every turn by bassist Christian McBride's equally remarkable bass 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as entertaining -- even awesome -- as it may have been, there was the 
nagging feeling that too much of the Green Trio's presentation was a sumptuous 
dessert for the ear, rich in taste and texture, but overloaded with calories 
and a bit lacking in musically nutritional substance. 
</P>
<P>
 With the festival's final group -- the all-world trio of Joe Henderson, Al 
Foster and George Mraz -- technical displays, flashy showmanship and facile 
solutions were set aside in pursuit of a penetrating, white-light view into the 
music. It was not an easy experience for the audience, and many listeners chose 
to leave early. But those who remained were rewarded with jazz improvisation 
refined to its very essence, improvisation that had no purpose other than a 
measuring of the creative mind against the infinite potential for musical 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The Henderson Trio was a courageous choice as the festival's climactic act -- 
especially so as an apparent revelation of the desire to produce a celebration 
that was both musically entertaining and creatively challenging. This year, the 
Pasadena Jazz Festival succeeded on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the empty seats that dotted the house at each performance (less so on 
Saturday night) are not encouraging signs of audience receptivity to eclectic 
programming and could impact next year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the festival's mixture of accessible contemporary jazz with 
mainstream music and cutting-edge artists seems just right. Combined with a 
lovely outdoor venue and free community access to some of the events, it is a 
formula that should, eventually, result in a ongoing successful festival. But 
it will take time. If the empty seats drive the 1995 Pasadena Jazz Festival 
programmers toward a more guaranteed commercial route, the unique character of 
this excellent small jazz celebration will be lost.

 NEW HIGH: Thirty-two people are recorded as having climbed the highest peaks 
in all 50 states. But nobody as quickly as a Balboa Island psychotherapist, who 
has an amputated leg. Todd Huston, 33, started his odyssey June 1 and on Sunday 
reached the top of Hawaii's Mauna Kea (13,796 feet). Huston, who lost his right 
leg below the knee at age 21, reached all 50 peaks within 68 days, bettering 
the record of 101 days. . . . Alaska's 20,320-foot Mt. McKinley was the 
toughest, he says. "It usually takes 14 to 18 days, if you make it at all. We 
took 12 days." 
</P>
<P>
 LAST TIME: The 50-day baseball strike in 1981 actually turned out well for 
Angel fans. (C1) . . . The Baltimore Orioles' Doug DeCinces was the American 
League player representative during negotiations and was later traded to 
California in what many saw as retribution. He joined other key union figures, 
such as Bob Boone and Reggie Jackson, to form the nucleus of an Angels team 
that took the AL West in 1982. Angel general manager "Buzzie Bavasi had some 
insight," said DeCinces, a Corona del Mar resident. "We were active in the 
strike, but we could help a team win."

 DAVE'S WORLD: TV producer Dave Forman, whose company is based in Irvine, is a 
veteran of reality shows. For six years he produced "On Scene: Emergency 
Response." Now he's producer-host on a new venture, "Special Access," which 
started daily at 5:30 p.m. this week on KCAL-TV . . . . It has stories about 
real life, just not emergencies. Says Forman, who lives in San Clemente: "I 
like to take viewers places they can't go on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 STILL PICKING: At age 12, Gordon McClelland (E1) had a job picking oranges 
near his hometown of Villa Park. While the county's citrus groves have 
practically disappeared, McClellan's fascination with the paper labels on old 
orange crates has only grown. Now it is antique dealers who go "picking" for 
these labels, and McClelland, 43, has parlayed his interest into a life's work, 
not just buying and selling the colorful labels, but writing books as well.

FATHER VICTOR SALANDINI; SERVED WITH CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father Victor Salandini, 66, a priest who served as spiritual leader to the 
late Cesar Chavez and others in the farm workers movement. He joined Chavez's 
crusade in 1965, spending nearly 29 years walking picket lines in the United 
States and Canada.But his unwavering support for the labor movement sometimes 
put him at odds with parishes that took a more moderate stand. "To thousands of 
farm workers, he is a prophet," Chavez said in 1972. Salandini was 
affectionately named the "tortilla priest" in 1971 after he ran out of 
traditional Communion wafers while ministering to striking farm workers and 
used corn tortillas instead. He embraced the name and 20 years later wrote "The 
Confessions of a Tortilla Priest." Salandini's death came less than four months 
after he completed a 343-mile pilgrimage through Central California in support 
of the United Farm Workers union. In Escondido on Aug. 2 of liver cancer.

<TEXT>

 Giovanni Spadolini, 69, former prime minister who headed two Italian coalition 
governments in the 1980s. As leader of the tiny Republican Party, which had an 
electoral base of 3%, Spadolini headed governments in 1981 and 1982, breaking 
the Christian Democrats' four-decade lock on power.His coalition collapsed in 
political bickering over an economic austerity plan. Spadolini served as 
defense minister under Socialist Premier Bettino Craxi in 1985, and threatened 
to bring down the government after Italian authorities released the Palestinian 
suspected of leading the Achille Lauro hijacking. Spadolini was named a senator 
for life in 1991. He lost the senate presidency, which he had held since 1987, 
by one vote in April to Premier Silvio Berlusconi's choice of Carlo 
Scognamiglio. Spadolini also served as editor of Milan's Corriere della Sera 
and taught political science at the University of Florence before turning to 
politics. In Rome on Thursday of stomach cancer.

<TEXT>

 Domenico Modugno, 66, Italian pop singer who gained fame in the United States 
with his hit "Volare." Although critics viewed the singer as only a good 
guitarist, Modugno won awards at Italy's prestigious San Remo Music Festival 
two years in a row by singing his own compositions.The first in 1958 was "Nel 
Blu Dipinto di Blu," which means "In the Blue Sky Painted Blue," better known 
in the United States for one of its lyrics, "Volare" or "To Fly." In 1959, he 
won with "Piove" meaning "It Rains," but that Italian hit did not translate to 
additional sales or fame in the United States. Popular in Italy from 1953 to 
1976, Modugno also recorded an Italian version of "Mack the Knife." He was 
involved in politics and in 1987 was elected to the national Chamber of 
Deputies on the Radical Party ticket. On Saturday on the Italian island of

 The O. J. Simpson case has drawn unprecedented attention to the issue of 
domestic violence. And for Betty Fisher, that means more calls for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're shorthanded," said Fisher, executive director of Haven Hills Inc., 
which runs the only shelter in the San Fernando Valley for battered women and 
their children. "We could definitely use more volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the number of telephone calls to the Haven Hills 24-hour 
counseling hot line has jumped dramatically since June, when police released 
the transcripts of 911 emergency calls from Nicole Simpson, the former football 
star's ex-wife, who was slain along with her friend Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really spiked after the 911 calls were released to the media," Fisher 
said. The hot line had typically received 250 calls a month before the murders. 
Now they receive more than 400. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many women really identified with that," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one portion of the tape, Nicole Simpson is heard pleading for help, saying 
that O. J. Simpson was breaking down her door. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers on the crisis line receive 40 hours of training. The next training 
session for Haven Hills, which was started in 1977, begins in September. Crisis 
line workers can make referrals to counselors and shelters after listening to 
the caller and confirming that she may be in an abusive relationship. But they 
are trained not to give advice, Fisher said.  
</P>
<P>
 "People who do best with this are those who are able to put their own feelings 
aside about what they think is best for the women," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the training, some volunteers find they are not suited for the work and 
quit. Others have been with Haven Hills for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter especially needs volunteers during the daytime hours, when the 
crisis line gets the majority of its calls. For more information, call Fisher 
at (818) 887-7481.

 A national network of volunteers called doingsomething is looking to expand 
its operations into the San Fernando Valley, said spokeswoman Wendy Vega.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization, whose Los Angeles work has focused on Westside projects, is 
geared toward matching busy professionals with short-term volunteering 
opportunities. So far, the group has helped Valley organizations such as the 
Women's Care Cottage, the Big Brother organization, United Way events and the 
Valley Shelter in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to build our way into the Valley," Vega said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the volunteer opportunities are for one or two hours. "They're just 
one-time things," Vega said. To contact doingsomething, call (310) 391-3907.

 The Helping Hands Society -- a new group based in Tarzana to help single 
working parents -- is looking for volunteers to plan fund-raisers, set up a 
support group and help with other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Oran, a single mother of two, said she started the group to help single 
parents afford to attend school or other activities to improve their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The first mailing for the group went out recently to 300 people, about 70 of 
whom are single parents. The next meeting is Aug. 20 at 10:30 a.m. Call Oran at 
(818) 345-6452 for more information.

 Wise Senior Services in Santa Monica is looking for volunteers to be advocates 
for senior citizens in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 These volunteers investigate complaints, promote the needs of nursing home 
residents and help identify long-term problems.

BEATEN WORRELL REACTS; DODGERS: AFTER GIVING UP FOUR RUNS IN NINTH TO GIVE 
ROCKIES A 7-6 VICTORY, HE DERIDES REPORTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Worrell ended his silence Monday, lashing out at reporters in the 
clubhouse after he blew a three-run lead in the ninth inning and the Dodgers 
lost, 7-6, to the Colorado Rockies at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 When approached at his locker, Worrell, who hasn't talked to the media in a 
month, at first said nicely: "It's not that I don't like you guys, I have 
nothing against you personally." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked if he wanted to say anything on his behalf, Worrell snapped, "I 
don't need to say anything, you've taken care of that."  
</P>
<P>
 Then, things got personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you knew anything about baseball, you wouldn't have to hide behind 
players' quotes," Worrell continued.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked by a reporter what that meant, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys don't know . . . . about the game and how it's played," Worrell 
retorted. 
</P>
<P>
 To that, a reporter replied: "Obviously, you don't know anything about 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussion over. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier, in the office of Manager Tom Lasorda, there were different 
questions asked. With his team ahead by three runs, after rallying for five 
runs in the eighth inning to take the lead, why did he make Worrell pitch for a 
fourth consecutive game? Rudy Seanez, who relieved Pedro Astacio after seven 
innings, was pitching well. 
</P>
<P>
 And why had Lasorda pitched Worrell the day before, when the Dodgers had a 
five-run lead? At least Monday's game was a save situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, drinking a non-alchoholic beer and eating rice and chicken, made the 
decision sound simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to put Worrell in in the ninth inning, that's his responsibility, 
that's his job," Lasorda said. Any ninth inning? Even with a five-run lead? 
Even when Worrell was hit hard the day before?  
</P>
<P>
 "How did we do in that game? We won," Lasorda said, pointing out that Worrell 
had an off day during the four-game span. "We put him in there whenever we want 
to put him in there. If I would have left Rudy out there (Monday), and he would 
have given up three runs, you would have asked me why I hadn't put Worrell in, 
since that is his job. The easy thing is to second guess. You know what a 
second guesser is, someone who doesn't know the first guess and needs two to 
get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . (Worrell) didn't do the job, so that makes me make the wrong decision. 
I can't tell you after, I can only tell you before." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell quit talking to reporters shortly after he questioned Lasorda's use of 
the bullpen about a month ago. It's not a new subject, but it was unusual for a 
Dodger player to speak on the record about it. Sources say that Dodger 
management was not happy that Worrell spoke to the media, with Fred Claire, 
executive vice president, saying that the line of communication leads to the 
manager and the coaches. But the difference in pitching philosophy between 
Lasorda and Worrell is not a secret.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda doesn't believe in roles, choosing instead to go with the pitcher he 
believes can do the job. Worrell, and most relievers, believe roles help define 
the bullpen and helps keep the relievers fresh and confident. Before Worrell 
came to the Dodgers, though, he had only pitched in back-to-back games three 
times the season before. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Worrell had been doing his job. Until Sunday's game, when he gave up 
a run in the ninth inning, Worrell had given up no runs and only three hits in 
his last five outings. Before Monday, he was 3-0 with three saves in four 
opportunities in his last 10 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ride a guy as long as you can in baseball," said Jim Gott, who relieved 
Worrell and gave up a single to Charlie Hayes, which scored the winning run.  
</P>
<P>
 The play of the game for the Dodgers came in the seventh inning, when Eric 
Karros dived and smothered a sharp grounder by Walt Weiss down the first base 
line with the bases loaded and two out, and tossed to Astacio for the out. 
</P>
<P>
 After tagging the base, Astacio whirled around and spiked the ball as he ran 
into the dugout. With the Dodgers trailing by 3-1, Karros' play -- his second 
exceptional defensive play in two games -- kept the Dodgers in the game and 
sent them on to a five-run eighth inning. But it would all be for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not about anything other than we have got to win that game, that's 
all," Gott said.

DODGERS COLLAPSE IN NINTH; BASEBALL: ROCKIES RALLY FOR FOUR RUNS AGAINST 
WORRELL AND GOTT FOR A 7-6 VICTORY.

<P>
 Charlie Hayes' RBI single capped a four-run ninth inning rally that carried 
the Colorado Rockies to a 7-6 victory Monday over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The win snapped Colorado's five-game losing streak and averted a sweep of the 
three-game series. The Dodgers had won four straight and seven of their 
previous nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies, who had earlier squandered a 3-1 lead when the Dodgers scored 
five runs in the eighth, tied the score with no outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 John VanderWal opened the ninth with a single off Todd Worrell (6-5) and moved 
to second when Nelson Liriano walked. Howard Johnson followed with an RBI 
single and pinch-hitter Danny Sheaffer hit a two-run double to right-center, 
chasing Worrell and bringing on Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Weiss sacrificed pinch-runner Ellis Burks to third and, after an 
intentional walk to Dante Bichette, Hayes singled to left. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Ruffin (4-5) picked up the win with 1 2/3 innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-run uprising ended a Rockies string of 56 innings in which they had 
not scored more than one run. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza's two-run double highlighted a five-run eighth inning that gave 
the Dodgers a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Freeman had blanked the Dodgers through six innings and left after 
seven with a 3-1 lead, but the Rockies bullpen couldn't hold the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Munoz walked the first two batters he faced, then surrendered an RBI 
double to Delino DeShields. Piazza greeted Steve Reed with a double down the 
right field line for a 4-3 lead. Tim Wallach, who singled in another run. After 
a fielding error on third baseman Hayes, Raul Mondesi's groundout produced the 
final run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Eric Young hit a solo homer, his seventh, off Pedro Astacio in the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, Liriano doubled down the right-field line and scored when the 
light-hitting Freeman, batting only .086, doubled into the gap in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies made it 3-0 in the sixth when Weiss and Bichette singled. Weiss 
went to third on a fly ball and scored on Mike Kingery's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, cruising along with a four-hit shutout, yielded a leadoff homer to 
Wallach, his 22nd, in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman went seven innings, allowing six hits, with one walk and five 
strikeouts. Astacio, who also went seven innings, gave up nine hits and three 
runs, with one walk and six strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies loaded the bases in the seventh, but first baseman Eric Karros 
made a diving stop of Weiss' grounder and flipped to Astacio for the third out.

 Linford Christie was slow -- for him -- but fast enough to win his third 
consecutive 100-meter meet title at the European Championships in Helsinki, 
Finland, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie, the 1992 Olympic champion and world champion last year, was timed in 
10.14 seconds, 0.13 seconds slower than his seasonal best and well off his 
European record of 9.87. But it was fast enough to get him a tie for the record 
of three titles in a row by Valery Borzov of the former Soviet Union in the 
1970s. And it was fast enough to leave Norway's Geir Moen 0.06 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This silver (medal) is like gold to me," said Moen. "Finishing second behind 
Linford, who is one of the greatest, is a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Christie took the lead at the 50-meter mark. No one was close to him at the 
finish line.

 Steve Backley won in the javelin, throwing 279 feet 6 inches to beat Finnish 
favorite Seppo Raty's throw of 272 feet.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS PROJECT MIGHT BE MORE THAN A DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a publicist's dream: all of the mouthing off, the comparisons, the talk 
of retired champions reuniting one last time to give their callow predecessors 
a dose of humility. 
</P>
<P>
 Dream Team vs. Dream Team II. Magic and Michael vs. Reggie Miller and 
Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the most anticipated sporting event of this or any year. But could 
it happen? 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM Grand in Las Vegas hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Dream Team II wends its way through the World Championships in Canada, 
the hotel-casino is pursuing the matchup that Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and 
O'Neal, among others, seem to really want. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bill Doak, the hotel's manager of public relations, the NBA, 
which already was contemplating a I vs. II showdown, has been informed that the 
MGM is interested in holding the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Dream: Although nobody is sure when the game would be played, the MGM 
would like it to be held at the hotel's 15,000-seat Grand Garden arena to 
culminate a series of events it would call "Dream Week," and it says the event 
would be a show to dwarf all other special events, from Barbra Streisand to 
title fights, ever held in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine anything that'd be bigger? I can't," Doak said. "Everyone who 
has ever brought any event here and everyone at this hotel cannot think of a 
bigger event that has taken place in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add Dream: Citing the star qualities and teamwork Dream I displayed on 
its way to the 1992 Olympic gold medal -- and the decided lack of same being 
shown by Dream II recently -- MGM oddsmaker Gene Kivi already has made Dream II 
a 5 1/2-point underdog if the game should ever take place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: The impending baseball strike could end Atlanta Brave pitcher Tom 
Glavine's attempt to win 20 games for the fourth consecutive season. Who was 
the last major league pitcher to accomplish that feat? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Big conference: Bruce Pascoe of the Las Vegas Review-Journal tried a more 
common-sense geographical approach to writing about the Big West Conference, 
which has added such non-Western schools as Southwestern Louisiana, Arkansas 
State and Northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the "Big West-of-the-Appalachians Conference," he wrote.

Oakland A's.

TENNIS / WOMEN AT MANHATTAN BEACH; GAVALDON DISCARDS SUPERSTITIONS, KEEPS 
CLOTHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four years ago, Angelica Gavaldon was a 16-year-old tennis player from Our 
Lady of Peace Academy in San Diego full of superstitions and promise. 
</P>
<P>
 She reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the third round of 
Wimbledon in 1990, and became the talk of the women's tour because of her odd 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 In Australia, she would eat dinner at the same restaurant and same table each 
night, and order a chocolate chip cookie for dessert. She would braid her hair 
in the bathroom each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the time she took the same seat in the car that brought her to 
a tournament in Tampa. And at Wimbledon, she would kneel in the bathtub once at 
night and once in the morning before her matches. 
</P>
<P>
 But she did not stop there. Gavaldon started eating a baked potato and sweet 
corn before her matches. Then she started showering in the same stall in the 
locker room after she played. 
</P>
<P>
 And if she lost, she threw away her tennis clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 She started throwing away a lot of outfits once she became a tour regular. In 
her first full year, Gavaldon's best 1993 Grand Slam event finish was at the 
French Open, in which she lost in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 20, Gavaldon has decided to discard her quirky tendencies and worry about 
what happens on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the best she has done in a Grand Slam event is reach the second round 
at Roland Garros again, but if Monday's first-round performance in the Virginia 
Slims of Los Angeles is any indication, then perhaps Gavaldon's game is 
maturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a strong service return, Gavaldon scored a mild upset over 11th-seeded 
Natalia Medvedeva of Ukraine, 6-2, 6-2, at the Manhattan Country Club in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing were ninth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France, who defeated Jana 
Nejedly of Canada, 6-3, 6-4; No. 15 Kimberly Po, who defeated Katrina Adams, 
6-3, 6-2; Maria Jose Gaidano of Argentina, who upset No. 14 Marketa Kochta, 
7-5, 6-2, and Lisa Raymond, who ousted Rita Grande of Italy, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Gavaldon, who plays Kyoko Nagatsuka in the second round, also looks different 
on the court this year. In an effort to shed all her superstitions, she quit 
wearing large hoop earrings and bright red lipstick that were her trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was overdoing it," she said. "In a way, it was kind of insecure. 
I'd have stupid thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Gavaldon said Monday's victory gives her confidence after a dismal season. Her 
best showing was in last week's tournament at Carlsbad, where she reached the 
round of 16 before retiring because of back problems. 
</P>
<P>
 She entered this week's event feeling better, and it showed against Medvedeva. 
"Her game is comfortable for me," Gavaldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly when Medvedeva self-destructed in the second set. She looked as 
if she wanted to be anywhere but on the stadium court when she lost her serve 
all four times. 
</P>
<P>
 After breaking Gavaldon to close within 2-1, Medvedeva lost her serve in the 
fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 Although breaking Gavaldon twice, Medvedeva was unable to control her 
groundstrokes. She double-faulted on her second match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova, 37, will decide after this week's tournament whether she 
will enter the U.S. Open. Ranked fourth in the world, Navratilova is playing in 
the final season of a 20-year career. She might skip the U.S. Open because she 
has not spent much time at her home in Aspen, Colo., she said. How would the 
year's final Grand Slam event do without her? "I could lose in the first round, 
so the Open won't miss me," she said.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's nice that the baseball season has lasted long enough for Fred McGriff to 
reach the 30-home run mark for the seventh consecutive season and demonstrate 
that he is one of the most consistent sluggers ever. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson never hit as many as 30 in two consecutive 
seasons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One thing I won't miss Friday is rotisserie league chatter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers probably will be deprived of the kind of home stand that usually 
fattens won-lost records -- Chicago, Pittsburgh and Florida. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 ESPN plans to televise the Southern League game between Birmingham and Memphis 
on Sunday. The attraction is a light-hitting Birmingham outfielder who wears 
No. 23. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Yankees, Montreal and Atlanta are more successful on the road 
than at home. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 News item: The University of Alabama athletic department denies that it has 
offered a job to Boston Red Sox Manager Butch Hobson. Reaction: Too bad because 
he probably will need work next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This has been a great year for hitters in Ohio -- Cleveland and Cincinnati -- 
but a lousy year for those in Pennsylvania -- Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The first round of the playoffs is supposed to start on Oct. 4, the league 
championship series on Oct. 11, and the World Series on Oct. 22. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have what is potentially the greatest kickoff-and-punt-return 
combination ever, Rocket Ismail and Tim Brown. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense was impressive against the Dallas Cowboys in their 
exhibition game, but the task is a lot easier when Troy Aikman plays only one 
series and Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin don't play at all. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 New Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer can't complain that owner Jerry Jones is 
looking over his shoulder and talking behind his back.Instead, during the last 
few minutes Sunday, Jones stood next to Switzer on the sidelines and spoke to 
him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson might become USC's first conference total offense leader since Pat 
Haden in 1973. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among those pictured on the cover of the Notre Dame media guide is offensive 
tackle Ryan Leahy, grandson of former Irish Coach Frank Leahy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Standout at the one-day camp for high school seniors conducted by Terry 
Donahue at UCLA Saturday was Locke High running back-wide receiver Sirr Parker. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas is long overdue for induction into the National Racing Hall of 
Fame, which welcomed Steve Cauthen and Jimmy Croll on Monday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former jockeys Johnny Longden, Bill Harmatz, Ken Church, Alex Maese and Danny 
Velasquez will be the honored guests today at the Orange County Sports Assn.'s 
monthly newsmakers' luncheon at Anaheim Stadium. Some of them will be riding 
Sept. 10 when the Rocking Chair Derby is renewed at Del Mar. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly and Hollywood Wildcat on grass are nearly as well matched as 
Affirmed and Alydar were on dirt. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Les Horvath, who is celebrating the 50th anniversary of his Heisman 
Trophy, will receive the Heritage Award Aug. 29 at halftime of the Disneyland 
Pigskin Classic at Anaheim Stadium that matches Horvath's alma mater, Ohio 
State, against Fresno State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't matter during the World Championships, but what Dream Team II 
lacks is a team leader. No Magic. No Bird. No Jordan. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NBC didn't give the score after every basket of the United States-Brazil game 
Sunday, but I guess it wasn't really necessary. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Buddy McGirt did nothing against Patrick Coleman that should cause Pernell 
Whitaker to worry about his rematch with McGirt on Oct. 1. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Holmes, who used to be heavyweight boxing champion, and Tim Witherspoon, 
who once had a share of the title, will be seen on cable television this week. 
It's Holmes-Jesse Ferguson on USA Network tonight and Witherspoon- 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Griffin on ESPN Friday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Liveliest family reunion in America this weekend could be the Bodines' at 
Watkins Glen, N.Y. The family hails from nearby Chemung, N.Y., and the event 
was planned long before brothers Geoff and Brett got into their not-so-friendly 
game of bumper cars during Saturday's Brickyard 400. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Track and field promoter Al Franken informs us that Noureddine Morceli's 
record-breaking 7:25 in the 3,000 meters equates to under 8 minutes for two 
miles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell me the Goodwill Games are over already.

 Dino Radja scored 23 points and Toni Kukoc had 13 points and 15 assists Monday 
night as Croatia defeated China, 105-73, in the opening game of the 
quarterfinal round of the World Championship of Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 In another quarterfinal game, Greece held off host nation Canada, 74-71.The 
United States plays Australia tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Radja, who plays for the Boston Celtics, scored all of his points and grabbed 
six of his game-high eight rebounds in the first half as Croatia took a 61-41 
lead. Kukoc, a Chicago Bull, dazzled the crowd with his pinpoint passing.  
</P>
<P>
 Hu Weidong led China with 31 points, including 9-for-14 shooting from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece, supported by partisan fans waving blue-and-white flags that 
outnumbered the red-and-white maple leaf flags by at least a 10-1 margin in the 
crowd of 11,083, pulled away late in the second half for a 72-65 lead with 1:34 
left on a layup by Panagiotis Fassouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's Kory Hallas hit a three-pointer nine seconds later and, after a steal 
by Joey Vickery, sank a second one with 52 seconds to play, moving Canada 
within 72-71. But Greece held on for the victory.

DEL MAR; DESORMEAUX LOSES BOTH HIS FIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fight City Hall? It doesn't pay. Ask jockey Kent Desormeaux. He tried it on 
behalf of Fightcityhall, his mount in the fifth race Monday at Del Mar, and 
came away later convinced that the effort had cost him a victory on another 
horse two races later. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question," he said. "The fifth race got my horse disqualified in the 
seventh race." 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh, Wende, ridden by Desormeaux, was disqualified and placed last. 
The disqualification moved favored Dame D'Onze Heures to first place and gave 
Gary Stevens his fifth victory of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux's horse bumped Castle Gardens, ridden by Chris McCarron, as the 
nine-horse field came out of the chute in the 1 1/16-mile turf race. Castle 
Gardens took up and trailed the field past the grandstand for the first time, 
but rallied for third place. The disqualification moved McCarron's horse up to 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Two races earlier, Desormeaux had been on the opposite side of such a 
situation, when he rode Fightcityhall to a second-place finish behind 
Poweroftheninetys. After the race, he engaged in a heated discussion on the 
stewards' telephone next to the winner's circle. His argument was unsuccessful 
and he ripped off his silks and stalked up the lane to the jockeys' room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just called up there to see if they had watched the race," Desormeaux said. 
"She asked if I wanted to claim foul and I said no, I just wanted to see if 
they were looking at what happened. I've got a horse wheeling right in front of 
me and I end up beaten by half a length. I come back and I don't even see (an 
inquiry sign)." 
</P>
<P>
 After the seventh race, the inquiry sign was lit and Desormeaux was the man 
under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pressured from the outside," Desormeaux said. "I kept the same distance 
between me and the outside horse. Where could I have gone? I couldn't pull 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 But his number came down. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, if Desormeaux incurs a suspension as a result of Wende's 
disqualification, probably will be missing out on riding Lakeway in Saturday's 
Alabama Stakes at Saratoga. New York does not allow suspended jockeys to ride 
in "designated races" as California does. 
</P>
<P>
 In the featured one-mile Bayakoa for fillies and mares, Exchange took an 
out-of-character front-running approach and won under Laffit Pincay Jr.

 On Sunday, when the Dodgers played before a crowd of 70,372 at Mile High 
Stadium, it was the largest crowd they had played before in the regular season 
since opening night at the L.A. Coliseum, April 18, 1958, when they played 
before 78,762. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd Sunday put the Rockies over three million in attendance after only 
52 dates, breaking the record they set last season when they reached the mark 
in 53 dates.

 Rafael Bournigal had a scare Monday morning when he couldn't find his 
eyeglasses. He had already packed his suitcase for Cincinnati and sent it down 
to be loaded on the truck to the airport, when he realized he might have packed 
both pairs of the glasses he wears when he plays. The suitcase, though, wasn't 
gone, so he retrieved them. "Can you believe it?" he said. "I wouldn't have 
been able to play today."

LANGSTON STYMIES ROYALS, 6-1; BASEBALL: HIS FOUR-HIT COMPLETE GAME, SALMON'S 
THREE-RUN HOMER GIVE ANGELS THE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can believe all of the gloom and doom you want, Kansas City Manager Hal 
McRae was saying Monday, but he's telling you right now: 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no strike. It's just common sense. How can there be a work 
stoppage with everyone making so much money? They know the skinny. They're just 
profiling, seeing who's going to blink first. We're going to be playing Friday, 
you just watch." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this philosophy that has helped the Royals creep back into the American 
League Central race, and if the Angels listen . . . well, crazier things have 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, proving to the crowd of 18,315 at Anaheim Stadium that they really 
do have a pitching staff, stopped the Royals, 6-1, Monday night behind starter 
Mark Langston's four-hit complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an up-and-down year," said Langston (7-8), "not just for me, but 
the whole team. Hopefully, we can play well for the next few days, and then, 
who knows what after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to worry about getting guys out again instead of worrying 
about getting guys back on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 While Langston was stopping the Royals for his first complete-game victory at 
Anaheim Stadium since April 28, 1993, right fielder Tim Salmon provided the 
offense. He hit a three-run home run in the eighth inning, his fourth in the 
last three games, to break the game open. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one felt the best," Salmon said, "because we finally won one. When you 
lose the way we've been losing, it doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (46-67) might have the worst record in the American League, and 
have lost 13 of their last 17 games, but no matter how hard they try, they 
proved it's impossible to fall out of the American League West race. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how pathetic is this division? 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 21-31 since June 10, but have not lost any ground to the Texas 
Rangers, remaining 6 1/2 games out of first place. Yet, instead of easing the 
Angels' pain, it has merely intensified their frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really serious when I say it's been miserable around here," said Angel 
third baseman Spike Owen, who had two hits and raised his batting average to 
.313. "We've been scuffling, struggling. Believe me, it's been ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nothing can boost the Angels' spirits more, however, than a look at 
the Royals (63-50), who believed 2 1/2 weeks ago that they were out of their 
division's race, then reeled off a 14-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barring a miracle," Royal closer Jeff Montgomery said, "we were done. We were 
9 1/2 games out, and strike or no strike, it looked like we had no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened since is truly amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "While everyone was talking about the season ending (on Friday)," pitcher 
David Cone said, "we treated it like we still have two months left. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask me, there's been way too much emphasis on the strike date. I mean, 
if the rest of the season is wiped out, we're all (finished) anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 McRae believes it's absurd for all of these teams to actually be gearing their 
championship hopes toward a Friday strike date. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you prepare for uncertainty?" he asked. "You're not going to be 
rewarded if there is no more baseball. If there is no more baseball, nobody 
wins. You just don't go into postseason play."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; INDIANS' SUMMER HAS NO DOG DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now, traditionally, the Cleveland Indians are in baseball's dog days of 
August, resigned to playing the role of spoiler at places such as Toronto, 
where pennant races have become the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 But in these confusing times, when everyone wonders how long the season will 
last, the Indians are adding to the turmoil. They are in a pennant race, and 
helped themselves Monday night with a 6-1 victory at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no dog days with a strike looming on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't think about the past," said Kenny Lofton, who paced an 11-hit attack 
with three hits, including a leadoff triple. "All we've got to concern 
ourselves with is winning the next two games." 
</P>
<P>
 The past includes being beaten and beaten up by the Blue Jays as Cleveland's 
season waned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're looking for any retribution," Indians' Manager Mike 
Hargrove said. "All I can say is being in a pennant race sure beats the hell 
out of losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Nagy (10-8) held the Blue Jays to a run on six hits over seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 2, Oakland 1 -- Tim Raines singled home Ozzie Guillen with one out in 
the ninth inning to give the White Sox a victory at Oakland and maintain 
Chicago's one-game lead over Cleveland in the Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 14, Texas 4 -- Tino Martinez drove in a career-high six runs, Jay 
Buhner added three RBIs and Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 39th homer as the Mariners' 
tour of the American League reached Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey is hitting .556 (20 for 36) with eight homers and 20 RBI against the 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle is on a 32-day, 30-game trip, extended because of structural problems 
in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Baltimore 5 -- Randy Velarde singled home the winning run with two 
outs in the 11th inning at New York, stopping Baltimore's winning streak at 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Eichhorn (6-5) retired the first two batters in the 11th before walking 
Luis Polonia. Danny Tartabull was hit by a pitch and Velarde looped a single to 
right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Howe (3-0), the fifth Yankee pitcher, was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Boston 2 -- Kevin Tapani (11-7) pitched seven strong innings and 
Matt Walbeck capped a three-run rally sixth inning with a two-run single at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Trlicek (1-1), making his first major league start, gave up three runs 
on four hits in 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 12, Detroit 4 -- Three-run homers by John Jaha and Jeff Cirillo 
highlighted a 10-run seventh inning as the Brewers won at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Miranda (2-5) ended a five-game losing streak. He pitched six innings, 
giving up three runs on eight hits.

NEGOTIATORS KEEP BATS ON SHOULDERS AGAIN; BASEBALL: COMPROMISE APPEARS AS 
ELUSIVE AS EVER AS THE FRIDAY STRIKE DEADLINE APPROACHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There was no progress Monday during negotiations on the non-economic issues in 
baseball's bargaining agreement, no hint of a compromise on the major issue of 
a salary cap and the likelihood of a strike beginning Friday loomed ever 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking apples and oranges," said Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief 
negotiator.  
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations on the proposed salary cap -- strongly opposed by the players' 
union -- will resume Wednesday, but both Ravitch and Don Fehr, the union's 
executive director, said they did not expect either side to change its 
position. If that turns out to be the case, Thursday's games will be the last 
before the players strike Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he was resigned to baseball's eighth work stoppage in 22 years, 
again blamed the owners for forcing it and said he has been unable to convince 
Ravitch that the union will never accept a salary cap despite "hitting him over 
the head with everything except the kitchen sink" on that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ravitch: "I don't want to spark any unrealistic optimism, but when you're 
in a situation like this, I wouldn't dare predict what's going to happen 
between now and Friday. That doesn't mean I think the fairy godmother will 
descend with a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch also said that although the union rejected a salary cap in the last 
two negotiations and he accepts Fehr's rigidity on it, he isn't sure all 800 
players share that ideology, indicating that he believes the owners can outlast 
the players for the first time. He said the owners have no plans to offer any 
other proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' proposal calls for a 50-50 split with the players of all revenue 
generated by both sides -- 58% of the owners' 1994 revenue will go to salaries 
-- along with the elimination of salary arbitration and reduction of free 
agency eligibility from six years of major league service to four, with a 
player's current club having the right to match his best offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ravitch and Fehr said they saw no value in the possible intercession of 
Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who has offered his assistance. A sarcastic Fehr 
added that the only sign of hope was that interim commissioner Bud Selig on 
Sunday, backed off the owners' claim that 19 teams would lose money this year, 
saying the number was 12 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can keep up that kind of progress, maybe we'll be all right," Fehr 
said.

 While Angel management has painfully watched this season unfold, perhaps no 
one has suffered more than second baseman Kevin Flora. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have used four starting second basemen, alternatively moving Damion 
Easley from second to third to second to the bench to second, and Flora knows 
he could have been the mainstay the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very hard to watch," said Flora, who visited with Angel players for 
the first time since spring training, "because it's been a revolving door 
there. But I can't blame anyone, or be mad at anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've brought a lot of this on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who originally was projected to be the Angels' everyday second baseman 
this season, realizes this was another lost season. He missed virtually all of 
last year, and nearly the first three months of this season trying to cope with 
the death of his wife, who was killed April 22, 1992. He was assigned to Class 
A Lake Elsinore after he returned to baseball in July, but now has been out the 
last 10 days with tendinitis in his left knee. Flora said he plans to play in a 
winter league and hopes to contend for a starting job next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels optioned starter Andrew Lorraine, 0-2, 10.61 earned-run average, to 
triple-A Vancouver after Monday's game and recalled reliever Mike James, 5-3, 
5.49 ERA. The move was made to allow Lorraine to continue pitching should there 
be a players' strike. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although the Angels were thwarted in their attempt to acquire center fielder 
Andy Van Slyke from the Pittsburgh Pirates, they are planning to pursue the 
33-year-old Gold Glove winner this winter as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels are successful in acquiring Van Slyke, sources say, they will 
move center fielder Chad Curtis to left field, and then make a decision on whom 
to play at first base, J.T. Snow, Jim Edmonds or Garret Anderson. They likely 
would attempt to trade at least one, if not two of the three players. BOB

THIS TIME, SALMON'S HIT COUNTS; ANGELS: AFTER HITTING HOME RUNS IN FRUSTRATING 
LOSSES, RIGHT FIELDER'S THREE-RUN HOMER IN THE EIGHTH, HELPS BEAT ROYALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Tim Salmon jogged to his position in right field late in Monday's 
Angels-Kansas City Royals game, a strange sensation swept over him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, this is the last inning," he said to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been awhile since the Angels had a big lead and only had to watch their 
starting pitcher preserve it in the top of the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 It also had been awhile since Salmon could say one of his home runs had an 
impact on an Angel victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But both happened in the Angels' 6-1 victory over the Royals at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had stumbled so often recently, primarily because of their poor 
pitching, that Salmon's offensive punch had gone unnoticed. Or at least 
overshadowed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Salmon, who hit a three-run homer in the Angels' pivotal four-run 
eighth, went to play the field in the top of the ninth wondering how the game 
had slipped by so quickly, so trouble-free. Salmon's homer and Mark Langston's 
complete-game victory enabled the Angels a rare night off from blown leads, 
four-hour games and extra-inning losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it's great when you're hitting home runs, but when you're losing it 
doesn't mean as much," Salmon said after hitting his fourth homer in the past 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "You still go home mad if you're losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon's homer, his 23rd this year, came against Kansas City reliever Stan 
Belinda with no outs in the eighth, turning a tight game into a runaway. 
Langston did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Salmon dismissed the notion that he is on a tear similar to the one 
earlier this season, when he hit five homers in four games May 11-15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel hot," Salmon said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 His numbers on the home stand would indicate otherwise. Since returning from 
the disabled list with a strained right hamstring on Aug. 3, Salmon is eight 
for 23 (.349) with four homers, seven RBIs and five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a lot of luck and a lot of bad pitches," he said. "They are 
throwing fastballs right over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon said that's the only reason he has been tormenting pitchers over the 
past four games. That's the difference between this run of homers and the one 
in May. Now, he's hitting mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I was hitting everything no matter where they would throw it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Belinda left a fastball where he shouldn't have and Salmon made 
him pay for his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chad Curtis on second base, after a single, and Chili Davis on first, 
after a walk, Salmon worked the count to 3-and-1 against Belinda. 
</P>
<P>
 When the next pitch came, Salmon sent a drive over the right-center field 
fence. A moment later, Royal Manager Hal McRae replaced Belinda with Mike 
Magnante, but Salmon had put the game out of reach by then.

again Friday, and join triple-A Vancouver by the end of the month. "I'm 
starting to feel good physically now, but the main thing, my mind feels really 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'll be back."

<P>
 In an apparent changing of the guard, Darryl Ashmore practiced at right tackle 
with the first-string offense Monday in place of 19-year veteran Jackie Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the season started today, the starter would be Ashmore," said Jim 
Erkenbeck, offensive line coach."But it could be Jackie tomorrow. There's 
really only one job locked up on the offensive line right now, and that's 
(center) Bern Brostek." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have hedged on choosing a starter, mostly out of respect for Slater, 
who has played in 246 games since joining the team in 1976, more than any other 
player in team history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't made any real decision there because we want to work (Ashmore) in 
there and see how he does," Coach Chuck Knox said. "We haven't designated him 
the starter because it's too early. A lot of things can happen between now and 
that first game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore, a third-year player from Northwestern, started seven games last year 
after Slater was sidelined because of a torn chest muscle and backup Robert 
Jenkins suffered a dislocated toe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback Chris Miller, who sat out practice last week and 
Saturday's 14-6 loss to Green Bay because of a sore stomach, returned to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris threw the ball very well," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox also said backup quarterback T.J. Rubley, who is battling Jamie Martin 
for the third-string position, won't be able to throw for another week because 
of tendinitis in his right elbow.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Steve Israel, who has sat out the last two weeks because of a sore 
thigh muscle, had a light workout and is expected to return to practice today. 
. . . Cornerback Dexter Davis and defensive end Fred Stokes also sat out 
because of ankle and knee injuries. MIKE REILLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell's report card after the Raiders' 27-19 exhibition victory over 
Dallas on Sunday included several good grades, but what pleased him the most 
was the negative X-ray on defensive tackle Chester McGlockton's left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, McGlockton was kicked in the leg that was broken in last 
season's playoff victory over Denver.He did not return to Sunday's game and was 
nervous about being examined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he didn't want to go for X-rays because of what happened to him 
before," Shell said at the team's training camp in Oxnard. "He'd rather test it 
on the field than to find out he had broken it again from X-rays." 
</P>
<P>
 For fellow defensive lineman Willie Broughton, the news was not as good. 
Broughton will sit out for a month because of a dislocated elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Skrepenak, who started at right offensive tackle in place of injured 
Bruce Wilkerson, played three quarters against the Cowboys and despite being 
beat by Tony Tolbert for a safety, received a good report from Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players praised by Shell included rookie linebackers Rob Fredrickson and 
Rob Holmberg, along with second-year linebacker Greg Biekert and defensive end 
Scott Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The player Shell said had made great strides toward making the team, however, 
was defensive end Alberto White, who had two sacks and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being consistent is important but you have to make plays to get people's 
attention," Shell said. "He's had a good camp and has done good things when 
he's been on the field in games. He's letting his play on the field do his 
talking for him." LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL / BILL PLASCHKE; UNIFORMS, RULES ARE NEW, BUT TALK REMAINS THE

 You can change the uniforms of 132 players through the wonders of free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 You can temporarily change the uniforms of 28 teams through an anniversary 
promotion that, at times, will make some of these guys look like Red Grange 
with earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 You can even change the rules so that instead of a commissioner calling for 
players to be drug-tested, it is the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 But take comfort. Two weeks into the exhibition season, on the fields at NFL 
training camps, it's the same old, same old: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Somebody is already talking trash. 
</P>
<P>
 After catching a touchdown pass during drills, tight end Shannon Sharpe of the 
Denver Broncos told his teammates, "I'm like a slot machine, three cherries 
every time -- ching, ching, ching. When I'm in the slot, I'll beat you 10 out 
of 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
 When linebacker Elijah Alexander told Sharpe to pipe down, Sharpe responded: 
"You, 11 out of 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Do you believe us now when we say the Raiders acquired Albert Lewis for the 
express purpose of shutting this guy up? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some oddball is already given a chance to earn a roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Darren Bennett is Crocodile Dundee, but when he received a snap for 
his first practice punt with the San Diego Chargers, he began sprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 As an Australian football star, he was never given the luxury of kicking while 
standing still. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Sorry, mates, I'm still getting used to this,' " said Bennett, whose 
booming kicks could make him the most unlikely player on an opening-weekend 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, 29, signed by the Chargers after a tryout, is a veteran of seven 
seasons in the Australian Rules Football League. You might have seen him on 
cable TV, playing a game that looks like rugby with referees who wave flags. 
</P>

 "At first, I thought that because Americans wear all these pads, they are a 
little soft," Bennett said. "After hearing a few collisions between 
300-pounders, now I see why." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett averaged 44.8 yards in the Chargers' exhibition opener against the 
Atlanta Falcons, and could displace expected starter Kent Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just takes a while to get used to wearing this helmet," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Somebody is learning a new position. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Conway, the Chicago Bear who left USC too early, hasn't quite figured 
out playing wide receiver or punt returner, but what the heck. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the Bears' two-point conversion quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some rookie is making big noise. 
</P>
<P>
 How about that Dallas Cowboy receiver Willie Jackson, a fourth-round draft 
pick from Florida? 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who caught passes for 140 yards against Florida State and for 131 
yards against West Virginia in the Sugar Bowl, has been overcoming his lack of 
speed with several acrobatic catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he made his presence felt with a 26-yard touchdown catch in the second 
quarter of Dallas' 17-9 opening exhibition victory over Minnesota. Jackson had 
five catches for 60 yards against the Vikings, and two for 16 yards against the 
Raiders Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly think Willie is going to be a player, and I've thought that since 
day one," Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman said. "Of all the rookie receivers 
we've had since I've been here, he's as far along as any, including Alvin 
Harper." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some journeyman is valiantly hanging on, while some fat guy is going home. 
</P>
<P>
 Garth Jax, a nine-year veteran linebacker fighting for a backup spot on Buddy 
Ryan's Arizona Cardinal defense, left his feet on several tackles during a 
recent morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he know he was striking gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just gave Garth a $20,000 raise," Ryan announced on the field after 
practice. "If I had known he played this hard, I would have given him the 
$20,000 before practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody then asked Ryan about Gerome Gardner, a 6-foot rookie tackle who 
showed up weighing more than 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fat guy?" he said. "I just cut him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bad teams are getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Five potential starters for the Washington Redskins are already injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Leonard Marshall is still recovering from a broken forearm 
suffered last year. John Gesek, free agent center, has visited the hospital 
because of a back problem. Frank Wycheck, supposedly fighting for the starting 
fullback job, suffered a concussion. Defensive lineman Tim Johnson is sidelined 
because of a pulled hamstring. So is Reggie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 And Heath Shuler finally signed a contract last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Norv Turner. Four and 12 sound about right to you? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Only now they call him "Big Pay:" Johnnie Morton is already our leading 
candidate for rookie of the year. Before catching his first pass as a Detroit 
Lion (for eight yards and a touchdown against the New York Jets on Friday 
night), the former USC wide receiver had already written a check to the 
Pediatric AIDS Foundation. And guess who's paying back his USC scholarship, 
which figured to be in excess of $100,000. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, who could boast football's best turnover ratio last season, 
recently went through a practice without a dropped pass for the first time in 
Coach Bobby Ross' three years there. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Art Modell has owned the Cleveland Browns since 1961, yet he has never been 
asked to introduce any of the Browns' 13 Hall of Fame inductees. Of the two 
Brown Hall of Famers whose careers began after Modell bought the team, receiver 
Paul Warfield was introduced by his high school coach, and running back Leroy 
Kelly, inducted Saturday, chose a sportswriter to introduce him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the Browns' tradition, guess which current player leads the club 
in games played as a Brown? Linebacker Frank Stams, of course, with all of 26 
games in a Cleveland uniform. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Rookie tackle Scott Vaughn retired from the Broncos after three days of 
training camp. "He just said it wasn't what he thought it was going to be," 
Coach Wade Phillips said. "I don't know what he thought it was going to be. The 
big NFL party, I guess." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times: The Green Bay Packers have been forced to cancel their 
annual summer photo day for safety reasons. When 15,000 fans showed up at last 
year's event -- isn't that close to the entire population of the city? -- 
several small children were nearly crushed, and quarterback Brett Favre was 
forced to flee for his life. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The phone number the league has listed for the press room at the Seattle 
Seahawks' training facility is actually the number of a Seattle collection 
agency. "No, this isn't the Seahawks," sighed a representative who answered a 
recent call. "But we do know some of the players." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some things never change -- unfortunately: As part of the NFL's 75th 
anniversary celebration this year, each team will play at least one game 
wearing a uniform from their past. The Indianapolis Colts' contest with the 
Browns on Sept. 25 was originally designated as one such "Throwback" game, but 
then embarrassed officials had to throw it back. Neither team could find a 
uniform from its past that looks any different from what they are wearing 
today. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So far, No. 1 draft choice Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson has been as impressive in 
airports as on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson, of the Cincinnati Bengals, recently finished filming a soft drink 
commercial in which he was painted orange while playing the part of a monster. 
Hustling to catch a flight, he couldn't stay at the studio long enough for 
makeup specialists to remove his orange paint. After seeing the frightened 
reaction of people in a New York airport upon encountering a 320-pound bright 
orange guy, he decided he might have been a bit hasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once I got on the plane, they let me sit where I wanted," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pointing fingers: Good to see Phil Simms iron out his differences with 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, whom Simms said should be drug-tested after 
Tagliabue claimed Simms was not released by the New York Giants because of 
salary-cap differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Disgruntled players realize that their enemy in this salary-cap mess is not 
the league, but themselves, for not paying more attention when their union was 
cutting this horrible deal. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you still don't believe it was horrible, listen to Bronco quarterback 
John Elway, a Stanford graduate who knows more about economics than most of the 
owners: "Funny, but basketball takes their salary cap to court, baseball 
refuses a cap, yet the football union accepted it! One good thing that came out 
of this is that Gene Upshaw still has his job." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In their first intrasquad game, the Bears' offense scored two touchdowns. Last 
year, they had to play an intrasquad game and three exhibitions before scoring 
their second touchdown. The influence of tough Erik Kramer has only begun.

 Somebody is finally cutting open the hidden game of football as people have 
been doing for years with baseball. The outfit is Stats Inc., and its new book, 
"Pro Football Revealed . . . The 100-Yard War," offers an enlightening look 
into the 1993 NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Stats Inc.'s nuggets involving local teams last year: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the no-surprise department, no team averaged fewer yards on first-down 
rushing plays, 3.1, than the Raiders. The longest regular-season rush from 
scrimmage was a league-worst 19 yards, by Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Those who wondered why the Raiders used their first two draft choices on 
defensive players should read this: The Raiders forced fewer fumbles than any 
other team, nine, and gave up more fourth quarter points, 125. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Statistics show that while the Rams improved at quarterback and in the 
defensive line during the off-season, where they truly must improve is in the 
defensive backfield. Ram opponents completed 38.2% of their passes of 20 or 
more yards, nearly 10% higher than the league average of 28.5%. The Ram defense 
also gave up 7.7 passing yards per attempt, worst in the league.

 It was an easy night for veteran Jim Kelly and a rough night for rookie Heath 
Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who had been bothered by tendinitis in his throwing shoulder, completed 
nine of 12 passes, including his first seven, as the Buffalo Bills went on to 
beat the Washington Redskins, 13-11, at Orchard Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler, the No. 3 pick in this year's draft, did not practice with the 
Redskins until Wednesday because of a contract holdout.Playing the second 
quarter, he completed four of 10 passes for 47 yards.

 Mark Vlasic, whose only preseason pass was intercepted, was among five players 
waived by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. . . . Indianapolis Coach Ted Marchibroda 
said that rookie linebacker Trev Alberts will not require surgery on his 
dislocated right elbow. Alberts will be in a cast 10 days and is expected to be 
out four weeks. . . . Dolphin right tackle Ron Heller has been accused of 
slapping a security worker before Miami's game with Pittsburgh on Saturday. 
Heller denies hitting Edwin Mendez in a dispute over a parking space in the 
players' lot at Joe Robbie Stadium.

ART REVIEW; AT NEWPORT: INTO THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art museums worldwide exhibit their permanent collections (as well as the 
temporary shows that garner most of the publicity). Some of these collections 
are lures all by themselves. Have you ever heard of someone who didn't visit 
the Uffizi in Florence or the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam because he or she didn't 
want to see the stuff that was there all the time? 
</P>
<P>
 But at other museums, the collections -- meager, spotty or seldom displayed -- 
are not a draw. That's the situation at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, where 
limited wall space mandates that the 2,300 works of post-World War II art, with 
an emphasis on work made in California, usually are cooped up in storage while 
temporary shows occupy the galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, periodic exhibitions of portions of the collection have given viewers a 
good idea of the museum's holdings. Although the current, museum-filling 
installation of 103 pieces (through Oct. 2) offers a few surprises, these 
recent acquisitions of varying interest confirm earlier assessments of the 
collection's strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presence of significant and delightful works from the past 40-odd 
years, there is a lack of depth, both in relation to individual artists' 
careers and to art historical movements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given Newport Harbor's collecting history and its difficulty in obtaining 
donations, the spottiness is only to be expected. (In the absence of an 
endowment earmarked for acquisitions, the museum has been heavily dependent on 
individual donors, fund-raising by its Acquisition Council, and the Purchase 
Grant program of the National Endowment for the Arts, discontinued three years 
ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1961, the museum didn't receive its first donated work until seven 
years later. Three years after that, the collection expanded abruptly with AVCO 
Financial Services' donation of 34 works by such artists as Louise Nevelson, 
Helen Frankenthaler, Franz Kline and Gene Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, AVCO's Davis painting -- "Canary Bang," a characteristic brilliantly 
hued Hard Edge work -- hangs nowhere near his delicious early painting, 
"Oxford." A broadcloth-like swatch of wavering gray and forest green stripes 
that soak into the canvas, "Oxford" was donated by the artist's widow and 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the installation as a whole is a curious mixture of artfulness and 
awkwardness. Certain works really "speak" to one another -- particularly 
Richard Diebenkorn's "Ocean Park No. 36," Craig Kauffman's untitled painting 
and John Paul Jones' "Divining Rod," all of which reflect a tension between 
linear structure and a romantic image of the void. But there are also some 
jarring juxtapositions, like the intrusion of Nancy Graves' exuberant organic 
sculpture "Laciniform" on the monumental repose of the Bay Area Figurative 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It often is the case that a contemporary art museum acquires work from shows 
it organizes -- thanks, in part, to heightened interest in the artist among 
museum supporters, and the gratitude (and self-interest) of the artist and his 
or her dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 So it isn't surprising that the Newport Harbor's exhibition history is linked 
closely to the growth of the museum collection. The representation of such 
artists as John McCracken, David Park, Frederick Eversley, Chris Burden, Vija 
Celmins, ceramists Kenneth Price and Ron Nagle, Tim Ebner, Barry Le Va, 
Mitchell Syrop, Buzz Spector, Margaret Honda and Nayland Blake reflects this 
vital symbiosis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few years, however, major shows originated by Newport Harbor 
have been few, and recession and changing tax laws have played havoc with 
museum donations nationwide. Recent acquisitions have not significantly fleshed 
out either the modernist or postmodern portions of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Its high points remain the familiar ones: the two ravishing paintings by David 
Park and Elmer Bischoff, the fine early Joan Brown, memorable individual works 
by Edward Kienholz, Wallace Berman, John Altoon, John McLaughlin, Richard 
Diebenkorn, John Baldessari, Ed Ruscha and a few others. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the strongest of the recent acquisitions of older work are Peter 
Alexander's "Six-Part Wall Piece" from 1971, in which the cool serial format is 
undercut by the subtle action of light on polyester resin, and an untitled 
painting by Philip Guston. 
</P>
<P>
 Guston's small painting of a white pointing hand (somewhat resembling a 
clown's gloved gesture or the work of an itinerant sign painter) dates from a 
pivotal year in his oeuvre . In 1968, he abandoned his lyrical, brushy 
abstractions to focus on bluntly rendered objects -- hands, shoes, books -- 
revealing a stubborn insistence on the materiality of everyday life and the 
difficulty of giving any familiar form an independent life in paint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newly acquired postmodern works, Greg Colson's mapping of the 
Oakland Coliseum's seating chart on an inner tube, Spector's metaphorical book 
piece "North Sea (for M.B.)" and Barbara Kruger's untitled photograph are the 
standouts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the mind boggles to consider superior contemporary works 
that might have replaced pieces by Rachel Lachowicz, William Outcault, Alan 
Sonfist and Thomas Nakada. Too bad there wasn't room for the museum's massive 
installations by Bill Viola ("Theater of Memory") and Chris Burden ("Tale of 
Two Cities"), Charles Ray's "Ink Box," Jill Giegerich's untitled sculpture, 
Mary Corse's "Light Painting Grid Series," one of the Jay DeFeo pieces. . . . 
But the exhibition does make a cogent case for raising $3 million to $4 million 
in renovation costs to allow the museum to expand into the former Newport Beach 
library next door to free up more gallery space. Augmented by related works and 
installed with a sensitive hand, the collection may yet become a destination. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Permanent Collection Presentation" continues through Oct. 2 at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission: $2-$4; free on Tuesdays. (714)

POP MUSIC REVIEW; POWERED BY PASSION, THE PROCLAIMERS ENERGIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who can blame the Proclaimers for sounding particularly fervent when singing 
to American audiences about Scottish politics? Ours is, after all, the country 
that created the most famous ersatz-Scotsman of the era, a portly engineer who 
is always whining to Captain Kirk: "I canna give ya any moor poower!"  
</P>
<P>
 The Proclaimers' twin front men, Craig and Charlie Reid, may live in a galaxy 
far, far away from that of "Star Trek's" Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery Scott. But they 
do have at least one trait in common: passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Reids are as passionate about their native Scotland (just listen 
to their unequivocally independence-minded "Cap in Hand") as they are about 
their music, which brims with American roots-rock sources as well as with 
Celtic folk and skiffle. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for all that to be made perfectly clear Sunday night, when 
the Proclaimers played the Coach House. It's hard to imagine that these 
energetic laddies could have mustered even a wee bit more power than they 
expended over the course of their 21-song, 85-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is on its first U.S. tour in five years -- and its first since "I'm 
Gonna Be (500 Miles)," a song the band recorded in 1988, turned into a smash 
single after being featured last year in the film "Benny and Joon". 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an even longer (six-year) lull between albums (reportedly caused by a 
divorce-induced case of writer's block for Charlie Reid), the adrenaline-stoked 
enthusiasm of the first two Proclaimers albums is intact on the new one, "Hit 
the Highway." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, along with the vibrant folk-rock aimed at lifting hearts and 
stirring minds, the boys have added some funky grooves that give the hips and 
feet something to do, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a canny move that lends a temporal balance to this frequently spiritual 
music. It's too bad the Reids didn't bring a saxophonist on tour to add the 
gritty, sensual parts that flesh out several songs on "Hit the Highway." But 
journeyman work by their explosive four-man band, particularly by guitarist 
Stuart Nisbet, made the absence of the sax as painless as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reids may not be Christians (a count on which they frequently express 
reservations in their interviews), but their soulful yearnings certainly are 
God-directed. It's no contradiction that they can castigate smug proselytizers 
in such songs as the new album's title tune and "The Light" (powerfully played 
back-to-back on Sunday), and then turn around to sing, in "The More I Believe": 
</P>
<P>
 The less I believe in me,  
</P>
<P>
 The more I believe in thee.  
</P>
<P>
 As the Reids see it, faith comes differently to each person, and they are 
suspicious of anyone who offers one-size-fits-all answers. Still, they'll 
accept no substitutes for faith, a fact they outline in another nifty section 
of "The More I Believe," answering a couple of knocks on God from one of John 
Lennon's most skeptical periods: 
</P>
<P>
 I don't believe in beads or crystals,  
</P>
<P>
 Instant karma or Mother Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't believe that what I think  
</P>
<P>
 Makes any difference to what I'm worth.  
</P>
<P>
 What does make a difference in the Reids' quests for spiritual truth are their 
roots in everyday life. They still haven't found what they're looking for, but 
unlike U2, they're looking for it with feet planted right here on Earth, not 
floating breathlessly through swirling clouds of mystic haze. 
</P>
<P>
 And the feisty "Shout Shout" showed they aren't so preoccupied with matters of 
the soul that they are beyond an all-too-human marital row. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during the show they reached an utter abandon that was 
breathtaking. The spotlight was mostly on Craig Reid, who puffed his chest, 
jutted his jaw and belted out song after song with a brogue as thick as his 
horn-rimed glasses. The relentlessly infectious "500 Miles" marked one of the 
few times during a rock concert that a singer seemed in danger of inciting a 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Reid laid on sweet high harmonies and pounded his acoustic guitar as 
if the road to heaven were paved with enthusiastic strumming. When Charlie 
threw his head back and took over the lead in the soaring, octave-leaping 
"Sean," it was world-class goose-bump time. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening set by Baltimore's Greenberry Woods, it was a full evening of 
carefully crafted melodic rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woods boast their own pair of twin singers in guitarist Matt and bassist 
Brandt Huseman, who trade off leads with the band's third singer, guitarist Ira 
Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 The group hasn't developed as far as the Proclaimers, but many attractive 
elements are falling into place: distinctive melodies, attractively layered 
harmonies and even a bit of vocal counterpoint -- exceedingly rare in this 
Riffs R Us age. 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics tend to toward the elliptical, which isn't in itself a problem -- 
Crowded House often leaves the listener guessing. But with Crowded House, at 
least the listener remembers what he or she is guessing about. Greenberry 
Woods's catchy melodies cry out for lyrics that are equally memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they did pull it all together occasionally, with "37 (Feels So 
Strange)," "Trampoline" and one or two others included in the briskly paced 
12-song, 37-minute set.

 Blanche Thomas was an 81-year-old minister and grandmother, a much-loved woman 
who, in the words of City Councilman Nate Holden, "gave so much of her life to 
the growth and development of our community." 
</P>
<P>
 As pastor of the small Mt. Zion Churches United parish in the Mid-City area, 
she worked to comfort the elderly, ease the plight of the homeless and curb the 
spread of illicit drugs. And as her daughter, Shirley Jean Better, said Monday, 
"she was very concerned about violence." 
</P>
<P>
 That concern was well-placed. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 25, sometime between midnight and dawn, "a predator who preys upon 
defenseless women" entered Thomas' tidy apartment in the 1700 block of South La 
Brea Avenue, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Ross Moen, commander of detectives at 
the department's Wilshire district station. 
</P>
<P>
 Moen said Blanche Thomas was bound, gagged, sexually assaulted and murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, Better, Moen and Thomas' grandson, Daniel Better, gathered in front of 
the police station Monday to ask the public's help in finding the killer. 
Holden said he will ask the City Council today to approve a $25,000 award for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expect your mother to die peacefully, in her sleep, " Shirley Better 
said. "It is very painful to me that she died in this shocking way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate what the city is doing, to be offering a reward," the victim's 
daughter added. "And I would appreciate any help from anybody . . . not only 
for my mother, but to help assure that this sort of thing can't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Moen said that while some items were stolen from Thomas' home during the 
pre-dawn attack, the intruder is believed to have been more intent on violence 
than on theft. The detective declined to reveal further details about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Better said his grandmother did not answer the phone when he called her 
on Sunday, July 24, "but she's usually busy at the church on Sundays, so we 
weren't concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I called Monday and she didn't answer, I got a bit worried," he 
said. "I went over there, and the door was open. When I went in, I found her 
there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," the young man said. "I yelled out, 'Grandma! 
Grandma!' Then I called the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said in a prepared statement that the victim, a native of 
Arkansas, taught school there before moving to Chicago and marrying Samuel 
Thomas in 1934. When her husband died in 1971, she moved to Los Angeles to be 
closer to her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Long active in church affairs, she was ordained 10 years ago to the ministry 
of the Mt. Zion Churches United, where, the family said, "she worked tirelessly 
to establish an urban ministry that would be especially responsive to the needs 
of the poor and the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 "Although she was 81, she was still bowling in a bowling league," her daughter 
said. "She was a very active, very happy person."

UPWARD BOUND; SCHOOL DISTRICT ARBOREAL COWBOY WILL REPRESENT THE WEST IN THE 
'OLYMPICS OF TREE CLIMBING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marty Bedwell's long, slow climb to the top started 15 years ago, soon after 
he had hitchhiked to California from Michigan with $250 and a six-string 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend told him that a tree trimmer was looking for help. So Bedwell, a high 
school dropout facing a cash crunch, found himself scaling the palms and 
Chinese elms that grace the valleys of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bedwell is a 33-year-old tree surgeon for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District -- and the best tree climber in the West. Or so says the International 
Society of Arboriculture, a tree-care trade association that is hosting a 
worldwide tree climbing competition this month in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedwell, who is taking part in that contest, describes himself as part of a 
dying breed of arboreal cowboys -- tree surgeons who still sharpen their own 
handsaws and tie their own bowline knots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in doing things the nowadays way and all that, but I'm a relic to 
some," the Westchester resident said one recent evening, after lowering himself 
from a eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the sweat has left tree doctoring; these days arborists generally 
hoist themselves in hydraulic cherry-pickers. But there is a good chance those 
modern pruners will never see the world, and its trees, in quite the same way 
as Bedwell and his fellow L.A. Unified tree surgeons, who still grunt their way 
up a trunk with nothing more than ropes, elbow grease and panache. 
</P>
<P>
 "How high can I go?" Bedwell asked. "How high is the tree?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That can-do spirit -- and Bedwell's muscular 195-pound physique -- will be put 
to the test in Halifax on Aug. 13, where entrants will compete for the top 
prize: a rectangular belt buckle featuring a bas-relief tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago he placed 11th out of 25 finalists in the arboriculture 
society's contest, making him one of the world's elite tree climbers. Then, as 
now, he was the champion representing Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty is quick, he does safe operations, he's skillful and graceful," said 
Rose Epperson, secretary of the Southern California Tree Trimmers Jamboree, the 
event where Bedwell took first prize and won the right to compete in Nova 
Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Olympics of tree climbing," Ed Brennan, a San Francisco-based 
board member of the arboriculture group, said of the Halifax event. "It's 
different than lumberjack competitions because we're usually not cutting the 
trees down." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to pruning trees, arborists study botany and learn how to diagnose 
and treat plant diseases. Many refer to themselves as tree surgeons, though 
that term has grown outdated in recent years, Epperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to California law, private landscapers, including arborists, must be 
licensed by the State Contractors Licensing Board. Applicants need at least 
four years experience in landscaping and must renew the license every two 
years. However, public employees such as Bedwell are exempted from the license 
requirement as long as they work only on government property, according to the 
licensing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said tree workers may also be certified as arborists by the society. 
The society requires applicants to pass a test and take continuing education 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree climbing competitions have grown into a near sport, though Epperson 
said they began as teaching tools for younger arborists. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said that virtually all entrants in the society's competition are 
professional arborists. A few are women, he added, though the profession is 
dominated by males. Epperson said the western chapter has 1,200 members and the 
society has 7,000 members worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not supposed to win," Bedwell said of this year's competition. "I'm not 
tall, I'm not young, I'm not lightweight. Those 20-year-old guys can really get 
up there and jam." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Angelo Robinson, a senior tree surgeon who supervises Bedwell's tree 
trimming for the school district, believes that his employee is equal to the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty is very efficient in a tree," Robinson said. "He knows all the latest 
climbing techniques and applies it to his job. To see him not only use ropes 
and knots to climb a tree, but also move around and make the tree look pretty, 
is really a sight." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bedwell practiced climbing and swinging on the pale pink branches of a 
75-foot eucalyptus recently at Emerson Manor School in Westchester, he caught 
the eyes of more than a few passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gravity is the biggest nuisance facing the tree climber. Bedwell begins every 
ascent by pitching a throw line -- a black cord with what looks like a red 
beanbag on one end -- over a branch 20, 30, 40 or more feet overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 To the unpracticed, this is a little like trying to thread a microscopic 
needle in a stiff head wind. But Bedwell, who can toss the bag dozens of feet 
with just a flick of the wrist, explains that the throw line is necessary 
because most climbing ropes are too heavy and unwieldy to hurl with accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 With the throw line in place, Bedwell attaches a braided climbing rope to one 
end and pulls it over the branch. Then he cinches a leather saddle around his 
legs and backside and shimmies up the rope using a "foot-lock" maneuver -- legs 
pressed together with the rope looped around one foot for support. 
</P>
<P>
 The ascent and the tree work do not always go smoothly. In 1986, he fell out 
of a tree and broke his wrist. A few years earlier, he required 245 stitches in 
one leg after he lost his grip on a chain saw. Amazingly, he worked the next 
day grinding stumps. Both accidents happened, he says, shaking his head, 
"because I was in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Bedwell's wife, Linda, an electrician at UCLA, said: "I don't worry 
too much about Marty, because he's good at what he does and is pretty safe." 
</P>
<P>
 In competition, Bedwell will have to climb 40 feet in less than 15 seconds and 
perform an aerial rescue of a dummy perched in a tree. He could probably make 
the trip faster if he wore spiked shoes, but that is not allowed; it would rip 
the bark to shreds, violating the spirit of arboriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "A true arborist will never hurt the tree," said Bedwell, who rails against 
tree surgeons who take reckless shortcuts and prune branches down to stubs, 
thus exposing the bark to the scalding sun. More of a hard-hat realist than a 
naturalist, he nevertheless considers himself a student of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trees are real smart," he said. "Look at the pine bark beetle, which gets 
inside the bark and tries to attack the tree. A healthy tree will just start to 
close its bark and get tighter and kill that beetle." 
</P>
<P>
 For Bedwell, there is no higher calling than climbing -- and caring for -- 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main reason for continuing to climb is I love it. I get to climb outside 
and learn something new every day," he said. "And we're preserving something 
for the future, something we need. Preserving a tree that one day may be 100 
years old. . . . that's just so cool."

SCHOOLS TAKE HARD LINE ON WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Renee Benson used an emotional plea. Vickie Yates used an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women tried to dissuade the Los Angeles Board of Education last week from 
expelling their children for having weapons at school, a problem that has 
prompted tougher punishments in an effort to stem campus shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made a stupid mistake but sometimes children of 13 make stupid mistakes," 
Benson said, her eyes brimming with tears. Benson's 13-year-old daughter admits 
she brought a BB gun that looked like a revolver to Lawrence Middle School in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates' 14-year-old son admits he knew there was a 9-millimeter handgun in his 
locker at Wright Middle School in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases, typical of the expulsions reviewed by the board every two 
weeks, underscore the rigidity of the school board's policy, critics say. Board 
members find themselves with little or no leeway in weapons cases, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson's daughter was expelled. Yates' attorney, Wendy Segall, had better 
luck, in part because Yates' son says he had not even touched the gun. Segall 
persuaded the board to delay a decision on the case until mid-September, as 
well as review a portion of the Los Angeles Unified School District's expulsion 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members who support the 15-month-old policy say they would rather expel 
students for bringing guns to school than reassign them to other campuses, 
which is what the district did for years.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they say, students can reapply for admission to Los Angeles schools, 
usually within six months of expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board is not unanimous on the issue. "The cost for these kids is just 
too high," said school board member Jeff Horton, who opposes the district's 
expulsion policy for students under 16. "Kicking a kid out of school -- in my 
mind -- only encourages antisocial behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 State and district officials say they have little choice. They do not want to 
reassign students to other campuses if there is a chance of violence.  
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is you have to have a rigid policy because (weapons possession) 
is so prevalent," said Maureen DiMarco, Gov. Wilson's secretary of education 
and child development. "Certainly in Los Angeles where they've had students 
tragically killed with weapons, I think you have to have strong policies." 
</P>
<P>
 The board policy, strengthened more than a year ago, requires students who 
bring guns to school -- including BB guns and stun guns -- to be expelled from 
the district. Previously, those students could be assigned to other campuses 
within the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law governing expulsions is less severe. It allows districts to 
either expel students or to transfer them. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1993-94 school year, the board expelled 166 students for bringing 
guns to school. In 1992-93, the board expelled 256 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The board excused just two students from the expulsion policy in the last 18 
months. Both cases involved BB guns found in the students' lockers. The board 
-- and the officials who review each case -- found that the students had 
intended to inform authorities about the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say Benson's daughter -- known to the school board as Case 
494 -- and Yates' son -- known as Case 581 -- are typical of the dozens of 
expulsion cases they review. Both students had minor behavioral problems and 
received mostly Cs and Ds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their trouble with school district authorities, the two face 
charges in the Juvenile Court system. If found guilty of bringing firearms to 
school, a felony, they could be sentenced to a maximum of four years detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Both say they are, at most, guilty of being loyal to their friends, even for 
the wrong reasons. Their parents say the children did not have the emotional 
maturity to turn in their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickie Yates' son said his best friend brought a handgun and bullets to school 
on May 24. He said his friend showed him the gun before classes began.  
</P>
<P>
 The boy told Yates' son that he needed it for protection because he had been 
threatened by 18- and 19-year-old gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'No matter what you do, don't put it in my locker,' " said Yates' 
son, who shared a locker with the boy in violation of school rules. But after 
lunch, Yates' son went to his locker and saw the gun. He said he told his 
friend to remove the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the friend ignored Yates' son and boasted to other kids about the handgun, 
even showing it to classmates. Then somebody told. Yates' son was taken to the 
office, arrested by police and then kicked out of school. His friend also was 
arrested and, eventually, expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Yates' son has spent his time playing computer games, walking his 
dog and thinking about what's next. His mother keeps a chalkboard list of his 
chores posted in the kitchen, that includes homework and cleaning his room. At 
the top, she wrote, "I love you."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grader says he has learned his lesson. "I don't care who my friends 
are -- I will tell next time," he said. "I don't ever want to go through this 
again. I would tell someone immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, single and a legal secretary in Century City, said she hired an 
attorney after talking to the lawyers at her firm. Yates said she decided to 
take their advice, even though hiring an attorney will cost her at least 
$1,500, which is creating a financial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to get a job and pay this back," Yates said of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Yates' efforts have paid off. Segall, the attorney, is arguing that 
the youth's expulsion be overturned based on a legal technicality involving the 
definition of possession. The boy, she says, should not have been considered to 
be in possession of the weapon because it was in a locker he shared with 
another student. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy dialogue between Segall, the district's lawyers and other 
officials, the board Monday night took five votes on the issue and ended up 
agreeing to delay the case and review that section of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 While the board debated the youth's case for about an hour, Renee Benson says 
she was ignored. Benson, who said she waited six hours before she could speak 
to the board last week, gave an impassioned plea, ending with tears rolling 
down her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it your goal to make my daughter a gang member or a criminal by turning 
her out into the street?" she said. "I am asking every single one of you to 
rescue my child and allow her back into school." 
</P>
<P>
 It was her second attempt to get the board to overturn her daughter's 
expulsion, but the board swiftly and without comment turned her down. 
</P>
<P>
 The board action means Benson's daughter cannot attend any district school for 
at least six months. After that she can apply for re-admission, and the 
decision would be up to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl says a friend handed her the BB gun before she got on the school bus 
in April. The girl says she did not want to take the weapon, but her friend 
asked her to keep it until after school. 
</P>
<P>
 When she got to school, Benson's daughter said she let another friend borrow 
her jacket -- with the empty BB gun in the pocket. The friend showed it to 
other students and before long, the girl was pulled out of class and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother says she is placing her daughter in a special county-run school for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's worth saving -- she's not violent," Renee Benson said. ". . . (But) 
their policy makes no provision for stupid mistakes."

DEFENSE FIGHTS MEDIA BID IN SIMPSON CASE; COURTS: JUDGE IS ASKED TO DENY 
REQUEST BY NEWS ORGANIZATIONS TO VIEW PHOTOS OF VICTIMS AT THE SCENE. MATTER 
WILL BE CONSIDERED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's defense lawyers have asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
to deny the request of several media organizations for limited access to 
photographs of the scene where Simpson's ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers contend that if the request to view the photos were 
granted, it probably would prejudice Simpson's right to a fair trial and make 
it more difficult to impanel an impartial jury.  
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys also urged that Judge Lance A. Ito deny the media 
organizations' request to unseal transcripts of closed conferences held by 
another judge during Simpson's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the prejudicial value of the requested materials is great, the 
disclosure of the requested evidence would stifle the ability of both the 
defense and the prosecution . . . to impanel an impartial jury, especially in 
light of the unprecedented extent of the publicity generated in this case," 
according to a brief filed Monday by Carl E. Douglas, one of Simpson's 10 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief was filed in response to a motion by Cable News Network, CBS, the 
Copley Press, the Los Angeles Times, Newsweek and USA Today asking for access 
to the material. Judge Ito is scheduled to hear the motion today. 
</P>
<P>
 During Simpson's preliminary hearing last month, photos of the bloody bodies 
of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were shown to witnesses who had found the 
bodies. But they were presented in such a way that they could not be seen by 
the courtroom audience, shown on live television or reproduced in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel that if the media does have access to (the photos) . . . they 
will show (them) every time they talk about the case . . . that it's just 
better, more prudent to not release the crime scene photos," Municipal Judge 
Kathleen Kennedy-Powell said during a closed July 5 hearing, the transcript of 
which subsequently became public. 
</P>
<P>
 However, photos of pools of blood and a bloody glove were shown publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 29, Los Angeles attorney Kelli I. Sager, representing the media 
organizations, formally asked Ito to allow the organizations "to have access to 
photographs used at the preliminary hearing, solely for the limited purpose of 
viewing the photographs, without making copies, videotaping or otherwise 
replicating the exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the public and the press have a right to access under the 1st 
Amendment to judicial proceedings, including transcripts and other records of 
preliminary hearings, which can only be overcome by a showing that "closure is 
essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to that interest." 
Sager said that there has been no such showing in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Simpson's lawyers retorted that there is no presumption of openness 
regarding the photographs because they were not shown at the preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police sources downplayed the significance of an ice cream vendor's 
account of seeing Nicole Simpson on the evening of her death and of a partially 
frozen dessert found after her body was discovered. Bill Chang, the store 
manager of a Brentwood Ben & Jerry's ice cream store, on Sunday said Nicole 
Simpson and an unidentified man came into the store with her children on the 
night of June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sources close to the case said a police officer at the scene reported 
that a small container of a partially melted dessert was found inside Nicole 
Simpson's condominium, law enforcement sources said there is no evidence 
supporting a defense theory that Nicole Simpson and Goldman were therefore 
alive later than police and prosecutors have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was cool and police sources said that the officer who noticed the 
dessert did not document the extent to which it had melted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, any suggestion that the victims were alive after about 10:30 p.m. is 
contradicted by other, more solid evidence in the case, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the preliminary hearing, a witness testified that he found Nicole 
Simpson's dog wandering in the neighborhood with bloody paws about 10:35 p.m., 
which police take as convincing evidence that the two victims had been killed 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing is important because prosecutors have sought to show that Simpson 
could have committed the killings and still made it home in time to meet a 
limousine that took him to the airport later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 At the preliminary hearing, the limousine driver said he buzzed Simpson's 
intercom for about 15 minutes without getting an answer before noticing a 
shadowy figure striding across the football superstar's lawn shortly before 11 
p.m. on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure disappeared into Simpson's home and moments later Simpson answered 
the intercom, the driver testified. The chauffeur said he and Simpson left for 
the airport about 11:15 or 11:20 p.m., rushing so that Simpson could catch an 
11:45 p.m. flight for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Simpson-related media controversy, the New Yorker magazine, 
responding to a threatened lawsuit by Los Angeles Police Detective Mark 
Fuhrman, has offered to publish a letter from Fuhrman. In its July 25 issue, 
the New Yorker quoted anonymous members of the Simpson defense team calling 
Fuhrman a racist and a "bad cop," who might have planted a key piece of 
evidence to be hailed as "the hero of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's attorneys, Robert H. Tourtelot and Laurie J. Butler, wrote to the 
New Yorker last week demanding a correction of what they called the "bald and 
untruthful claim" that the detective planted evidence. After the New Yorker 
article was published, police sources said that it would have been all but 
impossible for Fuhrman to have taken a bloody glove from the crime scene and 
transported it to Simpson's home, but those sources were not quoted in the New 
Yorker piece. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Tourtelot's letter, a New Yorker lawyer said the magazine 
continues to believe the article was "consistent with the highest standards, 
ethics and traditions of American journalism," but offered to publish a letter 
from Fuhrman or his lawyers explaining their position. The letter would be 
followed by comment from the magazine, the New Yorker attorney stated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would urge you and your client to give serious consideration to this 
alternative," attorney Devereux Chatillon said in a letter dated Aug. 5. "It 
would allow Detective Fuhrman's views and feelings to be expressed publicly and 
in words he chooses or approves." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatillon also warned Fuhrman's attorneys against pursuing a lawsuit, stating 
that "such litigation can be destructive and can have the paradoxical effect of 
extending the life of a public controversy long after it otherwise would have 
faded."

LEGISLATIVE PANEL KILLS BILL FOR PURCHASE OF WATER COMPANY; SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEY: PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE LET THE PUBLICLY FUNDED CASTAIC LAKE AGENCY BUY A 
PRIVATE FIRM. OPPONENTS SAID THE TRANSACTION WOULD BENEFIT AN AREA DEVELOPER.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Senate committee on Monday killed a bill that would have allowed the 
publicly funded Castaic Lake Water Agency to buy a private water company, a 
proposal opponents say was intended to benefit the Santa Clarita Valley's 
biggest developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers denied its benefit to developers, saying it simply makes good planning 
sense to acquire water supplies at a time of lingering drought. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents feared the bill would be used to shift huge quantities of water 
from existing Santa Clarita Valley users to 70,000 future residents of a 
housing development proposed there. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the attempt by the Castaic Lake Water Agency to buy the private 
Santa Clarita Water Co. The acquisition would also settle a pending lawsuit 
between the two water suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castaic Lake agency is a public wholesaler that buys State Water Project 
water and sells it to 150,000 people in the Santa Clarita Valley. And although 
the taxpayer-supported Castaic Lake agency can purchase the smaller, private 
company, a change in the law is needed before it can legally operate it as a 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now public water agencies, such as Castaic, can only sell to retailers, who in 
turn provide water to household and business customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), an expert on water issues in the 
Legislature, said he had agreed to author the bill after Castaic Lake Water 
Agency officials told him residents backed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Cortese said, he was surprised at how vehement local critics 
were in demanding safeguards to prevent the Castaic Lake Water Agency from 
diverting Santa Clarita Water Co. resources to the area's influential 
developer, Newhall Land & Farming Co. He said he understood that the 
acquisition would play a key role in the company's development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall company through a spokeswoman denied any connection between their 
development plans and the Castaic Lake agency's desire to own and operate the 
Santa Clarita Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But local critics said they believe the Castaic Lake Water Agency, a small 
outfit with a lot of lobbying muscle, was at least partly interested in 
benefiting the Newhall firm, which transformed the Santa Clarita Valley from 
onion farms to fields of suburban homes. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cortese said he attempted to address the concerns by linking the Castaic 
Lake Water Agency bill to broader legislation he authored to improve water use 
planning in California. The landmark bill would have required that ample water 
supplies be available before new subdivisions are approved, a common-sense but 
controversial departure from past policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Cortese said, the legislation would have provided protection for 
Santa Clarita Valley residents, as well as others statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was the splicing of Castaic Lake's measure to the bigger bill 
that seemed to diminish its chances on Monday, as a parade of building industry 
lobbyists registered their objections before the Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In snuffing out both bills Monday, Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) insisted he was not ruling on their merits, but on the timing: the 
Legislature is due to shut down for the year in one month. Lockyer said it was 
too late in the session to consider complex water issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Monday's action, mistrust persisted among some Santa Clarita 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where there is lobbying smoke, there's all kinds of special interest fire," 
said Allan Cameron, a community activist and co-founder of SCOPE, or the Santa 
Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment. "Now they will run around 
town trying to find another lawmaker to carry it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron said he believes that Newhall Land & Farming Co. would obtain valuable 
new water supplies if the Castaic Lake agency is permitted to take over the 
Santa Clarita Water Co. and its ground water rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron, and others in the community, see links between Castaic Lake's elected 
and appointed board and the powerful development company. One of the appointed 
members of Castaic Lake's 11-member board, for example, is a representative 
from the Valencia Water Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Newhall Land & 
Farming. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Santa Clarita Water Co. serves the eastern portion of the Valley, 
the Valencia Water Co. supplies water to the western Valley and will serve the 
future Newhall Ranch, a massive planned development that will cover 19 square 
miles and house 70,000 residents by the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 In good years, both private companies get state water project water from the 
Castaic Lake Water Agency -- as well as from their own ground-water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valencia Water Co. could very easily obtain the ground-water rights of 
the Santa Clarita Water Co. if the Castaic Lake Water Agency became the 
retailer," said Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Castaic Lake Water Agency officials did not return calls Monday, 
Cortese -- who worked closely with the agency in developing the legislation -- 
seemed to affirm a tie-in with Newhall Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently there is a pending proposal in the Santa Clarita area to build a 
substantial number of homes," Cortese said after the committee meeting. "It's 
my understanding that in the minds of a lot of people, the question of whether 
Newhall Ranch goes forward is the question of whether enough water is there and 
who will provide it . . . that if Castaic could buy the Santa Clarita Water 
Co., that would provide the water for Newhall Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 But Newhall spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said there was no connection between 
the water agency's plans and Newhall Ranch, although the firm sent a July 1 
letter to a Senate consultant in support of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just started the process of getting Newhall Ranch approved. The 
decision-making is now in the hands of Los Angeles County," Lauffer said 
Monday. "The Castaic Lake Water Agency's role is simply to make sure there's 
water available after whatever approval comes from the county planning 
agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the bill insist the acquisition is needed to settle a longstanding 
lawsuit filed against the wholesaler by the Santa Clarita Water Co. four years 
ago when the smaller outfit was cut off from its state water supply at the 
height of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges the Castaic Lake agency was not providing Santa Clarita with 
its due share of the state water project water. Presumably the action would die 
after the proposed purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Santa Clarita Water Co. says it is a willing seller -- and in 
fact has narrowed its search for a buyer down to the Castaic Lake Water Agency 
-- a price tag has not been disclosed.

WOMAN IS SENTENCED FOR FALSE AID CLAIM; EARTHQUAKE: WOMAN GETS PROBATION FOR 
FRAUDULENTLY COLLECTING FEMA MONEY BY CLAIMING SHE LIVED AT NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After telling a judge she has been plagued by shame and remorse, a Carson 
woman was sentenced to three years probation Monday for receiving $2,300 in 
federal aid by falsely claiming to have lived in the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments, where 16 people died during the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter opted to give Denise Jones, 36, a 
chance, despite requests by prosecutors to sentence her to three months at a 
correctional facility for illegally obtaining aid from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 36, who has since returned the money, pleaded guilty in April to one 
count of making a false claim to a government agency in order to seek FEMA aid 
by phoning an assistance line and giving her address as Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand what's with you," Hatter told Jones. "What's your 
problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't thinking at all about what I did," Jones replied. "I had a drug 
dependency and it caused a lot of problems with my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in agony," she said. "I'm very ashamed of what I have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were tipped off to Jones, and three others who falsely used the 
Northridge Meadows address to collect emergency aid, by a mail carrier who 
found himself delivering mail -- including FEMA material -- to unfamiliar names 
at the apartment complex after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes were considered particularly ghoulish among a rash of quake-fraud 
attempts because of the high death toll at the collapsed apartment building, 
which made it the disaster's deadliest address. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three others who used Northridge Meadows addresses have already been 
convicted of the same charges Jones faced. Two received prison terms -- Daniel 
Richards of Hollywood was sentenced to two months in prison and Miguel Cordero 
of Van Nuys was sentenced to four months in prison -- while Mary Mitchell of 
Paramount also received three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cordero's case, authorities said he filed a FEMA claim using the apartment 
number where mechanic Pil Soon Lee and his 14-year-old son, Hwon, were crushed 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 When reviewing Jones' case, Hatter apparently was influenced in her relatively 
light sentence by the fact that Jones has a young daughter. Jones also told 
Hatter she has been off drugs for a year and a half and that she has been 
taking parenting lessons. Jones did not elaborate in court on the relationship 
between her earlier drug problems and filing a false FEMA claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments before imposing the probation sentence, Hatter told Jones she owes 
debts to herself, her child and society that cannot be paid from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time you start repaying some of these," Hatter said. "You've just got to 
stop doing these things that are self-destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 In contention was why Jones did not immediately return the aid money -- which 
she said she never spent -- to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Eda Suh, a federal public defender, told Hatter that the money was not 
returned sooner because federal authorities failed to tell Jones where to send 
the check. Suh described Jones as "shy and timid." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Edward Moreton, however, pointed out that since the 
Northridge quake hundreds of people have returned money they were not entitled 
to receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, he said, "was not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the hearing, a man who identified himself as Jones' father said, 
"We're just glad it's over. We're relieved." He declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Jones is one of as many as 30 people who have been charged 
with filing false claims following the Jan. 17 quake. A multi-agency task force 
began making the arrests to signal that law enforcement authorities planned on 
pursuing opportunists who took advantage of quake aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional investigations are continuing, authorities said.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED; NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FINALLY ABOUT TO OPEN IN EAST 
CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After five years of effort and despite two failed bond initiatives, Pleasant 
Valley Elementary School District administrators are about to open a new 
elementary campus to ease overcrowding in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The 710-student Tierra Linda School, located off Woodcreek Road in the Mission 
Oaks area, is set to open Sept. 6, drawing primary-grade students from several 
crowded campuses in the eastern part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Because financing the $6.3-million project was so difficult -- voters narrowly 
rejected two bond measures in 1991 -- the new school lacks a multipurpose room. 
And in that room's place sits a temporary trailer that provides the additional 
bathrooms required by state law for a school of that size. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, district officials say they are thrilled that the school is finally 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a great place to teach students and a great place for 
them to learn," said school board President Jan McDonald. "We're playing 
catch-up in terms of our building program, but I'm so glad we have reached this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the new site, the growing 13-campus district still needs to build 
two more elementary schools in the next 15 years, Supt. Shirley Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By having Tierra Linda operational, we will be able to cut down on the amount 
of busing we're doing and lessen the crowding," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the bond failures, Carpenter said the district paid for the new 
school by selling bond-like certificates, borrowing money from banks and using 
developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This week, as construction workers put final touches on the school, officials 
are hoping its design will help students learn. The school is composed of six 
oversized classrooms with movable walls surrounding a large common area for 
group activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The carpeted buildings are wired for fiber-optic lines and heavy computer use. 
The school also features natural lighting and special kid-sized equipment and 
furniture -- from desks to cabinets and even sinks. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials and building designers said the school, atop a hill on 5 
1/2 acres, is itself "smart." Electronic monitors are programmed to start and 
stop cooling and lighting systems as people leave or enter rooms, saving on 
energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other features include sinks with fold-away doors to allow wheelchair access 
and classroom storage cabinets with angled tops to prevent the stacking of 
objects that could fall and hurt students during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is beige with red Spanish-tile roofs. It has two sets of brightly 
colored playground equipment, mounted on thick rubber matting for safety. 
Doorways and window frames have been painted bright green. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our goal to design a building that would fit with the character of the 
neighborhood, but would have a sense of self too," said Dave Cartnal, whose 
architectural firm designed the school.  
</P>
<P>
 "We strive in our designs to get away from institutional looks. We want to 
design places that are cheerful, that actually fit kids and which promote 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Quinby-Anders, Tierra Linda's new principal, said a committee of 
teachers, administrators and maintenance workers met for more than four years 
to recommend design features. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we obviously couldn't afford all of the suggestions, a great deal of 
them were incorporated into the final design," Quinby-Anders said. "It's been a 
very exciting time for us. We can't wait to get the school open." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Tierra Linda Elementary School, 1201 Woodcreek Road, is set to open Sept. 6. 
On that first day, parents are welcome to attend with their children for 
orientation and informal tours. Pleasant Valley School District officials have 
set formal dedication ceremonies at the site Sept. 8 at 4 p.m. For more 
information, call the district at 482-2763.

D.A.'S ACTIONS AGAINST JURIST MEET RESISTANCE; LAW: COURT OFFICIALS TRY TO 
FORCE PROSECUTORS TO ABANDON ATTEMPT TO BAN JUDGE FROM HEARING NEW FELONY 
CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly four months after Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury first banned one of 
the county's longest-serving judges from hearing new criminal cases, court 
officials are fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 Effective Monday, they began assigning all new felony cases to the judge that 
Bradbury has tried to remove from felony cases: Lawrence Storch of the Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury can still keep Storch off new cases, as he has since mid-April, by 
continuing to order his deputy prosecutors to sign affidavits alleging that the 
judge is biased against the district attorney's office. Under the law, each 
side in a case has one chance to get rid of a judge without actually having to 
prove bias. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges say that if Bradbury insists on continuing his crusade, he will 
have to exhaust his one and only chance to disqualify a judge on Storch. That, 
in turn, will force the prosecutor to accept whatever judge is then assigned 
the case -- one that might be equally unpalatable to Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, cases removed from Storch's court will be rerouted to the 
presiding judge, Melinda A. Johnson. She will keep a share of them and reassign 
the rest to the four remaining felony judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Johnson was the subject of a similar blanket 
disqualification, judges said. Now prosecutors who disqualify Storch will have 
to settle for Johnson in some cases, unless they can present evidence of bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure you either take Judge Storch or you use your affidavit," said 
Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr., chief of the felony division. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense attorneys applauded the judges' decision to fight back on the 
Storch issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, one said, the county's judges were loath to take on the powerful 
and combative Bradbury. Veteran criminal defense attorney George Eskin said 
prosecutors apparently did not expect the judges to resist this time, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they expected was that they were going to just put Judge Storch out of 
business and tell us who to have sit on criminal cases," Eskin said. "I can't 
think of any precedent in this county where the court hasn't just shrugged its 
shoulders and acquiesced in this kind of situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury was out of the office and unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But his top aide maintained that the district attorney's office will continue 
disqualifying Storch from criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will not change our practice with respect to Judge Storch," Chief Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said. "We will continue to disqualify him." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee also denied that the district attorney's office, by disqualifying 
Storch, is trying to dictate who sits on the felony bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges' move will have little impact, McGee said, because prosecutors 
rarely try to knock a judge off a case. Storch is an exception, he said, 
because prosecutors consider him unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors announced on April 19 that they would begin using affidavits to 
ban Storch from hearing new felony cases. The move came several weeks after 
Storch voided a jury's first-degree murder conviction of a Newbury Park man and 
convicted him of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch said the evidence did not support the more serious charge. It is one of 
several disagreements with Bradbury's office since Storch was appointed to the 
Superior Court in 1977 by former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The action to disqualify Storch drew strong criticism, including disagreement 
from some of Bradbury's own deputy prosecutors, who said they would refuse to 
follow the directive to disqualify Storch. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for taking the retaliatory action announced Monday, judges said, 
was the need to rebuild Storch's inventory of cases, which has diminished since 
the disqualifications began. As Storch's caseload dropped, court officials have 
had to assign him some civil cases to keep him busy. 
</P>
<P>
 If prosecutors do not stop challenging Storch, judges said they will have to 
decide whether to permanently assign him to another section of the Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to manage our caseload the best we can," said Municipal Court 
Presiding Judge John R. Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the fact that the county's biggest law firm, the district 
attorney's office, has elected to uniformly use that (disqualification) rule as 
a way to keep Judge Storch from hearing criminal cases, we have no other 
alternative but to continue to (try) cases the best way we can."

EXCAVATION OF RARE MAMMOTH TO BEGIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One scientist made his name excavating more than 50 mammoths from a sinkhole 
in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 Another did her dissertation on the pygmy mammoths that roamed the Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 A third has studied the unique geological formations on the islands and can 
tell the age of sediment surrounding a rare pygmy mammoth fossil. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of scientists from across the country will converge on Santa Rosa 
Island today to excavate the fossil from an eroding sand dune. If their hunch 
is correct, this could be the first complete skeleton ever found of the extinct 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 They can't wait to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of the night before Christmas," Channel Islands National Park 
archeologist Don Morris said as the scientists gathered Monday. "That's where 
we are right now. We've been looking at this package under the tree for several 
weeks. We're ready to open it." 
</P>
<P>
 They're not the only one waiting for answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian scientists have called to see how the Channel Islands discovery 
compares with tiny mammoths unearthed on a Siberian island. National Geographic 
magazine is sending a photographer. The Smithsonian Institution may send a 
paleontologist, said park spokeswoman Carol Spears. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, scientists have found no more than one or two complete limbs of the 
species, which grew to between four and six feet high. This skeleton, if 
complete, could tell scientists how the diminutive creature moved, what it ate 
and exactly how tall it grew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know a great deal about mammoths, and we probably know less about 
the pygmy mammoths," said Larry Agenbroad, a geologist who studies the breed at 
the Mammoth Site in Hot Springs, S.D., and at Northern Arizona University. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing the exposed skull and vertebrae of the pygmy mammoth on Santa 
Rosa, he estimates that the skeleton is at least 85% intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Agenbroad became intrigued with mammoths during digs in southern Arizona. The 
scientists there were searching for the spears and pottery of prehistoric man. 
Agenbroad wanted to know more about the beasts they were slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Agenbroad and his colleague, Jim Mead, once discovered a cave full of mammoth 
dung, 300 cubic yards of it. Analysis of the stuff revealed the diet of the 
North American creatures, which turned out to be very similar to their Siberian 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Roth, a biology professor at Duke University in North Carolina, studied 
the Channel Islands pygmy mammoth species as a graduate student. Interested in 
the evolution of mammals, she explored the dynamics of large species moving to 
small islands and shrinking over successive generations -- as pygmy mammoths 
are believed to have done. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rockwell, a geologist at San Diego State University, has tramped all over 
the Channel Islands in his study of marine terraces and other geological 
formations. He was on a field trip in June when he stumbled across the pygmy 
mammoth fossil. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the scientific team will be Morris, the park archeologist. He's 
hoping to see some sign of human contact with the mammoth. Scientists are 
deeply divided over whether the islands' early settlers arrived in time to hunt 
the creatures, or whether climate change was entirely responsible for their 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been the first humans ate the last mammoths," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The excavation team plans to cut away the sand from the eroding dune and 
expose the entire skeleton. Then they will photograph, measure and map the 
fossil in place. Roth, the Duke biologist, has brought a special camera that 
can take pictures in three dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Next the scientists will remove the fossil bones and place them in plaster 
casts. Agenbroad said he expects to separate the skeleton into three sections 
before transporting it to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The excavation could take 10 days, but research on the bones and terrain will 
continue for at least six months. A replica of the skeleton will eventually be 
placed at the Channel Islands visitors center at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Agenbroad said he has brought educational materials for elementary students 
and hopes Ventura County schools can capitalize on the pygmy mammoth discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every little kid can give you a dinosaur name that long," Agenbroad said, 
spreading his arms wide. "But not many kids can tell you much about mammoths." 
FYI 
</P>

URBAN BLIGHT ON THE RISE IN OXNARD, CITY REPORT SAYS; COMPLAINTS: CODE 
ENFORCEMENT DIVISION SAYS MANPOWER ISN'T THERE TO CURB INCREASE IN VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Signs of urban blight such as illegal dumping, front-yard parking and 
substandard housing are becoming more frequent in Oxnard, according to an 
annual report by the city's Code Enforcement Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders have criticized Oxnard officials for failing to curb the 
city's growing code violations. But Richard K. McIntosh, the city's code 
enforcement chief, said he simply does not have enough resources to combat the 
deluge of infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem we have is people -- the lack of them," said McIntosh, 
who has seven code inspectors at his disposal. "We can't cite everyone, and we 
don't have the personnel to investigate everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Oxnard leaders agree. Denise Gunn, chairwoman of the Wilson Neighborhood 
Council, acts as a liaison between the city's neighborhoods and the Code 
Enforcement Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think code enforcement gets a bum rap a lot," Gunn said. "They do the best 
they can with what they have. People want things done yesterday, and they just 
don't have the time.. . .The public is a bunch of whiny rats." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which summarized the 1993-94 fiscal year, found that the Code 
Enforcement Division received 355 complaints regarding parking on lawns -- 172 
more than the previous year. The complaints came from all parts of the city, 
McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Code officers made 1,128 inspections for yard parking violations last year, an 
increase of 427 from the year before.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement received about the same number of substandard housing 
complaints as the previous year, 326 compared to 323. But that number is 
substantially higher than five years ago, and will probably increase in the 
next few years, McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that overcrowding in certain neighborhoods, such as North Bartolo 
Square, has reached critical proportions.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Coz, vice chairman for the North Bartolo Square Neighborhood Council, 
said his neighborhood is facing an overcrowding epidemic. But he does not blame 
code enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The steady stream of migrant farm workers in Ventura County, and Oxnard's lack 
of affordable housing, are responsible for the city's substandard housing 
problem, Coz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The garages are converted to houses, the houses are converted to 15 people 
per home," Coz said. "It all has to do with the underground immigrant economy. 
It's not code enforcement's problem. It's a national and statewide problem."  
</P>
<P>
 Complaints about illegal dumping have also leveled off, from 65 in 1992-93 to 
69 last year. The numbers are actually down from five years ago, when there 
were 103 complaints. But McIntosh said there is reason to believe that illegal 
dumping actually is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the increasing problems is people disposing of chairs, washing 
machines and mattresses, just chucking them in the alleys," McIntosh said. "We 
get a lot of complaints about that from the Southwinds neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McIntosh believes tougher restrictions from landfills have led people to ditch 
appliances and furniture rather than pay a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 But some progress has been made in dealing with some of the city's 
longstanding eyesores, the report concluded.  
</P>
<P>
 The two greatest improvements from last year are in abandoned vehicles and 
weed abatement, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 576 deserted or stripped cars towed away from Oxnard's streets last 
year, compared to 788 the year before and 1,061 five years ago. And the number 
of code inspections related to unsightly weeds has decreased from 2,402 to 
2,010.

SUMMER CAMP FOR ROBOTS -- AND KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-week Robot Summer Camp for ages 5 to 16 is under way at the California 
Museum of Science and Industry, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is the first of its kind, according to organizers, and uses robots 
as teaching tools for helping students learn biological, mathematical, 
engineering and programming concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp participants are experimenting in a laboratory created for the sessions 
that contains more than $1 million worth of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp's program was developed by robotics expert K. G. Engelhardt of NASA. 
She said her aim was to create a forum to get students excited about science 
and technology and to introduce service robots, which work with and act as 
extensions of humans, including people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities include learning about human and robot behavior by inventing and 
building robots, comparing the intelligence of humans and computers and 
learning how humans and robots see, hear and touch by studying high-tech robots 
in action. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hoped that the camp curriculum will provide a model for schools 
nationwide.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CITY LAUNCHES WEEKLONG EFFORT TO FIX POTHOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They call it "Operation Pothole." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Public Works has declared war on the thousands of potholes 
ravaging the streets of Los Angeles, devoting extra crews to its street 
maintenance division all week long to mend an estimated 950 potholes a day. 
</P>
<P>
 To kick off the blitzkrieg, Councilman Joel Wachs rolled up his sleeves and 
joined street maintenance workers in Tujunga in a pothole repair demonstration 
Monday. Raking the 300-degree mixture of steaming asphalt, sand and rock that 
was poured into the dug-up hole, Wachs said, "I should put that on my resume!" 
</P>
<P>
 The public works department has launched the pothole repair project to prevent 
costly and traffic-clogging reconstruction. During "Operation Pothole," street 
maintenance workers will be sent out in 12 teams of two per day this week to 
work on square-block areas in each of the 15 council districts in Los Angeles. 
They will also respond within 24 hours to calls from the public to patch up 
potholes in isolated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, according to a public works release, $3 million is spent to fix 
200,000 potholes in Los Angeles caused by overweight vehicles, water and aging. 
</P>
<P>
 The asphalt dug out of all potholes in Los Angeles is recycled, public works 
spokesman Chuck Ellis said, and when the material is heated before being poured 
into the hole, microwave ovens, instead of conventional pollution-causing ones, 
are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are invited to report potholes in their neighborhoods during this 
week to be fixed within 24 hours -- barring storms or other emergencies -- at 
(818) 760-2259. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; PLAY URGES GIRLS TO BREAK OUT OF VICIOUS CYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The play -- dealing with the sensitive issues of domestic violence, sexual 
abuse and drug addiction -- had none of the finer features of a Broadway 
production. Ultimately, it didn't matter that the bare-bones production 
featured few props and an unpredictable sound system. The play made its point 
with the audience, who had been there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
 About 700 people -- mostly troubled teen-age girls but also some boys, 
counselors and social service providers -- watched the play, one of the 
highlights of the second annual Woman to Woman conference, held last week at 
Mission College's Campus Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the conference was to encourage girls who have been pregnant, 
abused or affiliated with a gang to turn around their lives. The event offered 
up a medley of inspirational speeches, a prayer and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to listening to female role models such as writer-producer Dwan 
Smith-Fortier and domestic-violence-shelter director Bernita Walker-Moss, the 
girls also had a chance to speak through, and learn from, their own voices. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the play, "Breaking the Cycle of Abuse," features a vignette in 
which actors depict students in a youth group discussing the problems -- and 
solutions -- facing today's teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Authority figures) need to teach us how to act, instead of just punishing 
us," said a teen-age boy, whose comments drew applause. "How do they expect us 
to respect them when they don't respect us in return?"  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the vignette, Pauline Cortez, 18, recounted her actual experiences 
of abuse at the hands of her stepfather, being forced to leave home and raise a 
10-month-old baby by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that education was the key to my success and happiness," said 
Cortez, who graduated in June from Los Angeles County's Independent Study 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, participation in the youth group turns out to be part of the 
recovery process for the central character, Wendy, who is emotionally and 
sexually abused by her father and physically abused by her mother. She also 
finds solace in talking about the abuse with a counselor, who urges her not to 
blame herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which drew twice as many people as last year's conference, was 
sponsored by the Los Angeles County Office of Education's Division of 
Alternative Education and the county Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the conference said it helped them to see that they were not 
alone in their plight, and inspired them to deal with their problems.  
</P>
<P>
 One 16-year-old girl, who attends a San Fernando school for pregnant 
teen-agers, said the conference reminded her of the importance of 
self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Before) I felt like I wanted a change but I didn't really care," said the 
teen-ager, who is eight months pregnant by a former boyfriend. "I thought my 
parents were going to take care of things for me. Now I'm thinking that I have 
to take care not only of myself, but also somebody else." KAY HWANGBO

 Firefighters on Monday extinguished a 20-acre fire that burned through thick 
vegetation near the Simi Valley landfill, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brush fire began about 1 p.m. in rugged terrain off Madera Road, about a 
half-mile north of the Simi Valley Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters from 10 engine companies and several hand crews worked to contain 
the blaze, assisted by a helicopter equipped with a bucket for water drops. The 
fire was contained by 5 p.m., said Nina Raya, spokeswoman for the Ventura 
County Fire Department.

 The cause is still under investigation. JULIE FIELDS

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: AARP OFFERS JOB RE-ENTRY WORKSHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An orientation session for a series of workshops to prepare middle-aged and 
older people to re-enter the job market will be held at Los Angeles Valley 
College today in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not necessary to go to the orientation session in order to attend the 
the workshops, which are scheduled throughout August, said Rochelle Linick, 
volunteer consultant for the American Assn. of Retired Persons, which organized 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The AARP Works program will not train people for particular jobs but instead 
will help them with job hunting skills, such as writing a resume and coping 
with problems such as age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see an older person sit in front of a manager and be told, 
'You're over-qualified for this job,' " Linick said. "That translates into 'I 
can hire someone else cheaper.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, led by AARP-trained volunteers, will help older job hunters 
redefine their skills and take a new look at their capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're also talking about people who are faced with having to go back to work 
for the first time in many years," Linick said, like a homemaker who may need 
to take a job after her husband is laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workshop attendees, for instance, may have worked for big companies for a 
long time and now realize that they might be better off in a smaller company, 
Linick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to understand they have a huge variety of skills that they can 
take advantage of," Linick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshop participants also will practice handling job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested can call Linick at (818) 348-1964. A $20 fee covers the cost 
of workshop materials. ED BOND

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MADONNA 
GIVEN RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST JAILED FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Madonna was granted a restraining order Monday against an allegedly obsessed 
fan who was barred from going near the singer, her home or her office. 
</P>
<P>
 The order, signed by Superior Court Judge William Allen, bars Todd Lawrence 
from going within 100 yards of Madonna or her property for the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence had allegedly been stalking Madonna for two weeks before he was 
arrested July 19 on the grounds of her estate. He allegedly claimed to be 
Madonna's husband and was arrested after scaling an eight-foot security fence 
to get onto the grounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence is in jail awaiting an Aug. 16 trial on charges of trespassing, 
assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, one of Madonna's security guards, Basil Stephens, 
arrested Lawrence at gunpoint and handcuffed him after watching him on a 
television monitor as Lawrence scaled the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was handed over to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old singer's million-dollar Hollywood estate is guarded by an 
electronic gate, security fence and television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Madonna nor Lawrence were in court for Monday's hearing.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; 
QUAKE-DAMAGED HOSPITAL GETS $10-MILLION GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The W. M. Keck Foundation has donated $10 million in grant money to help 
redesign St. Johns Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, where inpatient 
services have been halted since the facility was severely damaged in the 
January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past seven months, the 501-bed facility offered outpatient care while 
the hospital's Main and South wings are being repaired.Those wings are 
scheduled to reopen Oct. 3, with 233 beds. The North Wing, the hospital's most 
severely damaged, was razed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Keck Foundation gift, the largest ever recommended by the Foundation's 
Southern California Grant Program Committee, is earmarked for architectural 
engineering and strategic planning studies needed to build a "modern health 
campus of the 21st Century," according to Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka, the 
hospital's president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 What that new health care facility will look like -- and what functions it 
will serve -- are still undefined, according to Robert O. Klein, executive 
director of St. Johns Hospital and Health Center Foundation, the fund-raising 
arm of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, which cannot be used for repairs to the old facility, also will 
help preserve existing research and technological development at the hospital.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; ARSENAL SEIZED 
AFTER MAN ALLEGEDLY SHOOTS AT WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who barricaded himself inside his garage with an arsenal of weapons 
after allegedly shooting at his wife was in custody Monday after surrendering 
to deputies, a sheriff's spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 John Delgado, 44, was booked on suspicion of spousal abuse and assault with a 
deadly weapon and was held on $500,000 bail, said sheriff's spokeswoman Angie 
McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado's wife, who was not wounded, had called deputies to the couple's home 
on Lefloss Avenue after the pair argued about 9:30 p.m. Sunday, McLaughlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The man) had been drinking," McLaughlin said. "Delgado struck her, then 
fired one round at her from a handgun, missing her." Delgado then ran to the 
garage and barricaded himself inside, "stating he was going to kill himself," 
McLaughlin said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the garage was an assortment of 19 weapons, including handguns, shotguns, 
rifles and a large amount of ammunition, McLaughlin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputies evacuated several nearby homes and called for a sheriff's special 
weapons team about 11 p.m., but before the team's members arrived, Delgado 
surrendered, McLaughlin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose name was not released, suffered only superficial injuries 
when her husband hit her and did not require medical treatment, McLaughlin 
said.

 Los Angeles police on Monday were investigating the shooting death of a

 Joseph Alexander Jones died of a gunshot wound to the head, Sgt. Frank Reynoso

<P>
 His body was found about 1:50 a.m. Monday behind a house in the 11000 block of 
DeFoe Avenue.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; HELICOPTER NOISE IS FOCUS OF MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Studio City residents plan to meet tonight to plot a surface-to-air campaign 
against the noise made by helicopters flying over their homes from Van Nuys 
Airport every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 8 p.m. meeting, leaders of an anti-chopper group called "Stop the 
Noise" will discuss efforts to raise the minimum altitude required by the 
Federal Aviation Administration to 1,000 feet in the Hollywood Hills, Santa 
Monica Mountains and nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also are seeking -- through petitions to the FAA and testimony 
before Los Angeles city officials -- restrictions on the hours many helicopters 
are allowed to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first one usually doesn't wake you up," said Gerry Silver, president of 
the Homeowners of Encino. "It's the barrage of the five or six that follow that 
come whooshing over your house before 6 a.m. that get you out of bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver has spent hours with his ear to his radio scanner and his eye on the 
horizon to identify the offending helicopters and their patterns, and is now 
gathering signatures supporting a minimum altitude requirement. The FAA 
currently does not impose such a limit in residential areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, fire and medical helicopters used during emergencies would be exempted 
from the height restriction, under Silver's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver said many helicopters used by TV and radio stations, sightseeing tours 
and other private enterprises follow a path that roughly traces the Ventura 
Freeway from the Van Nuys Airport and through the Cahuenga Pass, traveling as 
low as several hundred feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have lived with the noise for a long time, but they were not aware 
where it was coming from," Silver said. "Now that they know, they are 
incensed." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigns such as "Stop the Noise" are part of an escalating war by homeowners 
-- especially in the southernmost part of the San Fernando Valley -- to protect 
market values in their quiet neighborhoods, which skyrocketed during the real 
estate boom of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Stop the Noise" meeting will be held as part of the monthly gathering of 
the Studio City Residents Assn., at the Carpenter Avenue Elementary School 
auditorium, 3909 Carpenter Ave. KURT PITZER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Officer Fred Tepstein pleaded guilty Monday in Van Nuys 
Superior Court to a single count of spousal abuse, the same day his trial was 
scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tepstein, 43, a 20-year department veteran who is assigned to the Foothill 
Division, had been charged with four felony counts, including assault with a 
firearm, false imprisonment and making a terrorist threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Damon said the four original charges will be dropped 
when Tepstein is sentenced Sept. 30. Tepstein faces a maximum sentence of four 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Tepstein, who is free on bail, was arrested after his wife told police that on 
May 3 he had choked her at their Santa Clarita home until she became 
unconscious. She told police that he had also pointed a gun at her and 
threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Tepstein nor his attorney, Steven Flanagan, could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD spokeswoman Officer Sandra Castello said she could not disclose 
Tepstein's current employment status, citing personnel privacy concerns. 
Castello said an investigation is under way to determine whether Tepstein will 
be fired or otherwise disciplined. JULIO MORAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; RESIDENTS SEEK HELP IN BLOCKING 
PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angered by plans for a housing project in their neighborhood, Newbury Park 
residents are seeking the help of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in filing 
a lawsuit against the city aimed at blocking the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents said they plan to sue the city for approving the 220-home Dos 
Vientos subdivision, an agreement they say ignores the project's adverse 
effects on the environment. Residents said that the Sierra Club has agreed to 
take the case, providing that they raise $15,000 to pay for the San 
Francisco-based group's travel and paperwork expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Club officials said they are close to reaching an agreement thatwould 
allow them to represent the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically this is a group that only gets involved with environmental issues 
of extraordinary national significance," said Newbury Park resident Michelle 
Koetke. "So I think it's remarkable that they have come to Thousand Oaks to 
look at this threat." 
</P>
<P>
 A legal battle would probably focus on the city's position that a previously 
arranged agreement with the builders of Dos Vientos precluded the city from 
rejecting the project, despite the damage it would have on wildlife, said 
Cassandra Auerbach, a representative of the local Sierra Club chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 220-home development was approved in July as the first phase of a 
2,350-home project that the city will allow to be built in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, developers Operating Engineers and Courtly Homes agreed to pay 
the city $12.6 million for the right to build. Developers also agreed to 
preserve 1,000 acres as open space and to set aside money to build parks, 
schools and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Koetke said that her group would need to raise the $15,000 for expenses by 
Sunday for the Sierra Club to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can do it," she said. "It will prove to the City Council that they 
did not win over the hearts and minds of the public." MATTHEW MOSK

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Little League all-star team of 9- and 10-year-olds could 
become state champions tonight if they win a baseball game against a team of 
all-stars from Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks is undefeated in this section of the tournament and will have 
two chances to win the state championship, said manager Daniel Catalano. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they lose tonight, the Thousand Oaks team will again play Lakewood -- 
which already has a loss in this section of play -- on Thursday, Catalano said. 
Thousand Oaks beat Lakewood, 6-4, last Tuesday, Catalano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have an advantage not having a loss," Catalano said Monday. 
"But Lakewood's a real good team, and the boys are going to have to play a real 
good defense and play their best game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks 13-year-old all-stars are already knocking on the door of 
the Little League World Series, standing just two wins away from a series slot 
after defeating a team from Pearl City, Hawaii, 4-1, in San Jose on Sunday.

 A man who said he had a knife robbed a Thousand Oaks bank about 12:45 p.m. 
Monday, then eluded sheriff's deputies who searched the area by ground and air, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the man entered the First Interstate Bank on North Moorpark 
Road, told a teller he had a knife and demanded cash.After placing the cash in 
a blue bag, he walked out the door. No vehicle was seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrived about four minutes later and sealed off the area. 
But a search by patrol deputies and a flyover by a sheriff's helicopter failed 
to turn up the robber, who was described as a red-haired white man in his mid 
20s, wearing a blue baseball cap, jeans and a white T-shirt.  
</P>
<P>
 The man was about 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighed about 180 pounds, 
investigators said. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A 39-year-old parolee has been arrested on suspicion of raping a woman at 
knifepoint in his Thousand Oaks motel room, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Pringle was taken into custody Sunday evening after a 20-year-old 
woman told deputies Pringle pulled her into his room at the Econolodge on 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard and assaulted her repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said Pringle, who was on parole after being convicted of burglary in 
Los Angeles County, let her leave about an hour later.  
</P>
<P>
 She then called the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies arrived at the motel, they found Pringle in his room and 
arrested him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Detective Darrell Erickson said the case is still under 
investigation and deputies plan to re-interview the woman Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle was being held without bail Monday in the Ventura County Jail. He was 
also arrested for violating his parole in a separate incident in Los Angeles 
County, authorities said. wJULIE FIELDS

 A fire in the Leona Valley tore through 400 acres of heavy brush Monday, 
damaging a large home and destroying 10 smaller buildings and 15 vehicles but 
causing no major injuries, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was 60% contained by 8 p.m. and full containment was expected by 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 It began about 3:40 p.m. near Lonesome Valley Road and 107th Street West, and 
was quickly spread through heavy hillside brush by 15 m.p.h. winds, roaring 
north across the valley floor to the homes and ranches that line Elizabeth Lake 
Road.

WOMAN GETS PROBATION IN QUAKE FRAUD; COURTS: DEFENDANT, WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE 
LIVED IN NORTHRIDGE APARTMENTS WHERE 16 DIED, TELLS JUDGE 'I'M VERY ASHAMED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After telling a judge she has been plagued by shame and remorse, a Carson 
woman was sentenced to three years probation Monday for receiving $2,300 in 
federal aid by falsely claiming to have lived in the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments, where 16 people died during the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter decided to give Denise Jones, 36, a 
chance despite requests by prosecutors to sentence her to three months at a 
correctional facility for illegally obtaining aid from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 36, who has since returned the money, pleaded guilty in April to one 
count of making a false claim to a government agency to seek FEMA aid by 
calling an assistance line and giving her address as Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand what's with you," Hatter told Jones. "What's your 
problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't thinking at all about what I did," Jones replied. "I (once) had a 
drug dependency and it caused a lot of problems with my life. I've been in 
agony," she said. "I'm very ashamed of what I have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were tipped off to Jones -- and to three others who falsely used 
the Northridge Meadows address to collect emergency aid -- by a mail carrier 
who found himself delivering FEMA material to unfamiliar names at the apartment 
complex after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes were considered particularly ghoulish among a rash of quake-fraud 
attempts because of the high death toll at the collapsed building, which made 
it the disaster's deadliest address. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three others who used the Northridge Meadows addresses have been 
convicted of the same charges Jones faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Two received prison terms. Daniel Richards of Hollywood was sentenced to two 
months in prison and Miguel Cordero of Van Nuys was sentenced to four months in 
prison. Mary Mitchell of Paramount received three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cordero's case, authorities said he filed a FEMA claim using the apartment 
number where mechanic Pil Soon Lee and his 14-year-old son Hwon were crushed to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 When reviewing Jones' case, Hatter apparently was influenced by the fact that 
Jones has a young daughter. Jones also told Hatter that she has been off drugs 
for a year and a half and that she has been taking parenting lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Jones is one of as many as 30 people who have been charged 
with filing false claims after the quake. A multi-agency task force began 
making the arrests to signal that law enforcement agencies planned to pursue 
opportunists who took advantage of quake aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional investigations are continuing, authorities said.

JACKSON-PRESLEY ORDER IS SWEET FOR CANDY MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man on the phone was mysterious, identifying himself only as a friend of 
Michael Jackson's family. 
</P>
<P>
 But what he wanted from Frank Sheftel, a San Fernando Valley candy maker, was 
absolutely clear: 1,000 chocolate bars about the size of a business card, with 
raised letters that say, "Lisa Marie and Michael." 
</P>
<P>
 A heart and a musical note were also to appear somewhere on the bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I'm thinking nothing," said Sheftel, 33, a fast-talking chocolate 
lover who has owned the Candy Factory in Sherman Village since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'm thinking, 'Lisa Marie and Michael. . . .' And then he's telling me 
where he wants them delivered and I'm thinking, 'Oh wow. Big wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackson family friend ordered the sweets last Monday, when Lisa Marie 
Presley confirmed the previously doubted rumors of her marriage to the pop 
superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 In a polite and straightforward manner, the unidentified man told Sheftel to 
deliver the chocolates to four places: the Jackson family estate in Encino, 
Michael Jackson's production company in Westwood, Graceland -- the Elvis 
Presley mansion -- in Memphis, Tenn., and the Trump Tower in New York, where 
the couple were honeymooning. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of co-workers at the candy store was initially one of disbelief. 
"With them making it public, then obviously it's true," said Sheftel's mother, 
Gloria, who helped prepare the chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours after the order was placed, a courier arrived at the Candy 
Factory carrying a sealed envelope with $100 bills in it, Frank Sheftel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candy maker declined to reveal how much the order cost, but said such work 
typically runs as high as $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a team of five people to prepare the 1,000 bars, pouring melted 
Nestle's chocolate into plastic molds they made from a master mold prepared by 
an outside firm, and wrapping them in gold foil. Half of the bars were 
delivered last week, while the other half will be shipped today by express 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 This brush with fame is nothing unusual for Sheftel. In March, the candy maker 
created 300 10-inch-tall chocolates shaped like the Oscar statuette for a party 
hosted by studio executive Mark Canton. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences sued Sheftel, saying it was trying to protect Oscar's image. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides recently settled out of court, with Sheftel paying the academy 
$1,500 and turning over many of the Oscar-shaped candy he used. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the entertainment industry turned to Sheftel for the movie "Forrest 
Gump." In it, Tom Hanks' character eats a box of chocolates while sitting on a 
bus bench and telling his life story to strangers. Sheftel says he made the 
chocolates Hanks eats in the film because Hanks is partial to certain types of 
chocolates, including a special variety with centers of Rice Krispies and 
marshmallow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was very weird," said Sheftel -- who himself eats two chocolate 
bars a day and sells chocolate-coated potato chips. "I thought, 'Why can't they 
go to a store and buy assorted chocolates?' They said, 'No, no, no. It's got to

 For the Jackson-Presley order, the Sherman Oaks native turned to the tabloid 
media to cash in on the celebrity sweets. The National Enquirer was willing to 
pay thousands of dollars for the story, Sheftel said, but it wanted exclusive 
rights for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So he went to the television program "Hard Copy," which broadcast his story 
Friday, demanding only that he not talk to other TV reporters. He says he was 
paid "thousands of dollars" by the program -- he will not say how much -- but 
the show's producers will not confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheftel makes no apologies for his decision to go public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun story," he said. "It's not like I'm showing a picture of them on 
their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sweet story, no pun intended," he said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; FIRE-HIT RESTAURANT TO REOPEN AT NEW SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a fire destroyed the Topanga Fish Market in early March last year, it 
gutted a 10-year landmark establishment in the canyon community. But it barely 
singed the morale of owner Lance Roberts, who says he will open a new 
restaurant by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 He's calling it Froggy's, and it will be located in the 68-year-old American 
Legion Building on Topanga Canyon Boulevard about five miles from Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The new site, which is only minutes from the former one, is undergoing final 
touches while the last permits are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts began refurbishing the building six months ago, putting in a new 
kitchen and replacing the old plumbing and electrical systems. Staff members 
from the Fish Market helped with the landscaping and painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the restaurant, Roberts will place a new blackboard for his trademark 
"seafood sayings" that lured customers to the Topanga Fish Market. Among the 
locals' favorites were "Shrimply Marvelous" and "As the World Tunas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking about what saying I'm going to use for my grand opening, 
but I haven't come up with anything yet," said Roberts. "I'm open to 
suggestions, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts believes that in the long run, the new location will be better because 
it's larger and the surroundings are nicer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The former site was close to a lumber yard. So visually, the new restaurant 
will be prettier," he said. "We will have the same seating occupancy, but the 
grounds will allow for a larger parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 While Froggy's initially will be open for dinner only, Roberts hopes to extend 
his hours to serve breakfast and lunch. He has already placed two new dinner 
items on the menu -- rotisserie chicken and fried fish and chips. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already receiving tons of calls from people asking about the menu and 
when we're going to open," said Steve Harris, the restaurant's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts initially expected to open Froggy's in July, but has been delayed 
while waiting for a transfer permit and a beer and wine license.  
</P>
<P>
 He is also in the final stages of obtaining a conditional-use permit, which 
will allow him to serve alcohol only until 9:30 p.m. during the week and 10 
p.m. on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition was raised during a public hearing in April when members from the 
local Hillside Steering Committee presented their concerns regarding the 
consumption of alcohol on the premises and the noise level that may arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just wanted to voice their opinions and make sure I conform to certain 
restrictions," said Roberts. "These are residents who live right next to the 
new location and they have the right to be concerned. Many of them are my old 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish Market, which was one of only five restaurants in the canyon 
community at the time of the blaze, was investigated as an arson committed to 
cover up a burglary, according to the Sheriff's Department. A rear door had 
been forced open, and nearby cases of beer, wine bottles and fish were removed 
from their storage crates.  
</P>
<P>
 Police detained a suspect outside the restaurant at the time of the incident, 
who police found climbing in the bushes. Food and other debris was found in the 
same vicinity, but no fingerprints were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Police released the suspect the next day for lack of evidence. The fire caused 
more than $150,000 in damages. ALICIA DOYLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; PRINCIPAL APPOINTED AT BURBANK HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of charges of racism and deflated morale among students and 
staff, the Burbank Board of Education has appointed a veteran African-American 
educator to take the reins at Burbank High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard E. Williams, 47, said he is well aware of the controversies at the 
campus since February, when principal Keiko Hentell was demoted without 
explanation and a flood of protests from students and teachers followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of divided feelings out there among the faculty and the 
community about the last principal, and about the process and issues 
surrounding her dismissal," Williams said. "But I would like to get the focus 
off the politics and return it to creating a quality education for our 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted 3-1 on Thursday to select Williams over two other 
candidates, with members Joe Hooven dissenting and William Abbey absent. 
Williams had been an assistant principal at a high school in Perris, Calif. 
since August, 1993, and vice principal at a high school in Concord, Calif. from 
1989 to 1992. He has a Ph.D. from Western Colorado University. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Wilcox, president of the school board, said Williams was chosen for his 
skills and experience in curriculum and management.  
</P>
<P>
 But she conceded that his initial task will be to mend the social rifts on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank High needs a principal who has the ability to unite some of the 
diverse factions on the campus. We also need a principal who will continue our 
programs of cultural diversity and cultural awareness," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was Hentell who was credited with fostering and supporting 
clubs and programs highlighting the cultural diversity of the student body. 
Hentell, who was demoted to a teaching position, has filed a federal 
civil-rights suit against the district alleging she was discriminated against 
because she is female and of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooven could not be reached Monday for comment on why he voted against hiring 
Williams. Hentell also could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said the selection of a minority principal was not an attempt to refute 
charges of racism brought by Hentell and other critics. 
</P>
<P>
 A board-appointed 16-member committee of parents, teachers and community 
leaders helped choose the new principal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is, he was the best candidate for the job," she said. 
"The fact that he's African-American wasn't the prime reason for hiring him, it 
was his qualifications. Burbank is very lucky to have a man of his caliber."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TEAMSTERS ENTER 3RD WEEK OF CALMAT STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the local Teamsters Union entered their third week of a strike 
against CalMat Co. plants in Oxnard and Moorpark, and a settlement in the 
salary dispute is nowhere in sight, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both CalMat officials and Teamsters Union members said Monday that they have 
no intention of changing their positions: CalMat wants the Teamsters to take a 
$2.20-per-hour pay cut because of the sluggish economy, but the Teamsters have 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 drivers have been picketing at the two local plants and at sites 
where CalMat products are delivered throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand how CalMat expects us to take a pay cut of more than 
$8,000, a year," said 11-year CalMat employee Ruben Villa. "I support a family 
of six. If I take that sort of pay cut, I wouldn't be able to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other members of the union, Villa makes about $32,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 CalMat, which specializes in rock and concrete building materials, employs 80 
drivers, 50 of whom are union members, said Dennis Shaw, secretary treasurer 
and chief executive for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 186. 
</P>
<P>
 CalMat and the union had been negotiating since April, and talks ceased July 
22, after the Teamsters refused to take a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent contracts with other companies in Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties, unions members have agreed to cuts of 95 cents per hour, but CalMat 
insisted on cuts more than twice as much, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we settle with a substandard agreement with CalMat," then other companies 
may attempt to renegotiate their union contracts to lower the salaries of 
hundreds of workers, Shaw said. Meanwhile, more than 50 Teamsters who work for 
other Ventura County firms have set up the El Rio Drivers' Strike Fund to 
support fellow union members. CHRISTINA LIMA

 A 25-year-old Oxnard man pleaded not guilty on Monday to forcing his 
12-year-old brother to sell narcotics, while the arraignment for the 
defendant's girlfriend on the same charges was continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Herbert Curtis III set an Aug. 18 preliminary hearing 
for Roberto Guadalupe Avitia.Prosecutors on Monday charged him and co-defendant 
Maria Raquel Chavez, 21, with three felony counts each. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez's arraignment was continued because a lawyer had not been appointed to 
her case before court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Each defendant was charged with inducing a minor to sell narcotics, possession 
of narcotics for sale and willful cruelty to a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they put the 12-year-old boy to work selling cocaine. The boy was 
arrested Thursday, along with the two adults, after police raided the family's 
home in a crime-ridden south Oxnard neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said that the couple could face up to nine years in prison if 
convicted. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; VENTURA BLVD. PLAN WILL BE DISCUSSED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Encino residents are invited to comment at a community meeting tonight on a 
conceptual plan for landscaping Encino's section of Ventura Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders and architects developed the plan, which they call more than 
a beautification project.It organizes the community into three areas: a town 
center, an employment center and a pedestrian-oriented commercial zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Public comment will also be sought on the location of public parking 
structures and possible routes for a community shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for creating a town center at Balboa and Ventura boulevards 
and consolidating and increasing park land in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Tall palms and banners would be added to areas with one- and two-story 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, sponsored by the Los Angeles City Planning Department and the 
Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board, will be held at 7 p.m. in the 
auditorium of the Encino Community Center, 4935 Balboa Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which will display drawings by architects and landscape architects, 
is the first of two in Encino.  
</P>
<P>
 The designers will incorporate public comment from the meeting into the plan 
and present the revised proposal for public review at the second meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities along Ventura Boulevard, from Woodland Hills to Studio City, 
have held or will hold public meetings to introduce conceptual plans for their 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The final plans for all the communities will be submitted by the Plan Review 
Board to the Planning Department as recommendations at the end of the year. KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DIESEL FUEL SPILL RESULTS IN GRIDLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A diesel fuel spill at a busy south Oxnard intersection snarled traffic 
throughout the day Monday as cars were forced to detour through residential 
streets while road crews worked to clean up the mess, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 The spill occurred about 6 a.m. when the driver of a tractor-trailer rig 
carrying explosives and ammunition tried to make a U-turn over the median on 
Ventura Road south of Channel Islands Boulevard and tipped over. 
</P>
<P>
 While crossing over the median, two of the truck's fuel tanks ruptured, 
spilling about 150 gallons of diesel fuel onto the street and into a storm 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm drain joins a flood control channel along Channel Islands Boulevard 
that empties into Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews from the Oxnard Fire Department blocked the fuel from reaching the ocean 
by quickly constructing barriers in the channel, said Lt. John Suchil of the 
state Fish & Game Department. A private company was also hired by the trucking 
firm, Byron-based Diablo Enterprises, to soak up fuel in the storm drain and 
flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the morning, the northbound lanes of Ventura Road were shut down 
south of Channel Islands Boulevard. Cars were forced to detour onto Redwood and 
M streets, then back onto Channel Islands Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was gridlock," said Port Hueneme Police Sgt. Ken Dobbe. "It couldn't have 
happened at a worse place." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of police, the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center also 
closed its Sunkist Street gate during evening rush hour Monday to avoid sending 
hundreds of cars toward the spill site. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2 p.m. one northbound lane on Ventura Road was reopened, but both turning 
lanes onto Channel Islands Boulevard were expected to remain closed until this 
morning. Crews planned to flush water through the storm drain and dig out algae 
that had soaked up the fuel, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbe said the incident is still under investigation and no citations have 
been issued. The truck's cargo was destined for the Air National Guard unit at 
Point Mugu. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SATICOY; LOW-INCOME CLINIC TO BREAK GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crowded out by the rerouted Simi Valley Freeway, Clinicas del Camino Real will 
break ground today for a new health clinic in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic, one of four countywide dedicated to serving low-income 
residents, will offer physical therapy, dental and vision care as well as 
traditional medical and psychological services, said Executive Director Robert 
S. Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story building at 250 S. Wells Road will also function as the 
nonprofit corporation's headquarters, Juarez said. It is expected to open in 
September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Saticoy facility was severely affected by the realignment of Highway 118 
and we had to find a new location," he said. "This facility will enable us to 
expand our medical services." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinicas also operates clinics in Fillmore, Ojai and the La Colonia area of 
Oxnard. In 1993, the chain of clinics registered more than 60,000 visits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saticoy clinic opened in 1978. The facility, at 1280 S. Wells Road, is 
still open but is considered too close to the highway, said Al Limon, a program 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The realignment of the highway has brought cheers from many Saticoy residents 
who are pleased to see traffic diverted from the historic downtown but 
complaints from businesses forced to move out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Saticoy site, Clinicas must rebuild or relocate its 
Fillmore clinic, which was irreparably damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore's new planning laws, requiring shops and restaurants along the 
downtown commercial strip, would prevent Clinicas from rebuilding at its 
original site unless it adds a pharmacy to the clinic front. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DEPUTY FILES LAWSUIT OVER SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County sheriff's deputy who had his pay cut 5% and received a 
five-day suspension last year after allegedly injuring his mother-in-law during 
a domestic dispute filed a lawsuit Monday, claiming he was unfairly 
disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court by Deputy Christopher 
Williams, asks the court to overturn a ruling by the county's Civil Service 
Commission, which upheld the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 During an argument on March 31, 1993, Williams physically ejected his 
mother-in-law from his Thousand Oaks apartment, records say. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified in court records as Coy Phillips, injured an arm in the 
incident, the records said. Williams refused to cooperate with a sergeant and 
fellow deputy who arrived to investigate the mother-in-law's complaint, the 
records say. He would not let them into his apartment, but his wife did, the 
records say. 
</P>
<P>
 The discipline for battery and insubordination was handed down by the 
Sheriff's Department in August, 1993. It was upheld by the Civil Service 
Commission in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the commission, Williams' lawyer argued that the evidence against his 
client was inadmissible because he did not agree to allow the responding 
deputies inside his apartment. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; EX-OFFICIAL TO HEAD TUCSON WATER DISTRICT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Las Virgenes Municipal Water District General Manager Charles (Kent) 
McClain, who was fired in March in a disagreement over management style, has 
been hired as head of the municipal water district in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous advancement, so that makes me feel good," McClain said."The 
service population is about 10 times greater than the one in Las Virgenes." 
</P>
<P>
 McClain was fired as manager of the Las Virgenes district, which serves about 
20,000 homes, because directors were "looking for a little stronger 
leadership," board President Harold V. (Hal) Helsley said at the time. 
</P>
<P>

PLACE OF SOLACE

<TEXT>
<P>
 I must respond to Albert Cohen's remark ("Father and Son Developers Are Stuck 
in the Mire of Wetlands Issue," Aug. 1) concerning the land on Reino Road in 
Newbury Park. He says " . . . It is a few shrubs.Nothing lives on the land. 
Right now it is nothing more than a dump." He is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults walk the paths of the terrain as it provides a place of quiet, a place 
where the soul can reflect. Children play there, exploring old creek beds, 
using their imaginations, enjoying the freedom of the space. After viewing the 
labyrinth of nearby neighborhoods, I find the land to be serene, not an 
eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 Our community can do with less pavement, ugly brown buildings and beige strip 
malls. And just because a stretch of land is not maintained by a crew of 
landscapers, manicured to the nines, it does not warrant the insult of being 
compared to a dump.  
</P>
<P>
 There is solace in open spaces.

CAL LUTHERAN TO HOST PUBLIC RADIO STATION; MEDIA: BROADCASTS WILL CARRY SUCH 
FAMILIAR FARE AS 'ALL THINGS CONSIDERED' AND ADD NEWS AND ENTERTAINMENT WITH A 
LOCAL FLAVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to give the voice of National Public Radio a local accent, officials at 
Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks have begun building a new FM radio 
station due to hit the airwaves in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The station, 88.3 KCLU-FM, will be the first Ventura County affiliate of 
National Public Radio and will be heard from Ventura to Agoura Hills starting 
Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Station officials Monday said they plan to combine the best programs from 
national broadcasts with an enthusiastic mix of local news, talk shows and jazz 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make a real commitment to the local area," said Dan Kuntz, the 
station's general manager. "What I want to do is find out what the people want 
and try to deliver it." 
</P>
<P>
 As Kuntz and program manager Mike West struggle to piece together programming 
for the station's 18-hour days, construction workers have been hammering 
together the station's new studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices, which are on the eastern edge of the Cal Lutheran campus, will 
include state-of-the-art facilities, including links to national computer 
networks and news wire services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the ideas that will shape the station, however, will come not by 
laying fiber-optic cables but by pounding the pavement in the communities in 
which the station will air. 
</P>
<P>
 West, a veteran of commercial and public stations in Arizona, said he has 
already begun gathering ideas for programming by quizzing Ventura County 
residents through phone surveys and on trips around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly, I just want to talk to people," West said. "I want to find out when 
they wake up in the morning, how much time they spend in their cars and what 
they want to listen to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just starting to get a feel for the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The station will target the older, more professional audience that typically 
tunes in to National Public Radio's Los Angeles affiliate, Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be running shows like 'Morning Edition,' 'All Things Considered' and 
'Fresh Air,' which are the typical public radio fare, but we will also try to 
tap into the local flavor of Thousand Oaks and Ventura," Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
 That, West said, will include concentrating on the county's cultural 
diversity, with coverage of minority communities and music with an 
international style. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the station is based on a university campus, Kuntz said there are also 
plans to incorporate the wide interests of Cal Lutheran's students and faculty 
into educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any endeavor that a student is involved with, be it in history or English 
or communications, there are applications that relate directly to people, and 
we want the students to bring that knowledge to the people through this 
station," Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also envisions programs that may some day be adopted by National Public 
Broadcasting and aired around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to bring a major broadcasting affiliate onto their campus, Cal 
Lutheran agreed to front a number of the costs associated with the start-up, 
including hiring three full-time employees and building the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the start-up, which will be partially paid for with federal 
grants, will run between $300,000 and $500,000, Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's well worth it because this is something we've wanted for a long time," 
said Lynda Paige Fulford, a Cal Lutheran spokeswoman. "It's a major asset to 
the university and to the community."

NURSING CARE DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Instead of working with the nursing home industry to improve the quality of 
service, this self-appointed advocacy group chooses to expend its energy 
spewing inflammatory and alarmist rhetoric which preys upon the emotions and 
fears of the general public through exaggeration and misrepresentation 
("Nursing Home Called Among Worst in State," Aug. 4) 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that the nursing home industry is the most highly regulated and 
carefully scrutinized segment of the health care industry in this country. 
California's surveyors conduct 200 to 300 hours of inspections annually in each 
nursing facility to assure compliance with more than 900 separate 
requirements.California's nursing homes have an average compliance rate of 
97.5%; that's an "A" in anyone's book. 
</P>
<P>
 Our industry has always recognized and actively advocated the 
interrelationship between appropriate staffing levels, qualifications and 
high-quality care. There is a continuing trend of improvement in employee 
retention, enhanced wage and benefit packages, quality management programs and 
education and training. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes affecting our aging population are profound and complex. Thanks to 
scientific advancements, Americans are living longer; however, with extended 
life expectancies come the challenges, responding each day to the immediate 
needs and concerns of hundreds of thousands of long-term care residents and 
their families and preparing, through ongoing education and training, for the 
unforeseen new demands of tomorrow.

AVENUE CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As west Ventura taxpayers and registered voters, we would like to see the 
rebuilding, revitalization, rejuvenation and cleanup of Ventura Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Given many years of deterioration and neglect and with the avenue's history as 
the economic heart of our great city, reinvesting in our community is the least 
we can expect.Even with today's constraints on public revenues, we are 
convinced that the benefits of this investment in Ventura Avenue's 
infrastructure far outweigh any fiscal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 We invite all Venturans to volunteer their time, labor, economic resources 
and, most of all, their moral and vocal support for the renewal of the avenue. 
We would like to start the renewal by asking our Ventura City Council and city 
officials to approve and fund the repair of the crumbling sidewalks along 
Ventura Avenue and construction of curbs and sidewalks where they have never 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
 We also extend an open invitation to our business community, schools, 
churches, clubs, societies, associations, agencies and many other organizations 
to contribute and join us in the renewal, revitalization and cleanup of Ventura 
Avenue.

FOR GOOD OF OJAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found the article concerning the closing of the Ojai Bowling Alley for a 
Payless store very disconcerting. As a society, we cannot remove limited 
entertainment mediums for a community and then complain about graffiti, gang 
problems or juvenile hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
 I drove through Ojai recently and noticed that the Bank of America building 
was still vacant. It could serve as a more central location for a possible 
Payless-type store, in walking distance for most seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 I would keep the Ojai Bowling Alley and improve the facility by adding a 
skateboarding section to the oft-empty parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The powers that be need to think about constructive ways to keep our good kids 
good instead of destructive planning that will erode their sensibilities and 
increase the possibility of gang or related negative activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai needs another example of mindless consumerism like we need another 
weather station orb.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; HEAD OF DONOR SERVICES STRIVES TO KEEP THE LIFEBLOOD FLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While many Southlanders were celebrating the red, white and blue on the Fourth 
of July, the red was running low. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood supplies had dropped to a critical level, with the local chapter of the 
American Red Cross maintaining just five or six units of crucial type 
O-negative on its shelves some days. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryle Babbitt, beginning her second year as the region's managing director 
for donor services, was doing more worrying and working than celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Dips in the blood supply during the summer and after the winter holiday season 
are not uncommon. But this was the worst in several years and served to 
reinforce the point that donor recruitment continues to be an area of struggle 
for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Times correspondent Eric Slater, Babbitt talked about why 
Los Angeles uses more blood than it produces, how her office is trying to 
change that and how misconceptions about the transmission of AIDS and other 
blood-borne diseases continue to affect donations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What happened this year that allowed the blood supply to reach such 
a dangerous low?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Summertime is a time when areas across the country struggle. Companies 
are reluctant to hold blood drives on company time because they are already 
short-staffed. Also, during the school year we have blood drives at high 
schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the springtime, blood collections typically are very good, and that gives 
us a chance to build our blood supply. This year our blood collections during 
those spring months and during the Christmas season were not good. We did not 
meet our expectations. Then when the holiday hit us, it made a situation that 
wasn't good to begin with very bad. After the Fourth of July, we were down to 
about a half a day's supply of O-positive and O-negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the tenuous situation improved in recent weeks?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It certainly is much better than it was. It's returned to near normal, 
except for O-positive and O-negative, and those are types where the shortage is 
chronic. After the Fourth of July, we did send out news releases, and certainly 
newspapers and radio stations helped improve collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Such pleas for help are not uncommon, and yet instances of someone's not 
getting blood in an emergency is virtually unheard of. Is the Red Cross crying 
wolf?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No one is dying. We would never wait until that time. What we use as an 
indicator is we like to have a total of 10 days of blood supply in the 
community. When our supply drops to one day, we would go to the media with a 
very serious appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: O-positive is the most common blood type, and so large quantities are 
required. Why is O-negative, a fairly rare type, a problem in terms of 
supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 A: O-negative, the blood type of about 7% of the population, is called the 
universal donor, because O-negative can be given to a person with any blood 
type. Until they have the time to cross-match the blood, they can give them 
O-negative, so it goes to patients who are of a different type. Also, for 
neonatal and very young pediatric patients, O-negative is preferred. They 
haven't yet developed a blood type yet, and O-negative is neutral, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much blood is used daily in Greater Los Angeles ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Demand here is high, about 1,000 units a day. Here in Southern California 
we have many very large and sophisticated medical centers that are performing 
procedures that utilize a lot of blood. We have very busy emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much of that blood comes from outside the Los Angeles area?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We import about a third of our blood supply from outside blood centers.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: While local demand is high, there is also a huge population of potential 
donors. Why must blood be imported?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Typically, in small communities, in communities that are more homogenous, 
blood drives are more successful. Nationwide, only 4% or 5% of the population 
are blood donors, and that's a very low percentage. Here in Los Angeles it's 
less than 4%. If we could get that number as high as 7% or 8%, there would 
never be a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45% of our blood donors have given before, and we telephone them. But 
about 60% of those who make appointments don't keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is being done to increase donations locally?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We've really started to try to focus our attention on making stories 
available of actual recipients, put a human face on it. Donors want to know 
what happens when they donate blood. 
</P>
<P>
 We also spend a lot of time and effort working with companies, community 
groups and individual donors, communicating the need with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the Northridge earthquake bring out blood donors in greater numbers and 
help increase supplies?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Lots and lots of people came out to donate blood, which is a very common 
thing following a disaster. But most of these disasters do not require a large 
amount of blood, and that certainly was true here in January. However, we were 
grateful because it did pull us out of a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long does a unit of blood last after it's collected?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Red blood cells, about 42 days. Platelets last only only five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the erroneous belief that diseases can be transmitted while donating 
blood continue to affect supplies?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Almost 25% of the population surveyed expressed the belief that they 
can get AIDS donating blood. I don't know if those are people who have simply 
avoided the information that it's simply not true, or they are people who just 
don't want to hear it. It is safe to donate blood. There is absolutely no risk 
of infection of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: While there is no risk to those donating blood, those receiving a 
transfusion are susceptible to blood-borne diseases. Just how safe is the Red 
Cross blood supply today?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Thirty years ago, certainly, there was no risk of HIV. However, the 
greatest transfusion-associated risk has always been hepatitis, and 30 years 
ago the risk of getting hepatitis was significantly higher than now. Before the 
hepatitis-C test in 1990, the risk was 1 in 20 for hepatitis. Now it is about 1 
in 3,300. That risk has been cut dramatically.  
</P>
<P>
 What HIV has done has created an apprehension and an awareness (of 
transfusion-related disease), though those dangers were already there.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the chances of contracting HIV during a transfusion?  
</P>
<P>
 A: One in 1 million is about the risk now of contracting HIV from a blood 
transfusion. Clearly it was much higher than that in the past, especially 
before 1985, when the HIV test became available. Before 1985, all we could do 
was ask donors about behaviors that would put them at risk. And we weren't 
asking them as pointed of questions as we are now. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers have been significantly reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has your stringent screening of donors, while protecting the blood supply, 
also disqualified donors who had given in the past?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are now performing seven tests on each unit of blood, and each of those 
could come up positive. About 6% of our donors are notified that they can't 
donate blood again for life. So if you make that a cumulative number -- 6% a 
year -- it becomes pretty substantial. The tests are designed to give us false 
positives. So there have been people who have been told they cannot donate 
blood who actually come back negative when further tests are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The American Red Cross has come under heavy criticism at times for handling 
blood in an allegedly unsafe manner. What are the perceived problems?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't really speak for the Red Cross nationally or any other blood 
center. What we find are the criticisms come with deviations from procedure. 
What the Food and Drug Administration looks for when they inspect a blood 
center is, is the center following to the letter all the regulations? They also 
make sure they can track every unit of blood from the donor to the hospital. If 
they find any deviation, even if its clerical, they will cite us. What they are 
looking for is zero errors and perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 In this region we have had clerical citations. However, none of them have 
resulted in the release of contaminated blood.

LIBRARY BREAKS THE SILENCE TO FIX THE LEAKY ROOF; CONSTRUCTION: WITH BANGS AND 
THUMPS, THE FIRST CHAPTER OF REPAIRS BEGINS AT THE THOUSAND OAKS FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under the pounding rhythm of hammers and the staccato thuds of stomping work 
boots, 16-year-old Julie Vick quietly shelved books at the Thousand Oaks 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been pretty loud," she said Monday, glancing at the noisy workers 
marching on top of the large stucco and glass building. "It sounds like they're 
playing basketball on the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Since construction began last week to replace the library's leaky roof, 
employees and visitors alike have grumbled at the constant noise. 
</P>
<P>
 But if pounding and thumping will repair years of drippy ceilings and soggy 
floors, then library patrons said they are willing to grin and bear it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is temporary and most people are able to deal with that," library employee 
Brian Cruse said. "We've had very few complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary school librarian Sue Robertson said she had tuned out the 
hammering, but added: "If I was trying to sleep instead of study, I couldn't 
sleep." Flipping through the pages of a magazine, Simi Valley resident Daryl 
Rule said the repairs were loud, but badly needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You notice the pounding, but it's pretty understandable," he said. "I think 
you would have to be pretty cranky to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 The exterior roof of the library has leaked every rainy season since the 
building opened in 1982. Last month, after three years of negotiations with the 
building's architect, construction manager and subcontractors, the city reached 
a $1.28-million settlement agreement to repair the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers will add slopes to the roof so water will no longer 
collect in pools around the skylights, and they will install larger drainage 
pipes to remove rainwater. The project is expected to be completed by November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of work to do in 13 weeks," site superintendent Mike Hart said, 
adding that people have been patient with the disturbance. "Everybody has been 
really understanding." Demolition of the existing roof began last week when 
crews started removing stucco and aluminum panels -- the noisiest phase of the 
project, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the roof construction is only the beginning of several months of repairs 
at the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the roof is complete, engineers will begin work on the library's 
interior, which sustained $2 million in damage during the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The library is expected to be closed for two to four weeks this winter for 
interior repairs, such as installing new lightweight ceiling tiles. Those 
repairs will be paid for with a combination of insurance and federal disaster 
relief funds, city finance director Bob Biery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, more than $64,000 has been raised by the Library Restoration 
Committee to replace books damaged during the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 But until all the repairs are completed, employees and visitors used to the 
peaceful serenity of a quiet library are having to make do.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody kind of jokes about it, saying, 'Isn't a library supposed to be 
quiet?' " said senior library assistant Doris Lucas, who has worked at the 
Thousand Oaks Library for 14 years. "We're telling them that this is the first 
step in the repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching a workman casually walk past an overhead skylight, Lucas chuckled and 
said: "You get used to it and go on."

400 ACRES BURNED IN LEONA VALLEY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire in the Leona Valley tore through 400 acres of heavy brush Monday, 
partially damaging a large home and destroying 10 smaller buildings and 15 
vehicles but causing no major injuries, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was 60% contained by 8 p.m. and full containment was expected by 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 It began about 3:40 p.m. near Lonesome Valley Road and 107th Street West, and 
was quickly spread by 15 m.p.h. winds through heavy hillside brush, roaring 
north across the valley floor to the homes and ranches that line Elizabeth Lake 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 Los Angeles County firefighters fought to contain the blaze with 
help from nine retardant-dropping helicopters and planes from the Los Angeles 
city and county fire departments and the U.S. Forestry Service. The fire 
knocked out electric power early on, temporarily hampering water gathering 
efforts and leaving firefighters to battle the blaze with tanked-in supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers said many houses were saved by well-prepared homeowners who 
had long since cleared the brush around their homes and who, seeing the fire 
headed their way, moved quickly to dig trenches and water down their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryce Worthington, who lives with his wife Kathy and their 10 children in a 
large, two-story home at the west end of Leona Avenue, ran for his hoses when 
he sighted the flames on a nearby hillside, said Tom Perkins, a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins said he watched Worthington battle the fire that raced through an 
attached garage and tore through about a third of Worthington's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hosing down everything he could," Perkins said. "It was the scariest 
thing I've ever seen in my life. We just kept praying 'Lord don't let (the 
house) go down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington was later taken by a friend to a nearby hospital with minor heat 
and smoke-related injuries, Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters rushed to free the Valley's farm animals, and 40 volunteers with 
the county Department of Animal Regulation helped owners recapture the freed 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 At an ostrich farm a couple of hundred yards away from Worthington's house, 
owner Dick White and a relative, Dale Livingston, raced to hose down the 
animals and the pens as the flames moved toward the barn. They suffered one 
casualty: One of the birds, panicked by the fire, fatally injured itself 
dashing against the barbed wire of its pen. 
</P>
<P>
 On a small hilltop just south of Elizabeth Lake Road, Alan Dellert, 24, saw 
smoke near his mother's house. Finding no one home, he rushed to hose down the 
roof as 40-foot tall flames headed his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters eventually relieved him and there was no damage to the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see from the roof to the garage, I couldn't tell if the garage had 
burned down or not," Dellert said. "I was keeping myself wet to keep from 
catching fire because the embers kept hitting me."  
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire was under investigation, said Clyde Taylor, of the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department.

ANTELOPE VALLEY TRANSIT OKS CENTURY CITY COMMUTER BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Directors of a local transit agency voted Monday to restore bus service to 
Century City on Aug. 22, responding to complaints from commuters after the line 
was stopped last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA) halted commuter buses to Century 
City in early July because of low ridership and the loss of a federal 
earthquake relief subsidy. The decision came under fire at a July 25 meeting, 
when a small group of Century City commuters urged the AVTA's three-member 
board of directors to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 These passengers proposed route changes and marketing ideas to boost 
ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting Monday, the AVTA staff endorsed these proposals, and the 
board voted unanimously to reinstate one weekday bus to Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're terribly delighted and excited and happy," said Billie Dickey, a 
Pearblossom resident who works as a legal secretary in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the commuter bus will attract more people, now that its route has 
changed to serve other large employers such as UCLA and Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she predicted that more people will give up their car-pool or 
van-pool seats now that bus service is guaranteed through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very confident of our numbers," Dickey said. "We think they'll be into 
a second bus." 
</P>
<P>
 AVTA, which also operates local buses and commuter service to Downtown Los 
Angeles, launched the Century City service in April. The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency paid most of the cost to help commuters hampered by freeways 
damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Antelope Valley agency ended the service when the federal money ran 
out. The bus service was attracting only 12 to 15 riders a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tax money is getting more and more difficult to come by," said Bill Budlong, 
AVTA's executive director. "We can't keep expanding transit programs if we 
can't identify a pretty good return from the fare box." 
</P>
<P>
 The restored service will need 35 passengers a day to break even, Budlong 
said. But the agency has agreed to subsidize the bus while it builds its 
ridership. The bus will tentatively leave Lancaster at 6 a.m., stop in Palmdale 
10 minutes later and arrive at Century City and Cedars-Sinai about two hours 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract new passengers, the service will be free between Aug. 22 and Aug. 
31. Then the fares will be $190 for a monthly pass.

12 INJURED AS 300 INMATES BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 300 inmates participated in a racially divided fight Monday morning at 
the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, injuring 12 inmates and a sheriff's deputy, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial disturbances are common at the five-jail Pitchess facility, although 
most involve fewer inmates than Monday's incident.There have been a number of 
large-scale fights this year, however, including an 800-inmate disturbance in 
mid-June and a 600-inmate brawl in early January. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's fight broke out at about 8:20 a.m. at the maximum-security North 
County Correctional Facility, said Deputy Brian Jones of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. The cause of the disturbance is still under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and Latino inmates in seven of the facility's 32 dorms fought with 
broken phones, shank knives, fruit and other items, Jones said. Two teams of 
emergency response deputies stopped the disturbance with pepper spray, two 
stingball grenades and two rounds from .37-millimeter guns that shoot plastic 
projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "One sergeant sustained a minor injury during the response when he was struck 
in the back by the fragments from a stingball grenade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two inmates sustained stab wounds and 10 others received minor injuries, Jones 
said. All were treated at the jail's clinic.

HANDLING OF HORSES UNDER INVESTIGATION; MOORPARK: D.A. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
DISTRICT LOOK INTO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MORE THAN 20 ANIMALS FROM DEFUNCT 
RIDING FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Both the Ventura County district attorney's office and the Community College 
District have launched investigations into the disappearance of more than 20 
horses at the defunct Newbury Park equestrian program run by Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said Monday that his office is looking 
into the possible theft or illegal sale of public property, while the college 
district has hired a private investigator to examine whether its staff broke 
any laws in dismantling the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's potentially criminal," McGee said of the district attorney's probe. But 
he declined to elaborate because the investigation is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District hired a private investigator 
last week to interview employees and study financial records kept by Don 
Anderson, the former ranch operator who retired in June and moved from the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, at least 40 horses were in training at the Rancho Sierra 
Vista equestrian center in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But college officials have been unable to determine precisely how many horses, 
which Anderson appraised at an average of $325 each, were sold by Anderson 
prior to the board's decision to sell the surplus animals at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees "want to look into the situation of the horses and what happened to 
them and get a background on it," said Jerry Pauley, a vice chancellor of the 
three-campus college district. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village private investigator William Hansen, hired for 40 hours at 
$65 an hour, declined to discuss his progress in the case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Gregory P. Cole, who represents the Newbury Park area on the governing 
board, said he wants to find out what happened to the missing horses that were 
supposed to be sold to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The explanation of the close of the program and the distribution of the 
horses unsettled the board," Cole said. "A number of us were not satisfied with 
the explanations that were given to us by the staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg said Hansen was told to interview anyone 
involved with the horses or the sale of surplus equipment related to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a whole grab bag of questions and issues, beginning with a large 
number of missing horses that seem to be scattered across the equestrian United 
States," Hirschberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those horses belong to the college and they seem to have been given away, 
spirited away or maybe even stolen," he said. "But we couldn't confirm anything 
with the explanation and documentation given to us by staff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dual investigations are the latest in a series of missteps that have 
marked the closure of the Moorpark College Equine Program. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 horses were used at the Rancho Sierra Vista facility as recently 
as May. But only 17 of the animals are available for bid at a auction scheduled 
for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second auction to be held, a sealed bid event designed to weed out 
flesh dealers who would use the horses for dog food. 
</P>
<P>
 The first auction was canceled after college officials discovered that 
Anderson had secreted at least seven horses at an Ojai ranch more than a month 
before he quit his job. Anderson said some of the horses belonged to him, but 
that he would donate them to the program, Moorpark College President James 
Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to that, Anderson told trustees that he had been selling horses at 
prices he negotiated himself for years. But as college property, any sale of 
the animals should have been conducted in public under the authority of 
Moorpark College officials, according to state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson kept a cardboard box full of records -- later turned over to district 
administrators -- but trustees and other college officials said they are 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker told trustees in June that he had approved a plan proposed by Anderson 
last year to dismantle the equine program. But he said he was unaware that 
Anderson was planning to set his own prices and select his own buyers for the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 After Anderson departed, the few horses that were available for sale to the 
public were left unattended at the abandoned Rancho Sierra Vista training 
facility in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials later brought in a part-time trainer to feed and water the 
animals until they were relocated to the Ojai ranch, which is charging the 
district $100 a month to board each of the animals.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; THEFT AT CABLE TV COMPANY LEADS TO FREE 
SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seldom has a neighborhood burglary been enjoyed by so many. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of the Stevenson Ranch community have been glued to their 
television sets since a freak burglary Sunday at the community's cable company. 
The culprits made off with more than $30,000 of equipment and -- wittingly or 
not -- made all of the premium-pay channels free to all viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just noticed it (Sunday) night. . . . I was up until 4 a.m.," said Jan 
Dagley, a three-year resident of the community just west of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they assumed the free service was a "preview" being offered by 
Stevenson Ranch Cable TV, which occasionally shows premium channels free for a 
short time in the hope of getting its 1,200 subscribers to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 But many people's glee over the free programming turned to disgust when they 
learned of the burglary, upset that it occurred in what they believe is a 
relatively crime-free neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristina Ozuna, 11, said she wanted to watch two movies Monday on Showtime, 
which she normally wouldn't receive. But hearing about the burglary changed her 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 If she watched, she said, it would be "because a crime occurred, and that's 
bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was as noble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we even noticed," said a 49-year-old man, who said he runs an 
accounting business out of his home. But he added, "I'll check it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The burglary apparently occurred at about 10:30 a.m. Sunday in the cable 
company's antenna tower room, located on a nearby hilltop, according to a 
report by Deputy John Hutak of the Santa Clarita Valley Station of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Combination locks were missing from the 
chain-link fence outside the facility and the door into the tower room. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolen were two unscramblers, six modulators, two computers, tools and other 
equipment, according to the report. A cable official told deputies the 
equipment was highly sophisticated and would be useful only to another cable 
company or to "sabotage the operation" of the Stevenson Ranch cable firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Stevenson, president of the cable company, minimized the burglary's 
effect on service, saying Monday that repairs were expected to be completed 
within a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, all customers will receive all 50 channels the company 
carries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials learned of the break-in when many customers started complaining 
about 11 a.m. Sunday that their cable service was out, Stevenson said. He said 
repair workers were able to restore service quickly, but found out viewers were 
getting more than they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure if it was just a random burglary or someone who knew something 
about cable equipment," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers said they were surprised by what appeared on their television 
screens as they flipped through the channels Sunday night, but none said they 
saw anything they considered offensive or potentially harmful to their 
children.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PREMIERE RADIO REBOUNDS WITH SOLID PROFIT BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Premiere Radio Networks Inc., a Sherman Oaks company that produces and 
distributes syndicated radio programming, reported profit turnarounds in the 
second quarter and first half compared to year-earlier losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months that ended June 30, Premiere earned $383,236, in contrast 
with a loss of $43,185 in the second quarter of 1993.Its quarterly revenue 
jumped 66%, to $4.27 million from $2.58 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, the company had net income of $1.37 million, while its 
revenue soared 71%, to $7.79 million. In the first half of 1993, Premiere had a 
loss of $325,843 on $4.55 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiere attributed the financial rebound to its acquisition strategy, which 
depressed 1993 results but contributed to earnings this year. Among those 
acquisitions were nine radio programs purchased last year from Olympia Networks 
of Missouri Inc. and an investment in Mediabase Research Corp., which Premiere 
now owns.

INCHING AHEAD ON A ROUGH ROAD; BANKS AND S&LS POST IMPROVED RESULTS, BUT THE 
QUAKE'S IMPACT, WEAK LOAN DEMAND LIMIT UPSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half of the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County area's largest banks and 
savings and loans reported improved earnings during the latest quarter as the 
recession loosened its grip on the region. But banking executives complained of 
sagging demand for loans and said that damage from the Northridge earthquake 
continued to hurt their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter ending June 30, four of the area's eight largest banks and S&Ls 
reported improved earnings, and two posted profits after year-earlier losses. 
Glendale Federal Bank reported a narrower loss, while Citadel Holding Corp. of 
Glendale has not yet filed its second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks watched its profit climb to 
$360,000 in the second quarter ended June 30, up 8% from the year-earlier 
period. But were it not for the Northridge earthquake and its rattling of 
consumer confidence, "We'd have doubled our earnings," said Frank J. Ures, 
chief executive of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake hurt commercial and residential property values just when they 
appeared to be stabilizing, Ures said, and tripped businesses that had begun to 
gain momentum, including restaurants, car dealerships and other mid-size 
businesses that are among American Pacific's customers. As a result, the bank 
is still uncertain about how many firms will be able to survive 
earthquake-related setbacks. So the bank's provision for loan losses was $3.25 
million on June 30, up 35% from a year earlier. The uncertainty could linger 
through the spring, when damaged businesses may finally be finished making 
repairs, Ures said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a cancer," Ures said. "You don't know whether you've licked it or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 One banking institution that was troubled before the earthquake is 
Glendale-based Citadel Holding Corp., the parent of the S&L Fidelity Federal 
Bank. Citadel announced Friday the closure of a deal in which several unnamed 
investors purchased a combined 80% ownership of its Fidelity Federal Bank 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity Federal received $109 million from the investors in the deal, giving 
the S&L a badly needed cash infusion. Citadel lost $67 million in 1993, and 
concern over deteriorating capital has prompted the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, the federal agency that regulates S&Ls, to increase its oversight 
of the company. Citadel, which has also planned a separate bulk sale of $465 
million in problem assets, said it expects to post a second-quarter loss of 
about $92 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Federal Bank's $4.81-million loss in the latest quarter was an 
improvement over the $29-million loss reported a year earlier, but still came 
as a disappointment in light of the S&L's goal to reach profitability by the 
end of its fiscal year on June 30. For its full fiscal year, Glendale Federal 
reported a $209-million loss, compared to $80.8 million a year ago, largely due 
to a third-quarter write-off of goodwill and other assets related to the sale 
of its Florida branches. Glendale Federal's total assets on June 30 were $16.8 
billion, down from $17.9 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, Glendale Federal averted government seizure by undergoing a 
$451-million recapitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its struggles, Glendale Federal showed several signs of improvement. 
Its non-performing assets -- delinquent loans or foreclosed properties -- 
declined to 4% of its total assets as of June 30, from 5% a year earlier. And 
the decline of its deposit base -- fueled by customers' concern for the S&L's 
financial condition -- slowed to a $696-million outflow in fiscal 1994 after 
deposits declined by $2.1 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 One local bank that has been in existence since the 19th Century will soon be 
sold. Last week, Levy Bancorp, parent of Bank of A. Levy, announced that it had 
agreed to be purchased by Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp in a stock 
deal valued at $86.5 million. Marshall Milligan, president of 112-year-old 
Levy, said the bank welcomed the deal because it allowed Levy to choose a 
suitor at a time when options are dwindling because of increasing consolidation 
in the banking industry. Milligan also said Levy had grown increasingly 
concerned with the pitfalls of being a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see increasing price competition being driven by non-bank competitors, and 
that favors larger banks because they are the ones that are more efficient," 
Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan acknowledged that some of Levy's 275 employees are likely to lose 
their jobs in the restructuring, and that some of the bank's 17 branches in 
Ventura County will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest quarter, Ventura-based Levy reported a profit of $1.87 million, 
compared to a loss of $3.48 million for the second quarter of 1993. For the 
first six months of 1994, Levy had income of $3.23 million, compared to a 
$4.28-million loss through the first six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 1.16% return on average assets, Levy was the only local financial 
institution to exceed the 1% ROA benchmark that is considered a strong 
performance. Levy's non-performing assets were $30.5 million at the end of the 
latest quarter, down 55% from a year ago. Still, 5% of the bank's assets were 
in the non-performing category, and that's about twice the level of healthy 
banks. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp, the Oxnard-based parent of Ventura County 
National Bank and Frontier Bank, reported meager earnings of $29,000 for the 
June quarter. But that marked the bank's first profitable quarter since 1992, 
although the latest results were boosted by $791,000 in income from its Small 
Business Administration loan portfolio as a result of an accounting change. For 
the first six months of 1994, VCNB reported an $85,000 loss, compared to a 
$4.25-million loss posted for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Cupp, president of Ventura, declined to comment on whether the bank 
wants to be purchased or is up for sale. "There will always be room for 
profitable, well-run independent community banks," Cupp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements in VCNB's loan portfolio enabled it to cut its quarterly 
loan-loss provision to $2.08 million, half the amount set aside in the same 
quarter a year ago. But the bank remains below capital ratio requirements 
imposed by federal regulators earlier this year. The bank has until Sept. 30 to 
raise two ratios that measure equity as a percentage of risk-based assets. The 
bank must raise its so-called Tier 1 capital ratio from the current 8.25% to 
12%, and its leveraged capital ratio from 6.16% to 7%. Failing to meet the 
Sept. 30 deadline could lead to sanctions, possibly including civil penalties 
or removal of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Financial Corp., the Chatsworth-based parent of Great Western 
Bank, had a solid second quarter, as earnings climbed 6% to $55.9 million. For 
the first six months of 1994, earnings were $105 million, up 7% from the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
 The net interest margin -- the profit between the interest a financial 
institution charges its borrowers and what it pays its depositors -- expanded 
to 3.71% from 3.66% in the first quarter, and the S&L has shed $800,000 in 
non-performing assets since June 1993. Total provisions for loan losses in the 
quarter were $58.9 million, down 32% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp, the Encino-based parent of California United Bank, reported its 
sixth straight quarter of increased profit after undergoing a major 
restructuring two years ago. In the latest quarter, the bank earned $608,000, 
up 9% from a year earlier. For the six months ended June 30, net income was 
$1.19 million, up 26% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp's strategy has been to move away from commercial real estate 
lending and instead focus on lending to mid-sized businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year . . . we brought in $100 million in new loan commitments to middle 
market business," said CU President David Rainer. "This year, we're ahead of 
that pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the bank has aggressively slashed costs: The bank moved its Beverly 
Hills branch to a cheaper Westwood location 18 months ago, and cut 10 jobs at 
the branch, which saves the bank $600,000 a year, Rainer said. 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp's assets dipped 16% from a year ago to $278 million on June 30, but 
non-performing assets for the latest quarter were $1.04 million compared to 
$9.99 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's net interest margin improved to 5.84% in the latest quarter from 
5.42% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, CU Bancorp said that its merger discussions with Bay Cities 
National Bank, based in Redondo Beach, were terminated. On June 8, the two 
organizations had signed a letter of intent to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 TransWorld Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks-based parent of TransWorld Bank, posted 
earnings of $625,000 for the June quarter, up 16% from the same quarter a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a $300,000 charge in the first quarter for earthquake-related damage 
and foreclosed property, the bank's earnings for the first six months were 
$893,000, up 12% from the same period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, TransWorld has added $40 million in new deposits, said John R. 
Marquis, executive vice president. That figure is padded by earthquake 
insurance money that has poured into the region, but Marquis also said deposits 
have grown because the economy has strengthened and businesses have more cash. 
Now the bank is waiting for loan demand to pick up, Marquis said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Pacific reported that its assets reached a record $265 million in the 
June quarter, up 17% from a year ago, thanks to the introduction of new 
products and the opening of a branch in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bank remains cautious of more earthquake-related loan problems, and 
has built up its allowance for loan losses to $3.25 million from $2.4 million a 
year ago. 
</P>

credit-worthy are still waiting. Nobody wants to borrow." Second-Quarter Report

JULY SALES RISE FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, BUT PRICES DECLINE; REAL ESTATE: TOTAL 
SOLD FOR THE MONTH CLIMBS 28% OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHILE THE AVERAGE COST OF 
A SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE FALLS 9%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sales of previously owned homes in the San Fernando Valley continued to 
rebound in July, with 1,194 single-family houses and condominiums changing 
hands, up 22% from 978 sales a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Total sales in July were down 6% from June, when 1,271 houses and condominiums 
were sold. But a slowdown in sales during mid-summer is typical, according to 
the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors, which compiles the housing data. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the surge in year-over-year sales, prices of houses and condominiums 
continued their downward trek. 
</P>
<P>
 The association cited low prices -- including deep discounts on properties 
damaged in the January earthquake -- as a key reason for climbing sales. The 
realty group also noted an abundance of potential buyers and low interest rates 
available for mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Association President Alice McCain said "the feeling among local real estate 
professionals is that August-closed escrows will be even higher than July." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,060 single-family houses changed hands in July, a 28% increase 
from the 828 sales a year before, but down 6% from 1,125 sales in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a single-family house sold last month was $223,400, a 9% 
decline from the July, 1993, average sales price of $246,000, and 3% below the 
average price of $229,800 in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price of a single-family house in July fell 5%, to $185,000, from 
$195,000 a year earlier, but gained 5% from the $176,000 median sales price in 
June. The median price means that half the houses sold in July cost more than 
$185,000 and half cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of condominiums sold last month declined 11% from July, 1993, to 
134 from 150, and sales fell 8% from 146 condominiums sold in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a condominium dropped to $115,900 in July, down 17% from 
$138,800 a year ago and 3% lower than the average price of $119,700 in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The median sales price of condominiums sold in July was $119,000, down 9% from 
a $130,000 median price a year earlier, but 6% higher than June's $112,600 
median price. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in July, the inventory of available properties for sale continued to 
decline from 1993 levels. The number of active listings last month was 8,363, 
35% below the 12,854 active listings in July, 1993, but slightly higher than 
8,304 in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Link, the association's executive vice president, said he expects median 
prices to continue declining until at least the end of the year.

SHERMAN OAKS BUSINESSMAN FOUND GUILTY OF FRAUD; COURTS: ONCE-RENOWNED 
TURNAROUND SPECIALIST QUENTIN T. WILES IS ALSO CONVICTED OF INSIDER STOCK 
TRADING RELATED TO COLLAPSE OF MINISCRIBE CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once-renowned corporate turnaround specialist Quentin Thomas (Q.T.) Wiles was 
found guilty in federal court in Denver of three felony counts of fraud and 
insider stock trading related to the collapse of a Colorado company he ran, 
computer disk-drive maker MiniScribe Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated for nine hours over two days before returning the verdict 
on July 29. Wiles, 74, a Sherman Oaks resident, faces up to 15 years in prison 
and $750,000 in fines. He remains free on bail while he awaits sentencing, 
which prosecutors expect will be scheduled for mid to late September. 
</P>
<P>
 The former MiniScribe chairman was convicted of filing a false annual report 
for the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which overstated 
MiniScribe's 1987 profit by about $15 million. Prosectors said the overstated 
income was the result of "an elaborate scheme" to conceal a $15-million 
shortfall in the company's inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles knew of the shortfall, and sold about $1.7 million of MiniScribe stock 
in April and May of 1988, before the information was made public, the U.S. 
Attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The false financial statements were also submitted to Standard Charter Bank as 
a means to secure a $90-million loan for MiniScribe, prosecutors said. Standard 
Charter suffered significant losses from the loan, they said, although the bank 
recouped most of those losses in a civil settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-week trial, prosecutors and defense attorneys presented more 
than 45 witnesses and hundreds of exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles' attorneys maintained that Wiles knew nothing of the wrongdoing, and 
that he had been duped by his underlings at MiniScribe. Several former 
MiniScribe employees who were promised immunity from prosecution testified 
against Wiles. It has been reported that Wiles' attorney, H. Alan Dill, is 
likely to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles was a trouble-shooter for the San Francisco venture capital and 
investment banking firm Hambrecht & Quist. He would be sent to sick high-tech 
companies to nurture them back to health, and his string of successes earned 
him the moniker "Dr. Fix-It." 
</P>
<P>
 After Wiles joined troubled MiniScribe in 1985, the company appeared to 
achieve a remarkable turnaround, with surging sales and profits and a soaring 
stock price. But Wiles resigned shortly after the company reported a loss for 
the fourth quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 New management then reported to the SEC what it called a "massive fraud" to 
boost inventory numbers and conceal MiniScribe's true financial condition. The 
company has since been liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Another former MiniScribe executive, Patrick J. Schleibaum, who was chief 
financial officer, was found guilty in June in federal court in Denver of two 
counts of filing a false statement with the SEC and insider trading. Schleibaum 
is also expected to be sentenced in mid to late September.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PINKERTON PURCHASES STANLEY SMITH OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pinkerton Security & Investigation Services, the Encino-based private security 
company, said it has purchased contract security-guard services with estimated 
revenues of $23 million per year from Stanley Smith Security Inc., a subsidiary 
of the Australian company Mayne Nickless Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 The company declined to give the price of the transaction. Pinkerton plans to 
consolidate former Stanley Smith offices in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
Connecticut, Georgia, Colorado, Washington and Northern California with its 
existing operations. It has also gained two Stanley Smith offices in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkerton said it agreed to the purchase to strengthen its customer base and 
to expand its services into Alaska.

VOICE POWERED'S LOSS NARROWS IN SECOND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voice Powered Technology International Inc., a Sherman Oaks-based maker of 
voice-recognition consumer electronic products, reported a narrower loss for 
its second quarter that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported a loss of $141,000, compared with a loss of $5.25 million 
for the same period a year earlier.Revenue for the latest quarter was $2.64 
million, down 45% from $4.81 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six months of 1994, Voice Powered posted a loss of $36,000 on 
revenue of $5.76 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $7.65 million on 
revenue of $9.26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the latest quarterly results reflect a transition from being 
a direct marketer of its products last year to a strategy that includes sales 
to retailers, distributors and catalogues. The new strategy is expected to cut 
marketing and other operating costs, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voice Powered also announced that it recently relocated its corporate 
headquarters from Canoga Park to Sherman Oaks.

PROPERTY VALUES: MEDIATION KEEPS DISPUTES OUT OF COURTS -- BUT FOR A PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A growing number of real estate-related disputes are being settled out of the 
courts with the help of private mediation and arbitration. Cases that might 
have been tied up in litigation for years are being hashed out instead through 
several hundred companies or individuals in the area that specialize in 
alternative dispute resolution -- or ADR. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors strongly encourages its members to 
get buyers and sellers to agree to ADR in their contracts because they are 
convinced that private resolution saves money and time. The ADR companies are 
happy with the trend -- and why shouldn't they be? They charge rates of up to 
$700 an hour. But California trial lawyers are more circumspect about the new 
trend. They say they don't oppose private dispute resolution, but they warn 
about the dangers of shifting too many disputes to a growing number of 
profit-making dispute resolution companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents are required by the National Assn. of Realtors, and 
affiliates such as the Valley's association, to arbitrate disputes. Starting 
last year, standard form contracts distributed by the California Assn. of 
Realtors have included provisions for mediation and/or binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage our members to include alternative dispute resolution in their 
contracts," said James A. Link, executive vice president of the San Fernando 
Valley Assn. of Realtors. Most arguments related to property have to do with 
claims by a buyer that the seller failed to disclose some sort of defect to the 
buyer, Link said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Often the problem isn't really about non-disclosure though. It's about lack 
of understanding or communication. Generally, these are issues resolved better 
out of court." Cases are resolved through mediation more than 80% of the time, 
Link said. That's better, he argued, than waiting for years to get a civil 
trial in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors in California are so pleased with ADR that they are pushing 
legislation in Sacramento that would require all parties involved in real 
estate disputes to use mediation before pursuing litigation. The state Assembly 
has approved the mediation bill and the Senate is expected to take up the issue 
in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is convinced that mandatory mediation is as great as it 
sounds. "It's not a black-and-white issue," said Wayne McClean, a Woodland 
Hills attorney and president-elect of the California Trial Lawyers Assn. "It's 
a very expensive system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mediators and arbitrators are retired judges who charge between $300 to 
$700 an hour for their services, McClean said. He recalled one mediation where 
"the judge was very talkative and taking people's time. He didn't accomplish 
anything but to take up everybody's time and to earn himself a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of real estate agents, lawyers and other people are also 
presenting themselves as mediators. McClean worries about the qualifications 
and the neutrality of many private mediators and arbitrators. "Most mediators 
don't know what they're doing," he said. And, "they may be biased in favor of 
certain parties that bring them ongoing business." 
</P>
<P>
 And what a business. Hundreds of alternative dispute resolution companies have 
sprung up in the past few years, many of them in the San Fernando Valley and 
Ventura County. Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services -- the industry 
leader -- has 12 offices and hears about 1,000 cases a month in California. A 
full day of mediation by JAMS costs about $1,750. 
</P>
<P>
 Because real estate cases make up a large share of JAMS' caseload, the company 
has a special real estate division staffed with retired judges who almost 
exclusively hear real estate-related disputes, reported John J. Welsh, general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 ADR isn't always appropriate, Welsh acknowledged. Litigation may be better for 
a class action involving many plaintiffs, where one of the parties wants to set 
a legal precedent or where a plaintiff expects a jury to award punitive 
damages. Also, parties generally can't appeal a judgment in a binding 
arbitration in the way that a trial judgment can be appealed to a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the money for a private mediation or arbitration is another problem. 
"Private dispute resolution costs money," admitted retired Superior Court Judge 
Leon Savitch, a JAMS mediator, arbitrator, and so-called judge pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Different companies charge differently for their ADR services. Richard J. 
Rosenthal, who heads the Rosenthal Group, a real estate consulting, education 
and mediation firm, said his company charges about $100 for each of the parties 
and another $75 to $250 an hour for a mediator -- depending on the experience 
and qualifications of the mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more expensive mediators and arbitrators aren't necessarily better at 
their work, said Rosenthal, who is a past president of the California Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 A mediator should be someone who is a good listener, Rosenthal said. Many 
mediated disputes have more to do with hurt feelings than money, he said. 
That's why the mediator should also be empathetic and conciliatory. In 
contrast, the arbitrator should be a person with a sense of fairness and 
authority, Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 In certain technical cases, he added, it also helps to have a mediator or 
arbitrator who is familiar with the issues at hand. That makes it possible to 
get the session over with more quickly. The best way to find an arbitrator or 
mediator is by personal recommendation, Rosenthal said. Information about 
arbitration and mediation is also available through the American Arbitration 
Assn. at (213) 383-6516. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great bulk of disputes arise between buyers and sellers after the close 
of escrow," Rosenthal reported. One of his cases involves a buyer who withdrew 
from the purchase of a property when he paid for an inspection and found the 
property wasn't hooked into the local sewer system. The would-be buyer now 
argues that he should have been informed of the sewer problem before paying for 
an inspection. He is seeking reimbursement for the cost of the inspection and 
other miscellaneous expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer threatened to sue the listing agent, who in turn threatened to sue 
the buyer's agent. To avoid the hassle of litigation, the parties will first 
try to work out their disputes in a session conducted by a mediator associated 
with Rosenthal's company. 
</P>
<P>
 While mediation and arbitration seems to be the growing trend, not all lawyers 
are comfortable with the cost of ADR and some of the rights given up by parties 
-- such as the right to appeal a binding arbitration. Arbitration and mediation 
can be very effective ways of settling a legal dispute, said trial lawyer 
McClean. "But look before you leap."

PRIVATE COLLEGES LEARN HOW TO MAKE A MARK; SOME HAVE PROSPERED BY CARVING OUT 
SPECIALIZED CAREER PROGRAMS. BUT ONE SCHOOL HAD ITS LICENSE REVOKED BY THE 
STATE. 
</P>

<P>
 As the third-oldest independent college in Southern California, Woodbury 
University in Burbank -- a small private institution with a solid reputation 
for turning out architects and fashion designers -- has a nagging problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school was founded in 1884, Woodbury's administrators decided 
this year that their biggest problem was that the campus remains virtually 
unknown to the general public. So the university recently hired a public 
relations firm to help it develop a community image -- 110 years after opening 
for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Such anonymity is one of many issues faced by the private colleges, 
universities and trade schools that operate in the San Fernando Valley, 
adjoining valleys and Ventura County. This region has at least 26 
degree-granting institutions, plus an estimated 140 state-licensed career 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 While the local private schools have been largely overshadowed by an array of 
public and higher-profile schools in Southern California, some private schools 
have prospered through the recession by carving out specialized academic or 
career programs in the education marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local nonprofit schools such as Woodbury and Learning Tree University, 
which operates in Chatsworth and Thousand Oaks, have increased their 
enrollments in recent years despite the recession. During the same period, Cal 
State University and community college enrollments have dropped as their fees 
have risen. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbury President Paul Sago said because his school has focused on just a few 
career-specific programs it has kept enrollment strong even though Woodbury's 
tuition also has increased, 8% to 12% annually in recent years. "I think we are 
distinctive. . .in that the students we graduate from Woodbury University are 
employable," Sago said. 
</P>
<P>
 The private school sector has its problems, however, especially among 
for-profit schools. Lax state regulation through the 1980s led California to 
gain a national reputation as a haven for diploma mills that sold degrees. And 
financial-aid fraud and questionable programs still abound, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the state in June revoked the license of 18-year-old Kensington 
University in Glendale -- a for-profit, study-at-home school that offers 
bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in many fields -- after finding it 
failed to meet state standards. The school's owner has denied the allegations 
and he plans to challenge the ruling in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrating the vast differences among private schools, Woodbury University, 
except for its narrow course offerings, operates much like a traditional 
university. Woodbury has an attractive campus, more than 1,000 students, and 
its classes have lecturers, laboratories and a library. By comparison, the 
Learning Tree, headquartered in industrial buildings, resembles UCLA's 
extension program with night courses on a wide variety of trendy topics. And 
Kensington's study-at-home approach holds no actual classes. 
</P>
<P>
 That diversity is echoed through the region's private schools. Among the ones 
that grant academic degrees, for instance, arts are the specialty at the 
respected California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, while Thomas Aquinas 
College in Santa Paula takes a "read great books" approach to learning. Among 
career schools, Castaic has the Paradise Ranch Racing School for horse racing 
jockeys, hopeful Philip Marlowes can learn at the Nick Harris Detective Academy 
in Van Nuys, and state records show an American Academy of Body Sculpting in 
Westlake Village for aspiring fitness trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The regulation process of these schools is Byzantine. Most private 
post-secondary schools are regulated by the state Council for Private 
Postsecondary and Vocational Education, a little-known agency which oversees 
more than 2,100 private career schools. The council also regulates 200-plus 
private colleges and universities that are not accredited by another prominent 
group, the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Woodbury, though, is 
accredited by WASC, so it does not need state approval. Learning Tree's founder 
said he has received an exemption from the state. But Kensington is regulated, 
and it was the council in June that voted to revoke its state approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "California has always been geared toward its public education system. But 
most people know very little about the private segment of education," said 
Kenneth Miller, executive director of the council, created by the Legislature 
in 1991 to overhaul the state's regulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of private colleges and career schools argue they are less 
bureaucratic and more responsive than public schools, both in catering to 
students' needs and to the changing demands of the work force. Woodbury, for 
example, also offers night-only and weekend-only degree programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are downsides. Part-time faculty accounts for 80% of Woodbury's 129 
instructors. And part-time teachers are the only ones offered at Learning Tree 
and Kensington -- far larger shares than at public schools. Library facilities 
are small, in Woodbury's case, and virtually nonexistent for the other two 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition can be steep: At Woodbury tuition runs more than $12,000 a year, 
several times the annual cost of a Cal State school. Kensington charges from 
$2,895 for bachelor's degrees to nearly $4,500 for doctorates in engineering. 
Learning Tree's fees are per course, averaging about $125. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As illustrated by the major differences among these three private schools, 
almost any institution in California can call itself a university, despite the 
ivy-walled traditions conjured by the term, because there are few enforced 
rules about what actually constitutes one. 
</P>
<P>
 At Woodbury, which has a $13-million annual budget, there are no 
intercollegiate sports teams, no debating club, no English, math or science 
majors, and no tenured faculty. The university offers only bachelor's degrees 
in various fields of business, design and architecture, and a master's degree 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
 The university, founded in downtown Los Angeles as Woodbury Business College, 
converted to nonprofit status in 1972 and moved to its 22-acre Burbank campus 
in 1987 hoping to halt dwindling enrollment. The move worked somewhat, with 
enrollment increasing from nearly 800 in 1987 to 1,089 last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But that performance, while better than many public schools, is less than the 
100-students-a-year-increase that Sago set as a goal when he arrived as 
Woodbury's president in 1990. He blamed the recession, a shortage of on-campus 
housing, and the move of a Lockheed plant from Burbank to Palmdale, and other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sago maintains that Woodbury's practical, career-oriented approach is 
the trend of the future. To generate more enrollment, the university added 
architecture in the mid-1980s, the weekend program in 1987 and the night 
program in 1991, the latter two offering business degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 At Learning Tree University's headquarters in Chatsworth, President Michael 
Gould boasted that enrollments in his array of quick-hit classes have been 
steadily increasing ever since he co-founded the school as a disgruntled Cal 
State Northridge business freshman in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly night courses, emphasizing career training and personal improvement 
for adults, vary from painting and makeup artistry to international business 
and environmental management. Learning Tree does not award degrees, although 
some classes carry college credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although enrollment growth flattened during the recent recession, Gould said, 
"We tend to be chameleons to the marketplace. We'll figure out what sells even 
in slow economic times." Thus Learning Tree has begun offering career-related 
certificate programs and now has several dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Woodbury, Learning Tree started as a for-profit school but switched to 
nonprofit status. By law, nonprofit entities are required to have annual 
financial statements available for public inspection. But Gould did not produce 
his school's statement for a week's period despite repeated requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, however, said Learning Tree generated about $6 million in gross revenue 
last year, up substantially from previous years. Enrollments, counted as one 
every time someone signs up for a class, grew from about 32,000 in 1990 to more 
than 41,000 last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning Tree's offerings, which typically run in two-month cycles, are laid 
out in a 50-plus-page catalogue. About 460,000 copies of the catalogue are 
printed each term, Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school began in Chatsworth, expanded to Thousand Oaks in the early 1980s, 
and now is planning to open an Orange County campus. 
</P>

 At Kensington University, owner-attorney Alfred Calabro said he offers a range 
of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees to working adults through 
"accelerated programs, no fat, no bull." Students read portions of books and 
articles at home, then send in written reports and tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabro maintains that the state council acted hastily in revoking his 
school's approval and claims the council is on a campaign to close similar 
non-traditional schools. But the council's final report last month concluded 
much of Kensington's offerings failed to meet even minimum state standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cited one case of a doctoral student who received four units credit 
with an A grade for reading popular magazine articles and writing short 
reaction papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kensington, which opened in 1976 and is housed on one floor of a Glendale 
office building, also awards students academic credit for past work 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been going for 18 years. These state (regulators) are not supposed to 
be executioners. They're supposed to improve the quality of education and try 
to work something out," Calabro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The university, which claims more than 600 students worldwide, tangled with 
the state before in the early 1980s, but settled by paying about $12,000 into a 
scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the state has ordered Calabro to halt enrollments and stop offering 
degrees. Calabro says his next step will be to appeal the state's ruling in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. Degree-Granting Private Colleges, Universities

<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County areas, there are more than two 
dozen private, higher education schools that offer degrees. One way schools are 
rated is by their accreditation, a voluntary process in which educators 
periodically assess a school's compliance with certain standards. The most 
prominent affiliation in California is the Western Assn. of Schools and 
Colleges. Some trade schools and others are accredited by various federally 
approved associations. And some schools have no accreditation, but they still 
have been approved by the state to offer academic degrees.

MENTALLY ILL FIND STRENGTH IN EACH OTHER; HEALTH: O.C. CONFERENCE WILL SHOWCASE 
GROWING SELF-HELP MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Heather Gallas knows what it's like to hear internal voices that begin as 
whispers, then become louder and more demanding, insisting on self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin woman knows what it's like to take a torturous emotional slide, 
from working as a self-supporting word processor to being a chronic mental 
patient, confined to locked wards. Hospitalized about 15 times in six years, 
she tried 40 different psychiatric drugs before hitting on a stabilizing 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Her life experience may not be the usual stuff of an appealing resume, but she 
defied predictions made three years ago that she would never again hold down a 
job or live on her own. And she's convinced that other mental patients, by 
helping one another, can do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in my deepest, darkest, blackest depression," she said, "I could 
not see that other side. I hope I can be that other side to somebody. . . . 
That's what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallas, 34, now an Orange County mental health worker, is an eager member of a 
burgeoning consumer movement among mental health clients who believe there is 
comfort -- and clout -- in numbers. This week, she will join some 1,500 
patients and former patients at the Anaheim Marriott for a five-day national 
conference geared to help them help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a conference to show the consumer that they count," Gallas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, she said, the message has been: ' "You are a schizophrenic and 
you can't do anything. Sit and talk to yourself all day.' I had a friend tell 
me I would never, ever work again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this conference will show, yes, we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Entitled "Alternatives '94," the conference is the 10th annual national 
convention for people with mental illnesses, but the first held in Southern 
California. Almost all the organizers and leaders involved, at one time or 
another, have been diagnosed as mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four times as many participants are expected as were at the inaugural 
conference in Baltimore nine years ago -- a good indication, organizers say, 
that their movement is taking off. "We've just sort of reached a critical 
mass," said Joseph A. Rogers, executive director of the National Mental Health 
Consumers' Self-Help Clearinghouse, sponsor of the conference with the help of 
such local agencies as the Orange County Health Care Agency and the Mental 
Health Assn. of Orange County. "If it's a legitimate effort, and you get enough 
people involved, it takes on a life of its own," Rogers said. "Also, I think 
there's a general cynicism about the old ways of doing things . . . (which) 
opens people up to new ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say they picked Southern California for the convention partly 
because mental-health consumerism here has lagged behind other parts of the 
country. The reasons are unclear, Rogers said, but he speculated the initially 
radical nature of the movement in Northern California kept the state's more 
conservative areas on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to get it going" in the south, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees with that comparative assessment, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are all behind," said Dr. Rick Massimino, a psychiatrist who 
founded the John Henry Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Orange serving 
mentally ill people. Everywhere "there's still terrible discrimination, a need 
for flexibility and understanding," but particularly in the workplace and 
housing markets, Massimino said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conference, more than 100 workshops will cover topics including "The 
Nuts and Bolts of a Successful Consumer Newsletter," "Using Humor to Turn Your 
Life Around" and "Spirituality and the Self." But the hottest topics this year 
are expected to be employment and health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop leaders will speak from personal experience as mental patients or 
former patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these people are types that haven't lived what they are talking 
about," Rogers said -- himself included. Years before becoming a movement 
leader, as a teen-ager, he suffered a "psychotic break" and lived on the 
streets of New York City for nine months, eating out of garbage cans and 
sleeping on a park bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders will "discuss what it is that's helped them recover. They're not some 
Ph.D., some theoretician saying what might help the mentally ill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health clients like Marty Fuca of Garden Grove appreciate this 
hands-on, fraternal approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuca, who attended the "Alternatives" conference in Berkeley three years ago, 
said he picked up practical tips no therapist ever gave him: that it's 
particularly important to avoid junk food, for example, and to spend at least 
two hours a day in sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are things I want to know, just like a diabetic's got to have insulin," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the people at the Berkeley conference were "a little strange," he 
said, "but at least they were trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Their aspirations were not grandiose, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew they weren't Lee Iacoccas . . . but they wanted to know 'My life 
means something.' They wanted to know if they're thrown in the loony bin, 'I'm 
not going to be there the rest of my life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fuca said even outpatient therapy, let alone institutionalization, made him 
feel as though he was a hopeless case, as though he ought to wear a sign saying 
"Marty Fuca, mentally ill." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers and others are careful to stress, however, that theirs is not an 
anti-professional, anti-white-coat movement. Rogers does take issue with large 
institutions that, in his view, make feeble efforts at rehabilitation, and he 
objects to over-reliance on therapists, but he does not condemn all doctors or 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The professional can provide a certain level of care when the patient is in 
an acute state," he said. But "on a day-to-day basis, living in the community, 
you've got to be responsible for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Some psychiatrists recognized long ago the healing power of compassion and 
empathy among patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "They understand (each other)," said Himasiri De Silva, president of the 
Orange County Psychiatric Society and co-founder of the patient-directed group, 
Depressive and Manic Depressive Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have gone through similar episodes. They can identify with each other . 
. . know there is hope, there is a light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a practical advantage: "The therapist is not always available. A 
friend is available most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists do not view the consumer movement as supplanting their role, De 
Silva said. On the other hand, he said, he wishes his peers would be more 
supportive of the consumer movement by referring patients to groups run by 
their peers. But patients aren't combining forces just to help themselves cope 
-- it's also a way to get things done. De Silva points out that 5% to 10% of 
the population suffer from a mental illness -- that means there are millions of 
people who together could wield formidable political and economic power. 
</P>
<P>
 Former House majority whip Tony Coelho, the conference's keynote speaker 
Friday morning, says he will urge his audience to stand up for themselves in 
the workplace and in the debate over health-care reform, to ensure that their 
needs are covered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which Coelho introduced, made it 
illegal to discriminate against disabled workers and required employers to make 
"reasonable accommodations" for them. But that, Coelho said, was only half the 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go out there now and fight for our rights," said Coelho, an 
epileptic who chairs the President's Committee on Employment of People with 
Disabilities. "That's cumbersome and tiresome and irritating, but at least 
we're in the ballgame now." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said proof that mentally ill consumers are major political players lies 
in the support they now are receiving from government agencies at the national 
and local levels. This year's conference, for example, was funded through a 
grant from the federal Center for Mental Health Services. Orange County mental 
health officials are providing support in the form of in-kind services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say no when a group of organized citizens demands something," 
Rogers said, adding that officials value the efficiency and cost-effectiveness 
of self-help organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 For people like Gallas, the newfound recognition and power are plainly 
exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mental health movement is getting huge," she said. "It's going to be a 
big surprise. We're going to send quite a message to a lot of people."

TEEN MASTERMIND IN TAY MURDER GETS LIFE PRISON TERM; COURTS: JUDGE PRECLUDES 
PAROLE AFTER PLEAS FROM CHAN'S AND VICTIM'S PARENTS. SHE CALLS CASE 'A TRAGEDY 
FOR SOCIETY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The teen-age mastermind of one of Orange County's most unsettling murders was 
sentenced Monday to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 
slaying of a 17-year-old honors student. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan, 19, a onetime high school valedictorian candidate, sat 
impassively as the judge handed down the sentence for the 1992 New Year's Eve 
killing of Stuart A. Tay of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was one of five Orange County teen-agers convicted of beating Tay with 
baseball bats and a sledgehammer, pouring rubbing alcohol down his throat and 
leaving him to die, bound and gagged, in a shallow back-yard grave in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the sentencing, both Chan's and Tay's parents made emotional pleas to 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary. Their comments conveyed 
to a packed courtroom the travesty and heartbreak of a crime that involved 
academically ambitious teen-agers from supportive, loving families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big tragedy for all the families in this case," said Tony Chan, who 
begged the judge to show his son mercy. "It's just like living in hell 24 hours 
a day. . . . We love Robert very much. He means the entire world to us. There 
is no meaning to life without Robert." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's parents, Alfred and Linda Tay, pleaded that no leniency be given. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robert Chan is a cruel and diabolical killer," Linda Tay said through sobs. 
"He is evil incarnate. The fact that he is so intelligent and yet so 
coldblooded is frightening. Life without parole is the least he deserves. He 
never should be given another chance to inflict this type of pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Tay said his family has been ruined by the ordeal. "Nothing can change 
the fact that our family will forever be incomplete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Chan orchestrated Tay's murder with four other 
teen-agers because they believed Tay was about to double-cross them in a plan 
to rob an Anaheim computer parts dealer. The plan fell apart, prosecutors said, 
when Chan discovered that Tay was lying to him about his name, age and 
background and feared that Tay was a police informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan and the other boys lured Tay to a Buena Park garage on New Year's Eve, 
1992, by telling him he could buy a gun to use in the robbery. When Tay went to 
examine the weapon, he was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Tay was beaten for 20 minutes during the rehearsed 
attack. He begged for his life before the alcohol was poured down his throat 
and he was gagged, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge O'Leary, who has been involved with the case for the past 18 months, 
said she found it impossible to reconcile the backgrounds of the youths with 
the robbery they were plotting to commit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inexplicable to me that Mr. Chan, given the love and support of his 
family, and Mr. Tay, given the love and support of his family, would ever have 
come together to plan a residential robbery . . . or how Mr. Chan and Mr. Tay 
could meet on the night of Stuart Tay's death to discuss the purchase of a 
firearm," O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this case is not only tragic for these families, but it's also a 
tragedy for society. I think there are a lot of families, and a lot of parents 
who are wondering how this could happen," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The case received wide attention from the media because of the seeming 
incongruity of bright teen-agers from stable homes involved in a vicious 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was a top student at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton and his IQ 
hovered near the genius level. Tay, who attended Foothill High School in Santa 
Ana, was an honors student who planned to go to an Ivy League school and become 
a doctor like his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teen-agers, though, seemed attracted to crime and danger. Tay apparently 
bragged of having underworld connections with dozens of followers working for 
him, while Chan boasted of his links with an Asian gang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their bravado that landed them in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan admitted his involvement in Tay's murder but testified at trial that he 
believed Tay was a powerful crime figure who would kill him if he backed out of 
the robbery plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan denied masterminding the murder, as the four other defendants contended. 
A jury deliberated less than three hours before convicting him of first-degree 
murder May 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other defendants, Charles Choe, 18, of Fullerton, and Mun Bong Kang, 19 of 
Fullerton, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The other two defendants, 
Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, and Kirn Young Kim, 18, of Fullerton, were 
convicted of first-degree murder July 1 in a separate trial and are awaiting 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The key witness for the prosecution was Choe, who admitted participating in 
the murder but said he did not strike Tay. Because he cooperated with 
prosecutors, he was sentenced to a California Youth Authority facility and is 
expected to be released when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, Acosta and Kang are scheduled to be sentenced after a review by the 
California Youth Authority to evaluate whether they should be locked up in 
prison with adults or with juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to Monday's sentencing, Chan's attorney Marshall M. Schulman petitioned 
the court for a new trial and a reduced sentence. O'Leary denied the new trial 
motion and said the murder conviction with the special allegation of lying in 
wait compelled her to give Chan a prison sentence of life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pre-sentencing report, Chan wrote to the court and the Tay family to 
explain what had happened and express his remorse for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his outlook on life devolved shortly after he read "The Stranger" by 
French author Albert Camus, which discusses existentialist philosophy. Chan 
wrote that he interpreted the novel as saying "everything was meaningless and 
nothing matters because we are all going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said he stopped caring about his schoolwork and personal hygiene and 
found it difficult to concentrate. Also, he said, he started hearing voices 
quoting lines from "The Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, it is nearly impossible for me to fathom the fact that I 
degenerated from a hard-working student and good citizen to a deranged 
individual who took another human being's life," he wrote to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page letter to the Tay family, Chan wrote: "I shudder when I try to 
imagine how you must feel. I know your pain is infinitely worse. I know now, 
all too late, that not only have I destroyed one life, I have destroyed many." 
</P>
<P>
 The grief of both Chan's and Tay's parents was evident during the two-hour 
court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Chan, who sat with his wife, said he was "responsible" for the crime 
because he did not have his son visit a psychiatrist sooner than he did. "We 
love him more than our own lives," he said. "We will never abandon him." 
</P>
<P>
 In an eloquent, prepared statement, Linda Tay spoke of the "gaping hole" in 
her life since her son was killed. She said her son enjoyed the cars, 
computers, clothes and many other things that teen-age boys are interested in. 
He was "filled with curiosity" and "everything was special and exciting to 
him," she said. "He had so much to live for. . . . We miss him very much."

'86 IMMIGRANT HIRING BAN USED IN L.A. CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight years after a sweeping immigration law made it a crime for business 
owners to knowingly hire illegal immigrants, federal authorities have filed the 
first felony charge against an employer in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, federal prosecutors indicted a former manager of a Los Angeles 
medical clinic on charges of repeatedly accepting fake documents when hiring 
workers. The difficulty of proving such accusations, as well as political and 
economic factors, have hindered the filing of criminal charges before now, 
immigration experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time the INS gave us information that we think we can prove 
in court," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Brent Whittlesey, who is prosecuting the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions against employers for hiring illegal immigrants were a cornerstone 
of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which contained provisions 
to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the United States. But criminal 
charges have proven difficult to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the debate on immigration is reaching a crescendo among many 
California politicians and voters, the eight-year gap underscores the seemingly 
impossible task of controlling the illegal tide of immigrants into the state. 
It also highlights the failure of the 1986 law to solve the problem, 
immigration advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the larger context, this is yet another example of how enforcement has 
been unsuccessful in stopping undocumented immigration," said Charles Wheeler, 
an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although numerous employers have been fined for hiring illegal immigrants, the 
absence of criminal charges before last week is especially puzzling given 
Southern California's prominence as a destination point for workers who enter 
the state illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1986 law, employers are required to ask workers for documents such 
as a Social Security card or work permit, which are often counterfeited and 
easily obtained by illegal immigrants. Showing that a business has engaged in a 
pattern of knowingly hiring illegal workers is difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 But immigration experts say the recent public outcry over illegal immigration 
is a primary reason that charges are being filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened sentiment against illegal immigration has emboldened the 
government to go after employers in this more public fashion, said Roberto 
Lovato, executive director of Central American Resource Center, an immigrant 
advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is the immigration debate and enforcement has been one-sided. If you 
don't look at the employer part of it, you don't see the economic magnet that 
draws people to L.A. and California," Lovato said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the lack of previous criminal charges may reflect the 
government's reluctance to crack down on California businesses in the midst of 
a recession, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners "really like having cheap labor with limited rights," said Ira 
Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform and an 
outspoken proponent of the 1986 law's provisions. Mehlman said immigrant rights 
advocates also have formed a powerful constituency against employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jack Kyser, a chief economist for the nonprofit Economic Development 
Corp., said business is not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's an unfair characterization because businesses want to comply 
with the law," Kyser said. "Most businesses I have dealt with realize that they 
cannot compete by relying on cheap labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the law was enacted, federal authorities have imposed numerous civil 
penalties totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars against Southern California 
businesses for hiring illegal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Random checks of businesses by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents 
have shown that those penalties are deterring employers from hiring illegal 
workers, said John Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The provisions work well," he said. "We're not seeing repeat violations." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the felony case against the former medical clinic manager is far more 
serious than most other employer-sanction cases because the woman allegedly 
knew that the workers were using fake documents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the indictment delivered last week federal prosecutors allege that Leticia 
Ruiz de la Cruz, 40, knowingly accepted fake Social Security, alien 
registration and temporary resident cards to hire illegal workers while serving 
as the manager of Clinica Medica Familiar, which operates several medical 
clinics in the Los Angeles area. The indictment also alleges that Ruiz 
encouraged people who she knew were here illegally to remain in the country. 
She is also charged with using a fake Social Security number to compute payroll 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz's attorney, Tom Mesereau, said Monday that she is innocent. "We 
categorically and emphatically deny any guilt and look forward to vigorously 
defending this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesereau suggested that Ruiz was being set up by a disgruntled former employee 
who stole clinic documents and handed them over to INS investigators. 
"Unfortunately, it appears that government agencies were taken in by this 
former employee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brechtel said the main problem with enforcing the law is that employers are 
unable to determine whether a document is counterfeit. Some immigration experts 
say that issue would be addressed by adopting a national identification card, a 
controversial proposal that has been debated in recent years by Congress. Last 
week, the federal Commission on Immigration recommended adopting a national 
identification system that included ID cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (1986 immigration) law is on the books, but how can you really tell that 
a Social Security card is valid unless you are a documents expert," Mehlman 
said. "That's really been the Achilles heel of employer sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent counterfeiting, proponents say, the ID card could function like a 
credit card, with a magnetic strip containing information such as a Social 
Security number and birth date. Immigrant rights advocates and civil 
libertarians oppose such a card, saying it would lead to a centralized filing 
system that would threaten the privacy and individual rights of all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant rights groups also have opposed the employer-sanction provisions of 
the 1986 law, saying they have led to employer discrimination against legal 
residents and U.S. citizens with Spanish surnames or who look foreign. A 1990 
report by the federal General Accounting Office concluded that employer 
sanctions caused a "widespread pattern of discrimination" against citizens and 
other eligible workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report added that employers have not stopped hiring undocumented 
workers. Arrests of immigrants illegally crossing the U.S. border reached a 
high of 1.8 million in 1986 before dropping to 954,000 in 1989, according to 
INS data. The number of arrests reached 1.2 million in 1993.

PRINCIPAL IN PROM BIAS CASE REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high school principal who briefly chose to cancel his school's prom rather 
than allow interracial dating was removed from his post Monday, two days after 
the school was destroyed in a fire authorities suspect may have been 
deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying it was time for the racially troubled county to heal its wounds, the 
Randolph County School Board voted unanimously to reassign Hulond Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, school board president Danny McCord's voice cracked as he read 
a statement asking the community to "help us build from the ashes of Randolph 
County High School." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragic place to start," he said. "I beg your help." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, 55, who is white, will take an administrative post for the county 
school system. His chief duty will be to oversee the rebuilding of the school. 
The board named a white teacher to replace him, and a black teacher from 
another school was named assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry A. Sterling, Alabama field representative for the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, hailed the decision, saying the community now can begin 
to heal. "The next few days are critical," he said. "There are some tempers 
that will have to cool off." Sterling had been among African American leaders 
who had called for Humphries to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, who had been the school's principal for 25 years, was reportedly 
out of town Monday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, which has 20,000 people, has been divided along racial lines on 
whether the principal should be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Smith, 34, a white convenience store clerk, sympathized with Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so sad. He dedicated his whole life to that school," she said. "So 
many people just lie about what kind of person he is. He didn't mean to say 
what he said." 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Lee, 17, who will be a senior in the fall, said she was considering 
transferring out of the school district because of Humphries. "He doesn't 
deserve to be anything to the school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions have been high here since February, when Humphries asked for a show 
of hands at a student assembly from those who planned to attend the prom with a 
date of a different race. When a number of students raised their hands, he 
announced that the prom would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 When ReVonda Bowen, a junior of mixed parentage, stood up and asked who she 
could bring to the prom, Humphries reportedly said her parents had made a 
"mistake" in bearing her. 
</P>
<P>
 He backed off from his threat to cancel the prom the next day, but African 
Americans who have alleged for years that the principal discriminated against 
blacks in discipline and hiring continued to demand his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions flared to new heights after the school was gutted early Saturday, 
only hours before the scheduled start of a Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference march calling for Humphries' ouster, and a rumored 
counterdemonstration by the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
 A black television cameraman was roughed up while filming Humphries at the 
school as fire fighters battled the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries reportedly rushed the camera saying "Why don't you just get out of 
here?" A hand covered the lens as an unidentified voice said, "You black sons 
of bitches burned this school." 
</P>
<P>
 The cameraman was treated for neck and shoulder injuries. His camera was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The SCLC march was postponed, and the KKK kept a low profile. Arson 
investigators initially said the fire appeared to have been set, but state Fire 
Marshal John Robison said arson was just one of a number of possible causes 
being examined. Federal agents also were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to guess at the cause of this fire," Robison said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials briefly suspended Humphries in March while they investigated 
the prom incident and agreed to pay $25,000 toward Bowen's college education. 
But in May, the U.S. Justice Department filed a complaint alleging racial 
discrimination in the school district and asked that Humphries be replaced. 
Lawyers for both sides had been trying to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the department's motion had been set for Thursday in federal 
court in Montgomery. There was no immediate word on whether Monday's vote would 
affect the hearing, although Sterling predicted the Justice Department would 
drop its lawsuit if it is determined that the board's actions satisfies the 
black community's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sterling said complaints of hiring discrimination, promotions and 
curriculum go beyond the presence of Humphries as principal, he added: "A lot 
of the problems will leave when he leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was gratified that the black teacher was promoted to assistant 
principal in Monday's reorganization. The 680-student high school is about 38% 
black. It was integrated some 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the vote, Donald Sweeny, the school board's attorney, said, "The 
feeling of the superintendent and the board was that it was in the best 
interest of the community to begin the healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 There had been arguments during the board's emotional closed-door session, but 
in the end the seven-member board agreed unanimously to remove the principal. 
"This wasn't legal strategizing," Sweeny said of the board's move. "The board 
was trying to find some way to reach out to all aspects of the community for 
the reconstruction of the school and the reconstruction of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously the only board member in favor of removing Humphries had been the 
single African American member. Another board member who had argued against 
Humphries' reinstatement earlier resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Humphries' supporters said Monday night that his comments had been 
blown out of proportion, but they said they supported the school board's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a good idea to me," said Roger Hammett, a local hospital 
worker. "They had to have a change to make everybody happy." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, soon after the controversy flared, the high school was briefly 
closed because of a bomb threat. But the community was in obvious shock Monday 
following the weekend burning of the school.

RETURN TO RWANDA FILLED WITH UNKNOWNS; AFRICA: THE POWERFUL AND THE POOR 
OVERCOME THEIR FEARS AND BEGIN TO TRICKLE HOME. WHAT THEY FIND IS A RAVAGED 
LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From politician to peasant, a trickle of Rwandans have defied their old 
government, withstood shrill warnings of retaliation and returned home to their 
looted, blood-soaked country. And from what can be seen on this side of the 
border, away from the refugee camps in Zaire, they are glad to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear has passed," said Laurent Ngwijabanzi, 45, a bean and banana farmer. 
He lives with his wife, Constantine Nyiramahne, 42, in a steep hillside village 
with two of their children. Five other offspring remain refugees in Zaire, 15 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Down a precipitous footpath, out a winding dirt road, then north along the 
main highway, a different kind of refugee also has returned home: Banzi 
Weralsi, 67, the former ruling party strongman in this prefecture, a man who 
once controlled the much-feared Interhamwe militia. The Interhamwe are the 
young men who are blamed for much of the genocide that occurred this spring and 
summer in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Weralsi now sits in a Naugahyde chair in a plain cement-block home, with 
soldiers of his old enemy -- troops who surely lost family in the killing -- 
casually staffing a checkpoint 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only assurance I have that they will not kill me is that I'm not guilty. 
My heart has not charged me with murder," Weralsi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories like these two -- those of the strongman and the struggling man -- may 
not be representative of all that is happening in this shattered country. 
</P>
<P>
 Its politics are murky and violent. Vengeance is as old as Africa. People here 
also are posturing for survival under the eyes of the newly victorious Rwandan 
Patriotic Front, which drove the old government from this country. With the old 
government came one of the most tragic refugee stampedes in history. 
</P>
<P>
 But from what a visitor can see, Rwanda on this Monday is only a day's walk 
from refugee hell. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, Americans are familiar with the story of this far-off tragedy: The 
former government was run mostly by Hutus. The new government is represented 
mostly by Tutsis. The bitter blood between these peoples has raged for 
generations. It boiled over in April when Hutus and their militias rampaged 
and, international aid agencies estimate, killed perhaps 500,000 Tutsis, maybe 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Gisenyi, like most Rwandan towns, experienced its share of the genocide. 
Before that, in 1991 and 1992, Tutsis were slaughtered here by the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows what happens to the Tutsi. I cannot repeat it. . . . People 
were being killed like cutting bananas with a machete," farmer Ngwijabanzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days ago, from the despair and disease of the refugee camps, he returned 
to Rwanda. Up the loose footpath, his home is made of earthen blocks with a 
cement floor, three bare rooms, peeling yellow walls and a framed photograph of 
his family and himself on display. In the picture, he wears a tie and suit 
jacket. "I was a young man then, and handsome, and those were good days." 
</P>
<P>
 Why were they good? "Because there was no war in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ngwijabanzi's clothes are ragged and deeply soiled. His teeth are bad. 
He routed his family from Rwanda in the dark of night when Hutu officials drove 
the roads and told everyone, "Get out quickly from this country. The RPF will 
kill you, surely!" 
</P>
<P>
 Of his three weeks as a refugee, Ngwijabanzi observes: "The worst period of my 
life was in Zaire. I saw what I had never seen before. The streets were full of 
bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, officials of the Hutu-led government-in-exile and their Interhamwe 
militia hooligans enforce a brutal discipline on those suffering 900,000 or so 
refugees who have refused to go home and remain huddled across the border in 
Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Their message is the same as what brought the refugees here: Don't go home; 
you will be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than one in 10 refugees has taken the risk and returned. On Monday, 
there were decidedly different accounts of just how many refugees are leaving 
the camps. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said the 
number was increasing. But U.N. troops monitoring the border said the number 
was only about 1,400 a day and decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the roads of the region, there were surprisingly few returnees to be 
seen, perhaps only 100 or so in nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were many rumors we would be killed," Ngwijabanzi explained. "I decided 
to come and see if it was true. I cannot lie -- when we crossed the border we 
were afraid. We thought we might die." 
</P>
<P>
 But one day home in Rwanda turned into two; it's now been almost a week. 
Ngwijabanzi said the Tutsi soldiers of the new government aren't seeking 
revenge, but "treat us gently; we are no longer afraid. . . . Apart from a lack 
of food, there is no problem here at all. . . . There have been no disturbances 
at all, I swear to it." 
</P>
<P>
 By his account, the new government inflicts less terror than his fellow Hutus 
did when they governed. Then, he recalled, "Everybody was frightened. People 
were not just killed because they were Tutsi." He told of neighbors informing 
on neighbors, arbitrary violence at every turn. Once, 20 soldiers stormed his 
house because he had a visitor and someone reported it as suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ngwijabanzi's peace of mind is not complete because his stomach will soon 
be empty. The mass of Hutu refugees who swarmed through this border region 
looted almost everything on their way to Zaire. Ngwijabanzi said he had just 
finished harvesting 225 pounds of beans. They were stolen. His banana grove was 
stripped bare. His five goats were stolen by Zairian soldiers at the border. 
His water supply has gone bad. Now he has money for only two days. And not a 
single seed to plant for the new bean crop. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why my other children stayed in the camps," he said. "At least there, 
they can get food. When there is food here, I will go back and get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although primitive, Ngwijabanzi's home is beautifully situated. It has the 
feel of a mountain cabin, with a grand vista of 100 acres of banana groves. 
Beyond are steep hills, terraced for beans; farther still are the high green 
mountains of interior Rwanda. Other homes are clustered on this slope. But only 
three families from the entire village have returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "In time . . . they will come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ngwijabanzi's story is simple, politician Weralsi's is infinitely 
impenetrable. He was the sworn enemy of the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
His militia is accused of brutality against the Tutsis -- violence considered 
among history's most savage. He ran the government's MRND political party in 
this part of the nation from 1992 until he fled with the other refugees in 
advance of the Tutsi army. 
</P>
<P>
 But here he is, under Tutsi protection, with his Rolex watch and his friend, 
Augistine Bizimungu, a former mayor and another leading Hutu from the defeated 
regime. They sit in the living room of one of Weralsi's three homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The former mayor is a doctor. With all the medical calamity around him, he 
sits in his pressed suit and complains that he has not had his tea. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tutsi army officer directs visitors to the house, then drives away. This 
means the interview is unsupervised, the interpreter independent; no soldiers 
are within sight. 
</P>
<P>
 By simple logic, these two men would be among the last to return to face the 
new regime. How could their hands be bloodless when even they acknowledge 
butchery occurred here? 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to stop the killing (of Tutsis)," insists Weralsi. "But those who 
wouldn't stop were bandits, outside the law." He said his control of the 
militia slipped away in 1993. And he willingly names the man who supposedly 
took charge of the armed youth wing during its rampage -- he identifies him as 
Bernard Munyagishahi. "They are wicked people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Weralsi can be understood as nothing more than a simple survivor, 
willing to change allegiance swiftly in turbulent Africa. After all, he has 
been involved in Rwandan politics since 1959; that, itself, surely requires 
nimble instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to recognize that the power has changed," he said. "This is not the 
first time the power has changed. The first thing I have to do is accept that 
power and do what they say. Surely it will change another time." 
</P>
<P>
 So will he testify at an international inquiry into the Tutsi genocide? "Of 
course. . . . No doubt, I know exactly who was entirely involved in the 
massacres. But also many things were done alone in the night." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of his old henchmen, the militia? Who could know better than he if 
they are apt to hunt him down someday as a traitor? "They certainly are a 
danger."

NEW STRAINS OF AIDS VIRUS ARE IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers have identified as many as 30 different strains of the AIDS virus 
that often elude conventional tests used to detect their presence in blood, a 
Belgian researcher said here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new strains, first isolated in the Central African country of Cameroon, 
have never been detected in the United States and present no threat now to the 
American blood supply, J. Richard George of the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention told the 10th International Conference on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But French scientists have identified the viruses, collectively called HIV-1 
subtype O, in at least 10 people in Paris, some of whom have no connection to 
Cameroon. Existing blood tests may eventually have to be modified to ensure 
they detect the new strains as well, a recent meeting at the World Health 
Organization concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development, Dr. Robert Gallo, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, 
announced that he may have found the first effective treatment for Kaposi's 
sarcoma, the form of cancer that is often a distinguishing feature of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he reported only animal data, Gallo said his new approach is 
supported by indirect evidence in humans and that it should be put into 
clinical trial immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS activists have long criticized the scientific Establishment for devoting 
insufficient effort toward development of a treatment for Kaposi's and its 
disfiguring tumors. If Gallo's results are validated in humans, it could 
represent a significant advance in treatment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The human immunodeficiency virus mutates extremely rapidly, as much as 1 
million times faster than most other organisms; that instability has led to a 
proliferation of strains of HIV. Genetic information in these different strains 
can vary by a fraction of a percent or by as much as 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the viruses can be grouped together in various ways. Two main 
types are recognized -- HIV-1 and HIV-2. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV-1 is the family that causes disease in most of the world, while HIV-2 
predominates in areas of West Africa. These two families can further be broken 
down into eight subtypes, labeled A through H; all these subtypes are readily 
recognized by existing tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The new strains are called subtype O, for "outliers," because they lie outside 
the existing subtypes. The subtype O strains do not necessarily resemble each 
other, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The first subtype O HIV was, in fact, reported at the 1988 International AIDS 
Conference by Guido van der Groen of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in 
Antwerp, Belgium. It was dismissed as a "curiosity" of no importance, said Dr. 
Peter Piot of WHO. 
</P>
<P>
 But Van der Groen reported here Monday that as many as 10% of AIDS patients in 
Cameroon have antibodies to one of the subtype O viruses. The strains are also 
found in as many as 6% of AIDS patients in neighboring Niger and Gabon but not 
in other nearby countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar results were reported by Josef Eberle of the Max von Pettenkofer 
Institut in Munich, Germany. He and his colleagues found that as many as 30% of 
infections by new subtypes could not be detected by one or more tests normally 
used to monitor HIV infections. 
</P>
<P>
 "More disturbing," he said, were similar problems in the more sophisticated 
tests, called western blots, that are used to confirm results in the 
preliminary tests. 
</P>
<P>
 French researchers reported earlier this summer in the medical journal the 
Lancet that they had identified HIV-1 subtype O in nine AIDS patients in Paris, 
most of whom had connections to Cameroon. The virus went undetected in at least 
one instance when subjected to each blood test normally used to test for HIV 
infection; one test missed the virus in blood from all nine patients and is no 
longer used in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, co-discoverer of the 
AIDS virus, said Monday that he had also isolated a subtype O strain from a 
French woman who has apparently harbored the virus since at least 1978 and who 
has no known risk factors for infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Van der Groen said at least 30 subtype O strains are now known. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said there is no immediate threat from the new strains but noted that 
HIV-2 was first discovered in the same fashion. The growing number of cases in 
Cameroon suggests that the virus is spreading, Van der Groen said. But he 
emphasized that "there is no reason why there has to be changes in existing HIV 
tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo's work on Kaposi's sarcoma at the National Cancer Institute involved 
basic research on the mechanism of tumor formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Gallo developed an "immortal" line of Kaposi's cells that 
can be grown in the laboratory and injected into immunodeficient mice to 
produce the first animal model of the disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using these cells, he discovered that Kaposi's cells are controlled by a 
hormone that is produced during pregnancy, called human chorionic gonadotropin 
or hCG. This hormone, he said, can prevent the formation of Kaposi's tumors 
when injected into the immunodeficient mice along with the malignant Kaposi's 
cells. It can also cure a tumor when injected into mice after the tumor has had 
time to establish itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo noted that another female hormone, called luteinizing hormone, is about 
85% identical to hCG and may, thus, aid in controlling the tumor. "That may 
provide the first explanation for why men get Kaposi's far more often than 
women do," he said.

BENEFITS BOARD IS PRIME PLAYER IN HEALTH DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They would decide what treatments would be covered. They would set the amount 
that patients pay for a doctor's visit or a specific medical procedure. If 
federal funds should run short, they would impose limits on mental health 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 They would be appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation. But 
once in office, the public would have scant opportunity to influence their 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their broad powers, nobody knows who would serve on the National 
Health Benefits Board, which would be created by the health reform legislation 
that is to be debated on the Senate floor beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are certain to attack the board as the epitome of big government: 
faceless bureaucrats who would make potentially life-or-death decisions without 
direct public accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a board actually define in detail what the benefits structure will 
look like is the most extreme example of a hyperpoliticized process," said 
Richard I. Smith, a health policy analyst at the Assn. of Private Pension and 
Welfare Plans. Others said that concentrating coverage decisions in a federal 
bureaucracy would be likely to delay innovative treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Deborah Steelman, a health care lobbyist and GOP strategist, 
noted that the federal government did not decide to cover heart transplants 
under Medicare until "three to five years after they became fairly routine in 
the private market." 
</P>
<P>
 But many analysts said that the board's authority and lack of accountability 
actually would be its chief strengths. "A board can take more time in making 
those decisions than Congress. And it can make them in a less political 
atmosphere," said David Eddy, a physician in Jackson Hole, Wyo., who has been 
advising members of Congress of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you create a new government entity, you are obviously vulnerable to 
charges of big government," said analyst Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser 
Family Foundation, a nonprofit group that studies health issues. "So I think 
it's wise for proponents of this approach to present it as a consumer 
protection issue." 
</P>
<P>
 If every American is to be provided with health insurance -- President 
Clinton's bottom line -- there will have to be a universally available standard 
benefits package. And one of the key questions is who would define that very 
visible payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a sleeper issue all along. If it had been proposed all by itself, 
it would have been highly controversial," Steelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board proposal has a long way to go before it becomes reality. It is not 
in the House plan, so even if it passes the Senate, it would have to be 
approved by the House. It is, however, one of several second-tier issues that 
has the potential to ignite into a full-fledged fight, along with the larger 
issues of universal coverage and employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the President's proposal, which defined the scope of coverage in 
excruciating detail, Mitchell's bill only specifies 16 general categories of 
medical services to be covered, leaving to the board specific decisions about 
the scope and duration of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, that may open Mitchell's approach to the type of attack that 
the White House launched against a plan by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), which 
also proposed a board to define a standard benefits package. The President and 
other Administration officials repeatedly criticized Cooper's approach by 
saying that the public deserves to know at the beginning precisely what it will 
be getting. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, a senior Administration analyst defended Mitchell, saying that 
the creation of a board is "a way of getting around having to define everything 
-- right down to how many days of coverage and what the deductibles should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Clinton plan that was proposed last September featured an even 
more powerful board -- one that would have been allowed to set national 
standards and oversee the establishment and administration of health systems 
throughout the country. It was quietly dropped after a firestorm of criticism 
over the bureaucratic nature of Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mitchell's plan, the board's authority would be markedly curtailed. 
Still, the body would wield considerable clout. 
</P>
<P>
 It would define what treatments and procedures -- and how frequently they 
should be used -- are medically necessary and appropriate and therefore 
eligible for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, although not initially expected to be covered, Mitchell's bill 
requires the board to specifically study the cost of providing in-vitro 
fertilization as well as preventive and restorative dental care for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if mental health coverage becomes too costly, Mitchell would allow the 
board to place limits on such coverage, starting with hospitalizations and then 
outpatient psychotherapy for adults. Both major Democratic bills envision 
mental health coverage, but many skeptics have said that the cost could be 
prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading health reform bill in the House, put together by Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), does not propose a national health board because 
it simply requires that all Americans receive the coverage now provided by 
Medicare, the government-financed insurance program for those over 65. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, however, Gephardt's bill specifies various "enhancements" and 
out-of-pocket spending limits, such as annual deductibles of $500 for an 
individual and $750 per family and outpatient prescription drug coverage with a 
separate deductible of $500, 20% cost-sharing and a $1,000 annual out-of-pocket 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mitchell's proposal, the board would develop three specific schedules 
for cost-sharing -- that is, the out-of-pocket payments by consumers. According 
to Mitchell's plan, the three options are a "low cost" fee schedule similar to 
that of a typical health maintenance organization, a "high cost" fee schedule 
resembling a traditional fee-for-service plan and a hybrid of the two that 
would allow subscribers to pay a higher fee if, on occasion, they wish to see a 
doctor outside their plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The board would have an annual budget of at least $5 million. No more than 
four of its members would be from the same political party. Members would serve 
staggered, six-year terms.

COLUMN ONE; A MAVERICK LAYS DOWN THE LAW; SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO SAYS HIS CITIZEN 
POSSE AND OTHER HIGH-PROFILE PROGRAMS SHOW HE'S TOUGH ON CRIME. SOME PHOENIX 
RESIDENTS LIKE HIS STYLE. OTHERS SAY HE'S A PUBLICITY HOUND WHOSE TACTICS MAY 
LEAD TO TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a boy, Joe Arpaio lived for "oaters," those Saturday matinees starring 
Hollywood's singing cowboys who knew good from evil, and whose righteousness 
made local folks eager to ride with them on the dusty trail of outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County, Arpaio has mobilized his own 
2,200-member volunteer posse, 800 of whom strap on side arms and Stetsons to 
join deputies in crime-fighting blitzkriegs across the Phoenix valley. 
</P>
<P>
 To some critics, the mostly white, middle- and upper-middle-class posse is 
profoundly amateurish, an armed and zealous band of lawyers, doctors, 
politicians, corporate executives and pot-bellied retirees out to savor the 
excitement of ridding their city of hell-raisers and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff says they are a tightly regulated group of men and women who -- at 
minimal cost to taxpayers -- help his understaffed and poorly funded office 
guard a citizenship longing for law and order. While armed, his posse members 
cannot draw their weapons unless their lives are threatened, or make an arrest 
without the supervision of a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The posse is but one example of the Wild West feel Arpaio has brought to the 
nation's fifth largest sheriff's department since he was elected in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Making good on a vow to "get tough on criminals," the 62-year-old former U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration agent has launched high-profile programs that 
have made him a hero to residents eager for iron-fisted crime fighting and an 
object of horrified fascination to civil rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some law enforcement officials question the effectiveness of Arpaio's 
strategies, which are high on public relations appeal but may do little to 
reduce crime in a region where the homicide rate is rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides creating the posse, Arpaio has solved a jail overcrowding problem by 
erecting canvas tents in a field surrounded by a concertina-wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if 1,000 inmates bake in 120-degree heat because the swamp coolers in 
the tents do not always work. And so what if they are not allowed to smoke, 
read pin-up magazines or watch movies. The way Arpaio figures it, jails are 
supposed to be hellholes. And besides, his $100,000 tent facility has saved the 
county $41 million in construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, who include some former admirers, warn that Arpaio's zealous 
approach would backfire should an inmate die of heat prostration or a bystander 
get shot by a posse member. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say that his confrontational tactics counter the trend in law 
enforcement across the nation known as community-based policing. That strategy, 
which encourages cooperation and friendly relations with residents, has been 
embraced by the Los Angeles Police Department, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewey Stokes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which 
represents 250,000 peace officers nationwide, derided the notion that a 
volunteer posse can do police work at no risk to the people they aim to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a concern about the professionalism of the posse, their training in 
arrest, search and seizure," he said. "The thing he's got to be concerned about 
is liability. Mistakes result in lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Rhodes, head of the Phoenix chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, was more direct. "Arpaio thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt running to the top 
of San Juan Hill, and his posse are a bunch of junior G-men who want to be 
Batman," Rhodes said. "It's a comic-book version of crime fighting, and I'm 
worried that something bad will eventually happen -- all the ingredients are 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in one of the fastest-growing regions in the country -- thanks to an 
influx of post-riot Southern Californians -- critics say such simplistic 
approaches, however catchy for campaign slogans and media coverage, are not 
permanent solutions. Others speculate that Arpaio, who has broken a campaign 
promise to be a one-term sheriff by announcing plans to seek reelection in 
1997, is orchestrating a future bid for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 Tossing the gauntlet in his own version of "High Noon," Arpaio says his 
critics are just "jealous . . . that I'm getting all the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've got a method to my madness of publicity: I want to send a message to 
the bad guys," said Arpaio, who has appeared on more than two dozen radio and 
TV programs in the past month. "I want them to know that it is so bad in my 
jail that they won't want to commit crimes here." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a potent and popular message at a time when crime is the No. 1 concern 
here and across the nation. While some peg Arpaio, and his high-profile 
programs, as opportunistic pandering to the fears of the crowd, it is precisely 
what many merchants, politicians and residents want in this Western boom town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff is trying to throw a scare into criminals and there are some 
people here that could use a little bit of a scare," said Gilbert Hernandez, 
68, who lives in an unincorporated southwest section of the city the sheriff 
says is rife with crime. "I think he's doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix lawyer Gary Klahr disagrees, saying that inmates in Arpaio's cramped, 
brown tents are treated as "subhuman" even though "a lot of them are only 
beginning felons in work-furlough programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a potential for people dying out there," Klahr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the county jail system's work-furlough program, inmates assigned to 
tents are allowed to go to their jobs during the day but must return at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gripes about heat and harsh living conditions in the tent facility are music 
to Arpaio's ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my jails to be a deterrent to crime and that's why we went from 
R-rated movies to Donald Duck. Nobody liked Donald Duck, so I wiped all movies 
out," Arpaio said with a self-satisfied smile during a tour of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen inmates mopped their steamy brows and tried to look alert when the 
man with a shiny six-point star on his chest suddenly marched into their 
sweltering tent and bellowed, "Why's it so hot in here? You got a cooler, don't 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The cooler don't work!" several inmates said in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's the bologna sandwiches?" Arpaio asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green!" they shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the bologna can be green, red or blue on any given day. That's 
because jail cold cuts are bought from a distributor who gives hefty discounts 
on discolored meat that, while safe to eat, is unsuitable for sale elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio laughed aloud when another inmate chortled, "Hey, Sheriff, when you 
gonna be on television again?" 
</P>
<P>
 He told the inmate to watch TV the following night. "Eight p.m. NBC. Tom 
Brokaw," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Arpaio's programs better displays his true character -- his commitment 
to fighting crime, his loyalty to supporters, or his flamboyant style -- than 
the posse, which counts Gov. Fife Symington among its members. Arpaio contends 
it has saved the county millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs taxpayers $240 to train a posse member to use a gun -- a bargain when 
compared to the hours of free time the members devote to helping his 453 
full-time deputies, Arpaio said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 800 posse members have had the training to win permission to 
carry weapons on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Glenn, 61, a retired utility company worker, has undergone more than 150 
hours of police training and spent $1,200 of his own money on leather utility 
belts, a pistol, uniforms and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main reason for doing this is to take the load off a department that is 
short-handed in sworn deputies," Glenn said after helping deputies handle a man 
caught with a half a pound of marijuana in his car. "Yep, I'm making my valley 
a little safer tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 No one here doubts the commitment or courage of posse members such as Glenn, 
who once used pepper spray to prevent a suspect from slashing him with a broken 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, so many prospective volunteers are applying that background checks 
have been delayed, and admission standards have dropped, according to an 
internal memorandum written by Sheriff's Lt. Roy Reyer in March -- a few days 
before Arpaio first unleashed his posse on prostitutes trolling downtown 
Phoenix's scruffy Van Buren Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyer, who was transferred from a community relations position in Phoenix to a 
substation about 20 miles west of town shortly after his memo hit Arpaio's 
desk, wrote that posse recruitment standards had fallen so low that members 
included "Rambos, Otis the town drunk, and a lot of washed-out cop wanna-bes." 
</P>
<P>
 "In one instance, a new posse man was given the assignment of treasurer of the 
Operations Posse," the memo said. "Over $5,000 of this posse's funds were in 
his control. A background check of this individual later showed that he had an 
outstanding out-of-state warrant for fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio acknowledged that "as in any organization, there are a few bad apples 
in the posse." But they are quickly identified and rejected, the sheriff said, 
dismissing most of Reyer's accusations as "garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that several volunteers have been kicked off the posse for showing 
up intoxicated or packing concealed weapons at training sessions. Or that some 
deputies worry that overly zealous volunteers jeopardize bystanders and pose 
liability problems for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arpaio, whose office is short 30 deputies and 130 detention officers, the 
posse is a practical response to rising crime in a county facing a severe 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say the county Board of Supervisors says, 'Sorry, Sheriff, we just went 
bankrupt,' " said Arpaio, who earns $65,000 a year. "What do I have waiting in 
the weeds? A posse. I can still protect the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The posse got a chance to sharpen its law enforcement skills during an 
intensive crackdown against shopping mall crime last Christmas, and in April 
during the sweep against prostitution on Van Buren Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall effort was a success. But the assault on prostitution was at best a 
stop-gap measure. While the deputies and posse members were patrolling the 
street, crime dropped by 91%. Van Buren merchants say it's been climbing ever 
since they left. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar grumblings are being heard in southwest Phoenix, which Arpaio flooded 
in late June with 700 armed posse members, special tactics teams, canine units, 
helicopters, armored cars and support units. 
</P>
<P>
 The invasion, dubbed Operation Summer Heat, was aimed at clearing drug dealers 
and gang members from a largely low-income region dominated by cotton farms and 
auto wreckage firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio said the effort was justified because there have been seven murders in 
the region in the past five months. During the monthlong operation, he said, 
deputies and posse members interrogated 5,577 people and arrested 605 of them 
on charges ranging from drug possession to outstanding warrants. Many of those 
suspects were originally stopped for vehicle code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach doesn't wash with many residents who live and work in the 
targeted area. Among the dissenters is CeCe Maxwell, owner of a bar around the 
corner from Operation Summer Heat's mobile command post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's stupid. Dumb. A total joke. Hogwash," she said. "All they're 
doing is stopping people for traffic violations. There are people out here 
without much money and who happen to have car problems, but that doesn't mean 
they're bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio's response: "Even if there was no crime, what's wrong with going out 
there to deter crime before it happens?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such remarks have some people wondering whether Arpaio is just one more in a 
line of top cops who have raised questions about the office's professionalism 
over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio's predecessor, Tom Agnos, lost his bid for reelection over accusations 
of flawed interrogation and evidence gathering in the massacre of six Buddhist 
monks, two young initiates and an elderly nun here in 1991. In that case, the 
sheriff's office extracted four false confessions to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Tucson four were cleared of murder charges in late 1991 when two 
teen-agers told investigators they acted alone in killing the Buddhists during 
a botched robbery at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnos followed Dick Godbehere, who was criticized by federal authorities for 
"staging" a drug bust for the media in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Godbehere entered office on the heels of Jerry Hill, who lost a reelection bid 
in 1984 amid allegations of using his county car and filing travel expenses for 
a trip to New Mexico to marry his ninth wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our sheriffs lose reelection under a cloud," Klahr said. "It's all 
part of the strange history of Maricopa County sheriffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio began his law enforcement career when he joined the Washington, D.C., 
Police Department in 1954. Four years later, he signed on with the DEA, where 
he spent 30 years as an agent and director of offices here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio retired from federal law enforcement in 1982 as head of the DEA in 
Arizona, and he and his wife of 37 years, Ava, opened a travel agency in 
Phoenix. They have two grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that background I became sheriff," Arpaio said. "I'm the first Italian 
ever elected sheriff" (in the county). I'm the first ex-federal agent ever 
elected sheriff. I'm the oldest guy ever elected sheriff. And I'm probably the 
first East Coast guy ever elected sheriff in Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Arpaio's greatest challenge, critics say, will be to emerge from his first 
term unscathed and restore credibility to an office that has been dogged by 
controversy for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I've been lucky, maybe the roof will cave in," Arpaio said. "But I want 
to make a difference. If I fail, at least I gave it a shot."

 The teen-age mastermind of one of Orange County's most shocking murders was 
sentenced Monday to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 
slaying of a 17-year-old honors student. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan, 19, a onetime high school valedictorian candidate, sat 
impassively as the judge pronounced the sentencing for the 1992 New Year's Eve 
killing of Stuart A. Tay of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was one of five Orange County teen-agers convicted of beating Tay with 
baseball bats, pouring rubbing alcohol down his throat and leaving him to die, 
bound and gagged, in a shallow back-yard grave in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the sentencing, Chan and Tay's parents made emotional pleas to Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary. Their comments conveyed to a 
packed courtroom the travesty and heartbreak of a crime that involved 
academically ambitious teen-agers from supportive, loving families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big tragedy for all the families in this case," said Tony Chan, who 
begged the judge to show mercy. "It's just like living in hell 24 hours a day. 
. . . We love Robert very much. He means the entire world to us. There is no 
meaning to life without Robert." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's parents, Alfred and Linda Tay, asked that no leniency be given. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robert Chan is a cruel and diabolical killer," Linda Tay said through sobs. 
"He is evil incarnate. The fact that he is so intelligent and yet so 
coldblooded is frightening. Life without parole is the least he deserves. He 
never should be given another chance to inflict this type of pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Tay said his family has been ruined by the ordeal. "Nothing can change 
the fact that our family will forever be incomplete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that Chan orchestrated Tay's murder with four other 
teen-agers because they believed Tay was about to double-cross them in a plan 
to rob an Anaheim computer parts dealer. The plan fell apart, prosecutors said, 
when Chan discovered that Tay was lying to him about his name, age and 
background and feared that Tay was a police informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan and the other boys lured Tay to a Buena Park garage on New Year's Eve, 
1992, by telling him he could buy a gun to use in the robbery. When Tay went to 
examine the weapon, he was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors claimed that Tay was beaten for 20 minutes during the rehearsed 
attack. He begged for his life before the alcohol was poured down his throat 
and he was gagged, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary, who has presided over the case for 18 months, said she found it 
impossible to reconcile the backgrounds of the youths with the robbery they 
were plotting to commit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inexplicable to me that Mr. Chan, given the love and support of his 
family, and Mr. Tay, given the love and support of his family, would ever have 
come together to plan a residential robbery . . . or how Mr. Chan and Mr. Tay 
could meet on the night of Stuart Tay's death to discuss the purchase of a 
firearm," O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this case is not only tragic for these families, but it's also a 
tragedy for society. I think there are a lot of families and a lot of parents 
who are wondering how this could happen," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The case received wide media attention because of the seeming incongruity of 
bright teen-agers from stable homes involved in a vicious homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was a top student at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton and his IQ 
hovers near the genius level. Tay, who attended Foothill High School in Santa 
Ana, was an honors student who planned to go to an Ivy League school and become 
a doctor like his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teen-agers, though, seemed attracted to crime and danger. Tay apparently 
bragged of having underworld connections with dozens of followers working for 
him, while Chan boasted of his links with an Asian gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan admitted his involvement in Tay's murder but testified at the trial that 
he believed Tay was a powerful crime figure who would kill him if he backed out 
of the robbery plot. A psychiatrist for the defense said Chan is a paranoid 
schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan denied masterminding the murder, as the four other defendants contended. 
A jury deliberated less than three hours before convicting him of first-degree 
murder on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other defendants, Charles Choe, 18, and Mun Bong Kang, 19, both of 
Fullerton, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The other two defendants, 
Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, and Kirn Young Kim, 18, of Fullerton, were 
convicted of first-degree murder July 1 in a separate trial and are awaiting 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The key witness for the prosecution was Choe, who admitted participating in 
the murder but said he did not strike Tay. Because he cooperated with 
prosecutors, he was sentenced to a California Youth Authority facility and is 
expected to be released when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, Acosta and Kang are scheduled to be sentenced after a review by the Youth 
Authority to evaluate whether they should be locked up in prison with adults or 
juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to Monday's sentencing, Chan's attorney, Marshall M. Schulman, 
petitioned the court for a new trial and a reduced sentence. O'Leary denied the 
new trial motion and said the murder conviction with the special allegation of 
lying in wait compelled her to gave Chan a prison sentence of life without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pre-sentencing report, Chan wrote to the court and the Tay family to 
explain what had happened and express his remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his outlook on life developed shortly after he read "The Stranger" by 
French author Albert Camus, which discusses existentialist philosophy. Chan 
wrote that he interpreted the novel as saying "everything was meaningless and 
nothing matters because we are all going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said he stopped caring about his school and personal hygiene and found it 
difficult to concentrate. Also, he said, he started hearing voices quoting 
lines from the "Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, it is nearly impossible for me to fathom the fact that I 
degenerated from a hard-working student and good citizen to a deranged 
individual who took another human being's life," he wrote to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page letter to the Tay family, Chan wrote: "I shudder when I try to 
imagine how you must feel. I know your pain is infinitely worse. I know now, 
all too late, that not only have I destroyed one life, I have destroyed many." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he frequently cries at night when his cellmates are sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am also profoundly grieved when I consider the life sentence you have 
received," he wrote to the Tays. "You have received a life sentence of never 
seeing your son again."

ENTITLEMENTS SEEN TAKING UP NEARLY ALL TAXES BY 2012 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A prestigious bipartisan group warned Monday that entitlement benefits such as 
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and civil service pensions are growing so 
rapidly that they will consume nearly all federal tax revenues by the year 
2012, leaving the government with no money for anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic and Republican legislators on the Bipartisan Commission on 
Entitlement and Tax Reform put aside normal political wrangling to agree on a 
startling portrait of a world in which a handful of programs crowds out 
everything else. When entitlements plus interest on the national debt consume 
all revenues 18 years from now, said Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), co-chairman 
of the commission, "there will be no money for national defense, for law 
enforcement, for the environment, for highways -- that is a very stark 
finding." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), the other co-chairman, predicted that "the people 
who will get hurt the most are young working families" who will suffer a huge 
and ever-rising tax burden "unless we have the courage and foresight" to slow 
the growth in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan commission was created last year as a concession by President 
Clinton to Kerrey, whose vote was needed desperately by the White House to win 
Senate passage of Clinton's tax and budget program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding the alarm is just the first -- and easiest -- responsibility of the 
panel, cautioned one member, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.). "It is far easier 
to identify a problem than to solve it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Social Security is often considered the third rail of politics -- 
"touch it and you're dead" -- Kerrey and Danforth have pressed forward in 
formulating an apocalyptic definition of the problem of federal programs that 
grow automatically. The hardest part -- offering solutions -- has a deadline of 
Dec. 2, and Kerrey is determined to deliver strong proposals to the President. 
The commission will spend the next few months debating solutions, which could 
include suggestions for reducing benefits, increasing taxes or a combination of 
both. After the commission delivers its recommendations, it will be up to the 
President and Congress to act. 
</P>
<P>
 An entitlement, in the blunt language of Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), a commission member, is "a blank check for spending rather than a fixed 
dollar amount appropriated by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The spending grows every year -- an eligible person is "entitled" to receive 
the funds. The biggest current entitlements are Social Security, $335 billion; 
Medicare (for citizens over 65 and the disabled of all ages), $177 billion; 
Medicaid (health spending for the poor), $96 billion; and pensions for retired 
military and federal civilian workers, $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Other entitlement programs included on a long list, are food stamps, price 
supports for farmers, veterans benefits and aid to families with dependent 
children -- the basic welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
 Entitlements now consume about 47% of all federal spending. By 2012, unless 
policies are changed, "projected outlays for entitlements and interest on the 
national debt will consume all tax revenues collected by the federal 
government," the commission said Monday in a report approved by a vote of 30 to 
1, with one member not voting. "A bipartisan coalition of Congress, led by the 
President, must resolve the long-term imbalance between the government's 
entitlement promises and the funds it will have available to pay for them," the 
commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey moved to reassure senior citizens' groups, who have been fearful that 
the commission will tamper with Social Security. He pledged that there would be 
no erosion or cutbacks in the present level of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Social Security system runs at a substantial surplus, 
collecting more revenues from 110 million workers than it pays to 41 million 
beneficiaries. The system will come under strain in the next century, going 
bankrupt in the year 2029, because of payments to the massive baby boom 
generation, according to this year's trustees report. Medicare faces a more 
pressing crisis, with bankruptcy expected in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone dissenter at Monday's vote was Richard L. Trumka, president of the 
United Mine Workers Union, who said that, "apart from health care," 
entitlements are "not growing faster than the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 32 people serving on the commission are 22 members of Congress -- 11 
from each party -- who are trying to balance the immense popularity of the 
entitlement programs against future fiscal strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Social Security, and Supplemental Security Income, a special program 
for needy aged, blind or disabled, "my area would be a disaster," said another 
commission member, Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza (D-Tex.). "We would see the 
equivalent of what we're watching on television with Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 In his agricultural district, "the day workers and the seasonal workers are at 
the mercy of what the government could do for them," de la Garza said. But he 
also insisted that entitlement reform is essential for avoiding a crushing tax 
burden on his grandchildren, who, in the year 2030, will be 47, 44, 42 and 40. 
"Those are the ones we have to see won't bear the burden," he said.

ISRAEL, JORDAN OPEN ROAD LINK; MIDEAST: RABIN, CHRISTOPHER AND CROWN PRINCE 
ATTEND CEREMONY. CROSSING WILL BE LIMITED TO FOREIGNERS INITIALLY, BUT MOVE 
DEEPENS GOODWILL BETWEEN FORMER ENEMIES. 
</P>

 Israel and Jordan opened a new border crossing Monday through a desolate 
desert field that just days ago bristled with deadly land mines -- a move that 
accelerated good feeling two weeks after the former enemies ended almost half a 
century of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have waited 46 years (for peace with Jordan). . . . We cannot wait even 
one day more," Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in an emotional 
ceremony during which grizzled veterans of Middle East warfare exchanged 
handshakes and gifts and King Hussein's brother capped his speech by quoting 
from the Old Testament in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher presided over the opening of border terminals between the twin 
southern port cities of Aqaba, Jordan, and Eilat, Israel. Then they joined 
Hussein for a celebratory lunch and talks at the monarch's vacation palace 
beside the Gulf of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the border is open only to tourists and business people from other 
countries -- Israelis and Jordanians are not allowed to cross. But officials 
and journalists from Israel were permitted to attend the ceremony and a 
subsequent news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tonic to see that some seemingly insoluble problems have their 
solutions," Christopher said at the news conference with Rabin and Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a plaintive tone to Christopher's comment, coming as it did in the 
midst of his often-frustrating attempt to mediate the region's last remaining 
intractable conflict, between Israel and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 After the festive day in Aqaba, he flew to Jerusalem on Monday night to report 
to Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on his five-hour meeting Sunday in 
Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher plans to return to Washington today but is expected to head back 
to the region by the middle of next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an eloquent address during the border ceremony, Rabin said the hastily 
built customs sheds and other facilities straddling the frontier provide "the 
ideal backdrop for the new relationships being formed between Israel and 
Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sitting on an old minefield, which was cleared only three days ago," 
he said. "This is a field in which death and destruction were sowed. . . . 
Three days ago, this was a wilderness -- only sand and more sand. Today, this 
place teems with new life. Three weeks ago, the dream of peace was far away. 
Today, it is materializing -- telephone lines, tourism. Soon it will seem as 
though this is the way it has always been." 
</P>
<P>
 Direct phone service between the two countries began Sunday with a call 
between Hussein and Israeli President Ezer Weizman. On Monday, the Israeli and 
Jordanian chambers of commerce pledged cross-border cooperation in a call of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 For Israelis, the emotional high point of the ceremony was Hassan's surprise 
use of Hebrew to quote the biblical prophet Hosea's vision of "turning the 
valley of trouble into a gate of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli television anchorman Ehud Yaari, who was broadcasting the ceremony 
live, commented "Beautiful, beautiful" when Hassan broke into Hebrew. Later, he 
told viewers: "The crown prince has surprised us. This was the first time we 
hear him speak in Hebrew. . . . No Arab leader that I can recall has done such 
a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aqaba-Eilat border crossing stands on a newly poured asphalt plaza with 
Israeli customs on one side and Jordanian customs on the other. Blacktop roads 
from the towns to the crossing were put in over the weekend, along with new 
road signs pointing toward Eilat and Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of Israel's existence as a modern state, the towns have faced each 
other across a blue expanse of water. It is called the Gulf of Aqaba in Jordan 
and most of the rest of the world but in Israel is referred to as the Gulf of 
Eilat. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimmers and wind-surfers were kept on their own side of the border by 
gunboats stationed just off the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher described the area as "a place of longing, where Israelis and 
Jordanians could stand on the beaches of Eilat and Aqaba and see each other but 
not know each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by an Israeli journalist when Jordan will admit Israeli tourists, 
Hussein said, "I hope before long." But he declined to say how long. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hussein took Rabin and Christopher on a brief cruise on the royal 
yacht, heading immediately into Israeli waters. A flotilla of small Israeli 
boats, waving Israeli and Jordanian flags, saluted the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The monarch, whose 41 years on the throne have all been dominated by 
Jordanian-Israeli animosity, said the normalizing relations between the 
countries provide "the sort of peace that I have never experienced over the 
very many years." 
</P>
<P>
 More tangible payoffs for Jordan also came quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said legislation forgiving Jordan's $700-million debt to the 
United States "is proceeding through our Congress at an unusual pace." And 
President Clinton wrote to the heads of the governments of Switzerland, 
Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Canada, France, Italy, Sweden, 
Austria and Japan urging them to give debt relief to the Hashemite kingdom. 
Clinton also thanked Britain for debt relief already undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is essential that the people of Jordan feel the benefits of peace in 
tangible ways," the President wrote. "Jordan's debt . . . is a major impediment 
to economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the slow, indirect negotiations continued between Israel and Syria. 
American, Syrian and Israeli officials all said Christopher's Sunday meeting 
with Assad "laid the base for future progress," using virtually identical 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peres, who hitched a ride from Aqaba to Israel aboard Christopher's U.S. 
Air Force transport, told reporters on the plane that he is convinced Assad 
wants peace, although it may take a long time to hammer out details. The 
Israeli foreign minister also said Syria appears to have persuaded Hezbollah 
militias in southern Lebanon to stop attacking civilian targets in Israel, 
ending a week of border skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is an important gesture for continuing the peace negotiations," 
Peres said. He said Christopher relayed Israel's request for Syrian help in 
reining in Hezbollah and that Assad apparently complied, probably more to 
please the Americans than to help the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Mary Curtius contributed to this report. Opening the Border 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan on Monday opened the first road link between the two 
once-warring countries, connecting the resorts of Eilat and Aqaba. The border 
opening is one byproduct of the war-no-more agreement Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein signed two weeks ago.

 KING HUSSEIN: The Jordanian leader, 58, ascended to the throne in 1953. 
Opposed the 1979 Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel but later 
supported U.S. efforts to foster Arab-Israeli peace. 
</P>
<P>
 YITZHAK RABIN: The prime minister, 72, was once a Jewish underground leader 
and has been involved in Israeli politics since the nation was established in 
1948. Military commander in the 1967 Mideast War. Won office after replacing 
Shimon Peres as Labor Party leader in 1992.

THE IDAHO TRAIL; MIGRATION OF CALIFORNIANS TO STATE RAISES REAL ESTATE PRICES, 
TEMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Each year, the winds of August bring a smoky controversy to this bustling 
Northwest city, pitting a stubborn stock of locals against a quirky new breed 
of residents: the ex-Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when farmers set fire to 40,000 acres of bluegrass in a time-tested 
technique to add nitrogen to the soil and increase crop yields. Throughout 
August -- prime tourist season in rural north Idaho -- the skies above Kootenai 
County blacken with billowing plumes of soot, a sure-fire signal of the Potato 
State's biggest rhubarb. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of other environmentally conscious California transplants, John 
Mann watches the streaks of smoke trail low over Coeur d'Alene Lake and its 
resort hotel, over blue-collar housing tracts sprouting from once-virgin forest 
land and massive, newly built mansions locals refer to as "California dance 
halls." 
</P>
<P>
 And he fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You show me somebody who doesn't complain about the smoke and I'll show you 
an idiot," said the former Thousand Oaks resident, frowning in distaste. "But 
these farmers are given free rein -- just because this is the way they've 
always done things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't get it. This would never happen in California." 
</P>
<P>
 The bluegrass burn-off is just one volley in a cultural clash being waged in 
this tradition-bound town of 28,000 residents, less than 100 miles south of the 
Canadian border: Californians, weary of the crime, earthquakes and overcrowding 
back home, have come here by the carload, bringing with them fat home equities 
and what the locals regard as curious big-city attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are moving northward in search of a rural solace many believe can 
no longer be found in the country's most populous state. Between 1991 and 1993, 
28,202 Californians moved to Idaho, making up nearly 27% of the state's 98,446 
new residents. In the same period, 5,315 former California residents moved to 
Kootenai County, nearly 40% of its newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 California provides more than twice as many Idaho emigres as second-place 
Washington state. And even many of the latter, according to Idaho state 
transportation officials who tally newcomer origins through auto license plate 
transfers, are once-removed Californians who moved on after finding the growing 
congestion of Seattle and Puget Sound too much like home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann left Thousand Oaks and a career as a stockbroker because he hated Los 
Angeles traffic and cultural tensions: "I'm no racist but I just got tired of 
being a minority in Los Angeles, tired of explaining English to 7-Eleven clerks 
and counting their change for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'd go orbital, absolutely berserk, if I had to sit in traffic. I'd 
hyperventilate, pound on the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 For most Southern Californians like Mann, this new life has been a bit of 
Northern Exposure -- searching for their own private Idaho, a niche among the 
straitlaced and sometimes-cranky native population who wear the term local like 
some Great Northwest badge of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lund, a 40ish ex-model from the City of Industry, had such a hard time 
adjusting to Idaho men that she founded a dating club for California 
transplants, attracting dozens of lonely hearts, frozen out of the Idaho 
singles scene or self-exiled from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Idaho," Lund said, "can be a very lonely place." 
</P>
<P>
 The name Coeur d'Alene was coined centuries ago by Native American hunters, 
angered by French traders they thought were low-balling fur prices. They called 
them small-hearted men. Hence, the story goes, Coeur d'Alene means "heart the 
size of an alene, " a small leather-piercing tool the Indians used. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in Coeur d'Alene, many locals are lashing back at what they regard as a 
new small-hearted invasion, of big city "kooks" whose very appearance and every 
action affront their traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a stereotype of Californians here," said David Bond, a reporter for 
the Coeur d'Alene Press. "They Rollerblade around town in neon, 
glow-in-the-dark clothes. They put fences around their land and call the forest 
service all winter long, complaining that locals are killing the deer." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians, locals say, just cannot comprehend the folksy style of the 
Handle, a thin wooded finger of northern Idaho dividing Montana and Washington 
state, where deals are sealed with a handshake, where you can ride a horse for 
two days straight without crossing an asphalt road, where its plumb impossible 
to find a mechanic or carpenter come the first day of hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coeur d'Alene native Ted Anderson is fed up with watching his hometown turned 
into a "little Los Angeles." He tells of Californians suing the city, locals 
and one another, including one Los Angeles family who had the gall to fence off 
access to a popular local watering hole and forbid people to swim there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a funny bunch," said the 86-year-old retired sign painter. "They 
hated the place they came from so much, they headed for the hills. Now they 
want to make the hills just like California." 
</P>
<P>
 Locals such as Anderson say Coeur d'Alene is changing faster than the weather 
on a fall Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the summer air is filled with police sirens and the detested blare 
of car alarms. Locals complain that there are racial problems in their school 
system (although it is still more than 98% white), and grumble that youths in 
gang-style backward baseball caps and baggy shorts are popping up in the high 
school sea of cowboy boots and Wrangler jeans. Teen-agers are bringing guns to 
class, no longer seeing them as tools -- as their fathers and grandfathers did 
-- but as weapons, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Idaho, moose, deer and osprey still line the roadsides like 7-Elevens "back 
there" in California. Locals around Hayden Lake pump unfiltered water into 
their houses. People pay for their gas after they have pumped it -- with a 
personal check, no less. It is the place that Bill Clinton finished third in 
the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if the average salary is $19,000 a year, that there are more 
minimum-wage jobs than pine cones scattered across the forest floor. This is a 
proud right-to-work state where leaving car and house doors unlocked does not 
necessarily spell disaster, where teen-agers are watched by stern-faced cops 
issuing tickets for offenses such as under-age smoking and spitting on the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood banker, waitress and police officer will wave to you on the 
street, call you by your first name and even ask about the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is endangered, the locals will tell you, by the flood of 
Californians, with their rude driving habits and standoffish demeanor. The 
resentment surfaces in jokes told at bars, notes left on car windshields or 
epithets tossed at passing sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the resentment is based on dollars and cents. Armed with huge equities 
siphoned from the Los Angeles real estate boom of the 1980s, ex-Californians 
have invested heavily in Kootenai County property, raising housing prices to 
where many blue-collar Coeur d'Alene residents now cannot afford to buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kootenai County alone, there are 700 realtors, mostly to serve the 
California market. Indeed, locals point out, 1% of the population has a real 
estate license. Just five years ago, $100,000 homes were an extravagance. Now 
homes regularly sell for half a million dollars. Rents in many cases have 
doubled since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It grates on locals that on some stretches of U.S. 95, the main north-south 
thoroughfare through town, there are bothersome traffic lights every half-mile 
now, where Jaguars and Mercedes-Benzes sometimes outnumber John Deere tractors. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, folks learned last year that an Irvine real estate 
broker was teaching people how to leave California in a three-hour seminar at 
UC Riverside titled "How to Move to the Pacific Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more irksome than newcomers, however, are those who presume that five 
years in Idaho makes them a native -- with the right to slam the door on 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The local no-growth committee, locals point out, is composed primarily of 
ex-Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's wife, Debi, who came here with him four years ago, admits that she 
wants to close the door on future transplants: "We thought we found our own 
Shangri-La and no one else knew about it. Now it's all being ruined. What I say 
to these newcomers is 'Go find your own nirvana. You're tainting my dream.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other ex-Californians have found it easier to just stick to themselves. And 
when one family moved back to San Diego last year, they put the 
California-bashing to work for them: They threw a "Send Us Back to California" 
yard sale. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some locals who believe that Californians are good for Idaho, 
bringing a newfound cultural diversity -- authentic Mexican restaurants, coffee 
shops and small breweries. 
</P>
<P>
 And best of all, they say, new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town was still debating woman's suffrage in 1978," said reporter Bond. 
"For many locals, gourmet food meant deep-fried something. Nobody drank wine 
without a metal cap. The new blood has changed that." 
</P>
<P>
 But progress has come at a price, say Bond and some others, who complain that 
some Californians brought with them the racial tensions they complained about 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, African Americans were a rarity -- 13 in the county in 1970, 
growing to 68 in 1980 and 139 in 1990, out of a population of 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I arrived from Santa Barbara in 1978, people stared," said 43-year-old 
mechanic Phil Wilson, who is black. "They would stop me to ask if I were black. 
Some had never seen a black person before. They didn't want me to work on their 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Coeur d'Alene has a white supremacy group -- its leader and many members 
are Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wilson, a former Oceanside policeman who runs a Coeur d'Alene radiator 
shop, founded a social group for California law enforcement transplants who 
moved north for reasons of wide open spaces -- as well as race -- he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I say this tactfully?" Wilson said. "In Southern California, 80% of 
the calls you get as a policeman are from Hispanics and blacks. You just get 
tired of it. You want to get away." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond regards these as Californians that Idaho can do without. "Believe it or 
not, California has provided us with some real narrow thinkers," he said. "We 
may be rednecks up here, but we're not bigots. There's a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Potter, a former A T & T executive and ex-resident of La Canada 
Flintridge, is now president of Jobs Plus, a nonprofit agency whose goal is to 
bring good-paying manufacturing jobs to an Idaho economy depressed by slowdowns 
in the mining and logging industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a financial and cultural gamble," he said of the move. "People shouldn't 
come here expecting to make a killing with some downtown frozen yogurt shop. 
Because they won't." 
</P>
<P>
 In five years, Potter has recruited 37 companies to Kootenai County, 33 of 
those from Southern California -- including several small firms from the San 
Fernando Valley area, such as U.S. Products from Agoura and the Wilkinson Co. 
of Westlake Village. In all, he has created 2,000 jobs for residents as well as 
relocating a handful of workers from places such as Anaheim, Reseda and 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But some people are beginning to move back. 
</P>
<P>
 After less than two years, Kathy Smith and her husband are taking their three 
sons back to Orange County, fed up with Idaho's rugged weather and surly 
attitudes. "Once the beauty wears off," she said, "there's not much to like 
about this place. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell you to relax, 'This is northern Idaho,' they say. If you dress 
professionally, they say 'Heck, where are you going, to a wedding? Or is it a 
funeral?' Get me out of this place."

STATE SEEKS 2-DAY ELECTION RECESS IN SIMPSON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's election officer asked a judge Monday to recess the O.J. Simpson 
murder trial on Nov. 7 and Nov. 8 so the televised proceedings won't keep 
California voters from the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller -- who is a candidate himself -- said he 
is worried that the trial, set to begin Sept. 19, will divert media and public 
attention from the Nov. 8 election and reduce voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, Miller said a recess on 
Election Day and the day before would be "extraordinarily helpful in terms of 
promoting the democratic process." 
</P>
<P>
 "These final days are critical in terms of elections administration as well as 
to voters who often delay until the last moment reaching decisions which will 
have an impact on all of us for decades," Miller wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for statewide offices, including governor and U.S. senator, and 
hundreds of congressional, legislative and local offices, are on the Nov. 8 
ballot. Miller, a Democrat, is running against Republican Assemblyman Bill 
Jones of Fresno for secretary of state. Miller has been acting secretary since 
being appointed by the former holder of the office, March Fong Eu, who retired 
to become an ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Also before voters are initiatives to limit illegal immigration, establish a 
single-payer health plan and weaken statewide anti-smoking standards. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court spokeswoman had no comment on Miller's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 47, faces two murder charges in the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife 
Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, 25, outside her 
Brentwood condominium.

FIREFIGHTERS GAIN ON SIERRA BLAZES; NATURE: LESSENING WINDS AND COOLER 
TEMPERATURES AID CREWS. MORE THAN 30 BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Cooler temperatures and diminishing winds allowed firefighters Monday to get 
the upper hand on two Sierra foothill blazes that have destroyed more than 30 
homes and other buildings and charred about 1,300 acres of wild lands. 
</P>
<P>
 State fire officials Monday said a 500-acre fire near the town of Rough and 
Ready, 60 miles east of Sacramento, was triggered when a power line fell on an 
oak tree. 
</P>
<P>
 A blaze that consumed more than 800 acres near the town of Kelsey -- about 10 
miles northeast of Placerville -- was determined late Monday to have been the 
work of an arsonist. Fire officials released no further details. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious injuries were reported in either fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Terrill, a California Division of Forestry spokeswoman, said the blazes, 
along with a third major fire along the California-Nevada state line, 
contributed to an extremely busy weekend for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our resources were stretched very tight," she said, adding that state 
authorities still managed enough resources to fight the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 What has fire officials fretting is that communities in the tinder-dry Sierra 
Nevada foothills are just entering the heart of the state's annual fire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a very busy fire season and the worst is yet to come," Terrill 
said, noting that the fire risk will increase as the late summer heat makes the 
state's forests and brushlands even drier and seasonal north winds pick up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the potentially worst part of the fire season, she said, 4,525 
blazes have been reported statewide to forestry officials this year -- a more 
than 25% jump from the same period of 1993. Officials cite as causes the 
growing population in rural communities as well as drought and other weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Cunningham, a Sacramento-based meteorologist with the National Weather 
Service, agreed about the potential fire risk. "It looks like a more active 
fire season . . . in general throughout the western United States," he said, 
explaining that a number of fires have been touched off during thunder and 
lightning storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham said that temperatures in the Sierra foothills Monday dropped seven 
to nine degrees and that wind gusts began to diminish. "As soon as we get rid 
of these winds tomorrow we'll be in better shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the largest of the weekend blazes, 1,200 firefighters remained on the lines 
Monday battling the Kelsey fire in steep terrain. Twelve structures were 
reported destroyed, including five homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the fire was about 70% contained and they expected to have it 
totally contained by tonight. The fire began Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 miles north of the Kelsey fire, a power line fell on an oak tree, 
igniting flames Sunday afternoon that eventually consumed about 500 acres near 
Rough and Ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Airplanes flying as low as 150 feet dropped fire retardant chemicals to stop 
flames from spreading in the fast-growing foothill area. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which destroyed six homes and more than a dozen other buildings, 
forced hundreds of residents to flee, some to homes of friends and others to 
evacuation centers. Authorities began allowing them to return Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The third fire, called the Crystal Peak blaze and located at the 
California-Nevada border, was fully contained about 6 p.m. Monday. Since the 
fire began Thursday, it has consumed 7,310 acres and destroyed three homes and 
several other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, about 300 firefighters remained on the fire lines near the Nevada 
town of Verdi, about 10 miles from Reno. The blaze was caused by heavy 
machinery used to clear an area to plant trees, said Sharon Brockman, a fire 
information officer with the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds on the fire lines picked up late Monday afternoon, but a fire official 
said, "So far . . . the line is holding." 
</P>
<P>
 Another blaze south of Reno had consumed 5,000 acres by Monday evening. 
Officials reported that an outbuilding and a trailer were burned in the fire at 
Holbrook Junction on U.S. 395, 15 miles south of Gardnerville near the state 
line.

PANEL REJECTS BILL TYING GROWTH, WATER SUPPLY; GOVERNMENT: UNUSUAL ALLIANCE OF 
FARMERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS BACKED MEASURE. BUILDERS OPPOSED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial measure that would have forced cities to consider water supply 
before approving new growth went down to defeat in a Senate committee Monday 
under the weight of pressure from the building industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure died without a final vote as Senate Rules Committee members agreed 
among themselves that the legislation did not deserve a rule waiver that would 
have allowed it to be heard in the last, hurried weeks of this year's session. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said the committee was not 
judging the merits of the measure, but had concluded that to consider it would 
take up too much of the limited time remaining to the Legislature. The two 
houses adjourn Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of having more hearings at this point would be unwise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes before, witnesses who had come to testify formed a line that 
snaked from the front to the back of the committee's hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
 In support of the bill were farmers and environmentalists who had forged a 
rare alliance to promote a measure they saw as a way to ensure that in the 
arena of competing water demands, existing interests would come first. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrayed against them were powerful building and real estate forces who 
complained that the bill was a thinly disguised effort to slow down growth in 
California and dilute the power of local governments to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, authored by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), 
chairman of the Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee, would have required that 
before new suburbs were created, the local government would have to identify 
the source and availability of water to supply new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortese, who had hoped the measure would at least get a hearing in the Senate, 
said the struggle is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Building Industry Assn. and the real estate interests won out over the 
farmers and the environmentalists," he said. "But I think they are shooting 
themselves in the foot. In the future, my guess is we'll see some real 
entrenched warfare among residential, industrial and agricultural users, many 
of whom have come together here." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides acknowledged Monday that the issue is not likely to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is to form a consensus on growth and water, and this bill did 
not take a consensus approach," said building industry lobbyist Richard Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Randele Kanouse, a legislative manager for the East Bay Municipal Utility 
District who helped draft the bill, said the proposal might have a better 
chance in a non-election year, when interests would not be contributing so 
heavily to political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is on our side," he said. "This is just phase one. We'll be back. If the 
water supply is sinking at the same time that growth and population are rising, 
we have a problem that we'll have to deal with right around the corner."

HUMAN TOUCH MAY BE NEEDED TO SAVE TOPPLED DANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dante II was supposed to go where no human could. After it went there and got 
stuck, a human stood ready to go in and bring the $1.7-million robot back. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-legged machine was walking out of the Mt. Spurr volcano on Friday 
when it lost its footing 400 feet from the rim and toppled over. 
</P>
<P>
 A National Guard helicopter flew to the volcano's rim on Monday, planning to 
hook onto the robot's tether and hoist the 1,700-pound robot free. Low clouds 
prevented any retrieval Monday, but the crew planned to try again today. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else failed, plans were for geologist John Paskievitch to go down into 
the crater and attach a hoist sling by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, scientists considered leaving Dante in the volcano, but 
Paskievitch said that wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be discarded," the Alaska Volcano Observatory scientist said. 
"If you take it in, you should bring it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., designed Dante 
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which hopes someday to 
explore other planets with robots. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Dante went into the volcano to perform geological tests was that 
Mt. Spurr has been deemed too dangerous for people to enter since it erupted in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, officials played down some of the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The crater isn't hot, it isn't venting any scalding liquids and there is 
plenty of oxygen in the section where Paskievitch would be, said Terry Keith, 
the volcano observatory's head scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Paskievitch, who has gone into Mt. Spurr before, would need only climbing 
ropes and a helmet, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a serious danger of falling rocks, and if Paskievitch did go in, 
he would be accompanied by another geologist. One would watch for avalanches 
while the other worked on the robot.

CONGRESS REACHES ITS D-DAY, AS IN DEBATE, ON HEALTH BILL; REFORM: SENATE BEGINS 
CONTENTIOUS TASK TODAY ON MITCHELL'S DILUTED VERSION OF CLINTON PLAN. THE HOUSE 
WILL BE WATCHING FOR SIGNS OF POLITICAL HITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a year and a half of partisan bickering, the issue of how and 
whether to transform the nation's health care system has finally reached the 
ultimate proving ground: the floors of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, the Senate is set to launch its debate of a sweeping proposal 
that represents the best approximation by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) of how far that chamber is willing to go toward reaching President 
Clinton's goal of guaranteeing health coverage for every American by a specific 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 The early days of the debate, which could stretch into weeks, are expected to 
be long on atmospherics and rhetoric but short on real action. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, no votes at all are expected until Wednesday at the earliest, and 
leaders have yet to agree on when to schedule the most critical vote -- a test 
of whether to retain Mitchell's watered-down version of Clinton's proposal that 
employers be required to pay part of their workers' health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats will be watching that vote carefully as they gauge whether to 
put their own careers on the line by voting for the far stronger "employer 
mandate" contained in the bill Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) will 
set before them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) denied the widely held belief 
-- espoused in private even by some members of the House Democratic leadership 
-- that a defeat for the mandate in the Senate automatically means the same in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Pounding his desk in frustration, Foley told reporters: "I don't think there 
is any evidence that this is a killer amendment, which a lot of the press seems 
to want to believe. You know, this is the way people get their health 
insurance. This is the way the country provides health insurance. This is the 
ordinary, standard, everyday, run-of-the-mill, American, moderate, 
conservative, private insurance health care plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Foley's comments, the idea of the government requiring employers to 
provide benefits that they now offer voluntarily or through collective 
bargaining is far and away the most controversial element of the entire health 
debate, with business groups warning that it could cost millions of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, House leaders on Monday delayed some of the preliminaries leading 
up to its debate but insisted that they still will meet their latest schedule, 
which calls for a final vote on the bill by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 As it now stands, all sides in the House must submit their alternatives to the 
Rules Committee by Wednesday, but that deadline has slipped several times 
already. 
</P>
<P>
 The final day before the official beginning of Senate debate was not an 
auspicious one for those who were looking for signs of a consensus, which has 
been lacking so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.) announced that they 
are willing to use the filibuster, if necessary, to kill the Mitchell bill. 
Such a move would have to be supported by at least 41 senators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I willing to use every power I have as a member of the U.S. Senate to stop 
a government takeover of health care in America?" asked Gramm, who is one of 
the most tenacious opponents of the alternatives being offered by the 
Democrats. "The answer is yes, and I'm going to do it proudly." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Administration intensified its sales effort. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, four Cabinet secretaries called a press briefing to argue 
for universal coverage, saying that incremental approaches to reform, such as 
that advanced by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), actually could cause 
insurance premiums to rise and swell the ranks of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 "That approach won't work" said Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining her were Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt and Riley cited their own experiences as governors in warning against 
"piecemeal" reforms that their states had undertaken in the 1980s, which 
generally relied on incremental, voluntary market-driven reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Such approaches "seemed fairly reasonable" at the time, but the "ironic 
result" was that they made things worse, Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the health care reform debate about to begin in Congress, the Clinton 
Administration is launching a "full court press" both on Capitol Hill and in 
the court of public opinion, Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has invited health care reporters to the 
White House for a rare session on the topic today. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes disputed a 
report over the weekend in The Times. The story quoted several unnamed senior 
Clinton advisers as saying that the President is ready to compromise and is 
resigned to salvaging whatever he can get from a recalcitrant Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has been committed all along to universal coverage. There's 
been no discussion or talk in here about compromise," Ickes said.

NEW PROSECUTOR ON WHITEWATER TO MEET WITH FISKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newly appointed Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr is expected in 
Little Rock today to meet with Robert B. Fiske Jr., his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge panel of the federal appellate court for the District of 
Columbia named Starr on Friday to replace Fiske, who had been appointed Jan. 20 
by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske declined to say what he thought of the mid-investigation switch. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, however, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) led a 
Democratic chorus Monday suggesting that Starr is too partisan. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic allies also questioned the process by which the former Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush Administration official was named to replace Fiske, 
though the White House appeared bitterly resigned to Starr's appointment.

CALM PREVAILS AS WEEK OF ABORTION PROTEST STARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abortion doctor Joseph Booker, wearing a military helmet and slumped in the 
back seat of a car, was greeted only by supporters Monday as he arrived at a 
clinic targeted by abortion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 abortion rights backers and a number of police stood watch as 
Booker's car, driven by officers, disappeared behind a six-foot fence that 
surrounds the Gulf Coast Women's Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs posted near the clinic read: "Abortion is America's holocaust," and 
"It's not a choice, it's a life." But no abortion opponents were in sight until 
about an hour later, when four sign-carrying demonstrators set up on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the "No Place to Hide" demonstrations planned throughout the 
week in Jackson and Gulfport said abortion opponents would attempt to talk with 
women visiting the clinic. Booker practices at clinics in both cities and is 
believed to be the only doctor in the state who performs abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a couple of dozen on their way down" to Gulfport, said Roy 
McMillan, a Jackson anti-abortion activist who invited protesters to 
Mississippi. "They will join a couple of dozen people already down there." 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan and another organizer, Joseph Foreman of Missionaries to the Pre-born 
in Milwaukee, both acknowledged signing a petition that says it is justifiable 
to kill doctors who perform abortions. But both said this week's protests would 
be nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman said he later withdrew his name from the document, which was 
circulated shortly after Dr. David Gunn was murdered outside a clinic in 
Pensacola, Fla., in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same petition signed by Paul J. Hill, a former minister charged with 
murdering Dr. John Bayard Britton and his escort outside another Pensacola 
clinic last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The escort, James H. Barrett, was buried Monday with military honors at 
Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, on the eve of what would have been his 
75th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Paul Johnson, a Unitarian Universalist minister and friend, said: "I 
think of Jim caring for and protecting others and speaking his mind freely and 
clearly. His final act was in the service of others. We have been enriched to 
have known him." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 100 mourners were others who escort abortion patients through 
protesters, along with Barrett's widow, who was with him when he was slain, two 
sons and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Florida, priests were warned to be careful and dress 
inconspicuously after a caller threatened to kill 20 clergymen in retaliation 
for the slayings of Britton and Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 The anonymous caller contacted a Roman Catholic Church on Thursday in Miami, 
and the threat was passed to the FBI, police said. A church spokeswoman said it 
was hoped that the threat was a one-time crank call.

HEALTH CARE; COVERAGE AND BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two major plans being considered by Congress to reform the nation's health 
care system are both Democratic: one written by Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell of Maine and the other by House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
of Missouri. Other plans are expected to be offered this week. The Mitchell and 
Gephardt proposals both offer a list of standard benefits that would be 
required in all insurance plans. Some new benefits, such as outpatient 
prescription drugs and long-term care, that are not widely available would be 
added to standard insurance policies. Here is an outline of the benefits 
packages in the Mitchell and Gephardt plans: SENATE (MITCHELL PLAN) 
</P>
<P>
 A National Health Benefits Board would be established with the authority to 
determine the scope, duration and co-payments of services. The seven-member 
board would be appointed by the President and would have to be confirmed by the 
Senate. The board would also develop medical practice standards. The Mitchell 
proposal outlines these 16 areas of coverage in a standard benefits plan: 
</P>
<P>
 COVERAGE 
</P>
<P>
 * Hospital services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doctors' and other health professionals' services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emergency and ambulatory medical and surgical services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preventive services -- no co-payment required. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mental illness and substance abuse services. The board is instructed to seek 
the same co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles as for other services. If 
the board cannot initially design a package with parity, it may limit coverage, 
first on hospitalizations and subsequently on outpatient psychotherapy for 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family planning and services for pregnant women, with no co-payment for 
prenatal services. Abortion is covered, but providers who do not believe in 
abortion are not required to provide the service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hospice care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home health care, including nursing care and physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extended care services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outpatient laboratory, radiology and diagnostic services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outpatient prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outpatient rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, 
respiratory therapy and speech and audiology services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Durable medical equipment (such as wheelchairs and walkers), prosthetics and 
orthotics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vision, hearing and dental care for those under 22. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investigational treatments that are part of an approved research program. 
</P>
<P>
 ELDERLY AND DISABLED BENEFITS 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term care: $48 billion from 1995-2004 will be given to states to 
provide home and community-based services to those with severe mental 
retardation, severe cognitive or mental impairment or those who need assistance 
with three or more basic daily living activities (such as eating, dressing, 
bathing, movement, toilet). 
</P>
<P>
 Standards for long-term care insurance will be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Life care program: creates a voluntary, self-financed public insurance 
program to cover the costs of extended nursing home stays. People can purchase 
coverage when they reach ages of 35, 45, 55 or 65. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medicare drug benefits: Effective in 1999, Medicare recipients will be able 
to obtain outpatient drugs under a variety of insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER PROVISIONS 
</P>
<P>
 * Choice of doctor and choice of plan: Everyone would have the choice of at 
least three insurance plans, one of which must be a traditional fee-for-service 
plan in which an individual can choose his or her own doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Access to specialized treatment: Plans that require a patient to see a 
primary care physician before seeing any specialist must show must show that 
enrollees have access to specialized treatment expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coverage for temporarily unemployed and uninsured workers: Beginning in 
1997, unemployed workers will be eligible for subsidies for six months to help 
pay for insurance premiums. HOUSE (GEPHARDT PLAN) 
</P>
<P>
 The Gephardt plan includes a nationally guaranteed benefit package, which is 
essentially the services covered under Medicare with some enhancements. The 
amount of coverage and co-payments (with a few exceptions) would be determined 
by the kind of plan chosen, but all the services would be covered to some 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 COVERAGE 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlimited hospital care without a co-payment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skilled nursing facility care up to 100 days after hospitalization. After 
the first 20 days there is a daily co-payment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home health care, including nursing care, physical therapy or speech therapy 
on an intermittent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hospice care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doctors' services, including surgery, consultation and home office and 
institutional visits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laboratory, diagnostic tests, X-ray and other radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home dialysis supplies and equipment, prosthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Physical and speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ambulance services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single deductible of $500 per individual, $750 per family. 
</P>
<P>
 * An out-of-pocket cap on what anyone would have to spend on deductibles and 
co-payments, $3,000 for an individual, $6,000 for a family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preventive and well-child services for children without co-payments and 
preventive services for adults, including mammograms, Pap smears, colo-rectal 
and infectious-disease screening. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prescription drug coverage: 20% co-payment, a separate $500 deductible and a 
separate $1,000 out-of-pocket annual limit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comprehensive mental health and substance abuse benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pregnancy-related services and family planning services. Abortion is covered 
but may be dropped on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 ELDERLY AND DISABLED BENEFITS 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term care: a new program that would give states the option to provide 
home- and community-based services to individuals with severe disabilities for 
all ages and income. The benefits could vary from state to state. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare recipients would gain prescription drug benefits, improved preventive 
health and mental health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER PROVISIONS 
</P>
<P>
 * Medicare C: The plan would set up a Medicare Part C program that would cover 
individuals who are not employed, part-time and seasonal workers and low-income 
people and their dependents employed by firms with fewer than 100 workers. 
Employers with fewer than 100 workers would have the option of enrolling their 
workers in Part C. Medicare Part C would consist of fee-for-service and managed 
care plans. Those receiving Medicaid would be enrolled in Part C or a private 
health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choice of doctor and plan: The proposal would require employers to offer 
their workers a choice of a traditional fee-for-service plan, in which they 
could choose any doctor, a managed-care plan, in which consumers are required 
to seek treatment within a network of providers, or a high-deductible medical 
savings account plan. 
</P>
<P>
 TOMORROW 
</P>
<P>
 * How much will it cost? On Wednesday, a look at financing and cost controls.

<P>
 A California man convicted in the kidnaping of casino mogul Steve Wynn's 
daughter, Kevin, was sentenced to 19 years in prison Monday and ordered to make 
restitution on about $550,000 in ransom money that is still missing. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Lloyd George, in imposing the maximum sentence possible 
under federal guidelines, called the conduct of defendant Jacob Sherwood 
"brutalizing" and "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood, 23, of Sacramento, and Ray Cuddy, 47, of Las Vegas were convicted in 
the 1993 kidnaping. Kevin Wynn was released unharmed after her father paid a 
ransom of $1.45 million, of which about $900,000 has been recovered.

NOVEL CITED BY CHAN OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD, TEACHERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The award-winning novel Robert Chan blames for his brutal slaying of a fellow 
honor student is widely read but often misunderstood by bright young people, 
Orange County educators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Camus' "The Stranger," a 123-page book with simple language and 
straightforward narrative covering complex, dense philosophical concepts, 
commonly serves as an introduction to existentialism for high school and 
college students. It is routinely among the first French novels assigned to 
students of the language, while others read English translations in advanced 
high school or beginning college courses in literature or philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, 19, was sentenced Monday to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole for the New Year's Eve, 1992, slaying of Stuart A. Tay. He said in court 
papers that he read "The Stranger" nine months before killing Tay and 
determined that "everything was meaningless and nothing matters because we are 
all going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 The book's narrator, Meursault, shows indifference to his mother's death, 
kills a stranger and remains unmoved by his own impending decapitation. The 
story expresses the existential philosophy that there are no objective values, 
only rules people make for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Camus, a Frenchman from Algiers who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 
1957, published half a dozen novels, two volumes of "Notebooks," a trilogy of 
plays and a book of essays before his death in 1960. But his most famous work 
was his first, "The Stranger." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cure, a rock band both Chan and Tay loved, even based the 1979 song 
"Killing An Arab" on the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bright students who are introduced to existential ideas are often fascinated 
by them. That is not unusual," said Joan Kasper, a Foothill High English 
teacher who had Tay as a student several years ago. "The extent of the 
fascination and the duration of the fascination depends on the individual 
student." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Stranger,' " Kasper added, is "a difficult book to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Published in 1946, the story is set in Algiers and told in two parts. The 
first is an 18-day chronicle in which Meursault, an insignificant French clerk, 
attends his mother's funeral, has a love affair and kills an Arab on a beach. 
The second section is a yearlong chronicle of Meursault's time in jail, his 
trial and his ultimate execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most famous is the novel's opening lines: "Mother died today. Or, 
maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure." The matter-of-fact narrator continues to 
move through what seems a meaningless life, enjoying physical pleasures such as 
swimming, smoking and sex, but seeing little purpose in people's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideas that Camus tries to exhibit in his literature is that human beings 
are in the strange position of being valuing and purposeful creatures, but they 
find themselves in a world where reality has no match for this -- there aren't 
purposes in the world," explained Amy Thomasson, a philosopher who is teaching 
a course on existentialism at UCI this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't meaning in the world, there isn't value in the world; that's the 
awkward situation of humanity according to Camus," Thomasson said. "He argues 
that there is no intrinsic meaning in the world apart from what human beings 
project onto it." 
</P>
<P>
 The book's climax comes during a seaside holiday, when Meursault encounters 
the Arab and determines that it does not matter whether he fires the revolver 
he is holding. Later, almost by accident, he kills the man, then pumps four 
more bullets into his corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 In jail for 11 months, Meursault misses smoking and sex but is not absolutely 
unhappy. He admits the murder, but the judge and jury are more upset with his 
indifference to his mother's death, and thus sentence him to decapitation in a 
public place. 
</P>
<P>
 Meursault decides that life is profoundly absurd, and faces his death in 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Potolsky, a UCI instructor in comparative literature, said "The 
Stranger" is famous for its exploration of "the gratuitous act." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's no meaning in the world then this one act can just sort of occur," 
Potolsky explained. Meursault "just accepts the consequences of that act, he 
doesn't really feel remorse, he doesn't rue the fact that he did it. . . . He 
doesn't feel he acted wrongly because the act had no meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 According to letters Chan wrote the court and the Tay family before his 
sentencing, his reading of Camus in March, 1992, led him down a trail of 
deterioration that ended in Tay's death. Chan said he stopped brushing his 
teeth, abandoned socks and tried wearing the same clothes for a week to see if 
anyone noticed. No one did. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Meursault, Chan said he does feel remorse for the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shame and guilt will never cease to torment me," Chan wrote. "As I talked 
to my family, I felt their incredible grief and sorrow overwhelmingly in waves 
and pressing down upon my conscience with an unbearable weight. . . . My heart 
was truly broken when my mother cried in front of me. I could not face her."

CHAVIS SAYS OUTSIDE 'FORCES' SEEK TO WREST CONTROL OF NAACP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. said Monday he believes that 
"forces outside the African American community" are using his out-of-court 
settlement of an employee's sex discrimination claims to try to wrest control 
of the organization from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis declined to name those forces, but he blamed people who are unhappy 
with his alliance with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe some of this campaign is being orchestrated by forces outside the 
African American community working in concert with a small number of forces 
inside the NAACP," Chavis said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether he was referring to Jewish groups that asked Chavis to 
distance himself from Farrakhan because they believe Farrakhan is anti-Semitic, 
Chavis said: "Everybody reading that is going to know who I'm talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis is under pressure to resign for using $64,000 in NAACP money, without 
consent of the 64-member board of directors, to settle a former employee's sex 
discrimination claim out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 The former employee, Mary E. Stansel, has since filed a lawsuit alleging that 
Chavis and the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People reneged on 
a portion of the $332,000 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The loudest criticisms of Chavis have emanated from the NAACP's board of 
directors, most of whom are black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think this search for enemies . . . is productive. It's a 
scapegoating exercise," said Michael Meyers, a former NAACP staff member who 
now serves as executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition. "He 
has to assume responsibility for his own behavior and conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 13 NAACP chapters in Oregon and Washington on Monday reversed a 
decision by their conference president, Greg Evans, to withhold money from the 
national office, saying he acted against their wish to support Chavis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Evans has done a great disservice to the NAACP," said a statement issued 
by ShaRee Rhone and Henry Luvert, presidents of chapters in Portland, Ore., and 
Eugene, Ore. "We do not agree with him and wanted to openly say so."

OSHA ISSUES ASBESTOS RULES FOR WORKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued regulations Monday 
aimed at protecting nearly 4 million workers, especially maintenance workers 
and auto mechanics, from exposure to asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations require that any worker who may come across loose asbestos 
must be trained on how to avoid disturbing it and in some cases be provided 
with protective equipment, such as a respirator. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules also reduce the maximum permissible exposure to asbestos from 0.2 
fiber to 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air.

HUGE SPY OFFICE SNEAKS UP ON SENATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The top-secret agency that manages the nation's spy satellites has nearly 
completed building a $310-million headquarters, unknown to its congressional 
overseers. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of the four-tower, million-square-foot National Reconnaissance 
Office complex in the Virginia suburbs was disclosed Monday after President 
Clinton declassified the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unprecedented disclosure," said Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), a member 
of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "The Administration is saying mistakes 
were made." 
</P>
<P>
 Central Intelligence Director R. James Woolsey and Deputy Secretary of Defense 
John Deutch said in a joint statement that they will form a team to review the 
project and its cost effectiveness, and find out why its existence wasn't 
disclosed to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 They are to be among witnesses at a closed-door hearing of the Senate 
intelligence panel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, five miles south of Dulles International Airport, has been 
under construction for nearly four years under the guise of a new office 
building for defense contractor Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who chairs the Senate committee, said the 
National Reconnaissance Office took great pride in finding a way to "hide an 
elephant on a football field." 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional officials in charge of monitoring the Central Intelligence 
Agency and its projects knew a building was being constructed to consolidate 
offices of the reconnaissance agency but were blind to its location, size and 
cost, DeConcini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure -- roughly the size of the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Va. -- 
appears far too large for the number of people who work at the reconnaissance 
agency, committee aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for about 1,900 employees and 1,000 outside contractors who work 
for the agency to be housed there, but the building is designed for 3,500 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was uncovered by a committee audit, and DeConcini told Clinton 
about it last week during a meeting on health care, he said. The President 
apparently had been unaware of the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini said there apparently was "an effort not to disclose the cost and 
even the location . . . based on a culture and philosophy in much of the 
intelligence community that we don't have to account" for activities as do 
other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said the disclosure was "a good example of 
what happens when the government does business in the dark . . . 68 acres, a 
million square feet, and nobody knows about it."

U.N. OFFICIAL PROPOSES WEAPONS-FREE BOSNIAN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.N. commander in Bosnia on Monday proposed removing all soldiers and 
heavy weapons -- even those monitored by the United Nations -- from Sarajevo 
and the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by Lt. Gen. Michael Rose appeared aimed at avoiding a repeat of 
Friday's Serbian seizure of heavy weapons that were put under U.N. guard after 
NATO demanded in February that the guns around Sarajevo be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure provoked a NATO air strike on an archaic Serbian antitank weapon 
south of Sarajevo, an attack designed to show Bosnia's Serbs that the United 
Nations has the power to use force. 
</P>
<P>
 After the air strike, the Serbs returned the weapons they had seized. Rose now 
apparently wants to build on the Serbs' new sense of isolation to get weapons 
out of Sarajevo and the 12.5-mile weapons exclusion zone that the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization imposed around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia pledged Thursday to cut off all military supplies and trade with the 
Bosnian Serbs because they rejected an international peace plan reducing their 
share of Bosnia from 70% to 49% and giving the rest to a Muslim-Croatian 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said Monday that Serbia's pledge could have "catastrophic" effects on the 
ability of the Bosnian Serbs to fight and maintain the military superiority 
they have enjoyed during the 28-month war. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take two to three months for the full impact of the closure of the 
border with Serbia and Montenegro, the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia, 
to be felt, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "the (Bosnian) Serbs are feeling increasingly isolated," he said, 
reporting that their military headquarters is now unable to call Belgrade, the 
Serbian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bosnia's Serbs still have Sarajevo in their grip. The international 
airlift of aid has been shut down for more than two weeks following presumed 
Serbian fire on planes. The Serbs have also closed the only land routes into 
and out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid airlift will resume today, U.N. spokesman Ron Redmond said in Geneva. 
It started again Friday but was halted again by the Serbian seizure of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said the Serbs felt justified in tightening the siege because the Bosnian 
army broke a cease-fire agreement with offensives elsewhere in Bosnia. He said 
the United Nations protested to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic about the 
offensives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose contended that both the government and Serbs would benefit from the 
demilitarization of the Sarajevo area, noting that 40% of the people in the 
region are on Serbian-held territory. Under the proposal, he said, both armies 
would withdraw from the zone, and the only local security forces would be 
police with handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday the Bosnian Serbs raised a new obstacle to any lasting peace: 
Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the self-styled Bosnian Serb assembly, demanded 
64% of Bosnia for the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs, who constituted about one-third of Bosnia's population before 
the war and tended to live more in rural areas, claim that is the amount of 
territory Serbs rightfully owned in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajisnik argued that the 49% offered by the international peace plan 
translated into only about 20% of Bosnia's economic assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs went to war after the Muslims and Croats moved to secede from 
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. An estimated 200,000 people are dead or missing in 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serbs are for peace, but peace based on Serb ownership of 64% of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and their right to self-determination according to accepted 
international standards," Krajisnik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs are to vote on the peace plan Aug. 27-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, the Red Cross confirmed that Bosnian Serbs have rounded up more 
than 100 Muslim men recently and taken them to a labor camp at Lopare in 
northeast Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs have also expelled more than 300 Muslim women, children and elderly 
men from the northeastern town of Bijeljina in the past three weeks, Peter 
Kessler of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.

ANAHEIM HILLS FIRES SPARK SEARCH FOR ARSON SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are aggressively looking for a group of teen-agers or young adults 
suspected of starting seven brush fires within six hours in and around Anaheim 
Hills over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our grave concern is that they will strike again and we could have a repeat 
of what happened last year," said Bret Colson, a city spokesman, referring to 
the October wildfires that destroyed thousands of acres in Anaheim Hills and 
Laguna Canyon. "That would be absolutely devastating, and it makes these people 
extremely dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The brush fires, ranging in size from one acre to 50 acres, occurred between 7 
p.m. Friday and 1 a.m. Saturday, he said, mostly in vacant fields in and around 
neighborhoods in Anaheim Hills and the nearby unincorporated county area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ordinarily get that many arson calls in a year up there, and this 
time we got seven in one night," Colson said. "We're just fortunate that 
weather conditions were such that these flames were not aggravated." 
</P>
<P>
 No damage or injuries were reported, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But during one of the fires, Colson said, a resident saw two or three white 
males in their late teens or early 20s driving away from the scene. The 
occupants of the car shined a flashlight at the resident's eyes to prevent him 
from getting a license number, Colson said. The witness was able to describe 
the car, however: a 1984 or 1985 dark blue Ford Mustang hatchback with no 
hubcaps on the right side, silver metal louvers over the rear window and a 
primer spot on its rear fender. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions were further aroused less than 24 hours later, on Saturday night, 
when a car fitting that description drove by a firehouse in the area, slowed to 
almost a crawl, then sped away when the battalion chief began to approach it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost as if they were casing the fire station," Colson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim fire investigator Mike Doty said: "Our concern is that they're so 
brazen that they will continue until they are successful in causing a major 
fire. Naturally, we want to get it stopped and apprehend them before they have 
that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, a 17-year-old was sentenced to eight months in custody for 
setting the 1993 Anaheim Hills fire that destroyed two homes, threatened 29 
others and burned 750 acres. The fire came shortly before a similar blaze 
scorched thousands of acres and damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes in 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Colson said authorities want to talk to anyone with any information on the 
weekend fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more time that goes by, the more chance there is that these people could 
do this again." 
</P>
<P>
 Arson, according to Doty, is a felony punishable by up to seven years' 
imprisonment for the first offense. Anyone with information on the weekend 
fires is asked to call the Anaheim Fire Department at (714) 254-4047.

EL TORO SWAP WOULDN'T ALTER TOLLWAY PLANS; LAND USE: ENVIRONMENTALISTS' VIEW 
THAT IRVINE CO. DEAL WOULD END NEED FOR ROAD IS DISPUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Countering the views of environmentalists, officials at Orange County's 
tollway agency and the Irvine Co. said Monday that a proposed land swap between 
the federal government and the development giant would not threaten a planned 
$1-billion toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway agency officials said they likely would turn to their powers of 
eminent domain if necessary to seize the right-of-way needed for the Eastern 
Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The tollway is slated to run across a 10,000-acre swath of Irvine Co. property 
being eyed by federal officials, who have discussed a swap for the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, slated for closure late this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have suggested the land exchange would eliminate any need 
for the tollway because the Irvine Co. property would be absorbed into the 
Cleveland National Forest and many of the 18,000 housing units now planned in 
Gypsum Canyon and East Orange would never be built. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the Irvine Co. on Monday are voicing a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I can't imagine a situation where a land exchange would preclude or 
eliminate the Eastern Transportation Corridor," said Monica Florian, an Irvine 
Co. senior vice president. "The company and the (tollway agency) have been 
working a long time to implement major regional roadways. I envision we will 
simply continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservationists, however, almost certainly won't go along with any swap plan 
that permits the tollway, according to David Kossack, an environmental 
consultant and vice president of Friends of the Tecate Cypress, the Orange 
County group that has pushed for the deal to preserve ecologically sensitive 
terrain in the Santa Ana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't see a trade if the Eastern Corridor remains a part of it," 
Kossack said. "We certainly wouldn't support it. . . . It would rip that area 
in half. It would be right through the middle of the thing. It would be visible 
from just about any ridge top." 
</P>
<P>
 Kossack also said he believes Florian's stance is calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a negotiating strategy," he said. "She's not going to let the idea of 
giving up the tollway get onto the table, especially so early," he said. "I'm 
not surprised she'd say something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the Transportation Corridor Agencies, the outfit planning 
three pay-to-use highways in the county, said they do not expect any land 
exchange to scuttle the Eastern tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without motorists brought by new development, the tollway would retain 
its prime purpose -- to serve commuters funneling from Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties into Orange County for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major regional transportation improvement," said Michael Stockstill, 
tollway agency spokesman. "Eliminating development near the route is not going 
to eliminate the need for that road." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to some 
civilian use would only heighten the need for the tollway, which would run near 
the base, Stockstill said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a land swap occurred before construction begins next year, the agency board 
would likely use its condemnation powers to acquire the highway right-of-way 
they need before it could change hands, Stockstill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My assumption is we'd exercise our rights of eminent domain before an 
exchange could be made," he said. "That's certainly an option that would be 
available to the board."

DISABLED RIDERS TO BENEFIT FROM BUS STOP REPAIRS; TRANSPORTATION: IMPROVEMENTS 
COSTING $2.6 MILLION WILL INCLUDE NEW PEDESTRIAN RAMPS AND RELOCATION OF 
HAZARDOUS BENCHES AND SIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After learning that 40% of Orange County's bus stops aren't fully accessible 
to disabled people, the Orange County Transportation Authority voted Monday to 
spend $50,000 to help remedy the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A commissioned study concluded that many of the county's 6,500 bus stops do 
not meet the standards of the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the stops that don't comply with the federal act need only "minor 
types of repairs and can be easily fixed," OCTA spokesman John Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds approved by the OCTA board of directors will repair and improve 
about 25 bus stops. By the time all are upgraded, the project will have cost 
about $2.6 million, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Monday's vote called for new guidelines to establish and maintain 
bus stops so that future problems will be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money will be well spent," said Greg Winterbottom, OCTA's alternate 
public member of the board. "The study made recommendations that are all 
doable." 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements will include installing pedestrian ramps, relocating benches and 
signs that are hazards to disabled passengers, clearing obstructions and 
installing minimum sidewalk and rear and front concrete pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Winterbottom said the best thing about the board's action is that guidelines 
will be adopted to spell out how bus stops should be improved and new ones 
built to meet the needs of disabled passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said some previous improvements to bus stops were installed 
improperly, creating hazards for the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
 "A prime example of this problem is a lip on a sidewalk ramp that exceeds 
one-half inch and is not beveled at 45 degrees," the study said. "This 
condition can cause a person in a wheelchair to fall out." 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials said they will work with cities to adopt stronger guidelines 
for bus stops. Participating cities would then become eligible for 
transportation program funding support from OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is a large portion of the problems can be addressed and taken 
care of easily if we all work together," said Westminster Mayor Charles V. 
Smith, an OCTA board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency voted Monday to select the consulting team of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff, based in the city of Orange, to help guide an investment study 
for the Fullerton-Irvine Transit Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote authorized OCTA Chief Executive Officer Stanley T. Oftelie to 
negotiate an agreement with Brinckerhoff not to exceed $3 million. In April, 
board members authorized studying the proposed six-mile-wide transit corridor 
between the two cities.

ENABLING THE DISABLED TO WORK; AGENCY FINDS JOB MARKET OPENING FOR ITS MENTALLY 
IMPAIRED CLIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Hutchinson remembers waiting for a bus with several of his mentally 
impaired students about 10 years ago, when a passing driver gawked at the group 
a bit too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "He slammed into the car in front of him," Hutchinson remembers. "I went home 
that night shaking my head. . . . I couldn't believe we were that much of a 
spectacle to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed in the world during the past decade, however, including 
society's acceptance of those who are different, said Hutchinson, program 
director of Saddleback Community Enterprises, or SCE, a nonprofit vocational 
training and job placement program. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that the program, which since 1974 has trained clients and then 
sought jobs for them, now finds employers knocking at its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business world's social awareness is growing. Now, we get calls from 
employers." 
</P>
<P>
 While the program's students still are stared at by unthinking people and some 
doors in the job market remain closed, "over the last 10 or 15 years, people 
have become very aware that disabled adults are people, too," Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Community Enterprises, which receives most of its $4-million annual 
budget from the state, serves 225 students who have mild to severe clinical 
brain disorders ranging from cerebral palsy to Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's mission is to teach life skills, which may mean using a spoon or 
learning assembly, maintenance or restaurant work. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to help the mentally impaired adults achieve self-respect and 
avoid being segregated from life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise, many of our students would be sitting in front of the television, 
by themselves, day after day," Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 of them work at outside jobs and another 90 are paid for assembly 
work at the program's own workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Client David Grimes, 28, said his goal was to be on his own, earn his own 
money and pay for his own apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad wasn't all for me leaving, but my mom knows that it's good for me to 
have my own place," said Grimes, who has mild cerebral palsy and epilepsy. He 
now assembles custom knee braces at Innovation Sports, an Irvine-based company. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The program helped him find employment, Grimes said. "Sometimes it took me 
months to find a job," and often employers would "see me and brush me off 
because my speech is a little slow. I like this job. Everyone treats me OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Montes, operations manager for Innovation Sports, said he had apprehensions 
when an SCE representative first approached him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fear of the unknown, of something we've never tried before," Montes 
said. "Mostly, I was concerned about how my other employees would react." 
</P>
<P>
 Montes polled a few workers who gave him the thumbs up. A short while later, 
Grimes and another client, Matt Waters, were hired. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, their work has been "pretty solid," Montes said. "They are evaluated 
like any other employees, and we consider them part of our family. I think they 
will actually teach our employees good work habits." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to entice employers are tax breaks and other financial incentives 
provided by state and federal governments. Businesses can deduct up to 40% of 
the cost of hiring a mentally disabled person. 
</P>
<P>
 But "that's not why we hired Dave and Matt," Montes said. "We feel you need to 
help out the community and give people a chance to show what they can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Students are trained in several large workshops in an industrial complex in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is slow and laborious, with emphasis on repetition. Each student has 
a job coach who teaches employment skills and how to work with other people. 
</P>
<P>
 When trainees are placed at a company, the job coach accompanies them to the 
job until it becomes familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them earn only the minimum wage, but it is the paycheck rather than 
the amount that matters most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen them on their first payday with that check in their hand, all 
smiles," said Lee Qualls, the program's job-placement director. "The nearest 
thing I can compare it to is like a high school graduate. There's a sense of 
accomplishment and self-worth that getting paid gives them." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the organization's biggest obstacle to placing the workers in jobs is 
simply a depressed economy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our No. 1 problem is that we're real susceptible to business cycles," 
Hutchinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another is transportation. More than 90% of the workers depend on Dial-A-Ride 
and buses to travel to their jobs, and jobs on weekends and late evenings go 
unfilled because few buses run then. And Dial-A-Ride is scheduled to be 
eliminated in October, leaving program officials wondering how they'll cope. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, one of the tax breaks offered by the federal 
government is scheduled to expire, and the Department of Labor isn't supporting 
its renewal, Hutchinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 But program officials have learned to take setbacks with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another disaster of the day," Hutchinson said. "We'll deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, the jobs don't run entirely smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Niguel, the city employed two SCE clients to set up for and clean up 
after meetings and banquets at the city's senior and community center. But the 
council recently determined the SCE people could not handle the job duties, 
which changed depending on the group and activity scheduled for the center. The 
council decided to hire four part-time workers instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job kind of evolved from what the council had in mind at first," said 
Hutchinson, who has managed to place one of the two workers at another job. 
"This happens occasionally, not very often."  
</P>
<P>
 But other cities' experiences have been more pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Juan Capistrano, which hires clients for office maintenance, Mayor 
Collene Campbell said, "Sometimes I go to City Hall early, and I see them and 
talk with them and watch what they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're great. They care more about their jobs and do them with so much 
responsibility. We can all learn a lot about how to do our jobs from these 
people."

LAWYER FOR INDIGENT REFUSES TO SHARE CASELOAD; JUSTICE SYSTEM: WILLIAM W. 
STEWART REJECTS JUDGES' RECOMMENDATION, SAYING IT WOULD LEAVE BAD IMPRESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Brushing aside criticism about his law firm's performance under a 
million-dollar contract to defend poor people accused of crimes, local attorney 
William W. Stewart rejected a recommendation from local judges that he share 
the massive caseload with two other law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Santa Ana Municipal Court judges, the flamboyant attorney said 
that agreeing to modify his existing contract would create the "appearance . . 
. that there really is something wrong with the level of my performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges had left it up to Stewart to decide whether he should share the 
work -- and roughly $1 million per year in fees -- even though some local 
jurists had expressed concerns that Stewart had not been in court in more than 
four years, that he had farmed out many of the cases to lawyers outside his law 
firm, and that his firm apparently lacked enough lawyers to ensure that 
defendants were always represented at scheduled court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Stewart's existing contract to defend indigent clients in Santa Ana 
Municipal Court runs through next July, Presiding Judge Gregory H. Lewis has 
said that the judges could only make recommendations to the attorney and could 
not unilaterally modify a valid contract that has been awarded to Stewart 
without interruption for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want it to appear that there is anything wrong with the 
representation we are providing," Stewart informed the judges. "It has always 
been my primary objective to service the contract and to provide indigent 
defendants with quality representation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has held the contract for the past 15 years. But in an interview 
Monday he said that he "probably" would not seek an extension next summer 
because of the recent controversy, and because fewer indigent cases are being 
referred to private law firms under contract to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office generally represents poor people accused of 
crimes. But on those occasions when there are multiple defendants or other 
potential conflicts of interest arise, the cases are referred to private 
criminal defense attorneys under contract to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's firm handles the largest number of indigent defense cases assigned 
to private contract attorneys -- up to 1,200 a year. However, Stewart said 
Monday that he has seen referrals from the public defender's office drop by 40% 
this year because of fewer conflict claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this decline, Stewart said it would be "totally impractical" to 
divide the caseload equally among three law firms, and insufficiently 
profitable to make it worth pursuing an extension of the contract. He estimated 
that potential attorneys' fees from the contract could drop from nearly $1 
million in previous years to about $450,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difficulty is in maintaining a balance between quality and quantity in 
these economic times," he told judges in his letter. "I opted for quality over 
quantity. To be sure, I would like to put a lawyer in each courtroom. But these 
economic times have affected all levels of service in all areas of life, not 
just this contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the same Santa Ana Municipal Court judges have also allowed 
attorney Patrick McNeal to continue serving as one of two backups to Stewart's 
firm, even though McNeal has been placed on three years' probation for legal 
misconduct by the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lewis has said the terms of McNeal's county contract state that 
disciplinary action by the State Bar is grounds for termination, but the judges 
are allowing McNeal to continue his county work because the legal misconduct 
did not involve a county contract case. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeal could not be reached for comment Monday, but Santa Ana Municipal Court 
Executive Officer Robert B. Kuhel said the McNeal matter was reviewed and "no 
steps were taken against him." 
</P>
<P>
 McNeal was placed on probation in May after he failed to provide status 
reports or file appropriate documents for a client in a divorce case, according 
to State Bar records. It was the bar's second disciplinary action against 
McNeal in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Stewart agreed to a reorganization of his contract, McNeal's firm would 
have been one of the two firms in line to share in a greater number of indigent 
cases.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; BOY PEDALS TO TWO MORE WORLD TITLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Larry Cambra enters Foothill High School next month, he will have an 
interesting tale to tell about how he spent his summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry, 13, just won his second and third world championships in dirt bike 
racing at an international competition held in Michigan. On July 31, he beat 
several dozen of the best competitors from as far away as South Africa, Belgium 
and Australia in two separate racing classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really hoped I was going to win. I was thinking positive," he said Monday. 
The tournament, sponsored by the Phoenix-based American Bicycle Assn., included 
more than 70 of the best riders from all over the world. Larry won 
championships for expert riders 13 years old, racing two different kinds of 
bikes in separate divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry has been racing BMX bikes, which are specially designed for off-road 
racing, since he was 4. He won his first world title in Brazil two years ago, 
at 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, Larry straps on a helmet and pads to practice at the 
Orange YMCA BMX track. The track is where he first learned to race 
competitively, and he stayed with the sport "for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry said he might never have won the titles if not for encouragement from 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was little I had (discouraging) slumps, but my dad made me stay with 
it. I learned not to be a quitter and I apply that to every sport I play," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he enjoys bike racing, Larry said he wants to eventually become a 
professional athlete, possibly as a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he is looking forward to the possibility of defending his title next 
year in Colombia and basking in his recent accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I won in Brazil, it's been my goal to win in America, and I did 
it," he said. "I was just really happy that I won."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 3 DEAD, 4 HURT IN STRING OF SHOOTINGS 
</P>

<P>
 Three men were killed and four other people injured early Monday morning in a 
string of apparently unrelated shootings in Santa Ana and Westminster, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All seven were in cars at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Hernandez Abarca, 21, of Santa Ana was killed about 3:30 a.m. while 
riding with friends along Bristol Avenue when a car pulled alongside and a 
passenger fired several rounds, Police Sgt. Bob Clark said. He said the attack 
was believed to be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour earlier, Jose Matis Delgado, 18, of Pomona died after his car was 
fired upon from another vehicle and then crashed into a tree on Civic Center 
Drive in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who labeled the attack gang-related, said it was still undetermined 
whether he died of gunshot wounds or of injuries from the collision. Two 
injured passengers were taken to an undisclosed hospital. A third rider was 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were wounded about 2 a.m. by gunfire after an alleged gang dispute 
outside a Santa Ana store near the intersection of 17th and King streets. The 
two, who were not identified by police, were taken to undisclosed local 
hospitals with injuries to the head and upper body. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said all three incidents were thought to be gang-related but otherwise 
unconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 A shootout that began in Westminster between the occupants of two cars left a 
man wounded in a stolen car on the Garden Grove Freeway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported shooting between two cars traveling west on Westminster 
Boulevard about 1 a.m., but police found no sign of the cars when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 A half an hour later, a man in his 20s was found with a gunshot wound to the 
head in a car parked on the interchange of the San Diego and Garden Grove 
freeways, said Westminster Officer Robin Kapp. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapp said the man, Dat Quoc Tran, 19, of Fountain Valley, was believed to be 
one of those involved in the shootout. He was taken to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where he later died. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was stolen in Santa Ana, Kapp said. He said police had not determined 
a motive for the shooting. KEN ELLINGWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CITY STUDYING HOW TO SPEND NEW FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An internal study is underway to determine the most appropriate uses for about 
$175,000 in sales tax money the city will receive this year as a result of 
Proposition 172. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which was approved by California voters in November, 1993, 
authorizes a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for local public safety 
services.Brea expects to receive from $150,000 to $200,000 annually from this 
new revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Tim O'Donnell said results of the study are expected to 
be presented to the City Council for action sometime this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting last week, the council unanimously approved a 
resolution that said money from sales tax will be used to bolster police and 
fire services, rather than just replace monies that were already budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest said that because the state legislation was "poorly 
drafted," some cash-strapped cities have used Proposition 172 funds "to solve 
serious problems in their existing budgets" instead of increasing police and 
fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities have even defined "public safety" in a broad sense, he said, and 
used the new sales tax money to repair potholes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a trust issue," said Councilman Burnie Dunlap, who said California 
voters agreed to the tax hike because they wanted a higher level of public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said that when cities defeat the intent of Proposition 
172, it becomes harder to win voter support for similar measures in the 
future.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY TO WEIGH SHIFTS IN MANAGEMENT SETUP

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider proposed changes in the city's management 
team, including the appointment of a deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley also is proposing the creation of the 
Community Development Agency, which would include redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the city would have two deputy managers -- one responsible for 
administrative services and the other for community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntley said the reorganization is intended to "maximize staff resources by 
combining related activities under one director." 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Loomer, currently director of Community Services and Recreation, is 
expected to be named deputy city manager of administrative services. She will 
be responsible for personnel, print shop, information services and community 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director Don Vestal will be named deputy city manager for 
community development. He will be responsible for redevelopment, housing, 
grants, building and planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Anderson will no longer be assistant city manager, but will keep his 
position as Redevelopment Agency director. He will work under Vestal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow me to concentrate on redevelopment issues," said Anderson, 
who has been assistant city manager for the past four years. He was responsible 
for personnel, print shop and information services, in addition to his duties 
as redevelopment agency director. 
</P>
<P>
 The council recently appointed Bill Smith, the city manager of Manhattan 
Beach, as Westminster's manager, replacing Jerry Kenny, who retired in March. 
Huntley has been acting city manager since Kenny's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will start his new job Sept. 5. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; COUNCIL MAY BALK AT JOINING FIRE AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Villa Park is contemplating going on its own when it come to fighting fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has scheduled a special meeting at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday to 
discuss alternatives to joining a countywide fire authority. Villa Park so far 
is the only city that has balked at the proposed new fire administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority, scheduled to be launched this fall, would be a new governing 
body for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of 16 cities currently served by the county Fire Department have 
voted to join it, and a 15th city, Seal Beach, has indicated it will join soon, 
according to Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, who is representing city managers in the formation of the new 
authority, said he cannot understand Villa Park's hesitancy in joining the 
compact. 
</P>
<P>
 But Villa Park Mayor Pro Tem Bob Patchin said he wonders why so many cities 
have already approved the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand how these other cities have signed away their fire money 
to a body that doesn't exist," Patchin said. He added that he has reservations 
about how the proposed authority would be governed. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin charged that the proposed governing structure is not clear, 
particularly on what role city managers would play in the new fire 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said that the fears expressed by Patchin and some other council members 
in Villa Park are groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Villa Park is making a mountain out of a molehill," Brady said. He 
added that no other city in the proposed authority has had any controversy with 
the proposed new fire authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said the fire authority would represent all cities adequately.  
</P>
<P>
 "Each city would have a voting board member," Brady said, adding that the new 
authority will be launched whether or not Villa Park joins, and if it doesn't, 
"we wish them well."  
</P>
<P>
 The Villa Park City Council was scheduled to vote on the proposed authority 
last month, but it deferred action after Patchin and Councilman Joseph S. Barsa 
said they had many problems with the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all council members are opposed to the fire authority. At the council's 
July 26 meeting, Councilmen Bob Bell and John Frackelton said they had no 
objections to delaying a vote on the authority. But both said they think it is 
likely the best option for Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't have any option, in my opinion, but to go ahead," Bell said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NIXON REMEMBERED WITH TALK, VIDEO

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of the 20th anniversary of Richard Nixon's resignation, a former 
White House aide is hoping the medium often blamed for bringing down the Yorba 
Linda native's presidency will now help round out future character portraits of 
the controversial chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Gannon, who was 25 when he joined the Nixon White House in 1971, showed 
excerpts from his new four-part video series called "The Real Richard Nixon" 
Monday morning at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Culled from 38 hours of interviews with the former President over a 10-month 
period in 1984, the video -- in what Gannon called an "objective, 
non-confrontational" style -- gives Nixon's recollections of his tumultuous 
political and personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have spoken on camera," said Gannon, who trained as a historian at 
Oxford University, "you can address posterity and not be filtered through the 
psycho-historians, the historians and the pundits." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 minutes of outtakes Gannon selected for the 300 Nixon library visitors 
Monday morning were largely of a nostalgic nature. In a tape chronicling his 
last days in office, Nixon remembered his famous farewell talk to the White 
House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In the speech delivered on nationwide television 20 years ago today, Nixon 
said: "Only if you've been in the deepest valley can you know how magnificent 
it is to be on the highest mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very emotional speech," Nixon said on the tape. "I recall speaking 
from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Gannon also provided his own accounts of Nixon's final hours while leaving 
office. Gannon traveled with the former President as he left Washington for the 
last time as chief executive and flew to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannon remembers thousands of people were solemnly waiting to greet Nixon. The 
crowd began to sing "God Bless America," Gannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was another in a series of very moving moments," said Gannon, who for four 
years helped Nixon compile his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tape entitled "The Early Life," Nixon -- who ironically was noted for his 
harsh language inside the Oval Office -- humorously recounted a childhood 
incident where an elder scolded him for using the word "golly." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same tape, Nixon thanked his Fullerton High School football coach who 
taught him: "If you don't win, you kick yourself in the butt and make sure you 
don't make the same mistakes again." 
</P>
<P>
 The videotapes, filmed 10 years ago and some of which aired on CBS's "60 
Minutes," also include an hourlong piece featuring Nixon's memories about the 
former First Lady, Pat Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon said it was love at first sight when he initially saw his future wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common denominator of the recollections is his wife, Mrs. Nixon," 
Gannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the sympathetic tone of Monday's tape selections, Gannon said his 
interviews with Nixon did contain "tough questions." 
</P>
<P>
 "He got ticked off," said Gannon, who described himself as a "loyalist, but 
not a blind loyalist." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon biographer Jonathon Aitken, a former member of Parliament and chief 
secretary of Britain's Treasury, will speak at the Nixon Library today about 
the former President's legacy. The talk starts at 10:30 a.m. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; COUNCIL TO WEIGH STOP SIGN INSTALLATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider placing a stop sign at the intersection 
of Hon Avenue and Camberwell Street, just off of Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents have long complained about drivers speeding down the 
residential street that begins at Alicia Parkway as a commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic commission has recommended a second stop sign, at Hon and Julie 
avenues. The recommendation comes just weeks after the council approved new 
three-way stop signs along Mackenzie Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of vocal Mackenzie residents had banded together to ask the council to 
slow down the commuters who use it as a freeway alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Ken Rosenfield had recommended only a stop sign at Hon and 
Camberwell because it is difficult for drivers to see the intersection as they 
travel south on Hon. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not recommend a second stop sign at Hon and Julie because stop signs 
are not used just to slow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider placing a rumble strip on Hon north of 
Camberwell to further slow drivers. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; ATTACK AT PARTY PROBED AS HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD and MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are investigating a weekend stabbing and beating of a black 
teen-ager as a possible hate crime, an assault that the victim's stepfather 
characterized Monday as "planned" attack based on race. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Vaughn, 15, of Tustin remained hospitalized Monday at Children's 
Hospital at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center with a broken jaw and nose 
and puncture wounds to the back, legs and upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn and a white friend were assaulted when they showed up where a group had 
gathered Friday night for a party in Portola Hills, Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two people among the group of 25 to 30 took part in the attack, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn was beaten and stabbed with an unknown weapon and his 16-year-old 
friend was punched and sprayed with a chemical, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone in the group reportedly shouted a racial slur during the attack, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a comment made by someone with a racial component," he said. 
"Whether this was based as a hate crime -- that's one of the components of the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said a 16-year-old Lake Forest boy, who is white, was taken into 
custody, and authorities were seeking another youth, described as Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have not determined the motive for the attack, which took place 
on Live Oak Circle about 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the group apparently had assembled for a party. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vaughn's stepfather, Melvin Aaron, told a news conference at the hospital 
that his stepson had been lured to a "phantom party" and that he was "isolated 
from the group and singled out" as a target. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the attack, a dark cul-de-sac, was "perfect for such a crime to 
occur," said Aaron, 44, a Cal State Long Beach professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron said that Vaughn had been involved in three verbal and physical 
incidents at Santa Margarita High School in which race was involved in the past 
year, and "I don't feel the school's response has been appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a sophomore at Santa Margarita High, is described as a popular student 
and standout football player who cracked the starting lineup in his freshman 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruben's a great kid, well-liked in the school and a real nice kid," said Rich 
Schaaf, the school's athletic director. "He's a good addition to the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaaf said accounts were untrue that senior teammates had resented Vaughn for 
starting as a tight end and linebacker in his first year. KEN ELLINGWOOD and

NRC GIVES SAN ONOFRE AN A-/B+ RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A "report card" released Monday by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives the 
San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station an overall A-/B+ rating on a range of 
issues including plant operations, maintenance and technical support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall it's a very good report card," said Steve Conroy, a spokesman for the 
Southern California Edison Co., which owns and operates the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance evaluation -- covering December, 1992, to June, 1994 -- is one 
of a series of evaluations issued by the regulatory commission every few years 
based on observations and data collected over time. In the evaluations, nuclear 
plants are rated on a scale of 1 to 3 -- with 1 being best -- in several 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent evaluation, the San Onofre plant received 1 ratings in the 
areas of plant operations and plant support, with 2 ratings on 
maintenance/surveillance and engineering/technical support. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall the plant received a 1.5 rating, described as being between an A- and 
B+. The rating was slightly worse than its 1991 rating of 1.43, but better than 
the region's average plant rating of 1.76. 
</P>
<P>
 "On average it's a little bit lower" than last year's evaluation, Conroy said, 
"but this is a solid report card for us."

UNFINISHED TOLLWAY BRIDGE TUMBLES WHEN VEHICLE HITS IT

<P>
 A 150-foot section of a bridge under construction as part of the Foothill toll 
road collapsed Monday when a vehicle lost its brakes and crashed into a metal 
support, tollway officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the vehicle, a loader similar to a forklift, injured his ankle 
when he jumped off before the impact, according to Michael Stockstill, a 
tollway spokesman.The driver, who was not identified, was treated and released 
at a nearby clinic. There were no other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill said that officials of the contractor, C.C. Myers Construction, 
estimated that the accident will cause a delay of about 10 days in the 4.2-mile 
extension of the Foothill toll road, which is scheduled to open in February, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a small portion of the work was affected," Stockstill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oso bridge is one of three portions of the Foothill Corridor extension 
project, which has been underway for a little more than a year. The collapsed 
section of metal piping and ironwork was on the northbound portion of a 
divided, 1,500-foot bridge near the Upper Oso Reservoir, Stockstill said. After 
the piping is installed, wooden forms called "falsework" are added, into which 
concrete is poured. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the southbound section of the bridge has been completed. MARK I.

TOLL ROAD PROTESTERS TO PAY NO RESTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight Earth First! activists arrested last year for chaining themselves to 
bulldozers about to begin construction of the San Joaquin Hills tollway will 
not have pay restitution for lost income and expenses associated with their 
actions, a group spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick T. Mitchell said Commissioner Kenneth Schwartz announced his decision 
Monday in South Orange County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, 27, was arrested with seven other environmental activists Sept. 27 
after they chained themselves to bulldozers to protest the building of the toll 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came two months after the activists promised not to repeat their 
action in exchange for a penalty limited to 10 days of community service and 
informal probation.

CYPRESS, POLICE UNION REACH AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a two-year struggle, the police union and city government have reached 
agreement on a new contract for police employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract calls for an across-the-board 1.5% pay raise retroactive to 
July 1, according to Sgt. Gene Komrosky, president of the Cypress Public Safety 
Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council announced it had reached a settlement Monday night after a 
closed-door meeting, but Mayor Pro Tem Joyce C. Nicholson did not disclose 
details of the contract.  
</P>
<P>
 Komrosky, however, said it is a two-year contract that, in addition to the 
initial 1.5% pay raise, gives raises on Jan. 1 and July 1, 1995. The 1995 
raises will vary according to work category. For instance, sworn officers will 
get a 3% raise next July, while sergeants will get 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're satisfied with the contract," Komrosky said. The police union hoped to 
increase police pay to the average in similar Orange County cities, he said. 
With the new contract, Cypress police still lag behind other cities, "but we 
came as close as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Komrosky said the police association had to give up a floating holiday and 
accept no increase in medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers endorsed the new contract by an overwhelming vote last week, 
union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had been without a contract since 1992, and negotiations at times had 
become tense. Last November, about 150 people, including police and their 
families, picketed a City Council meeting. Officials said it was the first time 
that police had picketed city government. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also at one time threatened to launch a recall action against council 
members. They charged that the council was exaggerating its budget problems and 
actually had adequate money for a police pay raise.  
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. John E. Cavanaugh said the new contract represents "give and take 
on both sides."

NEWPORT COUNCIL APPROVES MCDONALD'S ON BALBOA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite pleas from an overflowing, sometimes jeering crowd, the Newport Beach 
City Council on Monday voted to allow a scaled-back version of a McDonald's 
restaurant on the Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 4-3 vote, the council approved the restaurant with the caveats that the 
chain provide off-site parking for employees and that if a traffic study finds 
a signal is warranted at the site, McDonald's will pay the approximately 
$90,000 cost, with a portion to be repaid by other businesses moving into the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the neighborhood around 28th Street and Newport Boulevard have 
termed the project a "Big Mac attack" that will bring noise, traffic and trash, 
despite concessions from the restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Hyans, president of the Central Newport Beach Community Assn., said of 
estimates from McDonald's of cars and customers: "The statistics have been 
cooked -- make that deep-fried -- to suit the situation. . . . The philosophy 
that anything is better than a weed-filled dirt lot does not apply." 
</P>
<P>
 But a McDonald's spokesman argued that the restaurant itself wouldn't draw 
people; it would only serve those already drawn by the beach, pier or other 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry King, a land-use consultant for McDonald's, said, "We continually heard 
that the site would be a destination, and the traffic would be increased. 
Nothing could be further from the truth."  
</P>
<P>
 The appeal before the City Council was brought by the Central Newport Beach 
Community Assn., the Balboa Peninsula Point Assn. and resident Laith Ezzet. 
Opponents have complained that two walk-up windows, a glowing sign and menu at 
eye level and a drive-up lane with only an eight-car capacity will cause 
traffic jams and blight. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's officials agreed to change the red-and-gold color scheme of the 
restaurant's exterior to blue and gray. They also agreed to give up the chain's 
trademark golden arches, along with speakers at drive-up windows, two to three 
hours a night of potential business and an outdoor dining area. The chain also 
promised to limit signs to 10 feet tall instead of 25 feet and institute daily 
litter pickups within a two-block radius. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those sacrifices won a 4-3 vote of approval from the Planning 
Commission in June, some residents of the 28th Street Marina across the street 
from the proposed site weren't happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of area residents signed petitions opposing the store. Others wrote 
letters to the city, citing the potential threat to established, mom-and-pop 
fast food restaurants among their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic, both automobile and pedestrian, was a focal point in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponent Kent Stoddard noted that the restaurant site, on a triangular 
concrete island between the peninsula's main thoroughfares, leaves little 
opportunity for pedestrians to mosey up to the walk-up windows. He said the 
restaurant will heighten the risk of cars hitting pedestrians approaching from 
opposite sides of divided Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern was that cars lining up for the drive-up window would spill 
out onto Newport Boulevard, blocking already congested street traffic. A city 
traffic engineer said the restaurant will solve that problem by sending someone 
out to take orders from queued drivers, speeding the service time.  
</P>
<P>
 Two residents sent letters favoring the restaurant. Both expressed hope that a 
shiny new business would encourage owners of "run-down" properties to make 
improvements.

TRUST FUND SET UP IN SEARCH FOR MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a missing private security guard said Monday they are setting up 
a trust fund to aid in the search for Michael Jerome Williams, who disappeared 
July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' father, the Rev. Frank Williams, assistant pastor at Friendship 
Baptist Church in Long Beach, announced the formation of a family trust, part 
of which would be used as a reward for locating 32-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
 The family also announced that it has hired a private investigator to help 
locate Williams, who was last seen leaving his Santa Ana home for Newport Beach 
to pick up his paycheck and new security guard uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Anaheim police said they stopped three teen-agers who were in a 
rental car that Williams had been using while his was being repaired. A 
juvenile driving the white 1991 Ford Taurus was detained because he was wanted 
for an outstanding warrant, police said. The others were questioned, then 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is described as African American, 5 feet 8, 170 pounds and missing 
two front teeth. Anyone with information is asked to contact Santa Ana police 
at (714) 834-4801.

KEVIN WYNN'S KIDNAPER GIVEN 19 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California man convicted in the kidnaping of Kevin Wynn was sentenced to 19 
years in prison Monday and ordered to make restitution of some $550,000 in 
missing ransom money.  
</P>
<P>
 In imposing the maximum sentence possible under federal guidelines, U.S. 
District Judge Lloyd George called the conduct of the kidnaper, Jacob Sherwood, 
"brutalizing" and "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood, 23, of Sacramento and Ray Cuddy, 47, a former Newport Beach sporting 
club manager, were convicted in the July 26 kidnaping of the daughter of casino 
mogul Steve Wynn. She was released unharmed after her father paid a ransom of 
$1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy was arrested in Newport Beach a few days after the kidnaping as he tried 
to complete a cash deal for a $200,000 Ferrari. Sherwood was arrested in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities found $500,000 of the ransom money in the Newport Beach garage of 
a friend of Cuddy. The men had met at the now-defunct Newport Beach Sporting 
Club, which Cuddy managed. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Angelo referred to Sherwood and Cuddy as "two 
perverts" and said the crime left the Wynns and their daughter wondering, "Is 
it going to happen again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom O'Connell said after the sentence that about 
$900,000 of the ransom money has been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynn obtained the $1.45 million from the casino cage at the Mirage Hotel, 
carrying the money through the crowded casino in a shopping bag to an employee 
who took it to a ransom drop site. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was found bound in her car in a parking lot at McCarran 
International Airport, some two hours after the ordeal began.

<P>
 The dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese yen and gained on other 
major currencies Monday, but stocks and bonds closed little changed from 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said some of Monday's market action appeared to be posturing ahead of 
the U.S. Treasury's quarterly "refunding," which begins today with the sale of 
three-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar jumped to 101.52 yen from 100.25 yen Friday. Monday's 
close was the dollar's highest level against the yen since June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also inched up against the German mark, to 1.583 from 1.581 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the dollar was helped on two fronts: First, some foreign 
investors appeared to be purchasing dollars with which to buy Treasury notes 
and bonds at this week's auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, anticipation that the Federal Reserve Board will again raise 
short-term interest rates may be influencing some investors' thinking about the 
dollar's next big move. A rise in rates would tend to support the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither stocks nor bonds got much of a lift from the dollar's gains 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average added 6.79 points to 3,753.81 in typically 
thin summer-Monday trading. Winners topped losers by 11 to 9 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond closed at 7.54%, 
unchanged from Friday. Yields had rocketed Friday after the government reported 
a surge in job creation in July, suggesting that the economy is stronger than 
the Fed desires. 
</P>
<P>
 That raised expectations that the Fed will tighten credit soon for a fifth 
time this year, by boosting short-term interest rates. The Fed's policy-making 
committee meets Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the bond market in particular faces the hurdle this week of 
the Treasury's refunding, which will dump $40 billion in new notes and bonds on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, both stock and bond markets may be volatile in advance of the 
government's report on July wholesale inflation, due out Thursday, and July 
consumer inflation, due on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher-than-expected inflation numbers could force the Fed to boost short-term 
rates by half a percentage point, some traders say. Many economists now believe 
the Fed will raise rates a quarter of a point next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial shares continued to decline in profit taking. Deere fell 1 
3/8 to 65 5/8, Phelps Dodge lost 1 to 61 1/8, Great Lakes Chemical slid 1 3/8 
to 56 3/4, Illinois Tool Works eased 1/2 to 40 3/8 and Kennametal dropped 1 3/8 
to 51 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many transportation issues were also weak. British Airways fell 2 1/4 to 64 
3/8, Federal Express lost 1 to 66 1/8 and Conrail sank 1 1/8 to 54 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Mesa Airlines plunged 3 7/16 to 6 9/16 after the regional airline 
lowered its 1994 and 1995 earnings expectations, citing rising competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, technology issues were broadly higher. Apple rose 1/2 to 
33 3/4, Compaq jumped 7/8 to 34 1/2, Adobe Systems surged 1 7/8 to 31 1/8, 
Cabletron Systems gained 2 7/8 to 98 7/8 and IBM rose 7/8 to 63 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the day's big winners was North American Mortgage, which rocketed 3 
to 30 5/8. The firm hired Morgan Stanley & Co. to help it consider options to 
increase shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
 * Viacom shares continued to climb. The entertainment giant's stock has been 
gaining recently as investors re-evaluate its near-term prospects. Viacom Class 
B shares rose 1 to 35 3/8. The stock traded as low as 21 3/4 in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City shares succumbed to profit taking after their 
recent surge. The Bolsa index sank 39.04 points to 2,603.93. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended up 114.13 points at 20,635.83. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX average eased 0.09 point to 2,184.67. London's FTSE-100 
index added 4.4 points to 3,171.9. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. commodity trading, speculators bailed out of the coffee market Monday, 
sending prices to five-week lows as the threat of further damaging frosts in 
the world's biggest producing nation, Brazil, receded. 
</P>
<P>
 September coffee futures plunged 24.15 cents to $1.78 a pound, the lowest 
since the day following the first of two Brazilian frosts. 
</P>
<P>
 In precious metals trading, gold futures for August eased 60 cents to $376.70.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND PRICES, HIGHER DOLLAR BOOST STOCKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese yen and gained on other 
major currencies Monday as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates spurred 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks recovered Monday from last week's rout as investors put inflation fears 
aside and focused on bond prices and the stronger dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's gains came just ahead of this week's $40 billion in U.S. Treasury 
bond auctions, the first of which is scheduled for today. Traders said some of 
the dollar's improvement might have been related to the auctions, with foreign 
accounts purchasing dollars in order to invest in the securities. But in 
general, there was a sense that American securities were gaining in favor among 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant influence on the dollar was speculation about whether the Federal 
Reserve Board will raise the cost of credit again soon, foreign exchange 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of another interest rate increase heightened Friday when the government 
reported unexpectedly robust growth in employment and wages. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Fed's policy-making panel meeting next week, a perception is 
spreading that July's employment report could induce the Federal Open Market 
Committee to nudge rates up for the fifth time this year. Rising rates would 
enhance returns on dollar-denominated assets and thereby tend to boost demand 
for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of New York trading, the dollar changed hands at 101.52 Japanese 
yen, compared to 100.25 yen Friday. It was the dollar's highest level against 
the yen since its 101.90-yen exchange rate in New York on June 20. The U.S. 
currency finished at 1.583 German marks, up from 1.581 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, prices of most Treasury securities barely budged in the 
absence of any important economic data, as investors awaited this week's 
government auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the main 30-year Treasury bond closed unchanged, with its yield 
holding at 7.54%. 
</P>
<P>
 Uneasiness lingering from Friday, when July's employment report incited a rout 
in the bond market, left investors reluctant to buy or sell heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasury maturities ranged from unchanged to 1/32 point 
lower, and intermediate-term Treasuries fell by up to 1/8 point, according to 
the financial information service Telerate Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.79 points to 3,753.81. 
It was the first time the popular blue chip indicator closed higher in four 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's jobs report also caused a broad selloff in the Dow, sending it down 
nearly 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors put inflation fears to the side Monday, deciding that the jobs 
data, though strong, was not as bad as they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Market participants also took comfort in the bond market's steadying. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 217.68 million shares, down from 230.28 
million Friday. In the broader market, advancing issues led decliners by about 
6 to 5 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico was the most active on the NYSE, slipping 1/4 to 62 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * North American Mortgage rose 3 to 30 5/8. The company said it hired Morgan 
Stanley & Co. to help it consider options to increase shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nordstrom rose 1 5/16 on the Nasdaq to 43 9/16. Wertheim Schroder raised its 
second-quarter earnings estimate for the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mesa Airlines fell 3 7/16 to 6 9/16 on the Nasdaq. Traders said news late 
Friday that the airline had lowered a forecast of future earnings caused the 
selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buyers purchased Lowes Cos., a building supplies distributor that said sales 
in the first week of August rose 38% compared to a year ago. Lowes shares ended 
1 1/2 higher at 32 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors also concentrated on economically sensitive issues. Shares of the 
Big Three auto makers were active: Ford Motor rose 3/8 to 30 1/8, General 
Motors rose 1/8 to 50 3/8 and Chrysler was up 3/8 to 46 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks were mixed, with Mexico's Bolsa index closing down 39.04 
points at 2,603.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share average ended up 114.13 points at 20,635.83. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average closed 0.09 point lower at 2,184.67, 
while London's Financial Times 100-share average ended up 4.4 points at 
3,171.9.

 Berkeley Firm Signs AIDS Test Deal: Calypte Biomedical, developer of a urine 
test used to detect the virus that causes AIDS, has signed a distribution deal 
with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. that gives the Japanese firm exclusive rights to 
market the test throughout Asia. Calypte, a research and development firm, 
valued the deal with Japan's fourth-largest drug company at more than $50 
million. The disease is spreading rapidly in Asia, and the World Health 
Organization estimates that the number of HIV-positive individuals in Asia 
could quadruple to 10 million by 2000.

 T-Bills Hit 4-Week High: The Treasury sold $12.4 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 4.43%, up from 4.35% last week.Another 
$12.5 billion of new six-month bills sold at an average discount rate of 4.93%, 
up from 4.75%. The three-month-bill rate was the highest since they sold for 
4.50% on July 11. The six-month bill rate was the highest since they averaged 
4.94% the same day. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors: 4.54% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,888, 
and 5.13% for a six-month bill selling for $9,750.80. The discount rate 
reflects the price discount received when government securities are purchased 
at less than face value.

Elsewhere, AMC Entertainment Inc., one of the largest motion picture exhibitors 
in the United States, announced first-quarter profit of $1.6 million on $128.5 
million in sales, compared to a year-earlier profit of $3.1 million on $135.9 
million in sales. The company attributed the decline in first-quarter revenue 
to "weaker film product which resulted in lower attendance levels."

has pretty much gained the financing commitments. In a brief interview, he 
confirmed that a deal is close but that several loose ends are still being tied 
up by lawyers working on the project. Medavoy said he is getting enthusiastic 
response to his plans. He began working with former Carolco executive Peter 
Hoffman and former Columbia/TriStar International executive Arnold Messer 
shortly after he left TriStar in the wake of a falling out with the brass at 
TriSar parent Sony Pictures. JAMES BATES

BIKER MIKE'S FASHION EYE HELPS TURN AROUND A SMALL TOWN; ENTREPRENEUR: SHOP 
OPENED BY THUG-TURNED- CHRISTIAN DRAWS PEOPLE FROM A HUNDRED-MILE RADIUS FOR 
ALL-BLACK MOTORCYCLE ATTIRE.

 When Mike Grieshaber opened his store in January, some of the first visitors 
were police officers with questions. They wanted to know what this burly, 
bearded, longhaired, earringed, tattooed biker and ex-gang member was up to in 
their city, population 1,900. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd probably been open a week and I'd met every one of the police officers," 
Grieshaber said with a gravelly laugh. " 'Just come over here to check you 
out.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But as soon as they saw my Christian Motorcyclist Assn. banners hanging on 
the wall, it was 'Oh, Christian Motorcyclists!' . . . They were all for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Mike Grieshaber -- former thug, prosperous businessman and ebullient 
evangelist. Only a few years removed from his days as a Harley-riding 
roughneck, Grieshaber has cleaned up his act, put away his guns and knives, 
sworn off booze and drugs and rejoined the mainstream society he once scorned. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Carol, own Biker Mike's, a leather clothing and accessories 
shop catering to motorcycle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieshaber, 42, has become a respected member of the business community in 
this former lead-mining boom town on U.S. 60 in southwest Missouri, which 
produced bullets for the Civil War through World War II before the mines closed 
around 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikers and non-bikers from a hundred-mile radius head to Granby for jackets, 
vests, hats, gloves and other all-black attire sold at a discount at Biker 
Mike's. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a new floral shop and a bookstore, Grieshaber's business is 
credited with breathing life into the downtown district, which fell into 
decline after the mines shut. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been real good for Granby," said Mike Chesnut, president of Community 
Bank & Trust. "He's doing a great business over there. It's exciting to see 
someone who's had a rough life and is trying to make a new start." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unlikely turnabout for a man who spent seven violent years as a member 
of the Straight Satans, a California biker gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had, oh, half a dozen times I should have been dead," Grieshaber said as 
he sat in the shade on a bench outside his store. A silver crucifix earring 
dangled from his left ear, and a small gold cross was pinned to the center of 
his black leather cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overdosed on drugs, shot, stabbed, run over by a semi-truck once and was in 
the hospital for 14 months with virtually every bone in my body broken," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieshaber was born in Neosho, Mo., and attended high school in Miami, Okla. 
He said he was born into a solid, religious family, but the movie "Hells Angels 
on Wheels" changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was just rebellious," Grieshaber said. "I had motorcycles in my 
blood. Then I saw that movie, and boy, that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 After two restless years at an Oklahoma Bible college, it was off to 
California to join a gang. He said he ran cocaine, methamphetamine and 
marijuana between Bakersfield and Fresno, using as well as distributing. He 
said he also robbed and stole to support his drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting run over by that truck in 1978 was a blessing in disguise. As he spent 
months recovering, he realized he had to quit the gang or end up dead or in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 About five years ago, he came home to Missouri to straighten out. One day he 
stumbled onto the Christian Motorcyclists Assn.'s booth at a motorcycle show. 
The group counts 43,000 members in about 400 U.S. chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw their banner, and it was like a light went on," he said. "This is what 
I was put on this Earth for, this is why I've gone through all this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Grieshaber is road captain of the association's 25-member Neosho chapter. He 
packs a Bible as he travels to motorcycle rallies nationwide, preaching about 
Jesus to the same tough crowd he once ran with. 
</P>
<P>
 He also speaks to youth groups and at churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like if I tell people, I plant the seed: 'Hey, I was there, I got away 
from it, I'm lucky to be alive, I follow Jesus now, he's the guiding light in 
my life and look at me, I'm fine,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieshaber was working at a Neosho nursing home when he met Carol, a nurse. 
She persuaded him to turn his interest in leather clothing into a full-time 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieshaber leases a storefront for $100 a month. Business is booming because 
of low prices and word-of-mouth advertising. For example, he sells for $108 
American-made cowhide leather jackets that normally retail at $275, and 
Grieshaber said he still makes a decent profit. 
</P>
<P>
 He proudly mailed off a $500 state sales tax payment recently and hopes to do 
$100,000 in sales his first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone far beyond my expectations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most customers aren't bikers but just like the clothing, Carol Grieshaber 
said. Even the police chief plunked down $250 for a jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieshaber has helped raise money for a new ballpark and donated merchandise 
for local fund-raisers. He's also helped collect money and gifts for charities 
like the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to do just as much good as I can because I took and took and took 
for so many years, and it's time for me to give back," he said.

PERSONAL COMPUTERS TO CHANGE INSIDE -- AND OUT; TECHNOLOGY: IN THE NEXT TWO 
YEARS, THE PC WILL GET SMARTER, EASIER TO USE AND BETTER LOOKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN RAMSTAD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago this summer, there was a big change in the personal computer. It 
got cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was it. Despite the computer industry's reputation for ultra-swift 
change, there's been little besides the normal technological development. 
</P>
<P>
 The next two years hold more promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The main circuitry and software of a PC will get more extras. The industry 
will make big strides toward making a PC and its accessories connect as simply 
as a stereo amplifier and speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the hunger to satisfy consumers will spur other improvements, even if 
they're as simple as pop-in color accent panels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PC in two years will not be that significantly different than it is 
today," said Dan Schwartz, publisher of Home PC magazine. "But companies will 
work on small ways to make the computer user-friendly." The Main Stuff 
</P>
<P>
 The core of better PCs remains the relentless march of chip, or 
microprocessor, technology. The number of circuits jammed on a chip has doubled 
every 18 months for 30 years. Next year, Intel Corp. will keep up that pace 
with its next-generation microprocessor, code-named P6. 
</P>
<P>
 PC buyers will also have more choices for a computer's core "brain" chip. The 
Alpha chip of Digital Equipment Corp. and the PowerPC chip of IBM, Apple 
Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc. will be hitting the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the chip that powered PCs costing between $1,000 and $2,000, 
the price which most consumers are willing to pay, was Intel's 386. Such 
machines had 2 megabytes of memory and could store 40 megabytes of data on hard 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that money buys a machine with a more sophisticated 486 chip and 8 
megabytes of main memory and a hard drive of up to 500 megabytes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1996, it will buy a machine based on a Pentium, P6 or a second-generation 
PowerPC chip with 32 megabytes of main memory and a hard drive exceeding 1,000 
megabytes. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical modem will move data at 28,800 bits per second, up from 9,600 today, 
and 17-inch monitors will be increasingly common. 
</P>
<P>
 Older chips and components may end up as part of appliances like washing 
machines or blenders or something new. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can envision these personal products that people haven't defined yet," 
said Paul Breedlove, systems engineering manager in the PC division of Texas 
Instruments Inc. DSP Power 
</P>
<P>
 Another chip, called a digital signal processor, is also growing in 
importance. DSPs are responsible for functions like processing sounds, driving 
modems and making hard drives spin. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, DSP makers agreed on a standard to allow software 
designers to write programs without regard for the design peculiarities of the 
chips. That means the functions of modems, sound cards and other accessories 
can move together and some day may make it onto a computer's main circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see some DSPs on 'motherboards,' " said Dale Walsh, vice president for 
advanced development of U.S. Robotics Inc., a modem manufacturer. "I would 
envision for awhile it will be multiple function plug-in boards, modems that 
embrace a lot of other functions like voice and video." Bigger Programs 
</P>
<P>
 The basic software that runs a PC is also taking on more of the features that 
have required consumers to make extra software purchases. For instance, IBM's 
OS-2 has spreadsheet, planner and database software built in. And the update of 
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows due next spring will have electronic mail and screen 
savers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As people become more educated about software and hardware, the things that 
are standard change and improve," said Brad Chase, general manager of personal 
operating systems at Microsoft. "Several years ago, when you bought a word 
processor, you bought a separate spelling checker. Now every word processor has 
a spelling checker." 
</P>
<P>
 The update to Windows is particularly significant because it is the base 
program most used by PC owners and hasn't been changed since 1991. Its impact 
on the masses may not be felt for at least a year and maybe more, depending on 
glitches in the new product. Plug and Play 
</P>
<P>
 As the PC becomes much more of a "solid state" device, like a toaster or 
stereo, manufacturers are working out standards so accessories can just plug in 
without the hassle of programming new specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a portable computer, using infrared sensors like those of a TV 
remote control, will automatically configure itself to work with a similarly 
equipped printer wherever a person takes it. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, these so-called "plug and play" or "play at will" efforts will 
be far enough along to eliminate much of the extra programming a person must 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a general rule, our goal is to make it as easy to use as it is to toast 
your bagel," Microsoft's Chase said. "In two years, you will see very 
significant progress toward that." More Choices 
</P>
<P>
 PCs will be sold in more places. More software will come from CD-ROM 
catalogues and modem-accessed networks. Better speakers have started coming 
from stereo designers and monitors will approach the vaunted level of 
high-definition TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The PCs themselves will have more colors and shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, IBM has made black instead of beige the standard color for its 
portable ThinkPads and created matching monitors and keyboards. Kidboard Inc. 
of Edina, Minn., has created a keyboard in the shape of a smiling face for 
children, and Packard Bell Inc. is selling desktop PCs with removable 
earth-toned accent panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Home PC's Schwartz learned how much attention people pay to appearance, when 
he found none of his friends were taking his advice about what PC to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: "They said it looked clunky."

FIXATIONS: A HARD-TO-LABEL LIFESTYLE; GORDON MCCLELLAND'S CAREER AS ARTIST, 
COLLECTOR IS STEEPED IN ORANGE COUNTRY LORE

 Is this a postcard-quality vision or what?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '60s, a teen spends the afternoon surfing by the Huntington Beach 
Pier. Later, waiting for his mom to pick him up in front of the Golden Bear 
nightclub on PCH, a car pulls up and two men he recognizes as massively 
legendary grizzled bluesmen John Lee Hooker and Jimmy Reed get out. They find 
the club door locked, so the two bluesmen stand on the sidewalk shooting the 
breeze with the wet suit-clad surfer in the glow of the late afternoon sun.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It might be hard to recall amid the present-day hail of bullets and bills, but 
scenes such as that are our legacy, the sort of everyday serendipity that set 
Southern California apart. Here are two more distinctly SoCal vignettes: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old kid goes to a rock club, interested in seeing the light show, 
which was then the new psychedelic rage at concerts. He's disappointed to find 
the light show guy hadn't shown up that night, but gets the inspiration to tell 
the club owner he has a light show and can fill in. He runs home, gets his 
family's slide projector and somehow bluffs and improvises his way into a job. 
When the club owner's poster artist winds up in jail, the kid also tells the 
owner, "Sure, I do posters," and spends the next couple of years doing light 
shows and posters for shows by the likes of Chicago and the Mothers of 
Invention.  
</P>
<P>
 A 12-year-old boy gets a work permit to pick and pack oranges in the orchards 
near his Villa Park home. He falls in love with the labels used on the old 
fruit boxes, paintings depicting California in an idealized Maxfield Parrish 
glow, an agrarian utopia with mission-style buildings, rosy-cheeked beauties 
and lots of fruit rolling around. He begins collecting the labels, which no one 
else seems interested in. Three decades later, he's making an enviable living 
as the foremost expert and dealer in the now-hot collectibles.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The kid in all these instances was Gordon McClelland. If the title Mr. 
California wasn't associated with a muscle pageant, but, rather, was awarded 
for lifestyle and attitude, McClelland would get my vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 43, he still surfs three or four days a week, and would surf more days if 
the waves were better. He lives with his wife and 12-year-old son on the 
outskirts of San Clemente, and commutes in the early afternoon to the Santa Ana 
business complex where the publisher of his several books on fruit labels and 
California artists has given him space to work on his projects. McClelland's 
wet suit was drying on the business' door handle when we spoke there last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the walls inside are decorated with some of McClelland's 14,000 
different fruit box labels -- one wall devoted to oranges, another lemons and 
one apples -- while strewn about elsewhere are surf-related paintings, boxes of 
old maps and travel brochures, concert posters, surfboards, record albums, and 
a '60s vintage pinball machine titled Surf Champ. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearded, tan and wearing shorts and a knit sport shirt, McClelland noted, "The 
link basically between anything I do is that it all relates to California 
history or culture. That, and I've noticed that just about everything I've ever 
done has been something I was involved with before I was 13 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 McClelland was exposed early on to the work of California artists because his 
mother had taken painting lessons from some of the same painters he later wrote 
about in his book on watercolor artists, "The California Style, 1925-1955" (he 
collaborates with other authors on most of his titles). He had been into 
surfing and music since he was a kid, and he traces his interest in fruit 
labels to the "Dobie Gillis" TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started for me with an interest in signs. There was an episode of 'Dobie 
Gillis' where they showed where Maynard G. Krebs lived. I thought beatniks were 
the coolest thing in the world, so I was paying attention. And when they showed 
his place, the walls were covered with signs. I went right across the street, 
took a Sunkist Growers sign and put it up on my bedroom wall," he recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 When he got his work permit at 12 and began working in the groves and at the 
Olive Heights packing house in Orange, he fell in love with the labels and 
started collecting them.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a curious notion, isn't it, an Orange County with actual orange trees 
growing in it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a particular kind of character, the way we lived then," said 
McClelland. "It was a real nice mixture of agriculture and suburban living, not 
really a rural agrarian place anymore, sort of in the middle. We lived right 
next to a big stand of eucalyptus trees and there were orange groves right 
behind my bedroom. It always smelled good and we could go out and play in 
there, build treehouses, run wild. And there would be the old-style bums, 
hobos, hanging out camping in the groves. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By his late teens he was collecting the fruit box labels on a major scale. The 
fruit industry had largely shifted in 1955 to using cardboard packaging instead 
of wood crates, and most had been keeping their labels in storage. Hence, 
McClelland would sometimes turn up thousands of uncirculated labels that the 
packers were only too glad to be rid of. Other than enjoying them, McClelland 
says he had no particular plan for what to to with the labels he was amassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many in the late '60s seemed to think that the styles of the day had 
sprung without precedent from their psychedelicized minds, McClelland said his 
1920s fruit labels were a source of inspiration for him when he began doing 
concert posters for the White Room club in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been trying to figure how to effectively combine words with images, and 
realized that's exactly what the fruit labels were," he said, pointing out 
similarities between the innocent labels and his posters advertising Alice 
Cooper and local '60s heavyweights the Stack. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he and friends took piles of the posters for upcoming shows out to 
distribute at a pop music festival in Palm Springs. When asked if that wasn't 
the pop fest that had turned into a riot, McClelland winced. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents had heard there was going to be all this trouble, and told me, 
'Oh, you don't want to go out there.' So, that, of course, was right where we 
went. It was all windy there and my friends had the idea, 'We'll just throw the 
posters up into the wind and let them blow into the crowd.' So we did that. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I come home. We're sitting there the next morning, the news comes on, and 
they're going, 'These dirty hippies caused big trouble here in Palm Springs, 
and they littered the ground,' and the camera comes right in on the poster 
lying there, and my mom goes, 'That's your poster! Oh my God! Is your name on 
that poster?!' She was afraid the police were going to come and arrest me." 
</P>
<P>
 At his peak of presenting light shows, McClelland was running 14 slide 
projectors, three overhead projectors, strobes and a 16-millimeter movie 
projector used to screen old Harold Lloyd and W.C. Fields flicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the strobe lights that came close to causing riots. It was something 
people either really liked or really hated. If you got it set at a certain 
frequency and left it on long enough people would lose perspective and would be 
bumping into each other and nobody could really see what was going on. It was 
like a weird hallucination. I can't think it was very good for you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with having his old posters from the White Room shows and other 
concerts, the club's owner John Gardell also works in the office with 
McClelland, as sales rep for the book publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
 McClelland met Gardell (who had promoted "surfer stomps" and other shows in 
O.C. for years) in 1967 when he was 15, and credits him with being a 
significant influence on his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started working when I was 12 because my father had always done farming and 
carpentry so his perception of the way things work was 'you get a job,' so he 
always encouraged me to get a job. Then I met John and he encouraged me not to 
get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 While McClelland held sign-painting jobs and did the college grindstone bit 
for a while, instead of the 9-to-5 life he opted to work for himself, see the 
world and enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've always liked about this area -- and when I traveled I found 
people elsewhere also responded to this thing about California -- is all the 
activity here of people taking chances and starting up unusual, weird 
businesses and seeing if they can make it happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have a business plan in mind when he started gathering his fruit 
labels, and is still surprised he's been able to support himself for decades 
with it.  
</P>
<P>
 When the collectibles market sprang up in the 1970s, he'd suddenly found he 
could support himself by working just one day a month selling fruit labels and 
other old items at the Rose Bowl swap meet. That left the rest of the month 
free, he said, to go "picking." Rather than picking fruit, that's a term 
dealers use to describe their forays through thrift stores and other locales 
for old wares.  
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s he also connected with a German collector who would annually fly 
McClelland to Europe to sell him fruit labels. He'd travel there for four to 
six months, "Then I'd come home with 10 cents in my pocket, but with a roll of 
European posters I could sell here to get back on my feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Since marrying, he's led a somewhat more stable existence, aided by the rise 
in popularity of the fruit labels. There are some labels, ones made in the late 
1800s, that can command from $2,000 to $3,000. There are, however, hundreds of 
old labels which can still be purchased for a few dollars, while thousands of 
others sell from $50 to $500. With one of the world's largest stockpiles of 
labels, he says he's actually worked to keep prices down, so it will be a fun 
hobby instead of a speculator's market. 
</P>
<P>
 He's co-authored several books on the labels, with a new one, "An Illustrated 
Price Guide to Citrus Labels" in the finishing stages.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing he's attracted to in the labels is the innocent, idyllic quality 
expressed by many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they reflect a time when people had different sensibilities, when 
they could pull off ads like this and have them accepted at face value. If you 
were creating images like this in 1972 or today, it would be considered tongue 
in cheek, naive. People weren't hep at the time these labels were made, and I 
like people who are not necessarily hep. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing they make me think about now. But when I was a kid I'd just 
look at them and say, 'I like these.' I just flat-out responded to them. I 
didn't think about why I liked them. It was a completely non-intellectual 
thing. And these days still, when somebody brings in a label to trade that I've 
never seen before, I totally respond in the same way I did when I was little 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He insists that his feeling for the art isn't one of longing for another time. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always seem to think that I wish I lived back in 1920 or something. 
I'm so happy I live now. I have no desire to be in any other time. To me this 
isn't a way of living in the past; it's a way of enjoying what I'm doing now. I 
enjoy my life more now knowing all this went before and how the people who did 
it thought." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a decided lack of Angst in the fruit label art; instead most of the 
pieces speak of abundance, grace and ease. And, true to the form, McClelland 
isn't giving himself a coronary writing about them or dealing in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he's got rich off his childhood interest, he opines he perhaps could 
have if he'd worked himself into a frazzle. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't slave at this, and we don't live real lavishly. I work just hard 
enough for everything to work and then quit. It depresses me to I see people 
who have over-committed themselves, and are now not living a very pleasant life 
because they are not willing to let go of a particular lifestyle they thought 
was important and all of a sudden have their identity tied up in.  
</P>
<P>
 "And, you know, why not just forget about the whole thing, just sell the 
stinking thing, the house or whatever it is that's dragging you down? I always 
told my wife the worst thing that could happen was that I've have to move back 
into my van and live on the beach all the time. That'd be real bad, huh?"

 Hot Weather Brings Out Bacteria 
</P>
<P>
 Hot, sticky weather inspires the back-yard chef to barbecue some killer 
hamburgers. Literally. Salmonella and E. coli revel in uncooked meat and hot 
weather.  
</P>
<P>
 Avoid a bacteria buffet by placing a meat thermometer in the thickest part of 
the meat. Temperature should reach 145 degrees to 160 degrees for roast and 170 
degrees to 180 degrees for poultry. Hamburger should not be pink in the middle. 
You must brown ground meat all the way through. Also, parboiled or microwaved 
food must go right to the grill and not sit at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooked food or food that needs to be refrigerated prior to cooking should not 
be stored at room temperature any longer than two hours; one hour on broiling 
days. Marinate food in the icebox and do not reuse marinade that held raw meat. 
Prostate Shyness Kills 
</P>
<P>
 By Christmas, more than 38,000 men will die because they are too embarrassed 
to be tested for prostate cancer. In this year alone, more than 200,000 men 
will be found to have the disease.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of men shy away from the quick, painless exam. The American Cancer 
Society's California division is attempting to diminish discomfiture with "Real 
Men Do It." In a prostate cancer public service campaign, former heavyweight 
boxing champ George Foreman, San Francisco 49ers coach George Siefert and 
Golden State Warriors coach Don Nelson say they get annual prostate checkups. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACS urges men older than 40 to have a yearly digital rectal exam; starting 
at 50, a prostate-specific antigen blood test. Nine out of 10 men can be 
treated successfully with early detection. Calcium Intakes Fall Short 
</P>
<P>
 A snack of five cups of broccoli and one cup of milk adds up to 600 milligrams 
of calcium. But that healthy intake falls way short of the National Institute 
of Health's recommended 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams daily. Most Americans manage 
half that amount at best.  
</P>
<P>
 Calcium supplements are an option. Just don't knock back a handful all at 
once. The body prefers to tackle 500 milligrams at a time. Brand names or 
chewables are absorbable. Many filler-infested generics do not dissolve in the 
intestine. One dose should be taken at night when the body can cut the level of 
parathyroid hormone, which breaks down bone. Even if you prep your tummy with 
food, note that some substances such as phytates, in beans, and oxalates, in 
spinach, interfere with calcium absorption by the intestine. Don't overdo. 
Dosages higher than 2,000 milligrams could bring on kidney stones, which is a 
high price for calcium overkill. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Finnish researchers find that mothers who transfer saliva, via shared spoon 
and kisses, to their infants before teething help build up the children's 
antibodies to bacteria that initiate cavities . . . American Cancer Society's 
Look Good, Feel Good program ((800) 395-LOOK) teaches female cancer patients 
undergoing chemotherapy and radiation how to restore appearance and self-image 
. . . Artificial eyes are being made out of coral because it's porous and can 
form a bond with tissues of the eye socket.

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; TRYING ON THOSE HIGH FASHION IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love to leaf through a high fashion magazine, looking at those creations 
that are far beyond my reach. I visualize myself standing in the doorway of 
some pristine resort, arm up to the archway, a slim shadow cast behind. It's 
the second best feeling in the world, not having slipped to depths of 
self-indulgence, and then having those feelings of guilt and remorse, for 
whipping myself into a frenzy of shopping for a little number that looks good 
only when worn by someone who has not eaten more than a stalk of celery in a 
lifetime.

FITNESS: BODY WATCH; HIKERS, HO! HITTING THE TRAIL FOR YOUR HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burned-out runners, yoga students and gym rats are all catching on. "Take a 
hike" is sound advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking is on the upswing, says a spokeswoman for the American Hiking Society 
in Washington, D.C. About 41 million Americans are day hikers, she says, while 
13 million are longer-range backpackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking at a stop-and-smell-the-flowers pace won't make people muscle-bound, 
but it will yield health benefits such as reduction of the risk of certain 
conditions, including heart disease. Pick up the pace and you'll tone muscles, 
particularly those in the legs and buttocks. With a little imagination, hikers 
can even work out their neglected upper body muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 One caveat: Although hiking seems low-risk and laid-back, a recent survey 
found that 80% of hikers experienced ailments or injury. The good news is that 
most problems are preventable with a modicum of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping Out: A growing number of health clubs are offering members "hiking 
field trips" -- especially in the summer, when indoor workouts can get boring. 
Mark Stevens, an exercise physiologist who owns the Gym in Brentwood, regularly 
leads hikes into Temescal Canyon in Pacific Palisades, taking 40 or more 
members at a time on the 3.6-mile loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Freirich, a Santa Monica businessman, has launched Personal Challenge, 
a hiking program in the Santa Monica Mountains. He supplies water, hiking 
instruction and gourmet, low-fat lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the Trend: The surge in hiking reflects the move toward "mind-body" 
fitness, says Timothy J. Moore, an exercise physiologist at the National 
Hospital for Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Arlington, Va. "There's been a 
big surge recently in outdoor cross training, such as hiking and mountain 
biking," he says. Getting outdoors helps people relieve stress and rediscover 
the beauty of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoga and hiking seem especially compatible. Of 75 yoga students surveyed, 
about 90% mentioned hiking as their other favored athletic activity, says Jake 
Jacobson, owner of the Center for Yoga in Pasadena and Larchmont Village. "Both 
activities are non-competitive and you can 'go inward,' " Jacobson notes. "Yoga 
movements help offset the tightening of muscles associated with hiking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Benefits: "Hiking offers a great way to develop body awareness and 
balance," Moore says. Because of inclines often involved, a hike "can be more 
of a strength-training activity than walking." 
</P>
<P>
 Regular hikers can expect to develop stronger muscles, especially the 
quadriceps, hamstring and calf muscles, Stevens says. "The steeper the angle, 
the better the workout for the buttocks," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because hiking is often a start-stop activity, leisurely paced hiking won't 
yield the same fitness benefits as more intense, continuous exercise such as 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 But hiking provides significant health benefits and burns calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking can burn about 200 calories an hour at a leisurely pace, and much more 
depending on terrain, speed, body size and other factors. Add a 10- or 15-pound 
backpack and the calorie burn increases by about 15%, according to the American 
Hiking Society. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bugaboos: Muscle strains and sprains, cuts, poison ivy, blisters and diarrhea 
are among the hiker's top complaints, found Dr. Byron J. Crouse, a Duluth, 
Minn., physician who surveyed 180 backpackers who completed the 2,100-mile 
Appalachian Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Most problems are preventable with minimal planning, adds Crouse, who heads 
the department of family medicine at the University of Minnesota-Duluth. 
"Almost everyone, for instance, admitted to drinking non-purified water," he 
says, explaining the diarrhea complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 Comfort Factors: 
</P>
<P>
 * "First-timers should choose a shoe with good ankle support," Stevens says, 
"because when hiking downhill, there is pressure on the ankle." 
</P>
<P>
 * Break in new boots or shoes by wearing them around the house for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dress in layers to be prepared for any weather on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carry and drink plenty of water -- aim to take in about 8 to 16 ounces an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * After a hike, especially in grassy or woody areas, check your body for ticks 
and other critters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More in Step: Once hiking is a habit, incorporating exercises for the upper 
body is simple, says Gin Miller, an Atlanta fitness expert and consultant for 
Step Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say you're on a five-mile hike. Carry a towel or a rubber tube along," she 
suggests. "Stop every mile or so and do some upper body work. For instance, a 
supine chin-up: lie down with your chin up. Reach up, find a branch below chest 
level. If the branch is too high, wrap a towel around it." Or do triceps dips. 
With hands behind the body and feet out in front, use a tree stump as a brace, 
she suggests. Dip up and down to work the triceps muscles on the back of the 
upper arms.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WHEN BIG PROBLEMS HIT FAMILIES -- HEY, THAT'S JUST LIFE; 
OPAL ON DRY GROUND BY SANDRA SCOFIELD ; VILLARD $20, 279 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Read Sandra Scofield's latest novel, "Opal on Dry Ground," for its own merits 
-- for a hardscrabble beauty, which, like the beauty of west Texas where the 
story is set, isn't always obvious and takes some patience to appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, to better understand what Scofield has done, try this: Once you finish 
reading, imagine what Joyce Carol Oates would have done with the same material. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russell Duffy's four-bedroom house in Lubbock live Russell, an oil-pipeline 
worker with a penchant for taking off to Africa for months at a time, and his 
new wife, Opal, a health-care worker in her late 50s who is getting fat and 
suffers from heart trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving in with them are Opal's daughters, Clancy and Joy. Each, like their 
mother, has two divorces on her resume. Clancy, chronically depressed, suspects 
that her husbands left out of boredom. Reckless Joy picked mean, controlling 
husbands who beat her. Neither has enough education to get a high-paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy's teen-age daughter, Heather, is torn between her warring parents, lonely 
at school, sullen at home. She is drawn to a fellow outcast, a mixed-race girl 
named Jamaica, and to guys who drink beer, smoke pot and ride Harleys. As for 
the older women in her family, Heather "doesn't see how you can live whole 
lives as bad as theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Opal's mother, Greta, recently died during a flood. Her children's woes, plus 
the question of how much she should commit to Russell -- who is kind and 
reliable but a little obtuse -- distract Opal from her own emotional needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been more important to be a mother than a wife," she muses in 
Scofield's rapid prose. "When Greta was alive, it was more important to be a 
daughter." But what now? 
</P>
<P>
 Other people pass in and out of the house: Russell's senile father and distant 
children, Opal's former mother-in-law, Clancy's and Joy's new boyfriends. The 
boyfriends seem OK, but both are auditioning for the Male Savior role that 
neither woman even wants to believe in anymore. Finally, there's the baby 
Clancy insists on bearing out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough? With a list of dysfunctions this long, Oates would have no trouble 
surrounding this family with her trademark aura of alienation and menace. 
Scofield, however, clearly chooses not to do so -- and when we recall her 
previous work, especially the American Book Award-winning "Beyond Deserving," 
we see that this has always been her choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Human problems, Scofield seems to say, are simply that: problems. They don't 
necessarily mask even worse problems. Nor can they always, or even often, be 
solved. Problems are life, not just occasions for therapy. If things happen to 
get better, that's life, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Scofield is explicit about this. Clancy wishes a doctor would give 
her antidepressants without having "ideas about treating the whole person." 
Opal thinks: "Clancy's husbands seemed to be challenged by her sad demeanor; 
they didn't realize it wasn't something she could toss off like a discarded 
blouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, Opal reflects, "knows that in the construction of your life's plot, 
you narrow the options with age and error, and he wants to make the best of 
what he's got. Maybe he's right. Maybe what you've got is out of your control; 
all you can affect is who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, though, any messages are implicit in the action. What's new about 
this novel isn't so much its theme but Scofield's growing assurance. She knows 
more clearly than before what she wants to say, and she says it with a terse 
and graceful economy. 
</P>
<P>
 As in "Beyond Deserving," Scofield sees into the minds of both old and young. 
Crowded scenes flow by as naturally as if she had turned on a video camera. 
Emotions well up without sentimentality; the dialogue is authentic and funny 
without a trace of stock Texas "color." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end -- well, life goes on, and no more than that. Scofield, much like 
Susan Straight, refuses to give us melodrama. Opal and her daughters ride off 
into the future, which could be sad or happy in any conceivable mixture. The 
novel gambles that this very uncertainty will bring a catch to our throats; 
because we care enough about the characters, it does.

THE WEEK AHEAD: LONDONDERRY; MARCHING IN ULSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Security forces in Northern Ireland are braced this week for marches by both 
Roman Catholic Republicans and Protestant Unionists. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Republicans will commemorate with parades in several cities the 23rd 
anniversary of the introduction of internment -- imprisonment without trial -- 
in British-ruled Northern Ireland, a practice the London authorities have since 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Protestants will hold an Orange Parade to mark the military 
victories of William of Orange -- later King William III -- in Londonderry, 
marking the beginning of the "marching season" when tempers run high among the 
Protestants and Roman Catholics of Northern Ireland.

Luiz Nascimento, a 52-year-old former police officer, now a Rio de Janeiro city 
administrator. Folks where he works call him Jorge Mamao (George Papaya). 
</P>
<P>
 How Dourado became Waldo and Nascimento was dubbed Papaya are long stories, 
but the short of it in Brazil is that almost everyone, from the president to 
the doorman, is addressed informally, either by the first name or a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of the Brazilian culture, explains anthropologist Everardo Rocha. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just a much more informal society, and that is particularly true when 
it comes to how we call each other," he says. Like all Brazilian professors, 
Rocha is called by his first name by his students, despite his doctoral degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public people like politicians try to keep contact and intimacy with the 
people who vote for them," the professor says. "Sometimes, if a politician is 
very important, people will call him by his whole name and also by his initial 
or by a nickname that is given to him as a tenderness." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans got a taste of the Brazilian peculiarity during the World Cup. While 
other players wore their last names on their jerseys, Brazil's team trotted on 
the field with nicknames and first names applied to theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Dunga, for instance, whose moniker means Dopey, one of Snow White's 
seven dwarfs. And Branco, a key scorer as the Brazilian team moved to victory 
in Pasadena last month. His nickname means Whitey. Some of the players were 
known by diminutives: Bebeto for Roberto and Jorginho, or Little George. And 
Muller, for which there seems no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably nowhere is the relaxed, informal manner in which Brazilians address 
each other more apparent than the way they refer to their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, newspapers and television newscasts refer to the president, many 
Cabinet members and legislators by their first names. Others are routinely 
quoted using their nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of like picking up a U.S. newspaper to read "Bill Considers Military 
Invasion of Haiti" or "Dick Negotiates Settlement to Los Angeles Bus Strike." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for the field of 10 candidates vying this year for president. 
One is Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the nation's former finance minister and 
architect of the country's new economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody calls him Cardoso," Rocha says. "He's Fernando Henrique." 
</P>
<P>
 Or he's just FHC in headlines and photo captions. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging Cardoso is a former factory worker and labor leader named Luis 
Inacio da Silva. But nobody calls him Luis or Inacio or Da Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's Lula to everybody," says political scientist Venicio de Lima. Lula is a 
boyhood nickname that has been Da Silva's moniker throughout his professional 
and personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is new in Brazilian politics. The man sworn in as the country's 
president in 1985, following two decades of military rule, was Jose Sarney, 
except that isn't really his name, even though heads of state, historians and 
his current colleagues in the Senate still refer to him as Sarney. 
</P>
<P>
 "His real name is Jose Ribamar," says the author Dourado, alias Waldo, who has 
written a number of books on Brazil's culture. "His father's name was Ney. He 
worked for a British streetcar company. As a sort of a joke, a manager there 
used to call his father 'Sir Ney' and people in the area picked it up, except 
'sir' became 'sar.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sarney is not alone. Take Congressman Chico Vigilante. The Chico is easy, a 
common nickname for Francisco. But Vigilante? 
</P>
<P>
 "His last name means watchman, but that's not his real name," says political 
scientist David Fleischer, a professor at the University of Brasilia. "He took 
that name when he was running for office because he used to be head of the 
watchman and bank guard union in Brasilia. Nobody around here even knows his 
real name." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's former Congressman Pinga Fogo from Parana. Nobody knows his real 
name either. His moniker is one he adopted during his radio days when he hosted 
a popular show that recounted crime stories in gruesome, crusading detail. It 
means "Dropping fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilians without a nickname are almost invariably known chiefly by their 
first name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like in the United States where if you ask someone their name, they 
give you their complete name," says Rocha, the anthropologist. "Here, we say 
our first name and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, many are the Brazilians who know their neighbors, co-workers, 
friends -- and even their lovers -- only by their first name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the last names of most of my friends," says Silvana da Silva, a 
domestic. "People never say, and you just don't ask." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Brazil, the family name is not so important," says Jorge Antonio Barros, a 
hulking assistant city editor at the Jornal do Brasil known around the newsroom 
as Jorginho. 
</P>
<P>
 "For emotional reasons, we give more value to people's first names. Even if 
people have a formal relationship, rather than call someone Mr. Barros, you'd 
call him Mr. Jorge." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilians so identify people by their first names that legislators are listed 
alphabetically by first name in the federal directory and the U.S. Consulate 
keeps two telephone directories, one alphabetized by last name and the other by 
first name. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha conjectures that the more casual approach to names is partly a 
reflection of a Brazilian sense of cordiality and informality, one derived from 
the merging of the country's Portuguese, African and Native Brazilian 
heritages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Portuguese (colonialists and slave owners) were very formal," he says. 
"But the way the Portuguese had to deal with the Indians and Africans made them 
less formal. Now it's absolutely incorporated into the Brazilian way of calling 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say that Brazil is simply so overrun with a few common names like Da 
Silva, Dos Santos and Nascimento that people are looking for an identifiable 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have Brazilian friends, they are called by their most unusual name," 
says De Lima, the political scientist. "If they are Jose and they have a German 
middle name and a Portuguese last name, they almost assuredly will be called by 
their German middle name." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody, however, seems to know for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Damata, a top anthropologist, ponders the question and then says: 
"It's an interesting part of our culture that I've often wondered about. But to 
tell you the truth, I don't have the slightest idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The preponderance of identification by first name or nickname does have its 
drawbacks, as candidate Da Silva discovered in a 1989 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Election laws required that ballots list candidates' legal names only. Because 
he was known almost exclusively in the press and among his supporters as Lula, 
he would surely lose a sizable chunk of his support because voters simply 
wouldn't recognize him by his last name. So he had Lula, which means squid, 
added to his official name. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, when the head of the country's tax service decided to go after 
the incomes of many of the nation's highly paid soccer players, he ran into a 
similar problem. Nobody in his office knew the players' real or complete names. 
</P>
<P>
 In one small city in northeastern Brazil, the local bank has created a town 
directory correlating people's nicknames to their first names so it can keep 
track of checks either signed by or written to nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the odder twists of the language, one version of the Volkswagen 
Beetle, still in production here and officially called a Fusca, is known 
affectionately as a Fusca Fafa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Volkswagen changed the car's style by adding large, round, 
protruding taillights. Brazilians quickly dubbed the new version the Fusca Fafa 
de Belem, shortening it later to Fusca Fafa. It seems the size and shape of the 
lights reminded many of the ample proportions of Fafa de Belem, a popular 
singer and sort of the Dolly Parton of Brazil. Thus, Fusca Fafa. 
</P>
<P>
 The term is so common now, says taxi driver Erison Aguiar, that "if you go to 
the auto parts store and ask for taillights for a Fusca, they will ask you, 
'Regular or Fusca Fafa?' "

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; EUROPEAN UNITY IS LOSING VIGOR; THE DREAM SURVIVES BUT THE 
TIMETABLE SLOWS.

<P>
 Fabienne de Kimpe is part of the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 As a counselor at one of 200 information centers scattered across the European 
Union's 12 member countries, she advises business people on how to get around 
in the union's vast new single market, which became a reality early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In her modern, ground-floor office, under a poster of a hang glider soaring 
effortlessly through a sunlit sky over the word Europe, De Kimpe helps her 
clients come to grips with an array of difficulties, ranging from tax questions 
and union standards to finding partners in the outer reaches of their expanded 
business world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time for the awareness of these new horizons to develop, but it's 
coming," she said. "What's lacking now is a single currency. Only then will we 
have a really unified market." 
</P>
<P>
 While the idea of a single European currency makes sense to De Kimpe and 
leaders of the EU states who nearly three years ago agreed to form a monetary 
union by the end of the century, there is no longer any certainty that it will 
be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lofty goals -- including the full economic and political union that the 
12 leaders also set down at their historic December, 1991, summit at 
Maastricht, the Netherlands -- have grown fuzzy and uncertain, while talk of a 
confident, centralized union by the end of the century has all but ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying reason for all this is not hard to find: Europe's leaders have 
quite simply lost their way. After they defied skeptics by meeting a 
self-imposed 1992 deadline for creating a single market without tariffs, and 
after they committed themselves in 1991 to political and economic unification 
by the end of the century, their drive toward greater European unity has 
faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe that, for the union to regain its direction and its confidence, 
it must successfully deal with two major challenges: combatting unemployment 
and bridging Europe's former East-West divide by reaching out to the 
Continent's new, post-Communist democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get either of these wrong, we're all in deep trouble," said Stanley 
Crossick, chairman of the Belmont European Policy Center, a Brussels-based 
think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the achievements so far have been considerable. The union's 
member nations constitute the world's largest and richest consumer market. 
Goods, capital and people move more freely than ever on a continent that twice 
in this century has been racked by nationalistic wars. 
</P>
<P>
 This new freedom has been a major factor in the prosperity that today 
separates the EU West from the tumbled communism in the East. As the fathers of 
European unity predicted a generation ago, this economic interdependence has 
virtually eliminated the possibility of armed conflict among member states. 
Much Uncertainty  
</P>
<P>
 But uncertainty clouds the way forward. Among senior policy-makers, debates 
rage on issues such as whether the union must reform and strengthen its 
creaking institutions before it can even consider the task of expanding its 
membership across the old East-West divide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a new, distinctly nationalist government has taken over in Italy; 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the first time has begun complaining openly 
about his country's high contributions to the EU treasury, and Britain's 
increasingly beleaguered Prime Minister John Major views attacks on Brussels as 
one of the few ways he can score political points at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes for a monetary union, which seemed to perish amid last year's European 
monetary crisis, have once again begun to rise, but that goal too remains 
elusive. Western Europe's deepest, most prolonged recession since World War II 
has only added to a sense of disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four decades since their idea first began to take root, the promoters 
of European unity have survived several troughs of doubt during previous 
economic downturns. But what makes this crisis unique and more worrisome is 
that this time the recession is a sideshow.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, it is impotence in the face of troubling new problems that really gnaws 
at Europe's confidence and saps its will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apathy, confusion and frustration have settled like mildew over the 
Continent," commented Werner Weidenfeld, a respected Mainz University political 
scientist, in an article last month in the German daily Die Welt. "What, as an 
idea, lifted the fantasies of generations, is, as a real political system of a 
united Europe, becoming the focus of whiny accusations." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Andre Sapir, head of the Brussels-based Institute of European Studies, 
"People have gotten a bit lost on what Europe is about." 
</P>
<P>
 For the new democracies of Central Europe, whose 1989 anti-Communist 
revolutions were in large part driven by a yearning to become part of Western 
Europe's rich, free-market democratic experience, the EU's loss of direction is 
especially disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, one of the great prizes of their success has shrunk.  
</P>
<P>
 For the United States too, the EU's present malaise is critically important. 
</P>
<P>
 For amid all that has transpired since the end of World War II, the union is 
the only institution that offers the Continent a real chance to achieve a new 
level of political unity and thus escape a past littered with wars of national 
aggression -- wars that in this century alone have cost the lives of more than 
60 million Europeans and nearly a third of a million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, beyond the visible crises -- the war in the former Yugoslav 
federation, simmering instability and ethnic conflict in the East, political 
corruption in the West -- it is the less obvious struggle between advocates of 
deeper European unity and the forces of nationalism that is likely to have a 
far greater bearing on Europe's fate in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent events -- including a series of direct challenges by member countries 
to the EU Commission's authority, and last month's choice of Luxembourg Premier 
Jacques Santer, a weak, uninspiring figure, to succeed the dynamic Frenchman 
Jacques Delors as EU Commission president -- are indicators that the flow is 
running against greater integration. 
</P>
<P>
 June's lowest-ever voter turnout for a European Parliament election, and the 
fact that the campaigns were dominated by local issues rather than the grand 
ideas of the future shape of Europe, underscored a broad public apathy on the 
fundamental questions of "Why Europe?" and "What kind of Europe?" 
</P>
<P>
 And as electorates have turned inward, demanding action on jobs, crime, 
corruption and immigration, uncertain decision-makers retreat with them. The 
Jobless Problem  
</P>
<P>
 While unemployment would seem to be linked directly to the recession, in 
Europe it is not. As Germany and the region's other major economies show signs 
of resuming modest growth, there is little expectation that the problem will go 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The high cost of doing business in Western Europe, mainly due to liberal 
social benefits and universal medical care, is driving investment out of the 
region. At the same time, legal protection for employee job security 
discourages employers from any quick additions to their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of the problem sits on Sapir's desk: The laptop computer was made 
in Japan and purchased in the United States at half the Brussels list price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Europe's central problem is the welfare state," former French Foreign 
Minister Jean Francois-Poncet told a symposium in Prague, the Czech Republic, 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But in societies riven with age-old divisions yet so close that it is possible 
to drive through four countries in less than a day, state benefits are 
considered an essential ingredient for social peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the United States, and it is not Japan," Sapir insisted. "Without 
this social contract, we wouldn't have had the peace and prosperity we've 
enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
 While a growing number of economists like Sapir now acknowledge that Europe 
needs what he terms "a better balance between worker incentive and protection," 
politicians -- already unpopular as a class -- view any large cut in benefits 
as potential political suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The second challenge -- how to embrace the new democracies to the East -- is 
equally problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 While EU leaders know their union can survive only by erasing the old 
East-West divide and eventually accepting the former Soviet satellite states as 
members, the price is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 By one estimate, it would cost $70 billion annually just to extend the union's 
agricultural subsidies and regional assistance programs to the four most 
advanced Eastern countries: Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 How, officials ask, can the EU afford to integrate nations whose average per 
capita incomes vary between one-sixth (Romania) and one-half (Hungary) that of 
Portugal, the poorest member? 
</P>
<P>
 Such a transfer of payments could seriously undermine Western stability, 
senior officials maintain. While nations like Germany, Denmark and Britain see 
potential political and economic benefits in moving east, France and the poorer 
southern countries see new Eastern members as competitors in the battle for aid 
to depressed regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, pointing to the potential for political instability in the 
East, ask how the EU can afford not to take in these countries. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, little has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 Association agreements have been signed and trade liberalized, but strict 
limits on prime Eastern exports -- including textiles, steel and farm products 
-- have prevented any economic windfall for the new Eastern democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some Eastern leaders chafe at EU's promptings to improve wages and 
labor standards. "To force us to accept these externally imposed standards 
means to push us out of work," an angry Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
warned earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a blueprint for addressing these issues has diminished the union's 
standing and accentuated its impotence in dealing with other problems. The 
result has been a decline in public approval. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Europe' is perilously close to becoming a term of abuse throughout the 
European Union," commented the Economist last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the avalanche of problems that has descended since the 
Maastricht Treaty was signed has caught the union at an exceptionally 
vulnerable time. The treaty's sweeping call for economic, monetary and 
political union was a hasty reaction to the series of unexpected events that 
ended with German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
 For both French President Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Kohl, the 
treaty was nothing less than a guarantee that Germany would never again pursue 
its interests in isolation. But the political and economic commitments ran far 
ahead of public acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the treaty was poorly prepared by a leadership distracted by the 
mushrooming war in the former Yugoslav federation only exacerbated the problem. 
Many view the June, 1992, Danish rejection of the treaty as a watershed. Even 
though the Danes endorsed the treaty last year in a second referendum, the 
effect of the initial rejection lingered. 
</P>
<P>
 One survey earlier this year showed 60% of European voters either undecided or 
against the treaty, and today even Delors himself believes it was a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't have concluded a treaty on political union," he said recently. 
"It was too soon." Pushing Forward  
</P>
<P>
 But despite these problems, the collective will is to push forward. Most of 
the public still believes the union is "a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders also need little reminding that the overriding reason behind 
the union's existence remains as valid today as it did 30 years ago: reining in 
an oversized Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need an organized Europe to escape German domination," former French 
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Austrians gave a boost to advocates of greater integration when they 
voted by an unexpectedly large majority to join the union Jan 1. "Yes" votes in 
similar referendums planned for Sweden, Finland and Norway this year would do 
much to recapture lost momentum. Favorable votes would bring the three 
Scandinavian countries and Austria into a union that already includes Belgium, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Spain and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Many predict that the decisive battles will come in 1996, when member states 
convene to review the terms of the Maastricht Treaty. Advocates of a tighter 
European unity, known as "integrationists," will oppose "intergovernmentalists" 
-- those who see the future more in the form of cooperation between national 
governments.  
</P>
<P>
 With as many as 16 of the Continent's richest, most powerful countries 
discussing issues such as common foreign and security policies and the role of 
national parliaments in unionwide subjects, the conference will amount to a de 
facto European constitutional convention. 
</P>
<P>
 With national leaderships generally weak and insecure, some analysts believe 
that whichever side manages to better mobilize public opinion is likely to win 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think leaders will go much beyond what they perceive public opinion 
to be," said Crossick of the Belmont European Policy Center, a professed 
integrationist. "The real test is whether the integrationists can master the 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all to play for." Faltering Support 
</P>
<P>
 A poll among citizens of EU countries has shown a wavering of support for 
European Union membership in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: 56%

<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrive in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Saturday 
for a nine-day visit to Canada. The queen, Canada's head of state, will spend 
three days in Halifax, then fly on to Victoria, British Columbia, where she 
will officially open the Commonwealth Games. 
</P>
<P>
 She is scheduled to watch some events, including swimming and gymnastics, and 
participate in a round of building and garden dedications and dinners with 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Prince Philip is scheduled to tour the 
Khutzeymateen Valley in northern British Columbia. Philip, president of World 
Wildlife Fund International, has called for conservation of the valley, a home 
to grizzly bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the itinerary: a brief visit to Yellowknife, in the Northwest 
Territories, before the royals depart on Aug. 21.

THE WEEK AHEAD: WASHINGTON; A FIRST FOR ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time since his former Soviet republic gained its independence, 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan will visit the United States, starting with a 
meeting with President Clinton at the White House today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton invited Ter-Petrosyan, according to an Administration official, to 
"congratulate him on the cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh," the disputed Armenian 
enclave in Azerbaijan, and to discuss U.S. aid programs.In addition to his 
talks with Clinton, the Armenian president is scheduled to visit the Pentagon 
and talk with officials of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Before returning to Armenia, Ter-Petrosyan plans to visit Detroit, Boston and 
Los Angeles. Armenia declared its independence from Moscow in September, 1991, 
and became an independent state three months later when the U.S.S.R. disbanded.

 Twenty-five years after the original concert was held on Max Yasgur's farm, 
Woodstock '94 takes place near Saugerties, N.Y., in the Hudson Valley for three 
days beginning Friday.Promoters hope the event will be not only a reunion but 
attract the sons and daughters of the Woodstock generation. More than 30 bands 
plus a six-acre, interactive multimedia "Surreal Field," aimed, according to 
Danny Socolof, its architect, at "the first postgraduates of Nintendo 
University." Promoters also hope the rain and mud that marked the original

NEXT STEP; CLEANING UP ARAFAT'S IMAGE; THE PALESTINIAN LEADER HOPES THAT USING 
THE JOBLESS TO COLLECT GAZA'S GARBAGE WILL SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS -- AND PROVE HE 
CAN HELP THE REGION.

 Clinging to a low ridge overlooking the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean, 
this squalid refugee camp, a warren of cinder-block and corrugated tin, 
embodies two of Yasser Arafat's most pressing problems as he tries to prove 
that Palestinians can govern themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach Camp -- and much of the rest of the Gaza Strip -- is choked with 
unemployed men and uncollected garbage. As many as 60,000 people are believed 
to be crammed into the camp, and for decades they have been throwing their 
garbage over the ridge into the sea, or into a field just outside the camp that 
has become a vast, fetid dump bisected by the coastal road. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Israeli troops have pulled out of Gaza, residents are free for the 
first time to walk along the seashore at any hour, a privilege the army had 
denied them for security reasons. But it takes hardy beach-goers to pick their 
way through the garbage and around the hulks of abandoned cars that lie 
half-submerged in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the Palestinian Authority, Arafat is hoping he can produce a badly 
needed success for his infant bureaucracy by employing several thousand idle 
workers to clean up Beach Camp and other communities scattered across one of 
the filthiest places on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Arafat signed an agreement with Japan and the United Nations for 
financing to start the cleanup campaign. The Palestinians hope to employ 17,000 
people for nine months, at a cost of $19 million, to clear away tons of garbage 
in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian plan also calls for laying down a rudimentary infrastructure 
for the permanent collection and disposal of garbage. Gaza now has no 
functioning garbage trucks. There is no designated dump site; instead, people 
simply pitch garbage into any relatively open space or burn it in the street. 
Most of Gaza's inadequate supply of garbage cans were destroyed during the 
intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shebab (young men) used the garbage cans for roadblocks," explained Samir 
Ghosheh, the Palestinians' minister of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese government donated $5 million to get the project going. Arafat's 
wife, Suha Tawil, trooped out to the beach last week with a group of volunteers 
to launch a parallel citizens effort to tidy up. Tawil said she and her 
volunteers would be on the beach every day for two weeks, hoping to inspire a 
sense of communal pride in their surroundings among Gazans, who can find little 
else to take pride in beyond the presence of Palestinian police and flags on 
roads once patrolled by Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to make Gaza look beautiful and to generate employment," said 
Mohammed Shtayyeh, deputy director of the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR). "Our people have very high 
expectations of us. We want to show that we can produce. Otherwise, in a few 
months, the people will say we were much better off under occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shtayyeh acknowledged that the cleanup is hampered by the shortage of 
funds that plagues most of the authority's efforts to make self-government 
work. "We have promises of several million more in donations, but they have yet 
to materialize," Shtayyeh said. "We are hoping. Right now, we either can hire a 
quarter of the workers we need, or work for a quarter of the time we need." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign also suffers from the infighting that has troubled the 
Palestinians since former Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla leaders 
-- now filling posts as government ministers -- began arriving in the 
territories from Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. In 
many cases, the ministers of Arafat's Cabinet have assumed posts that West Bank 
and Gaza residents believe the newcomers are unsuited to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghosheh, the labor minister, has been in the territories for just two weeks. 
He shuttles between Jericho and Gaza, guarded by rifle-carrying bodyguards who 
were once PLO fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghosheh conceded during an interview in his Gaza office that he is largely 
unfamiliar with the cleanup project, even though it offers the best hope of 
immediate, if temporary, employment for large numbers of Gazans. And he said 
that he disagrees with the idea of providing only short-term jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that we should be concentrating on long-term employment," Ghosheh 
said. "This is PECDAR's plan. I worry that the people will complain in three 
months, when the money runs out. The opposition will accuse us of having done 
this just for show."  
</P>
<P>
 But on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Shtayyeh, one of the economic council 
officials who designed the cleanup project, argued that the Palestinian 
Authority's most pressing concern is how to immediately provide jobs for 
Palestinians. Unemployment in Gaza, home to about 850,000 people, is estimated 
to be as high as 70%. The situation was recently exacerbated when Israel 
drastically reduced the permits it grants to laborers to cross into Israel for 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before March, there were 166,000 laborers working in Israel," Shtayyeh said. 
"That number has been cut to 55,000. Only 28,000 are allowed in from Gaza." The 
Israelis say the cutbacks were due to security concerns, and they continue to 
talk with the Palestinians about increasing the permits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent meeting with Israeli peace activists -- and in an interview with 
the Israeli daily Haaretz, Arafat warned that there will be more riots like one 
at Erez Checkpoint on July 17 -- when frustrated laborers trying to get into 
Israel attacked Palestinian and Israeli police -- if the economic situation in 
Gaza does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in despair," Arafat told Haaretz. "The moment of truth has arrived, and 
alarm bells are ringing. I am finding it harder and harder to go on in this 
situation, and the explosion is liable to come. Every day we are treated to a 
new dose of humiliation, and each is worse than the last."  
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has been living in Gaza just since July 1, and he has been unable so 
far to generate jobs. In fact, Arafat has produced few visible improvements. 
New office furniture, computers and a plethora of secretaries, tea servers and 
bodyguards have appeared in the offices of the new ruling authority. But little 
progress has been made toward rejuvenating either Gaza or Jericho, the other 
territory that came under Palestinian rule with the historic peace accord 
between Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the Palestinian Authority is pinning such hopes on the cleanup 
campaign, Shtayyeh said. He predicted that workers will be hired and sent into 
the streets and fields of Gaza before the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is with us on the telephone nearly every day," Shtayyeh said. "He's 
very keen to let the people feel that the Palestinian Authority is the 
authority working for the benefit of the people."

CULTURE; DRIVE-IN THEM WILD!; THE CAR CULTURE HAS FINALLY SKIDDED INTO POLAND. 
AUTO SALES ARE UP, AND THE FIRST OUTDOOR MOVIE THEATER JUST OPENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The screen is so small that an announcer has to read the subtitles over a 
microphone. The projection booth is so bulky that it blocks the best views. And 
the location is so poorly marked that it is easy to miss entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 The first drive-in movie theater in Poland is primitive -- it doubles as the 
site of a swap meet for used cars by day -- but its debut last month represents 
a cultural milestone in this country's phenomenal rush to the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 people, behind the wheels of cars ranging from luxury Mercedes 
sedans to matchbox-sized Fiats, filed into the asphalt grounds for opening 
night in this dusty Warsaw suburb, better known for its bleak high-rises than 
its cutting-edge culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was so large that the snack bar was swept clean of bubble gum, 
candy and potato chips before the film even began rolling. Carside hostesses 
served complimentary Coca-Cola, but the soft drinks also dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had more money, I would like to start a drive-in myself," said Andrzej 
Jarosz, an awe-struck taxi driver who watched the debut movie -- "Four Weddings 
and a Funeral" -- from the same sheepskin-covered seat where he had worked for 
the previous 14 hours. "This would be a great business." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a remarkable scene -- repeated many nights since -- in a country where 
Communist authorities long restricted the availability of automobiles, 
compelling some Poles to make payments for a decade before obtaining one. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the early 1980s, the number of cars in Poland has tripled, and a new 
market has developed for luxury West European, Japanese and American models, 
particularly among young, entrepreneurial Poles who have adjusted well to 
capitalism. The car culture, and the drive-in movie, have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, most of our customers, about 70%, would buy a car for pleasure, 
to drive on the weekend," said Longin Bielak, a former race car driver who owns 
a Peugeot dealership in Warsaw. "Now 70% buy it because they need it for 
business. A car in Poland has become essential for many people." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks also to changes in the post-Communist banking system, many ordinary 
Poles who previously could not afford a car now have the option of buying one 
on credit. Almost half of Bielak's customers finance their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Only top-of-the-line makes, such as Mercedes, are still purchased on a 
cash-only basis. "Poles now want their cars to indicate what they are like, say 
something about them," said Tadeusz Zakrzewski, head of marketing for Mercedes 
in Poland. "Our buyers want to accentuate their prestige to others." 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are 6.7 million cars in this land of 40 million -- a modest tally 
when compared with West European nations but the most in any former Communist 
country of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish explosion has caught authorities off guard, with few highways 
designed for the increased traffic and parking in big cities relegated to 
sidewalks, median strips and front yards. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, police are struggling with a huge increase in car thefts. 
German models are the most popular but no automobile -- not even the lowly 
Polish-made Polonez -- is beyond being stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars are immediately transported to Russia and other countries to the 
east, and there is no way of tracing them," said Bielak, who is also vice 
president of a large automobile club in Warsaw. "Every owner of a Mercedes 
knows his car will be stolen -- the question is when." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth in car ownership has been so dramatic that dozens of new service 
stations are being built along well-traveled routes, and American fast-food 
restaurants have plans to open drive-thru windows. International Fast Food 
Polska, which operates Burger King in Poland, expects to open as many as four 
drive-thru restaurants this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Grindrod, the company's president, said the restaurants will be modified 
to make the drive-thru operation less intimidating for Poles who are 
unaccustomed to conducting commerce through a car window. Food orders will be 
given directly to employees, not via a speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a transition going on here toward the automobile as we think of it 
in the United States, not as they did in the former Soviet Bloc," Grindrod 
said. "Drive-thru locations are a natural part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dariusz Zawislak, a 22-year-old theater hand who came up with the drive-in 
theater idea, is equally sold on the concept. In fact, he is so convinced of 
his compatriots' new passion for the automobile that he staked his own vehicle 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Zawislak sold his 1988 Ford to pay his share of the drive-in's start-up costs, 
about $10,000. The rest of the expenses are being covered by his partners, a 
transport company that owns the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times have changed, and Poles have fallen in love with their cars," Zawislak 
said. "People my age especially like new cars, expensive cars and fast cars." 
</P>
<P>
 If the drive-in succeeds, Zawislak figures he will be able to buy a much nicer 
car -- and maybe even open another theater. If the venture flops, he will be 
stuck borrowing his parents' car, a cramped and run-down Fiat 126P, the 
smallest and cheapest car in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drive-in theater is more of a social event than just watching a film," 
said Zawislak, who ran unsuccessfully in last month's City Council election, 
pledging to reverse Bialoleka's reputation as a cultural desert. "People will 
treat it as a novelty at first, but hopefully they will like it and keep coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Poles know virtually nothing about drive-in theaters (including their decline 
in the United States), but they are well aware of one thing: their reputation 
as a popular hangout for young lovers. Eager to perpetuate that image, Zawislak 
and his business partners accepted a donation of 7,000 condoms from a Warsaw 
safe-sex foundation. The prophylactics are being distributed with tickets -- 
which run about $1.50 each -- at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The gag gift brought the expected chuckle from Dariusz Robak, who drives a red 
sports car, wears a gold necklace and owns a lucrative freight company. Robak, 
25, arrived at the theater in his Toyota Supra with his sparingly clad 
16-year-old girlfriend and her cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have outgrown doing it in the car," Robak joked as he examined the 
small packet. "Besides, it is only the first show. It is too early to be giving 
these out." 
</P>
<P>
 Zawislak is counting on people like Robak to make the drive-in a success. 
Robak has visited the theater twice, even though he confesses he wasn't 
particularly interested in either movie. "I like the idea, and I like cars," 
Robak said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the movie began to flicker on the screen opening night, Zawislak took to 
the microphone to thank Poland's first drive-in audience for supporting his 
dream. The excited moviegoers responded by honking their horns and flashing 
their headlights.

MARKET SCENE; ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS . . .; WHISTLE FOR ENGLAND'S J. HUDSON & CO., 
TOP MAKER OF THE SPORTS MODELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before the World Cup playoffs in America this summer, two senior 
soccer referees stopped by a quaint Edwardian factory in an industrial area 
here in Britain's Second City. 
</P>
<P>
 England's Philip Don and Holland's Mario van der Ende were calling on the 
offices of J. Hudson & Co. to acquire a supply of new whistles -- and not just 
any kind of whistle. They wanted the prince of whistles, the Acme Thunderer. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Hudson is the world's premier manufacturer of sports whistles, fashioning 
different types for various sports -- football, basketball, hockey, swimming -- 
all of which need special sounds for varying acoustic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top referees like to pick their whistles personally," said J. Hudson 
Managing Director Simon Topman, a descendant of founder Joseph Hudson, who 
created the firm in 1870. "We pride ourselves that referees pick our whistles 
not because of sponsorships but because they are the best and most reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a really good soccer referee blows his whistle, he does it in such a way 
that the players know whether it's just a minor foul or a major one that gets 
the cautionary yellow card -- or the red one, you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Acme brand whistles are officially approved by about 200 sports bodies 
worldwide, covering 50 sports and recreational activities. Some refs carry a 
range of whistles to fit different venues, while others stick to their favorite 
model. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a different whistle for the Super Bowl before 100,000 people than on 
a wet Saturday in Blackpool," Topman explained. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Hudson also makes a wide range of other specialized whistles, nearly 5 
million a year sold in more than 100 countries: bird and game calls, boat 
warnings, dog whistles, life-jacket whistles, boatswain's pipes, musical 
whistles, personal-safety whistles, a survival model and the Scotland Yard 
police whistle, that tweeter made famous in Sherlock Holmes films. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Hudson, a toolmaker, started the firm to produce the Scotland Yard, or 
Metropolitan Police, model, figuring that if you built a better whistle, the 
world -- or at least whistle-blowers -- would beat a path to your door. 
</P>
<P>
 "The British police whistle was invented by our founder to replace police 
rattles current at the time," Topman said. "It is a two-tone pipe made of brass 
plated in nickel. It was first tested in Hampstead Heath, London, and it could 
be heard a mile and a half away. This naturally was before walkie-talkies or 
cellular phones, when the only way of communicating with colleagues over that 
distance was by whistle. It was an important invention that is still used 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in addition to police forces around the world, members of the British 
army and NATO military forces use similar cylindrical whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our only competition is from the Far East with their cheap plastic 
imitations," said Topman, 40, a chirpy bespectacled lawyer who joined the 
family company 12 years ago. "I get peeved because some makers of life jackets 
-- which are very good indeed -- will nevertheless use cheap whistles because 
they cost a few cents less, and which may never work in an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 Topman insists that Acme whistles have worked consistently since Hudson, after 
his success with the police whistle, invented the star of the line in 1885: the 
Acme Thunderer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was looking to broaden the line and noticed that referees at sporting 
events used all kinds of makeshift whistles with inconsistent sound (and) 
unreliable performance," Topman explained. "So he devised the standard-looking 
whistle, the Acme Thunderer, with a mouthpiece and barrel with a small ball of 
the finest-grain cork inside, (which) we call the pea.  
</P>
<P>
 "The pea inside the Thunderer interrupts the flow of air, producing a trilling 
effect, which can be modulated into a harsher or softer sound. So in the mouth 
of a top-class referee, it can be used like a musical instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Acme developed other styles and mouth shapes in metal and 
plastic to suit individual preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need different sounds from sport to sport," the whistle maker said. 
"Basketball with its enclosed, indoor court needs a higher-pitched whistle, so 
we provide a pea-less instrument called the Tornado. But in a big football 
stadium like the Super Bowl, you need a lower frequency, because while you have 
bigger crowds, they are farther away from the players. That's where our Acme 
Thunderer with the pea comes into its own." 
</P>
<P>
 The managing director himself is clearly a whistle buff, and in the factory 
showroom he readily trills away on bird whistles. "You might say I whistle 
while I work," he says, with an apologetic grin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the specialty top end of the line, along with other specialized whistles 
and boat sirens, that adds to the company's "handsome" profit, says Topman, 
because even the best Thunderers sell for less than $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to sell a lot of Thunderers and Tornadoes to make a real profit," 
says Topman, who employs a staff of 57. "As you might imagine, we are not crazy 
about golf, baseball, cricket and tennis. No whistles!"

PLACING BETS ON A SINGLE EUROPE CURRENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after it was pronounced all but dead, the European Monetary System has 
defied projections and embarked on a tentative but definite revival. 
</P>
<P>
 The revival has rekindled hope among advocates of closer European integration 
that a single currency could become a reality throughout the European Union -- 
if not by the end of the century, then in the early 2000s. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect was set out in the 1991 Maastricht Treaty, and its importance is 
rarely disputed. It is widely believed that the proposed European Monetary 
Union would not just simplify trade and other business activities but would 
quickly drive EU member countries into a true political union. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the political will is there to push forward with EMU, then you don't have 
to worry about anything else -- because EMU is the fastest way to derive 
political union," declared Stanley Crossick, chairman of the Belmont European 
Policy Center in Brussels. "Conversely, if EMU looks like (it's) falling apart, 
there will be serious political consequences."  
</P>
<P>
 It was in September, only a month after the EMS had escaped its deepest 
crisis, alive but seriously weakened, that British Prime Minister John Major 
said publicly what many others believed but dared not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope my fellow heads of government will resist the temptation to recite the 
mantra of full economic and political union as if nothing had changed," Major 
warned. "If they do recite it, it will have all the quaintness of a rain dance 
and about the same potency." 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to dispute Major's flip analysis of the prospects of the EMS. 
Over a few midsummer days, currency dealers had basically blown apart the 
system that lies at the heart of Europe's efforts to achieve greater unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Put simply, the dealers had bet billions -- and won -- on their conviction 
that the nine national currencies involved in the system's exchange rate 
mechanism could not stay within the narrow bands of fluctuation that tied them 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 To save the system itself, exhausted and defeated European Union finance 
ministers met in Brussels and surrendered to the markets, loosening the narrow 
bands from 2.25% (6% for Spain and Portugal) to a startling 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 The move eased speculative pressure, but it seemed to be the death knell for 
eventual monetary union. The architects of a single European currency had 
always envisioned that their goal would be reached by a gradual narrowing of 
fluctuations, then a freeze and the eventual imposition of a single currency. 
</P>
<P>
 This defeat -- followed by the 1992 departure of the Italian lira and the 
British pound from the exchange rate mechanism and the distinct cooling of 
Germany, the EU's biggest country, toward the idea -- seemed to spell the end 
of the single currency dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the lira and the pound (and the Greek drachma) remain outside the 
exchange rate mechanism, and German doubts on EMU persist, but an unexpected 
stability of the new, looser exchange rate mechanism has brightened prospects. 
Instead of trying to push for competitive advantage through fluctuations of 
near 15%, most central banks have kept the value of currencies in close contact 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real test is whether this commitment is strong enough to meet the 
tough fiscal criteria necessary to begin the final stage of a monetary union. 
As detailed in the Maastricht Treaty, these would require countries to cut 
budget deficits and reduce total debt. At present only Luxembourg would qualify 
as prepared for the final step. 
</P>
<P>
 However, advocates of European integration insist the necessary political will 
is there. 
</P>
<P>
 Brussels Bureau researcher Isabelle Maelcamp contributed to this article. 
Marking the Changes 
</P>
<P>
 British pound and Italian lira, which are outside the European Union 
exchange-rate mechanism, are fairly volatile compated with currencies within 
the mechanism.

 As one of this country's best-known poets and an unabashed revolutionary, 
Roque Dalton escaped many brushes with death. Right-wing Salvadoran 
dictatorships captured him time and again, but he always got away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the hands of his own leftist guerrilla comrades that Dalton's luck 
ran out. His murder nearly 20 years ago by men who would claim he was a spy 
became one of those hushed truths that form the lore surrounding El Salvador's 
long and brutal civil war. Everyone knew who killed Dalton, but it was a topic 
that shamed and divided the left and did not much interest the right. It was 
taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, with the war over and the past seemingly less threatening, is the 
Dalton case finally coming to a close. The ending is not pretty.  
</P>
<P>
 Guerrillas had assured the Dalton family that they would help recover the 
poet's body for a humane burial. The Daltons wanted to pay homage to their dead 
husband and father. But it was a lie: The family has now learned that the 
rebels who killed Dalton buried his body in such a shallow, makeshift grave 
that the remains were devoured by animals within days of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the cruelest irony for the family is that the body of the leftist 
author of "Clandestine Poems" and "Turn of the Offended" was deposited at El 
Playon, the notorious trash dump more commonly associated with right-wing death 
squads who used it to discard thousands of victims during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Salvador and throughout Central America, societies recovering from a 
lost decade of war and misery in the 1980s are struggling to come to terms with 
the past. The graves ofmassacre victims are being unearthed in Guatemala and 
Honduras; army officers are being tried in Panama for crimes that date back to 
the early 1980s, and even in tranquil Costa Rica investigators are probing 
unsolved terrorist bombings -- all in a quest to find justice, to clarify the 
fates of loved ones, or simply to learn who did what to whom. 
</P>
<P>
 For Salvadorans victimized by the left, and for the far greater number 
victimized by the right, both justice and satisfaction have been fleeting. 
Neither the right-wing government nor the military want to delve into the past, 
and many on the left would also prefer to move on.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dalton matter always posed a dilemma for leftist intellectuals in Latin 
America who wanted to express solidarity for their slain colleague but who did 
not want to jeopardize a larger cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution of the Dalton case is testimony to the determination of one 
family to find the whole truth, as unsettling as the answers may be, and it has 
forced leftist leaders to admit to past sins. 
</P>
<P>
 Killing Dalton "was a tremendous error," former guerrilla commander Joaquin 
Villalobos now concedes. Villalobos, probably the most famous of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels, was part of the "tribunal" that 
ordered Dalton's execution. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a part of the history of our organization that I would like to 
erase, it would be this," Villalobos said in an extraordinary interview with 
Dalton's son, Juan Jose, who is a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Roque Dalton was killed on May 10, 1975, four days before his 40th birthday. 
The son of a Salvadoran mother and an American father, he became a poet and 
then a communist. Even as he lived in exile or in hiding through the late 
1950s, the '60s and the beginning of the '70s, his writing earned international 
acclaim.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of his work was banned in El Salvador because of its leftist, 
anti-Establishment tone, and he was frequently arrested and condemned. 
According to the legend, Dalton twice eluded death sentences: In 1960, the 
right-wing government of Col. Jose Maria Lemus fell in a coup just days before 
he was to be executed; later, an earthquake split open his death-row cell and 
he fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his raucous sense of humor and a simple, conversational style of 
verse, Dalton spent years in Mexico, Cuba and Czechoslovakia and raised three 
sons. Finally in 1973 he returned to El Salvador secretly and joined the 
Revolutionary People's Army, one of five guerrilla armies that would eventually 
unite to form the FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained a bohemian, however, and his free spirit rankled the orthodox 
Marxist hard-liners with whom he had joined forces. They began to voice doubts 
about Dalton and his lack of discipline. It came to a head when Villalobos and 
other members of the rebel leadership ordered Dalton's arrest and 
court-martial, accusing him, remarkably, of spying for both the Cubans and the 
CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 After days of intense debate and as he pleaded tearfully for his life, Dalton 
was shot and killed, along with another rebel known as "Pancho." 
</P>
<P>
 The execution provoked a crisis for the guerrillas, and dissidents in the 
Revolutionary People's Army split away, forming a separate faction that 
nevertheless joined the FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Dalton's sons, despite the betrayal of their father, also fought 
alongside the guerrillas, although not with the Villalobos faction. Roque Jr. 
was killed in combat in 1981, and Juan Jose, the journalist, was wounded and 
captured the same year. His wounds prevented him from continuing to fight, and 
he lived in exile until returning to El Salvador in 1991, as the war began to 
wind down. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the younger Dalton had left the ranks of the FMLN and embarked on a 
mission to recover his father's body and force the truth into the light of day. 
The guerrillas, who had begun the process of disarming and re-integrating into 
civilian society, promised help, saying at one point that the remains were 
secure. But no remains were ever produced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalton family last year turned to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in El 
Salvador, which launched its own investigation. The United Nations found that, 
contrary to the assurances that the family had been given, the remains no 
longer existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton and Pancho had been buried barely 20 inches under the earth's surface, 
in a grave so shallow that their feet stuck out. Animals started the job of 
unearthing the bodies, which was finished when a judge and police summoned by 
townspeople picked up the two men's remains and tossed them into the 
trash-filled ravine of El Playon, the United Nations concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physical recuperation of the body of Roque Dalton is not possible," wrote 
Diego Garcia-Sayan, director, in a letter to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was stunned by the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard, knowing the truth," Juan Jose Dalton said. "But we have arrived 
at a point where the victimizers of my father have recognized publicly that 
they did it, and that they did it unjustly." 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos has not commented further on the case since information about the 
body was publicized. He has blamed the "historic error" on the group's 
political immaturity, and he admits the espionage allegations were concocted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalton case exposed serious flaws within El Salvador's left, issues that 
it continues to struggle with to this day. In many ways, family members say, 
Dalton was killed because of a lack of tolerance for dissent and critical 
analysis.

PHOTO ESSAY; WHERE THE POOR SEW UP A FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCINE ORR, For The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a labyrinth of alleys lined with open sewers, amid concrete huts topped 
with corrugated tin, among the desperately poor people of a slum called Golibar 
north of Bombay, India, a small miracle survives. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 people -- mostly women and recovered leprosy patients -- sew unique 
clothing and create small gifts for export to the United States. They do not 
labor for a local sweatshop or some distant foreign conglomerate. They work for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The "profits" from the clothing and gifts help provide modest incomes, home 
loans and adult education and finance a catalogue in which Indian artists and 
American customers compare notes on women's lives and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 For 14 years, a nonprofit group now known as SHARE (Support the Handicapped's 
Rehabilitation Effort), has provided employment, education and most important, 
dignity, to some of India's most downtrodden people. The education is crucial. 
Many women learn to write their names for the first time through a SHARE 
program overseen by Philomena Fernandes, social program director. 
</P>
<P>
 A social worker named Pushpika Freitas is the dreamer behind the program. She 
lives in Evanston, Ill., outside Chicago, where she is executive director of 
MarketPlace, the sales outlet for SHARE products. 
</P>
<P>
 But her childhood was spent in India, where her mother, a social-work 
volunteer, helped deliver medical services in the Bombay area. When a German 
organization asked Freitas to set up a center to help leprosy patients become 
economically independent, she realized that even healthy women could benefit 
from such help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized women were taking the burden, the responsibility of bringing up 
their families, but they had no control over their lives or the money they 
earned," she says. So, in 1980 she began the SHARE program. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the participants made patchwork quilts, but they soon realized there 
was more money to be made in garments. When visiting a friend in Chicago, 
Freitas brought samples of their work, showed them to other friends and the 
marketing network that became MarketPlace was born. It incorporated as a 
nonprofit group in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the women also make gifts such as hand-painted stationery, table covers 
and candle holders -- more than 3,000 items each year. The program can be 
contacted by writing: MarketPlace: Handwork of India, 1455 Ashland Ave., 
Evanston, Ill., 60201.

RECALLING PAST STRIKES; AS BUSINESSMAN, DECINCES SEES THE ISSUES FROM BOTH 
SIDES NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doug DeCinces is a spectator this time. The former Angel third baseman said 
all he knows about the impending baseball strike is what he reads in the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at that, it's hard for him not to take a personal interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, as always, is money and who gets it. DeCinces knows the drill well. 
He remembers playing hardball in 1981 -- not on the field, but in the 
boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
 That players' strike lasted 50 days and canceled 712 games. DeCinces was the 
American League players' representative then and was knee-deep in the 
negotiation process. So he looks back at that now, then looks ahead to Friday's 
strike date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free agency was destroying baseball," said DeCinces, who is now part-owner of 
DeCinces Properties, a development and property management company. "That's 
what they told us in 1981. There was doomsday all around. The rich teams were 
going to get richer and the poor teams were going to be out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not active in the negotiations now, so I can't say if there are 
similarities between then and now. I'll let others decide that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, DeCinces can't help but dabble a little from the sideline. He hears the 
word salary cap and it means one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems to me, they're trying to stop free agency," he said. " 'The salaries 
were ruining the game.' That's what it always seems to be about." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was the same through three work stoppages when DeCinces was a player 
-- the lockout in 1976 and the walkouts in 1981 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, he said, have never accepted free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981, the players were being paid too much money," DeCinces said. "The 
owners could afford it. It was the same thing in 1976. But no player has ever 
held a gun to an owner's head and said, 'If you don't pay me, I'm going to pull 
the trigger.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' failure to contribute to the players' pension fund two weeks ago 
was a clear signal to DeCinces that a strike is unavoidable. He said it was a 
sign that the owners wanted a walkout, as they did in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCinces spent five years as the league's player representative and another 
two as a consultant to the players' union. The players, he said, did everything 
to avoid a walkout in 1981, even to the point of having an independent study 
drawn up that analyzed the effect of free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, DeCinces said, they were forced into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked all through 1980 trying to discuss what were the No. 1 issues," 
DeCinces said. "It all ended up being non-productive. We had some great one-way 
conversations. They stalled and stalled and stalled. We went a good 18 months 
without signing an agreement. There was no other option, we had to go out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Grebey, chief negotiator for the owners in 1981, called it a 
million-dollar strike over a 10-cent issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, as DeCinces saw it, was worth a lot more. The owners, armed with a 
$50-million strike insurance policy, were testing the players' will and unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to break up the (players') association," DeCinces said. "I think 
the owners were legitimately upset at the situation and they felt they needed 
to do it. I don't think they felt the players would stand up for their rights. 
They found out we would." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 12, the players walked out. For DeCinces, it was the beginning of a 
two-month ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the strike shuttling between meetings in New York and Washington. He 
traveled the country, not playing ball, but playing messenger, keeping others 
up to date on the dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure didn't get any time off," DeCinces said. "I was in meetings or 
traveling 41 straight days. I kept saying, 'Let's talk about the issues.' But 
the issues were not to be discussed." 
</P>
<P>
 When the strike fund evaporated, the issues were settled. The players returned 
to work. The owners returned to paying high salaries to free agents. The fans, 
eventually, forgave both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone came back with his eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at it as a sport, but it is very much a business," DeCinces said. 
"The owners have their positions and the players have theirs. You just hope 
that the business side doesn't destroy the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what DeCinces fears might happen with another strike. But he does see 
some encouraging signs and one significant difference from 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners are directly involved with the negotiations," DeCinces said "They 
weren't in 1981 and that caused the lengthy delay. It turned out that one owner 
would be told one thing and another owner would be told something different." 
</P>
<P>
 And DeCinces, now the businessman, can see the issue from the other side as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners have to deal with the economic side, and that's important, too," 
he said. "Hopefully, there'll be some common ground before there are major 
problems."

WHILE HENLEY PLAYS, FOUR WAITING IN JAIL; JURISPRUDENCE: ATTORNEYS FOR OTHERS 
IN COCAINE CASE CLAIM RAM CORNERBACK GIVEN SPECIAL TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With cornerback Darryl Henley having rejoined the Rams, federal authorities 
and attorneys for other defendants in Henley's cocaine-trafficking case are 
miffed that he is resuming his career while others accused of lesser roles in 
the crimes remain in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client is not facing a minimum-mandatory 10-year sentence (as Henley is) 
and yet he's in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles," said Joan P. 
Freeman, a deputy federal public defender whose client is accused of extorting 
money from Henley and faces a maximum term of three to four years in prison. 
"I'm having some difficulty with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight defendants who have been charged in the combined cases of 
extortion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine, only Henley and two others -- 
one of them his uncle, Rex Henley -- were allowed to make bail when they were 
arraigned. Darryl Henley is accused of masterminding a drug ring that 
distributed large amounts of cocaine throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Donaho, a former Ram cheerleader who was named in a federal indictment 
as a courier for the drugs, was among those given an opportunity to make bail, 
but has since pleaded guilty and is expected to testify on behalf of the 
government against Henley and the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the accused -- James Timothy Saenz, charged in the Henley extortion 
attempt -- spent 10 months in federal prison. He was released last week when 
bail was finally set at$10,000. The four others must wait until Jan. 10 for 
their trials to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a real disparity in treatment in this case," said one defense 
attorney in the case who asked that his name not be used. "Darryl Henley is 
clearly a celebrity who has been in the limelight, and although nobody is 
saying it, his case has been handled differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorney defended his client's treatment in the case, saying he poses 
no risk to others and is not likely to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 However, federal prosecutors argued strenuously last December before U.S. 
Magistrate Ronald W. Rose that Henley should be kept in custody until his trial 
because he might disappear and is a danger to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted Henley, Donaho and 
three others as participants in a conspiracy to transfer two shipments of 
cocaine from Henley's home in Brea to drop-off points in Atlanta and Memphis, 
using the 20-year-old Donaho as a courier. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men, including one of those charged in the trafficking conspiracy, have 
also been charged with threatening Henley's life in an attempt to extort 
$360,000 they say Henley owed them for cocaine they delivered to him. All seven 
are scheduled to be tried together. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents began investigating Henley in July of 1993 after Donaho had 
paid cash for a one-way ticket from Ontario International Airport to Atlanta. 
Such a purchase is taken as an indication that a passenger might be carrying 
drugs, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 When she landed, agents allegedly discovered 26 pounds of cocaine in a bag she 
had checked. Donaho later said Henley had recruited her. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, Henley -- who was aware of the criminal investigation -- 
went to police to report an extortion attempt. Henley said he was threatened at 
gunpoint at the Rams' practice facility in Anaheim and that three men had 
stolen his car. One of the men who allegedly threatened him was found shot to 
death in West Covina a few hours after the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating Henley's extortion claims and arresting several suspects, 
authorities focused on his alleged involvement in the cocaine ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, after pleading innocent to the charges against him, Henley was 
released on $200,000 bail. Bail for his uncle, who was indicted last month as 
part of the cocaine trafficking conspiracy, was set at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the charges of disparate treatment for Darryl Henley, his 
attorney said the football player is an excellent candidate for release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about the prior records about anybody else, but Darryl 
Henley has never been in trouble in all his life," Roger Cossack said. "He has 
been active in charity work, and for the past 10 months has been terrific in 
terms of making court appearances and keeping in touch with pretrial services." 
</P>
<P>
 A condition of Darryl Henley's bail is that he not travel outside the Central 
District of California, which includes seven Southern California counties from 
San Luis Obispo to Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Cossack said he will ask for a modification of the bail conditions, allowing 
Henley to travel with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Asst. U.S. Atty. Deirdre Z. Eliot, one of two federal prosecutors handling the 
Henley case, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric E. Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Police Foundation in 
Washington, said: "What's unusual is that bail was set in an amount that was 
achievable. Generally, in a case (involving drug trafficking), there is a 
presumption that a person should be jailed. If an indictment alleges that 
(Henley) is the central figure in this conspiracy, the fact bail has been set 
that he can make is highly unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 One federal law enforcement official believes the others in the case who 
remain in prison have good reason to be unhappy, adding: "If I was one of the 
other defendants, I think I'd be pretty upset watching Darryl Henley play 
football on Sundays."

SUPERSTARS OF DEEP; WHALES IN SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL PUTTING ON A SHOW UNMATCHED 
IN NATURE FOR PURE MAJESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephanie Le Chat looks out over the bow of the 88-foot Condor and can hardly 
believe her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no beauty quite like that of the sea," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been quite a week for Le Chat, 29. She came from Europe to be married 
in Las Vegas, traveled to Arizona, where she met members of the Navajo tribe, 
and now finds herself surrounded by creatures both wild and wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 She, her husband, Patrick, and 50 others lining the rails of Capt. Fred 
Benko's boat have been watching Risso's dolphins shoot through the water like 
fluorescent torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been marveling at humpback whales bold enough to swim alongside the 
boat, keeping pace with the slow-moving vessel and popping up from time to time 
as if to sneak looks at the watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 But what have been giving them the biggest thrills are the blue whales, which 
send plumes of mist high into the sky -- in one instance nearly blowing the 
feathers off a gull -- and bare their massive bodies. One whale seems to fly 
out of the water, crashing back down and causing a splash that's sure to leave 
a lasting impression on everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're looking at, folks, is the largest animal that has ever been on 
the face of earth," says Benko, whose boat has made the 2 1/2-hour run from Sea 
Landing to Santa Rosa Island, where there have been the most whale sightings. 
"Larger by far than any of the dinosaurs and much, much larger than anything on 
land today." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching lengths of 100 feet and weighing more than 100 tons, yet possessing 
grace and power enough to travel great distances with very little effort, blue 
whales have taken up temporary lodging in the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 They are there because they feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like crustaceans that 
have concentrated in abundance in the nutrient-rich waters around the Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the abundance of blue whales is unusual, especially considering that they 
are still trying to rebound from widespread hunting, which reduced the species 
from the hundreds of thousands in the early part of the century to near 
extinction. There are believed to be fewer than 10,000 -- perhaps as few as 
5,000 -- left. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the oceans of the world, I've never seen concentrations of blue whales 
like this," says David O. Brown, 35, a researcher who spent seven years 
studying whales with the Cousteau research team. "That includes the Antarctic, 
that includes sub-Arctic, that includes Gulf of St. Lawrence (off eastern 
Canada) where there's supposed to be a big concentration . . . It's just 
amazing!" 
</P>
<P>
 John Calambokidis, a research biologist with Cascadia Research, an Olympia, 
Wash., organization that studies marine mammals and their movements, said 
population estimates put the number of blue whales that feed along the 
California coast each summer and fall between 1,000 and 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike gray whales, which migrate fairly close to the coast from the 
Bering Sea to the lagoons of Baja California each winter and back each spring, 
blue whales are less predictable in their migration habits and tend to remain 
farther offshore.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very special occurrence going on out there," says Alisa 
Schulman-Janiger, a spokeswoman for the California chapter of the American 
Cetacean Society. "A lot of people don't realize that gray whales are on a 
mission (calving) and only occasionally does one stop (for whale-watchers). But 
here, these blue whales are in their feeding grounds and you can literally 
watch them for hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Benko is making the most of the phenomenon, canceling fishing trips and 
running daily whale-watching trips until the whales decide to leave, which 
could be today or two months from now. There was a similar occurrence in 1992, 
the whales appearing in mid-summer and sticking around until Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Benko and co-captain Ron Hart have studied whales and have the whales' routine 
down pat. With the exception of one day when the fog refused to lift, they have 
encountered blue and humpback whales on every excursion for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think they recognize the sound of the boat because as the season 
progresses, we tend to get better and better whale sightings," Benko says. "And 
I think this is because these animals are acclimating to the Condor and 
realizing that we're not threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Santa Barbara Harbor at 8 a.m., Benko tells his passengers that the 
crossing to the islands will take more than two hours, then begins dispensing 
information about the animals of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Channel Islands) have the greatest diversity of pinnipeds (seals and 
walrus) of any place in the northern hemisphere," he says, piloting the vessel 
over the slow-rolling swells. "We have huge elephant seals, up to 6,000 pounds, 
on the islands right now. We have California sea lions, harbor seals, Guadalupe 
fur seals, Northern fur seals and Stellar sea lions -- all come into the 
channel at various times of year, particularly at San Miguel and Santa Rosa 
islands." 
</P>
<P>
 Benko tells the passengers they might also see common dolphins, Pacific 
white-sided dolphins, Dall's porpoise, Risso's dolphins, Northern right whales 
and tiny minke whales. As the fog slowly gives way to sunshine, a California 
sea lion is floating on the surface in a posture known as rafting, sticking its 
fins out of the water and using them as solar panels to absorb heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther along in the channel, a blue shark is cruising off the starboard bow, 
its fins barely visible above the surface. In the same area, a large elephant 
seal sticks its head out of the water and watches the Condor glide by. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart tells of the time late last April, when a group on the boat encountered a 
pod of killer whales moving swiftly across the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "That same afternoon we got a call from (the skipper of) the Truth," Hart 
says. "They saw the orcas (as killer whales are often called) and went closer 
to look at them and, as they were coming into them, a gray whale pops up right 
off the front of the bow. The skipper backs down hard to keep from running into 
this whale and then he sees that it's injured. It's right beside him and he 
leans over to look down at the gray whale and this orca just came up and 
munched it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown explains that killer whales -- they are actually dolphins -- will attack 
whales or practically anything else they want. While diving off New Guinea in 
1988, he filmed killer whales feeding on a school of pelagic sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd show up with sharks sticking out of the sides of their mouths," Brown 
says. "They'd let them go and the sharks would try to swim away and they'd grab 
them again -- like they were playing with them. I saw one literally tear up an 
11-foot shark." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of Risso's dolphins off the bow puts everyone's focus back on 
the present. 
</P>
<P>
 The mammals, some 10 feet long, are leaping playfully and riding the wake of 
the Condor, giving most of the passengers a much-needed break from the monotony 
of boat travel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the distance, the first spouts are seen, appearing as broad smoke signals 
against a hazy white sky. Benko and Hart identify the source as humpback 
whales, saying blue whale spouts are thinner and reach much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few minutes the Condor is in the thick of things. Benko, careful not 
to harass the whales, lets them come to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Whales half the size of the boat cruise beside it on either side. Jaws are 
dropping and cameras are clicking away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the whales," say Margo Adams, part of a large church group from 
Ventura. "They're such gentle leviathans. Their grace is awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 A California sea lion leaps over the head of one humpback each time it 
surfaces, as if to also be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Benko remains with the humpbacks for an hour or so and then pulls away, having 
seen the slender plumes of blue whales above the white horizon. Those who 
haven't succumbed to the rocking of the boat -- Hart says about 7% get seasick 
every trip -- take the time to reload their cameras and jockey for position at 
the bow and along the rails. 
</P>
<P>
 Benko tells the passengers how impressive the whales they are about to see 
really are:  
</P>
<P>
 -- The blue whale's heart is as big as a small car and its tongue is as big as 
an African elephant, weighing up to six tons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually this animal is as large as a whole herd of elephants," Benko says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A blue whale calf is 25 to 30 feet long at birth, can gain as much as 300 
pounds a day and grow to 55 feet within six months. This is partly because the 
blue whale's mother's milk is more than 50% fat, compared to the less than 10% 
fat found in human milk. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The air expelled from the blue whale's blow hole is coming out at about 300 
m.p.h. And the holes, Benko says, "are easily big enough for any one of us on 
the boat to slip down inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with this knowledge, the passengers finally get a first-hand look. 
Several blue whales are spouting a few hundred yards away. Others are feeding 
on the krill on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 One whale breaches off the starboard bow, its sleek blue body in clear view. 
</P>
<P>
 It breaches again, as if for an encore. Another surfaces about a dozen feet 
away and rolls over on its side, showing off a long, white pectoral fin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as if they have grown bored with the Condor and its shutterbugs, the 
whales move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Le Chat, who still can't believe her eyes, watches them until they 
disappear. It is as she said. There is no beauty quite like that of the sea.

JIM MURRAY: INSTEAD OF FAREWELL, MARTINA SIMPLY MAKES IT FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarah Bernhardt had so many "farewell tours," the phrase became synonymous 
with her. But she was the best in the world at what she did. She said goodby 
one investment at a time. She was the "Divine Sarah" to the end.  
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had a farewell tour that brought him everything from a 
motorcycle to a Picasso to a Rolls. Because he was the best in the world at 
what he did. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other triumphant final tours. Babe Ruth never had one. But a 
lot of lesser players did. Mad Russian dancers had them. Aging tenors.  
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to my question -- why not Navratilova? The Divine Martina. No 
one ever did what she did any better -- play tennis. No one ever dominated a 
game any more thoroughly than she did. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching her play tennis was every bit as transcendent as watching Ruth bat or 
Nijinsky dance or Caruso sing. Martina on the court was a poem of power and 
grace. The other player on court might as well have been wearing a mask. I 
mean, does anyone look at the piano when Horowitz plays Chopin?  
</P>
<P>
 An important element in any appreciation of a performer has to be a belief in 
her invincibility. Martina had this in greater measure than almost anyone who 
ever played tennis -- and I include Tilden, Budge, Gonzales, Borg or whomever, 
male or female. You could root for Martina without fear of failure. You could 
bask in her glory. It's the essence of fandom: "Watch this! We're going to blow 
Goolagong right outta here!" 
</P>
<P>
 To be really great, you have to revolutionize the way your game is played. 
Martina did this to an extraordinary degree. When she came along, women's 
tennis was a nice polite baseline game played by Chrissie Evert and Evonne 
Goolagong at longer range than the Battle of Midway. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina went on the attack. She was more like Dempsey with his man on the 
ropes than someone playing telephone chess. She went for the knockout. She 
didn't jab you to death, she slugged.  
</P>
<P>
 It's doubtful if she could even have played the game in skirts, the way Helen 
Wills and Suzanne Lenglen, the other Wimbledon legends, had to. Martina's game 
could not have been hobbled. Martina was embarrassed if it took her three sets 
to polish off an opponent. She won Wimbledon once, 6-0, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon was her turf. Helen Wills Moody had won it eight times. So Martina 
won it nine. One by one, she destroyed existing records. She once won Wimbledon 
six consecutive years. No one had ever done that before. She won 96 matches in 
a row. She went through Grand Slam tournaments without losing a set. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why isn't somebody giving her a motorcycle, an oil painting, a year's 
supply of shampoo, a gold watch? Why no Bernhardt farewell tour?  
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly because I don't want one," she acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the emotion Martina fears. She has never been afraid of her feelings. 
When she came in the game, Evert was the Ice Queen. She beat you without 
getting her hair mussed. Her mascara didn't even run. But Martina scrambled, 
screamed, scratched. She even occasionally told the crowd to shut up. She was 
the Lava Queen.  
</P>
<P>
 It's probably hard to think of a farewell tour for someone who recently made 
the final at Wimbledon. For some, that would be the apex of a career, not the 
finale. Most never make a Wimbledon final. For Martina, that was No. 12.  
</P>
<P>
 In a sport that has combatants looking for an escape hatch at the age of 25, 
pleading burnout, Martina, nearing 38, is still rifling unreturnable backhands. 
A big factor in legend-making is longevity. To be consistent is necessary but 
to be persistent is essential.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have felt the tug of burnout," Martina says. "Back in 1986. I didn't want 
to play. So, I know the feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling evaporated when she saw an opponent leaning the wrong way on a 
return of serve, when she felt the exhilaration of putting a forehand down the 
line past a schoolgirl at the net. Then, she was Bernhardt with a good script, 
Ruth with a hanging curve.  
</P>
<P>
 She did not grow up in south Florida and get a tennis racket and a tricycle 
for her 4th birthday. Martina grew up in the harsh shadow of the Carpathian 
Mountains and the Red masters of Czechoslovakia. It had one plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communists encouraged girls to become athletes," she says. "They felt it 
reflected favorably on the regime." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. But it reflected unfavorably on the regime when the young Miss 
Navratilova got a look at Western freedom. No Russian tanks rolled through 
those capitals, and Martina had a Prague spring of her own and defected. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a brave but not foolhardy decision for the young athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to my family and they told me, 'No matter what we say to you on the 
telephone, don't believe it and don't come back. It might be a trick.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martina took the advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some repercussions," she says. "My father didn't get promoted to a 
job, in fact, took a minor demotion. My sister got thrown out of the tennis 
club." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no gunfire. The tanks didn't roll. And Martina became a 
world-class celebrity who finally did reflect glory on her benighted native 
land.  
</P>
<P>
 Martina is a child of the century, a part of history that will probably become 
incomprehensible to those who come after her.  
</P>
<P>
 She should have farewell tours. At least as many as Bernhardt. Instead, she is 
still entering stage left with a racket in her hand. She will be on the court 
at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles at the Manhattan Country Club this week 
and she might get another final to add to her collection.  
</P>
<P>
 You will have no trouble recognizing her. She's the one who looks as if she 
was born with a racket in one hand and a ball in the other. Even if she loses, 
her opponent will feel as if she has been locked in a room with a lion. Martina 
does not go gently into that good night.  
</P>
<P>
 When Martina played her last set point on Centre Court, she reached down and 
plucked a clump of grass as a memento of her happy youth in English summers 
amid cheering royalty. The notion here is that Wimbledon should get a lock of 
her hair in reciprocity. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina was lucky to have Wimbledon. And Wimbledon was lucky to have Martina.

WEIDA RACING TO FRONT OF CLASS; INDY LIGHTS TEAM OWNER FROM SAN CLEMENTE COMING 
UP A WINNER -- WHOEVER DRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Other than their passion for auto racing, Mark Weida and Joe Gibbs might not 
seem to have much in common. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gibbs got a lot of credit for winning three Super Bowls for the Washington 
Redskins with three different quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Weida has won three American Racing Series Indy Lights championships with 
three different drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last eight years, the San Clemente resident has been directing racing 
teams with remarkable success. The first was with Arciero Racing as that team's 
crew chief and race engineer. Then, opting to become a team owner, Weida formed 
Leading Edge Motorsports in 1988 and the titles continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike in IndyCar where you win the championship and everyone comes back, 
with our series, the driver leaves and we're forced to start all over again," 
Weida said. "Each of our three champions all moved on to IndyCar the following 
year. It's somewhat the nature of the beast that we're involved with. You win 
and your driver leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabrizio Barbazza won for Weida in 1986 and was on the Indy circuit the 
following year. Same with Mike Groff in 1989 and Robbie Buhl in 1992. But Weida 
has handled the inherent challenges just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "People go their whole lives without winning a race, let alone a 
championship," Weida said. "It's the ultimate goal of what we're trying to 
achieve. That we've done it three times with three drivers, I think that's more 
satisfying than winning three with the same driver." 
</P>
<P>
 His rules to win on the fast track are simple: "The No. 1 thing, you have to 
pay attention to detail. Setting up a race car is nothing magical. You don't 
get yourself all wound up in a magical setup, you just pay attention to the 
basics, give the driver the best race car you can -- something that will run 
all day." 
</P>
<P>
 With Buhl behind the wheel in 1992, Weida's team set a CART record by 
completing every race lap in a season, the only time that has ever been done, 
and set another record with 11 consecutive top-three finishes; he finished 
fourth in the other race. 
</P>
<P>
 Weida's team has won 14% of all races and finished in the top three 52% of the 
time over the last eight years. And when the Indy Lights Championship Series 
celebrated its 100th race anniversary in Cleveland last month, Weida was 
recognized for being the only person to compete in all 100. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in itself, is a fairly remarkable statistic, given the difficult nature 
of owning a race car team where the budgets easily soar into six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience is his virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many uncontrollables in racing: a crash, someone else crashing, 
mechanical problems. You can't let yourself get frustrated, you've got to keep 
your mind on what your job is and keep plugging away and not give up," Weida 
said. "A couple of times it would have been pretty easy to shut the whole 
operation down and go to work for someone else, but I'm glad I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult time came in 1990. He was running three cars and, on the 
surface, it looked like a big-time operation. But a business partner was taking 
in the money and Weida was doling it out. Then the partner disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Weida was $160,000 in the hole and relied on his word that he was good for his 
debts. No one to whom he owed money forced him into bankruptcy -- that's how 
good Weida's credit and word was. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Weida and his Leading Edge racing team is one of the most successful in 
the sport; his debts from 1990 have been nearly paid in full. Still, he had to 
sell his home, cash-in a second trust deed on a property and borrow from his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 "You rarely find Mark in a bad mood," said Weida's wife, Kathy. "He's pretty 
even-tempered. One of his mottoes is 'Don't sweat the small stuff.' . . . But 
it has bitten him a few times because he has been taken advantage of a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy was the more predominant racing name among the Weidas during the early 
years of their 9 1/2-year marriage. She was Dan Gurney's chief assistant at 
All-American Racers in Santa Ana, and has been for the last 20 years -- she 
started when she was 17. Her title is now vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark met Kathy in 1982 while working as a mechanic for Gurney. They married in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Weida raced motocross when he was 12, but his auto racing career -- even 
though it's more managerial in nature -- began to take shape in 1979 when he 
was a 19-year-old gofer working the Super Vee Series. He eventually worked 
himself into the chief mechanic position. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he wanted to drive, Weida realized that without sponsorship money, 
there was little chance. Given more responsibility on the race cars as the 
months turned into years, he eventually became passionate about race 
engineering, which led him to his Lake Forest shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like owning a baseball team and getting a chance to coach it," Weida 
said. "I'm responsible for logistics, day-to-day payments, but when I'm at the 
track, I work one-on-one with (driver Alex Padilla). He tells me what he feels 
with the race car, and I call the shots and tell the mechanics what I want on 
the race car to make him go faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still get my hands dirty. My attitude has always been 'Whatever it takes.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it takes to pursue the passion that has kept him enthralled since his 
mother and father took him to sprint car races as a child, since watching Indy 
500 qualifying at age 8, since working at Bob Bondurant's School of High 
Performance Driving at Ontario Motor Speedway at 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any other business where, when you have time off, you do it 
again," Weida said. "When I have time off, I go to the races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think too many bankers, when they have time off, go spend their time 
in other banks."

ASHMORE HAS THE CONFIDENCE TO REPLACE RAM LEGEND; NFL: RIGHT TACKLE SAYS HE'S 
PREPARED TO ASSUME STARTER'S ROLE AHEAD OF 40-YEAR-OLD JACKIE SLATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right tackle Jackie Slater cracked the Rams' starting lineup in 1979, 
beginning a reign that would span 15 years and three head coaching changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Slater practiced with the second-string offense during Monday's training 
camp workout in an apparent changing of the guard at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Ashmore, a third-year player who started seven games last season in 
place of an injured Slater, practiced with the first string, an indication that 
the team might be moving Slater to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems that's the way things are going to shake down," said Slater, 
who started in the Rams' 14-6 exhibition loss to the Green Bay Packers 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl is a young player who's improving. I remember what it was like sitting 
there my first three years and waiting for my chance to start. And the last 15 
years, I've been the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "So this practice was a little foreign for me. I guess this (change) is 
something that's inevitable as far as my getting out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater signed a one-year, $500,000 contract in the off-season and nobody 
within the organization indicated that he would be the starting right tackle 
when the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have hedged on naming a starter mostly out of respect for Slater, who 
has played in 246 games since joining the team in 1976, more games than any 
player in team history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the season started today, the starter would be Ashmore," said Jim 
Erkenbeck, offensive line coach. "But it could be Jackie by tomorrow. There's 
really only one job locked up on the offensive line right now, and that's 
(center) Bern Brostek." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ram Coach Chuck Knox: "We haven't made any real decision there because we 
want to work him (Ashmore) in there and see how he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't designated him the starter because it's too early. A lot of things 
can happen between now and that first game." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater was pursued by the Atlanta Falcons during the off-season before 
re-signing with the Rams. With his contract expiring at the end of the season, 
has he given any thought to retiring? 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously you think about retiring when you get to be my age," said Slater, 
40. "But at this point in time, my goal is just to, believe it or not, try to 
get a little better and help out wherever I can." 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the attention during training camp has focused on the progress 
of rookie left tackle Wayne Gandy, Ashmore has quietly been groomed to replace 
Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of Jackie's biggest fans," Ashmore said. "I support him in everything 
he does, and he supports me. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my three years here, I have sat on the sidelines and watched how he 
practices, moves around, relates to his teammates. I learned from him in not 
just a football sense, but a 'real world' sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore, 6 feet 7 and 300 pounds, missed most of last year's training camp 
recovering from a torn knee ligament, then spent the first seven games on the 
team's inactive list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back for the last game of preseason, but I was very rusty," Ashmore 
said. "I had to groom myself for seven more weeks before I got my chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore, 24, started seven games last season after Slater was sidelined with a 
torn chest muscle and backup Robert Jenkins dislocated his toe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl did a real good job," Erkenbeck said. "He improved dramatically 
between the first game and the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore struggled in his NFL debut, coming off the bench in a 40-17 loss at 
San Francisco on Oct 31. 
</P>
<P>
 He was whistled twice for illegal-formation penalties, one for lining up off 
the line of scrimmage on a second-quarter drive. He was later called for being 
offsides. Quarterback T.J. Rubley was sacked seven times for losses totaling 48 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big-time learning experience," Ashmore said. "I was thrown into the 
fire pretty early in the season. My only concern each game was improving, and I 
feel I did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox has made upgrading the offensive line a priority. There's little question 
that the offense's effectiveness, and quarterback Chris Miller's health, rely 
heavily on the development of Ashmore, a 1992 seventh-round draft pick from 
Northwestern, and Gandy, the Rams' 1994 first-round selection from Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot more confidence now," Ashmore said. "I've gone against some of 
the top defensive linemen in the league, guys like Trace Armstrong and Reggie 
White. I have that under my belt, and I feel I can compete with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore said the offensive line's goal is to give up one sack or less a game. 
Giving up 20 sacks this season would "be real good, considering how young our 
line is." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our work cut out for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are taking us lightly, and that's what we want. I hope they do that, 
because we're much improved. The newspaper says we're the same 'old Rams' and 
stuff like that, so obviously the writers don't believe it either."

TALK OF A NEW PROPOSAL APPEARS TO LEAD TO ANOTHER DEAD END; BASEBALL: 
MONTGOMERY, MYERS SAY RAVITCH OFFERED ONE. UNION SAYS NO AND, FOR ONCE, SELIG 
AGREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Baseball's labor negotiations took a bizarre twist Monday night when officials 
of the players' union denied player reports that owners' negotiator Richard 
Ravitch has promised a new proposal Friday if the players don't hold to their 
strike deadline of that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Myers, the Chicago Cubs player representative, said in a radio interview 
that union officials told him Ravitch made that offer during their negotiations 
Monday, but that the union regarded it as simply another ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Montgomery, the Kansas City player representative, supported Myers' 
statement at Anaheim Stadium on Monday night and said the player 
representatives had been told about the Ravitch offer in a conference call with 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said from New York 
that there was no conference call with the players and no such offer from 
Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely not true, strictly a rumor," Orza said, "and we're not going 
to change the strike date just because someone says they have a new proposal, 
which to our knowledge no one said. A new proposal could be worse than this 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and interim commissioner of 
baseball, also denied there was a new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing to it," he said Monday night. "I've been getting a few calls 
about it tonight, but there's nothing to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch could not be reached Monday night. He had earlier agreed with Don 
Fehr, the union's executive director, that there was no progress during 
Monday's negotiations on the non-economic issues in baseball's bargaining 
agreement and no hint of a compromise on the major issue of a salary cap. Fehr 
and Ravitch said the likelihood of a strike beginning on Friday loomed even 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking apples and oranges," Ravitch said in reference to the 
ideological differences over the economic state of the game and alleged need 
for a salary cap, which is the centerpiece of the owners' attempt to overhaul 
the compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations on the cap -- opposed by the players' union -- will resume 
Wednesday. Fehr said he was resigned to baseball's eighth work stoppage in 22 
years, again blamed the owners and said he has been unable to convince Ravitch 
that the union will never accept a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ravitch: "I don't want to spark any unrealistic optimism, but when you're 
in a situation like this, I wouldn't dare predict what's going to happen 
between now and Friday. That doesn't mean I think the fairy godmother will 
descend with a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, Ravitch had said he had no plans to put another proposal on 
the table. The owners' proposal calls for a 50-50 split with the players of all 
revenue generated by both sides -- 58% of the owners' 1994 revenue would go to 
salaries -- along with the elimination of salary arbitration and reduction of 
free agency eligibility from six years of major league service to four, with a 
player's current club having the right to match his best offer. It would be 
phased in over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain flexible," Ravitch said. "We asked them, 'is the percentage too 
low? Is the transition period too short?' We've heard no response and we need a 
response. We can't negotiate with ourselves. As long as (Fehr) says no, the 
owners do not intend to change their position."

 Cincinnati Red outfielder Deion Sanders was charged with two misdemeanors 
Monday night following an altercation with a security officer at Riverfront 
Stadium.Police Lt. Fred Ramsey said off-duty Cincinnati police officer Herb 
Kohus was guarding a stadium pedestrian entrance and stopped Sanders as he 
tried to drive his motorcycle through it. Sanders was charged with failing to 
provide a driver's license and resisting arrest. The officer suffered minor 
injuries, Ramsey said. Police will interview more witnesses today and consult 
with prosecutors before deciding whether to add an assault charge.

 Perhaps the greatest curveball pitcher of his era, Blyleven spent the last 
four years of his 23-year career with the Angels before retiring at the start 
of the 1993 season.His 17-5 record in 1989 kept the team in contention for the 
division title until the final week of the season, and his 287 victories make 
him a candidate for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyleven, 43, still lives in Orange County and hopes to become a pitching 
coach for a major league club. He is co-owner of a Villa Park restaurant, works 
as an announcer for the new Baseball Network, and has a company that makes 
"pop-up" baseball cards.

 An eccentric right-hander who holds a doctorate in kinesiology, Marshall 
relieved in a record 106 games in 1974 -- his first year with the Dodgers -- 
leading the club to the pennant and earning the Cy Young Award.Beset by 
injuries in 1975, his 14 losses in relief set another record and he was traded 
to Atlanta.

 Until recently, Marshall was the baseball coach and a physical education 
professor at West Texas A&M. His contract was not renewed in June, and the

COALITION URGES DELAY OF GATT CONSIDERATION; TRADE: IN A LETTER TO CLINTON, AN 
INCONGRUOUS GROUP OF MORE THAN 130 LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES URGE THAT 
CONGRESS AVOID 'A RUSH TO JUDGMENT' ON THE NEW WORLD TREATY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An eclectic, incongruous coalition of liberals and conservatives urged 
President Clinton on Monday to put off until next year final congressional 
consideration of the new world trade treaty negotiated by more than 100 nations 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Clinton, critics ranging from consumer advocate Ralph Nader and 
California state Sen. Tom Hayden on the left to Pat Buchanan and direct-mail 
fund-raiser Richard Viguerie on the right say Congress should avoid "a rush to 
judgment" on the "vast trade agreement and its complex implementing 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 In its more than 130 signatories, the letter reassembles many veterans of the 
unusual left-right coalition that opposed the North American Free Trade 
Agreement last fall. But the plea for delay reflects that coalition's 
frustration with its inability to focus the same kind of public controversy on 
the massive trade treaty that developed around the free-trade agreement with 
Mexico and Canada. As it stands, Congress is likely to approve the world 
agreement later this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration said it had no comment on the letter. But officials 
indicated that the President has no interest in putting off the vote until next 
year. On Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta identified the 
trade pact, along with health care reform and a pending crime bill, as the 
Administration's top three legislative priorities this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Nader described the letter's signatories as "probably 
the broadest political spectrum that has ever jointly petitioned a President." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not much of an exaggeration: Those signing the letter included 
left-of-liberal writers Gloria Steinem and Noam Chomsky as well as conservative 
activists Phyllis Schlafly, Paul Weyrich and R. Emmett Tyrell Jr., editor of 
the American Spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included are former California Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr.; Pat 
Choate, an adviser to Ross Perot; Ben Cohen, chairman of the company that makes 
Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and singer Lou Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter does not specify the group's objections to the trade agreement. But 
most of the signatories have already made it clear that they think the 
agreement could infringe on U.S. sovereignty by making it possible for other 
nations to challenge domestic health, environmental and food safety rules as 
unfair barriers to trade. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and other officials have repeatedly 
declared such concerns alarmist; in any instance, they argue, the proposed new 
mandatory sanctions would benefit the United States because this nation is more 
often a plaintiff than a defendant in international trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will establish a new World Trade Organization, which could 
impose binding trade sanctions on nations whose domestic laws it deems 
discriminatory to foreign firms. Under rules of the existing agreement, the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, there are no binding sanctions, because 
any country can block an adverse decision against its laws.

O.C.'S FLUIDMASTER IS FLUSH WITH SUCCESS; COMPETITION: WITH 65% OF THE U.S. 
MARKET, THE MAKER OF WATER INLET AND VALVE REPLACEMENTS IS POISED FOR SERIOUS 
FOREIGN EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flush toilets of the world share a common ancestry that can be traced to 
English inventors of the 1800s. Exactly how they work today varies from nation 
to nation, but they all still use that same basic technology involving a pair 
of valves. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives Fluidmaster, an Anaheim company that is the top U.S. maker of water 
inlet and flush valve replacements, the potential to become a plumbing 
superpower. The 36-year-old company already controls 65% of the domestic market 
and is now poised for a serious international expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluidmaster's foreign sales began in Canada a decade ago. In 1988, the company 
reached south into Mexico, Central and South America with its one-kind-fits-all 
valve kits, and it has since added nearly a dozen European and Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
 International sales accounted for just 5% of privately owned Fluidmaster's $60 
million in 1993 revenue, but they are growing rapidly. Robert Connell, vice 
president for marketing and sales, said he expects foreign sales to bring in 
about 9% of the company's 1994 revenue, projected at $75 million, and to make 
up as much as 30% of the total by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluidmaster, which will make about 13 million valve kits this year, credits 
its success to automation. The assembly plant that shares space with 
Fluidmaster's offices near the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim operates three 
shifts a day with an average of just 40 workers each shift. The rest of the 
people on the company's payroll of 200 -- up from 60 in 1985 -- are in sales, 
marketing and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Come to China, we have cheap labor,' but they really can't 
compete," Connell said, with the fully automated Fluidmaster factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one person who operates a 16-cavity mold" that produces 16 plastic 
valve bodies at a time, Connell said. "Compare that to the guy in China or 
Mexico who has one person operating a one-cavity mold. Our costs are 
substantially less." 
</P>
<P>
 Even packaging is automated, with a hypersensitive scale at the end of the 
assembly line that rejects any of the machine-packed cartons that have parts 
missing. It can tell if a washer weighing less than a tenth of an ounce has 
been omitted. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the foreseeable future, Fluidmaster valves will continue to sport a 
"Made in the U.S.A." label -- no matter what the language on the packaging and 
the instruction sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Language brings its own special challenge for exporters. Fluidmaster's biggest 
contretemps occurred in its early days of packaging its product for sale in 
Spain. "We tried to have our instructions translated into Spanish by someone 
who worked here," Connell said, "but he was from Mexico, and there are 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish distributor called and asked why the instructions called for the 
customer to attach "tennis shoes" at a certain point. The Mexican wording 
referred to a small plastic washer -- but it didn't translate to that in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in English there are cultural differences. Fluidmaster's package in 
American English says the kit fits most toilet tanks, but new packages had to 
be printed for Britain, where the word "tank" is reserved for the military 
vehicle. The British box says the kit fits most "toilet cisterns." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some problems are more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, where Fluidmaster has spent years negotiating, a plumbing fixtures 
council requires all threaded water inlet pipes on toilet valves to be made of 
a special type of brass that, until now, was made only in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we've found an American company that will make the brass" to Japanese 
specifications, Connell said. Fluidmaster expects to start marketing in Japan 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Import duties are a bigger blockade than local codes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company sells in China only to Western-style hotels because it cannot 
compete in a broader market because of a duty of nearly 60% on consumer goods. 
It doesn't sell at all in India, where it would have to pay a 90% duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, which had a duty on plumbing equipment before the implementation of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, sales were slow for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at a 25% disadvantage from the word 'go,' " Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA abolished the tariff this year, and Fluidmaster adjusted its price to 
reflect the 25% saving. For the first seven months of 1994, Connell said, 
Fluidmaster's sales in Mexico are up 63%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give us a level playing field," Connell said, "and we can compete anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Fluidmaster is not only boosting marketing efforts in countries 
where it already has a presence, it is also moving into new areas. Sales in 
Germany, where special recyclable packaging is required, are slated by begin 
late in 1995 or early in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Connell said, "there's always Eastern Europe. There are a lot of 
toilets there." 
</P>
<P>
 There still are stumbling blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most important lessons we have learned," Connell said, "is that 
you shouldn't expect your values to prevail when you walk into someone else's 
living room." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales meetings that would be short and to the point in the United States, for 
instance, proceed at a much slower pace in some countries. And Fluidmaster 
changed the color of its standard gray and black plastic product to adapt to 
buyers' tastes in Europe, where plumbing supplies usually come in blue and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluidmaster has learned enough about the politics of protectionism and the 
oddities of plumbing and marketing overseas, Connell said, to mount a serious 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret to success, in addition to having a good product to sell," he 
said, "is to get the right distributor." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales directors of U.S. companies who are shopping overseas for distributors 
typically feel most comfortable with people whose English is impeccable, 
Connell said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'd rather have to deal through an interpreter," he said, "and have a 
distributor who can talk to the store owners than have a distributor I can go 
out to dinner with and then find out he can't sell because he doesn't have the 
language and cultural background." Global Success Fluidmaster, an Anaheim 
company that makes toilet flush valve replacements, is steadily expanding into 
foreign markets. Locations entered and market share now: 03,24,14,14 Location

SENATE PANEL, PHONE FIRMS TENTATIVELY REACH ACCORD; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE 
COMPROMISE COULD BREAK THE LEGISLATIVE LOGJAM THAT HAS STALLED EFFORTS TO SPUR 
COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a breakthrough that could salvage stalled Senate negotiations over 
telecommunications reform, the Baby Bell telephone companies and the Senate 
Commerce Committee on Monday reached a tentative agreement on a bill aimed at 
spurring competition among cable television operators, local telephone 
companies and long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), who has been engaged in a 
bitter battle with the Baby Bells -- or regional Bell operating companies -- 
over the bill, has scheduled a committee vote on the legislation for Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The House last month passed its own telecommunications reform bill by an 
overwhelming margin, but the powerful regional Bell companies strongly objected 
to the original Senate version of the legislation. If the Commerce Committee 
and the full Senate pass a bill based on Monday's compromise, the stage would 
be set for a potentially difficult House-Senate conference to resolve the 
differences, followed by new votes in both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's breakthrough came after Commerce Committee staff members and 
representatives of the seven Baby Bell firms reached a handshake agreement on 
the highly contentious issue of allowing the regional companies into the 
long-distance telephone business. They are currently barred from that business 
by the 1982 consent decree governing the breakup of the old Bell system. 
</P>
<P>
 An industry source close to the negotiations said lawmakers agreed to allow 
the Baby Bells to offer long-distance service as long as they first provided 
telephone interconnection and "essential facilities" to alternative 
local-service providers that compete with the Bells. Once they had met those 
conditions, they would be required to seek permission from state regulators, 
the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department before they 
could offer long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Baby Bells would have to agree to permit long-distance rivals 
to compete on an equal footing for so-called local long-distance calls -- from 
Los Angeles to Riverside, for example -- that are now a local phone company 
monopoly in California and some other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bells would have to offer the long-distance carriers so-called dialing 
parity -- meaning no special access codes would be required -- for local 
long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the original Hollings bill, the Bells would not have been allowed to 
offer long-distance service until they could show there was genuine competition 
in the local phone business and no possibility that they could abuse their 
monopoly power to gain an advantage in long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for being allowed to offer long-distance services soon with only 
modest preconditions, the Bells agreed to form separate subsidiaries to market 
their long-distance services. It was unclear late Monday how the parties 
decided to resolve issues of telephone rate regulation and competition with the 
cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also not known whether the Bells would be permitted to use their own 
trade names in marketing their long-distance services through separate 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord sets the stage for stepped-up convergence of television, computer 
and telephone technologies. The marriage of those services is fueling a 
burgeoning multibillion-dollar telecommunications industry that promises to 
transform the way Americans live, work and communicate, according to a recent 
briefing paper prepared by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

<P>
 That's about how many videocassettes of "Dances With Wolves," "Wayne's World" 
and other films the fast-food chain has sold at bargain prices with its Quarter 
Pounder combos and Chicken McNugget kids' meals in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion is one of the fast-food industry's most successful -- too 
successful for some in Hollywood and the people Hollywood depends on to sell 
its movies on videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in what has become an annual rite of fall, McDonald's again plans to sell 
videos at bargain-basement prices with the purchase of burgers, fries, Cokes 
and the like. Starting in November, McDonald's will sell MCA's "Field of 
Dreams," "The Land Before Time," "An American Tail: Fievel Goes West" and "Back 
to the Future." 
</P>
<P>
 The sales are nothing small -- or new. McDonald's was the fourth-biggest video 
retailer in the final quarter of 1992 and third-largest in the final period of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But within the past month, the issue has sizzled like an oversize hamburger 
patty, prompted by complaints from Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg and Disney video chief Ann Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that such promotions devalue videos, create expectations that all 
videos should sell for $5.99 and slice into additional video sales. Katzenberg 
last month warned a Video Software Dealers Assn. convention in Las Vegas that 
the main threat to the video industry isn't new technology, but rather "the 
Golden Arches right across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, miffed executives at retailer Kmart -- one of the nation's biggest 
sellers of videos -- have denounced the promotion as well, promising that 
they'll never sell the four MCA movies again because customers won't like 
paying $14.99 when they once paid less than $6. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not how we treat our customers. We'd be very happy to have MCA sell us 
product at $5.99," Kmart electronics executive Dennis Wigent says. 
</P>
<P>
 And McDonald's? A spokeswoman says the company is simply "working hard to give 
customers what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, MCA has tried to soothe the video industry's fears and portray 
the McDonald's deal as a larger promotion for its upcoming "Jurassic Park" 
video this fall. If you buy one of the four videos at McDonald's, you also 
receive a $2.50 rebate offer toward the purchase of "Jurassic Park" at video 
retailers, as well as rebate offers on other cassettes available only at video 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Careful and thoughtful consideration went into every aspect of the marketing 
plan," MCA video chief Louis Feola says. "The ultimate intention is to drive 
consumers into traditional video outlets to purchase 'Jurassic Park' and other 
catalogue titles. This will put more customers in their stores than they've 
ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is a $16-billion-a-year business that has become a gold mine for 
Hollywood, and especially Disney. Movies don't necessarily live and die by the 
box office any more. Successful movies bring studios even more profit when they 
hit the video stores. Even box office bombs can shed some of the red ink if 
they perform better on video than at the cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg argues that selling videos so cheaply at fast-food outlets marks "a 
clear and present danger" -- an intentional reference to one of his rival's hit 
films -- that could hurt not only the video industry, but the studios that need 
video retail sales for years to come until technology makes it possible for 
people to easily call up films electronically at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financial health of the entire motion picture industry today is resting 
on the back of home video," Katzenberg says. "It's paying the rent out here. If 
you start squeezing the margins out of the business before you are able to 
replace it with another business -- which I don't see coming until way into the 
next decade -- you'll put us out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's comments clearly annoyed executives at MCA. Some in Hollywood 
interpreted his criticism as a call for a boycott, which he insists was not the 
point at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics also say that Disney, which has practically owned the video sales 
market as families snatched up its animated classics and family films, may be 
hearing footsteps from the success of such videos as 20th Century Fox's "Mrs. 
Doubtfire" and with MCA's "Jurassic Park" on the horizon. They also question 
the timing of the criticism, noting that "Jurassic Park" will be on the market 
this fall at the same time Disney launches its long-awaited video of the 
classic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Alexander, a video consultant to studios, wonders why the issue is on the 
front burner now when the practice has gone on for three years. He said 
previous fast-food video promos have resembled bargain-basement sales to sweep 
out excess inventory but that MCA's is different precisely because it is being 
used to promote "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 But Katzenberg insists his comments had nothing to do with MCA because both 
"Jurassic Park" and "Snow White" will be huge successes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Daly, Disney's video chief, adds that the company's position is a 
long-held one that only now is getting so much attention. "The industry spin is 
that this is yet another marketing ploy. The reality is we were on record last 
year when it happened and on record prior to that. We have a long-term 
investment to protect," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The video business is made up of folks already under siege, bombarded with 
dire predictions that the business will disappear within a few years when it is 
supplanted by newer technology. And regardless of motive, Disney's Katzenberg 
and Daly appear to have struck a nerve with most video sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support an entire line of videos all year long only to see McDonald's get 
choice titles at the end of the year," said a senior executive at one of the 
largest video sellers. "And we don't like to see people pay a lot less than we 
do for the same titles." The Market for McVideos 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's sells so many videos that it has made its way onto the annual Top 
10 list for video retailers that buy direct from studios. In the video market, 
39.4% of studios' video revenue comes from wholesalers that distribute to 
outlets such as video stores; another 24.2% comes from rack jobbers like those 
that sell in supermarkets. The Top 10 direct accounts for 1993:

WILES CONVICTED OF FRAUD IN MINISCRIBE CASE; COMPUTERS: FORMER CHAIRMAN FACES 
PRISON, $750,000 FINE FOR ROLE IN SCAM AT NOW-DEFUNCT DISK DRIVE MAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what may be the final chapter in the tale of collapsed computer disk drive 
maker MiniScribe Corp., its former chairman has been convicted on federal fraud 
and insider trading charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Once-renowned turnaround specialist Quentin Thomas (Q.T.) Wiles of Sherman 
Oaks faces up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines for his role in what 
was alleged to be a massive fraud on creditors and shareholders of the 
Longmont, Colo.-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles' trial, which ended in a Denver federal court July 29 with guilty 
verdicts on three felony counts, was the last of several significant legal 
actions that followed Wiles' resignation in 1989 from the company he was hired 
to save. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left, MiniScribe's new management said it uncovered "massive fraud" 
during Wiles' regime that included doctoring the company's books, recording 
shipments as sales and even packaging and shipping bricks to give the 
appearance that disk drives were being sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand was ordered by a Denver 
bankruptcy court to pay $95 million to settle claims filed by MiniScribe's 
creditors and shareholders related to the accounting firm's work for 
MiniScribe. It was one of the largest legal settlements by an accounting firm 
in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles and the San Francisco-based Hambrecht & Quist investment banking firm, 
which has had many high-technology firms as clients, was named in several civil 
suits resulting from MiniScribe's failure and was forced to make some 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Hambrecht & Quist settled for an undisclosed sum a Texas suit in 
which MiniScribe bondholders were awarded $550 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles was an executive and roving trouble-shooter for Hambrecht & Quist and 
had earned the moniker "Dr. Fix-It" after several successes in nurturing 
high-tech companies back to health. 
</P>
<P>
 After he joined troubled MiniScribe in 1985, the company appeared to achieve a 
remarkable turnaround, with surging sales and profit and a soaring stock price. 
But Wiles resigned shortly after the company reported a loss for the fourth 
quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that the new managers reported to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission their allegations that inventory numbers were fraudulently boosted 
to conceal MiniScribe's financial condition. The company has since been 
liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles was convicted of filing with the SEC a false annual report that 
overstated MiniScribe's 1987 profit by about $15 million. Prosectors said the 
overstated income was the result of "an elaborate scheme" to conceal a 
$15-million shortfall in inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles knew of the shortfall and sold about $1.7 million of MiniScribe stock in 
April and May of 1988, before the information was made public, the U.S. 
attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The false financial statements were also submitted to Standard Charter Bank as 
a means to secure a $90-million loan for MiniScribe, prosecutors said. Standard 
Charter suffered significant losses from the loan, they said, although the bank 
recouped most of the losses in a civil settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles' attorneys maintained that Wiles knew nothing of the wrongdoing and that 
he had been duped by his underlings at MiniScribe. Several former MiniScribe 
employees who were promised immunity from prosecution testified against Wiles. 
It has been reported that Wiles' attorney, H. Alan Dill, is likely to file an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles is expected to be sentenced in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick J. Schleibaum, who was chief financial officer of MiniScribe, was 
found guilty in June in federal court in Denver of two counts of filing a false 
statement with the SEC and of insider trading. Schleibaum is also expected to 
be sentenced in September.

 TRW Appeals Loss of Satellite Award: The company's aerospace unit in Redondo 
Beach asked the General Accounting Office to review its recent loss of a 
top-secret military satellite contract, a source familiar with the award 
said.TRW last year had won the contract, which would have generated more than 
$2.5 billion in revenue over the next decade. But federal authorities last 
month stripped the contract from TRW and awarded it to archrival Martin 
Marietta Corp. after Martin and Lockheed Corp. protested that TRW had submitted 
a "low-ball" bid. The GAO has issued a stop-work order on the contract pending 
TRW's appeal.

TCI WILL BUY VIRGINIA-BASED TELECABLE; TELEVISION: THE $1.4-BILLION DEAL IS 
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE NO. 1 CABLE COMPANY'S DESIRE TO EXPAND ITS REACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's biggest cable television company, will 
buy TeleCable Corp., the 18th-largest, in a deal valued at more than $1.4 
billion, the companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI has agreed to give TeleCable shareholders stock valued at about $1.2 
billion and will assume about $250 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal provides another example of TCI Chief Executive John Malone's 
ambitions to expand the reach of his company despite critics' complaints that 
he already wields far too much influence in the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone's defenders say his company must grow in advance of expected 
competition from telecommunications companies that will deliver video, phone 
and other services to homes. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI is the runaway leader among cable system operators. It has about 10.5 
million cable subscribers and owns wide-ranging interests in cable networks 
ranging from Cable News Network to the Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
 It recently agreed to increase its stake in the shopping channel operator QVC 
Inc. and reportedly is talking about a cable systems venture with the 
entertainment company Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 TeleCable, a privately owned company that owns cable systems in Norfolk, Va., 
has about 740,000 subscribers and generated $300 million in revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
 TeleCable operates in 15 states in the South and Sun Belt, and many of its 
systems are near systems operated by TCI, such as in Dallas, Kansas City, 
southern Florida and Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The research firm Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel said TeleCable was the 
18th-largest U.S. cable operator as measured by subscribers on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, TeleCable shareholders would receive more than 41.6 
million shares of TCI CLass A common stock plus preferred stock that could be 
converted into 10 million more shares of TCI common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI Class A stock fell 31.3 cents a share to $22.75 a share in Nasdaq trading. 
At that price, the TCI stock involved in the deal would be worth about $1.17 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger requires approval of TeleCable shareholders, franchise authorities 
and other regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 TeleCable shareholders would own 7.6% of TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal comes only five days after TCI shareholders approved the cable 
company's absorption of Liberty Media Corp., the cable program company it 
divested a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With TCI's blessing, Liberty joined Comcast Corp. last week in a sweetened bid 
of $1.42 billion for the 65% of cable shopping channel operator QVC of West 
Chester, Pa., that they didn't already own. QVC accepted that offer. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been reports that TCI is talking with New York-based Viacom 
about creating a joint venture to run Viacom's cable systems, which have about 
1.1 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Communications Commission rules prohibit any company from serving more 
than 30% of the roughly 90 million U.S. homes with cable. Cable system owners 
are challenging the rule in court. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI is believed to reach between 20% and 22% of the homes serviced by cable 
systems, while TeleCable and Viacom are believed to reach fewer than 3%. That 
would still leave TCI under the 30% threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Roberts, TeleCable's chief executive, said in a telephone interview 
that TeleCable managers felt the company needed to merge with a larger company 
to remain competitive amid fast-moving regulatory and technological changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Frank Batten founded TeleCable in 1964, and Roberts joined the 
company four years later when it had about 14,000 subscribers.

CAMPBELL SOUP TO BUY FAST-FOOD SUPPLIER; ACQUISITIONS: BREA-BASED FRESH START 
FOODS PROVIDES HAMBURGER BUNS AND ENGLISH MUFFINS WORLDWIDE TO ONE CUSTOMER: 
MCDONALD'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Campbell Soup Co. said Monday that it is buying an Orange County company that 
is a major supplier of hamburger buns and English muffins to McDonald's Corp. 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Start Foods L.P., which has annual sales of about $75 million, operates 
several large commercial bakeries that cater to a single customer: McDonald's. 
The company, based in Brea, has operations in the United States, including a 
bakery in City of Industry, as well as in Europe and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell did not disclose the terms of the acquisition, which is subject to 
government approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very positively," Fresh Start's president, Craig Olson, said in a 
telephone interview from Germany, where he was inspecting one of the company's 
bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
 A Campbell spokesman at the company's Camden, N.J., headquarters said the 
acquisition reflects the firm's increasing involvement in restaurant catering. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot more money is being spent away from home. People are more on the go 
these days," spokesman Kevin G. Lowery said. The Fresh Start purchase is a good 
fit for his company, he said, because Campbell is already a supplier of 
condiments and soups to McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Start was started 30 years ago when McDonald's founder Ray Kroc asked 
Harold Freund, operator of Freund's Baking in Burbank, to build a bakery that 
would supply the fledgling fast-food company. 
</P>
<P>
 Freund, now retired, built the plant in City of Industry. The company 
eventually added seven other plants, in Stockton; Waipahu, Hawaii; Salt Lake 
City; Kansas City, Kan.; one in Germany, and two in Brazil. Another location is 
set to open in Chile later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery company changed hands several times, most recently when 16 managers 
bought the operation in 1988. Though the buyout added debt, Olson said, Fresh 
Start's rapid growth over the years made the company attractive to Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 The company now has 480 employees worldwide, about 165 of whom are in 
California, including 22 at the Brea headquarters. All are expected to be 
retained under the acquisition, including managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's shares closed at $37.50, up 25 cents, on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

3 BIDDERS VYING FOR KODAK'S L&F PRODUCTS; CORPORATIONS: FIRM SEEKS UP TO $2 
BILLION FOR HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS UNIT. IT PLANS TO SELL TWO OTHER DIVISIONS BY 
YEAR'S END. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. is close to selling its household products division to one 
of three leading bidders: Colgate-Palmolive Co., Unilever, and Reckitt & 
Colman, a person familiar with the bidding said. 
</P>
<P>
 The division, which makes Lysol cleaners and other household products, is 
expected to sell for $1.7 billion to $2 billion, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 3, Eastman Kodak said it planned to sell L&F Products, its Sterling 
Winthrop pharmaceuticals unit and its Clinical Diagnostics unit to reduce debt 
and concentrate on its core imaging business. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales were seen as the first major step by Kodak's new chairman, George 
M.C. Fisher, to revive the company's lagging profit. Last year, Kodak posted a 
loss of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Smith, spokesman for Kodak's health businesses, said the company is 
"on track" to complete the sale of all three units by the end of the year. The 
sale of L&F could be announced as early as this week, the Wall Street Journal 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the company said it expected the three businesses to fetch at 
least $5.4 billion, above some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak agreed in June to sell Sterling's prescription drug business to Sanofi 
for $1.68 billion in cash and Sanofi's stake in the companies' European 
over-the-counter drug venture. Sterling's over-the-counter business, which 
includes Bayer aspirin, remains on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Clorox Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. were once interested in L&F, but they 
bowed out of the negotiations as the bids increased, said the Kodak source, who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Colgate, Unilever, Reckitt and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kodak's investment bank, 
declined to comment on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak's shares rose 12.5 cents to $47.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Unilever, the Netherlands-based packaged-goods giant that makes Aim and 
Closeup toothpaste and Dove soap, and Reckitt, the maker of Colman's 
English-style mustard, are pursuing L&F as a way to enter the U.S. market, 
analysts said. Colgate wants to protect its domestic turf, where its sales are 
flagging, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bids for L&F, which posted 1993 sales of about $1.4 billion, are higher 
than Kodak originally expected, analysts said.

MAY STORES REPORTS RECORD EARNINGS FOR 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 May Department Stores Co., which has been quietly building momentum with an 
ambitious acquisition program, reported record second-quarter earnings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 May, the nation's seventh-largest retailer, said its second-quarter earnings 
rose to $130 million, or 49 cents per fully diluted share, from $117 million, 
or 44 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis-based chain -- which operates Robinsons-May, Lord & Taylor, 
Foley's and Hecht's stores -- is on its way to reporting a 20th consecutive 
year of higher earnings, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never seems to get the respect it deserves," said Peter Siris of UBS 
Securities. "I actually think May is going to sneak up and surprise people." 
</P>
<P>
 May's second-quarter net sales rose to $2.62 billion from $2.46 billion for 
the period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the latest results were on target with Wall Street expectations, the 
stock slipped 12.5 cents to close at $38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts attributed the decline to disappointment that May did not exceed 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been gobbling up small regional store operators in one of the 
industry's most aggressive acquisition programs, one that is expected to give 
May healthy market share gains, analysts say.

 "We believe the company is becoming increasingly acquisition-minded," said Bob 
Buchanan at NatWest Securities. It's "on a roll, and it's going to do a lot 
more in the acquisitions area." 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, May has acquired 22 stores from struggling regional 
department store operators. It plans to remodel and reopen 19 of them, four 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, its Payless ShoeSource division announced the purchase of the 
679-store Kobacker Co. shoe chain based in Columbus, Ohio; May plans to remodel 
and reopen 600 of those as Payless ShoeSource stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As for expansion, May has opened 15 new department stores this year and said 
it plans to open 110 more over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company is widely expected to be among the retailers 
interested in acquiring stores that Federated Department Stores and R.H. Macy & 
Co. may shed to resolve antitrust objections to their planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
 May, a stodgy but efficient retailer that keeps its plans under wraps, will 
not discuss whether any deals are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always looking for acquisitions that meet our criteria and that match 
our strategic plan," a May spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's acquisitions, which are not expected to dilute earnings, came 
after a quiet period during which the company streamlined operations to cut 
costs. The number of department store divisions was cut to eight from 14 
between 1991 and 1993. (Payless ShoeSource is the company's ninth division.)

 Arco Nets $958 Million From Sale of Notes: Atlantic Richfield Co. said the 
$988-million sale was tied to its stock in Lyondell Petrochemical Co. The 
offering of 39.9 million three-year exchangeable notes closed Monday.In 
addition to the 35 million notes sold Aug. 1, underwriters exercised their 
over-allotment option to purchase 4.9 million notes. The notes, priced at 
$24.75 each, pay a 9% interest rate and are convertible into Lyondell common 
stock at a 12% premium over that price. They are being traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange under the symbol LYX. Arco has the option of paying investors in 
cash or Lyondell shares when the notes mature. If it pays in stock, Arco will 
eliminate its 49.9% stake in the Houston-based petrochemicals company.

 Pinnacle Micro Revises 1993 Earnings: The Irvine company said an accounting 
error -- placing $2 million in first-quarter revenue into the previous fiscal 
year -- has forced it to revise its 1993 earnings.James Hanley, Pinnacle Micro 
Inc.'s vice president for operations, said the miscalculation involved "only a 
couple of days" at the end of the fiscal year and that the maker of optical 
disk drives for computers would take steps "to see this doesn't happen again." 
According to the revised numbers, Pinnacle earned between $1.4 million and $1.5 
million on revenue of $36 million to $37 million in fiscal 1993. The company's 
shares fell $1.50 to $11.75 on Monday in Nasdaq trading.

 Canadian Company Sweetens Bid for Gold Mining Firm: Upstart Royal Oak Mines 
Inc. raised its offer for Lac Minerals Ltd. to $1.74 billion (U.S.) and 
predicted victory in the battle for the much-bigger gold mining firm. Royal Oak 
lifted its bid to $3.60 in cash plus two of its shares for each Lac share, 
valuing the target at $12 a share -- a 45% premium to Lac's market price before 
Royal Oak's first bid July 7.Separately, Lac rejected a rival offer from mining 
giant American Barrick Resource Corp. Analysts say they expect the battle for 
Lac to intensify with revised offers from rival bidders, including American 
Barrick. Barrick offered $2.90 cash plus 0.31 of its shares, or a total of 0.43 
shares, valuing Lac at $1.5 billion.

 Commercial Realty Won't Meet FCC Deadline: The biggest single winner in last 
month's auction of licenses for interactive TV service said it will not submit 
bid deposits and will file an appeal with the Federal Communications 
Commission. Commercial Realty of St. Pete Inc. said in a statement that product 
delays by the inventor of the technology could prevent it from launching the 
service within the government-mandated time frame. The FCC had warned license 
winners that if they did not meet Monday's deadline for down payments they 
would be slapped with penalties.

Lake Naval Weapons Center and that its current five-year, $128-million contract 
at the facility will expire in September. The present contract, for providing 
engineering and manpower support at the base, represented about 20% of Comarco 
Inc.'s revenue and operating profit in the first six months of the current 
fiscal year. China Lake is a major Navy weapons testing center on a dry lake

 Judge Denies Change in Asset Freeze: U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in 
Los Angeles refused to allow Joseph L. Casperson of Irvine to modify an asset 
freeze ordered July 21, when the Securities and Exchange Commission charged 
Casperson and certain associates with fraudulent offerings of oil and gas 
limited partnerships. Casperson, of Irvine-based American Business Securities 
Inc., had requested that the asset freeze be changed to allow payment of living 
expenses and attorney's fees.The judge denied a similar request from Tim L. 
Epps of Texas, who is also charged in the SEC complaint. The SEC alleges that 
Casperson, Epps and associates, through Southwest Energy Consultants Inc., have 
fraudulently raised $40 million through partnerships sold to more than 1,000 
mostly elderly investors since 1992.

COMPROMISE REACHED ON TELECOM MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWARTZ, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congressional negotiators have reached a compromise on an 
Administration-backed proposal to ensure that the evolving telecommunications 
networks do not shut out law enforcement's ability to do wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bill, being introduced today by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on technology and the law, and 
Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on 
civil and constitutional rights, was hammered out in four months of 
often-intense negotiations with law enforcement officials, industry 
representatives and civil liberties activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bill is already being denounced by some privacy proponents, 
supporters of the "digital telephony" bill say the new version offers more 
protection to businesses and consumers than initial forays by the Bush and 
Clinton administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill is certainly light-years ahead of the original bill," said Larry 
Clinton, executive director of government relations for the U.S. Telephone 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 One key privacy group that has been sharply critical of the Administration's 
efforts showed qualified support for the compromise bill. While saying the 
legislation is not necessary, Jerry Berman, policy director of the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation, a high-tech civil liberties and policy group, said, "If 
they're going to pass a bill, it should be the Leahy-Edwards version." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was first floated in 1992 by the Justice Department out of fear 
that changing communications technologies would render current surveillance 
tools obsolete. The Bush Administration withdrew the proposal in the face of 
vocal protests by industry and civil liberties activists. 
</P>
<P>
 A new version of the proposal was unveiled earlier this year but was assailed 
as an unnecessary yoke on technological progress and a threat to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials especially objected to provisions in the Clinton 
Administration bill that would have given the attorney general veto power over 
technological changes that could impair the ability of law enforcement 
officials to tap communications. The Justice Department could impose stiff 
penalties on common carriers that did not conform to government wiretap 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The original bill "made everyone's hair stand on end," said Edwards.

BOEING BOOSTS INVESTMENT IN CHINA; AEROSPACE: TAIL SECTIONS FOR 737 WILL BE 
MADE UNDER CONTRACT THERE AS THE COMPANY'S COMMITMENT GROWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN MUFSON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seattle-based Boeing Co. announced Monday that it is contracting with Chinese 
aerospace authorities to build parts of the tail section for its 737 jets in 
central China at Xian Aircraft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Woodard, president of Boeing's Commercial Airplane Group, also said China 
is a possible production site for a 100-seat passenger plane Boeing hopes to 
make for the Asian market. 
</P>
<P>
 While the work on the popular 737 is on a contract basis, Woodard said Boeing 
estimates it will have invested more than $600 million in various aerospace 
facilities in China between the early 1980s and the end of this century, 
underscoring the importance the American aerospace giant places on the Chinese 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing's announcement comes less than two months after President Clinton 
extended most-favored-nation status to China. Business leaders had lobbied 
heavily for the extension, saying the move would help protect U.S. jobs and 
industry. Boeing was particularly active in that lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Tail sections for 737s, Boeing's most popular passenger jet, are currently 
made at the company's Wichita, Kan., plant at the rate of up to 21 a month. 
Woodard said Xian, which already makes the end portion of Boeing fuselages, 
would eventually match that capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said there will be no loss of jobs in Wichita as 
a result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our experience has been that for every job we have placed outside the United 
States, we gain 13 jobs in the United States in terms of increased sales," 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing's sales of commercial jetliners has made it one of the biggest U.S. 
exporters of equipment to China. Of 79 new planes China bought last year, 52 
were built by Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing's announcement is part of a broader trend of China using its buying 
power to persuade foreign companies to transfer part of their assembly or 
manufacturing operations to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies often do so to gain an edge in winning large contracts and to take 
advantage of the lower costs of making parts in China. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four major centers of the Chinese aircraft manufacturing industry: 
Xian, Chengdu, Shanghai and Shenyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said the contract is for work on current models of the 737 but that 
"China would be a strong competitor" for similar work on a new family of 737s 
that will go into production soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing has begun a joint study with Chinese and Japanese aerospace officials 
on a new 80- to 100-seat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Boeing's chief rivals, McDonnell Douglas Corp., has been building parts 
in China since 1979. So far, it has made 800 main landing gear doors, 670 nose 
landing gear doors and 180 cargo doors there. It also makes other doors, 
inboard flap supports and horizontal stabilizers in China. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 Chinese workers are currently working on McDonnell Douglas 
projects, including the assembly of passenger aircraft from kits shipped from 
the factory in Long Beach, for ultimate sale to Chinese airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, China bought a Boeing 707 plane and took it apart in an attempt 
to determine how to build one on its own. But the effort was not successful, 
and a reconstructed Boeing now sits parked outside a hangar where Chinese 
workers are finishing the assembly of a McDonnell Douglas plane with the help 
of that company's engineers and technicians.

COMPANY TOWN; TBS AGREES TO MOVIE, VIDEO DISTRIBUTION PACT WITH SONY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Turner Broadcasting System Inc. units agreed to a worldwide home movie and 
video distribution pact with two units of Sony Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle Rock Entertainment and Turner Pictures Worldwide Distribution said they 
will distribute movies and other programming through Sony's Columbia TriStar 
Film Distributors International and Columbia TriStar Home Video. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle Rock and Turner Pictures Worldwide will each oversee the marketing and 
release strategy for their respective pictures, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction will start with the release of Castle Rock's "Little Big 
League," "Beyond Rangoon" and "Dolores Claiborne." Turner Pictures Worldwide's 
offerings are likely to include "The Pagemaster," the family film "Andre" and 
the Hanna-Barbera cartoon library, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle Rock said distribution is expected to begin in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia TriStar Film and TriStar Home Video are part of the Sony Pictures 
Entertainment unit of Sony Corp. of America. TBS acquired Castle Rock last year 
and the Hanna-Barbera cartoon library two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Columbia TriStar will distribute programs in Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Italy, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand and all of Asia 
except Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Video will distribute in those markets and in France, Britain, Germany, 
Austria and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Castle Rock announced a distribution venture with several European 
companies, including Britain's Rank, France's UGC, Germany's Concorde and 
Spain's Filmayer.

PINNACLE MICRO STOCK SLIDE CONTINUES; FINANCE: THE IRVINE MAKER OF COMPUTER 
DISK DRIVES SAYS IT IS REVISING ITS 1993 EARNINGS BECAUSE OF AN ACCOUNTING 
ERROR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of Pinnacle Micro Inc. -- buffeted last week by a delay of 
second-quarter results -- continued their slide Monday, falling $1.50 to 
$11.75, as the computer data storage company revised its 1993 earnings and 
revenue to correct what it described as an accounting error. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle Micro said that about $2 million of the $39.2 million it reported as 
revenue last fiscal year should have been counted as revenue for the current 
year's first quarter, which ended March 31. The company also announced 
preliminary second-quarter earnings in the range of $15 million to $16 million 
Monday, which is in line with analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the orders that Pinnacle recorded as 1993 sales were not actually 
shipped until the first few days of 1994, according to the Irvine-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 While the accounting revisions, so far, have not affected the company's 
second-quarter earnings, analysts said the error is worrisome for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anyone changing their estimates (of the company's profitability) 
on this," Vincent Glinski, an analyst with Fahnestock/Christopher in New York, 
told Bloomberg Business News. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a lot of people get upset because you're restating an annual report, 
you're restating a fourth quarter, you're restating a first quarter, and maybe 
when they're going forward, they find a couple of more restatements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1987, Pinnacle Micro produces optical disk drives to store computer 
data. The company has about 110 employees, including 80 in Orange County. 
Pinnacle is particularly focused on products to store audio and video documents 
in digital formats instead of on magnetic disks or tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hanley, Pinnacle's vice president for operations, said that the 
miscounted inventory involved products shipped over "only a couple of days" at 
the end of the fiscal year, and that the company's inventory was counted 
correctly. "It's more of an accounting principles issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to come with a whole host of recommendations that will be acted 
upon to see this doesn't happen again," Hanley said, though he did not know 
when such changes might be made. Asked if any employees might be disciplined, 
Hanley said such actions were "not being contemplated." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Strand, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon and Co. in Los Angeles, said the 
problem would probably be easy to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're talking about here is timing," he said. "I think the management 
are honest people, but there's some confusion in my mind as to where the 
auditors were at the end of 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's accounting firm, Ernst & Young, which performed the audit of 
Pinnacle Micro's 1993 annual report, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, another Orange County computer company, Irvine-based Platinum 
Software Corp., settled a class-action shareholder lawsuit for $17 million 
after it admitted that it had overstated its revenue over an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 According to its revised numbers, Pinnacle Micro said it earned between $1.4 
million and $1.5 million on revenue of from $36 million to $37 million in 
fiscal 1993. That's down from previously stated earnings of $1.9 million on 
revenue of $39.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First-quarter profit has been revised to a range of $1.1 million and $1.2 
million on net sales of between $15 million and $16 million. The company 
previously stated its net income as $679,000 on revenue of $13.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle Micro officials said that final results for its first and second 
quarters depend on its review of the accounting error. The company also 
announced that it was considering retaining legal counsel, which suggests the 
company expects lawsuits, Glinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Pinnacle Micro's shares fell 17% when the company delayed 
announcing its preliminary second-quarter results. Executive Vice President 
Scott Blum said at the time that the results were delayed because the company 
was considering a shift in the start of its fiscal year to July 1 from Jan. 1 
Pinnacle's Plunge Pinnacle Micro's shares dropped dramatically after Monday's 
announcement that the company's 1993 earnings must be restated. Monthly closing 
stock prices: Monday's close: $11.75

NEWPORT SYSTEMS DEAL COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The acquisition of Newport Systems Solutions by Cisco Systems Inc. of San Jose 
was completed Monday in an all-stock deal valued at $90.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately owned Newport Systems is the developer of a best-selling desktop 
computer networking software product.The company, based in Irvine, was formed 
six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Systems sells the LAN2LAN product line through Novell Inc., the 
nation's largest vendor of communications software. The companies said that 
relationship will continue after the acquisition, which was announced last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the purchase was based on Monday's $21.625 closing price for 
Cisco's stock, which rose 75 cents for the day in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Cisco said the company expects Newport Systems to increase in 
size and does not anticipate any layoffs at the company, which now employs 55 
people. Newport Systems, which recently moved to Irvine from Newport Beach, 
will continue operating under its own name, the Cisco spokesman said.

COMARCO STUNG BY LOSING BID FOR NAVY WORK; DEFENSE: COMPANY MISSES OUT ON 
$400-MILLION CONTRACT AND CURRENT ONE EXPIRES NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Comarco Inc., an engineering and management services company, said Monday that 
it lost out on a $400-million contract at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center 
and that its current five-year, $128-million contract at the facility will 
expire in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The present contract, for providing engineering and manpower support at the 
base, represented about 20% of the company's revenue and operating profit in 
the first six months of the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, we are extremely disappointed we were not selected," Don M. 
Bailey, Comarco president said in a statement. "Our company has been supporting 
the Navy at China Lake for over 30 years, and we had hoped to continue that 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 China Lake is a major Navy weapons testing center on a dry lake bed in the 
Mojave Desert, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. Many base operations are 
run by civilian services, including Comarco. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming contract will consolidate the work being done by several 
suppliers. A Navy spokeswoman at China Lake said that to her knowledge the new 
contractor has not yet been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Evans, Comarco vice president, said the company has not determined how to 
cope with the loss of a contract of this size. The company will press to have 
most of its 150 present employees at China Lake hired by the new contractor, 
whenever it is selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the company has six workers at its Yorba Linda headquarters and about 
40 at its Wireless Communications division in Irvine, which manufactures 
testing devices for cellular telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have to do some restructuring," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Navy's China Lake job was its largest such contract, Comarco also 
has other military subcontracting work on Army and Navy facilities around the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Comarco closed Monday at $4.875, down 12.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading.

 Chamber Leader: James Ramsey, an insurance agent at Mutual of New York and a 
former production manager at Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton, has been elected 
president of the Black Chamber of Commerce of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey, 39, says his goals include hiring a paid executive director to run the 
day-to-day affairs of the 4-year-old chamber, which has 106 members and 
operates an office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In his one-year term, Ramsey said, he hopes to work more closely with other 
minority business groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a challenge," Ramsey said when asked why he took on the volunteer 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for a full-fledged black advocate for businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey says the chamber will hold its first breakfast mixer Aug. 16 from 7:30 
to 9 a.m. at Nordstrom's cafeteria in the Main Place Mall in Santa Ana.

ALLERGAN TO ACQUIRE LENS-MAKING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allergan Inc. said Monday that it plans to acquire Ioptex Research Inc., an 
Irwindale company that makes artificial lenses, for $16 million cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Ioptex, a unit of British health care equipment maker Smith & Nephew PLC, 
makes an intra-ocular lens that replaces the eye's natural lens in cataract 
surgery.The acquisition is part of Irvine-based Allergan's push to increase its 
eye-care business. 
</P>
<P>
 Ioptex posted sales of $39 million and a profit of $400,000 for 1993. The 
company has about 200 employees worldwide. An Allergan spokesman said a 
transition team is working to determine whether any Ioptex employees will be 
laid off after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that, although the company will be an operating unit of Allergan, its 
name will remain on its products. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is subject to Federal Trade Commission approval.

'THE LEAN': IT'S AN ANGRY WORLD OUT THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL BERARDELLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can't remember exactly when I began to notice "The Lean," but I remember the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years back, I was riding my bicycle along a two-lane road near my home 
in Northern Virginia when a car whizzed by me, doing maybe 15 or 20 m.p.h. over 
the speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this was an unusual situation. I've been pedaling regularly for seven 
years, and I've encountered speeders more or less constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 But this guy was a little different. He was so blatant about it -- arrogant, 
even. He never eased his speed to pass me on that narrow road we momentarily 
shared. And he didn't yield an inch. He zoomed by me with only a foot or so to 
spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattled, I watched him as he sped away. He was a young man, late teens or 
early 20s, with a beefy frame, like a weightlifter or football player. 
</P>
<P>
 And I noticed that he was leaning toward the center of his car. His left hand 
gripped the top of the steering wheel, his right shoulder was slumped, and his 
hand rested either on a floor-mounted gearshift or the seat. But his head 
remained upright, as though he was being pulled to one side by a mysterious 
force, and he was straining to keep his equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a striking pose. It suggested assertiveness, overconfidence -- and 
arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm King of the Road," he projected. "Don't mess with me." 
</P>
<P>
 It made me feel very vulnerable on my flimsy, foot-powered machine, to have 
been nearly grazed by two tons of steel steered by the left arm of that young 
hulk.  
</P>
<P>
 I have since noticed that The Lean seems to be very common among young men. It 
doesn't matter whether they are alone, in pairs or accompanied by young women. 
If they drive aggressively, they almost always display that posture. 
</P>
<P>
 Where could such a pose have come from? And what might it say about the nature 
of today's young men? 
</P>
<P>
 During my own young manhood, in the early '60s, the standard pose behind the 
wheel was the opposite: right arm draped over the top of the steering wheel, 
left elbow crooked out the window, and head and shoulders resting comfortably 
back against the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bold souls even drove with their left arms hanging down outside their 
cars. An unfortunate friend of mine, tooling around in an MG convertible, lost 
his left arm in just that position when he suddenly lost control and slammed 
into a retaining wall. Perhaps it's just as well that the dangling-arm position 
has become passe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a minor but curious thing: Sometime in the recent past, the common 
posture of young men behind the wheel changed. Yet I can't think of a single 
triggering act. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not, for instance, like 60 years ago, when Clark Gable, in the movie "It 
Happened One Night," stripped off his shirt in front of Claudette Colbert and 
revealed his bare chest. All over America, women swooned and men began leaving 
their undershirts in their dresser drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular trends have occasionally emerged from memorable poses or actions by 
culture heroes: the early Marlon Brando's smoldering hulk; James Dean's laconic 
lost soul; Elvis Presley's dreamy-eyed, canted-lipped bumpkin; Eddie Murphy's 
wide-grinned smart aleck. 
</P>
<P>
 In my youth, I was into sophistication, so I fixated for a time on the 
drop-dead stare leveled by Sean Connery's James Bond at prospective consorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Results aren't paramount here (good thing, too). Mannerisms are emulated 
because they mask our insecurities. They are perceived, instinctively, to be 
effective tools, either to attract women or to improve one's status in the 
social hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lean is different. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't seem to have an overt cause. Rather, it appears to be a collective 
and spontaneous development -- an evolutionary one, perhaps, something that has 
bubbled up from a deep place in our anthropological roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Primitive behavioral reflexes tend to surface during emotional situations. 
Driving, for many young men, is surely emotional. It represents a time of 
asserting masculinity, of gaining position in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving is also pack behavior, although it is no longer confined to males. 
Women now occupy the roads roughly in proportion to their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I haven't seen women displaying The Lean. Neither does it seem to exist 
among men older than 40. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also human nature to resent confinement, and we Americans have an 
especially low tolerance for situations in which our freedom of movement is 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 The car companies' ad agencies are very conscious of these drives, so to 
speak. Their commercials frequently promote the illusion of uncontrolled 
velocity. An Acura Integra is perched at the top of a roller coaster. An 
announcer boasts of a Cadillac's ability to reach 150 miles an hour. A 
Chevrolet Camaro is shown in a slow-motion skid. A Lexus ad touts its ability 
to out-corner a BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 But you almost never see a commercial where the car is in a real driving 
situation -- in other words, in traffic. They're always gliding alone on an 
empty, scenic highway, churning up leaves and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the fine print, nasty reality must be acknowledged. The ads carry the 
common disclaimer: "Professional driver on closed course. Do not attempt these 
maneuvers." The images don't represent the road. They are purchase-eliciting 
fantasies aimed at the gullible. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, whenever young men take these powerful machines into highway 
situations, where traffic flow is frequently restricted and mobility greatly 
depends on the self-control and rationality of all motorists, the images from 
the ads linger in the subconscious. There is a constant temptation to test the 
limits of a situation -- to try to make a little headway at the expense and 
risk of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, someone makes a foolish mistake and pays the price, with dented 
metal, injured flesh or oblivion, while everyone else's mobility is 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 It's practically a daily occurrence on every major urban highway. But many of 
those who escape the worst of the consequences were playing the same game. 
</P>
<P>
 Such situations elicit defensive postures, especially the display of 
aggressiveness. We all carry the genetic wiring of millions of years. It still 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Among young men -- whether in today's generation raised on the artificial 
violence of culture and sports, or in ancient tribal life where mortal combat 
was practically a daily occurrence -- an aggressive posture is frequent 
requirement.  
</P>
<P>
 Young drivers of my generation gave only a hint of the primal, contained in 
the vague message, "I'm cool." That laid-back driving posture was as much an 
expression of pleasure -- we were mostly just glad to be on the road -- than 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Not The Lean. It's fear and anger, sculpting young men who contribute bedlam 
to our highways. "I don't care about you," it declares, "or anything else in my 
path." It's a small but unnerving sign, a little societal backslide toward the 
disassociated, the inarticulate, the primitive. 
</P>
<P>
 I've gotten so I can spot The Lean a mile away. It's commonplace to me now. 
Several times, just in the past few days, fast-moving vehicles have brushed 
past my bicycle. The drivers were all the same: right shoulder dropped, upper 
body tilted, head erect. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel strangely smug as I watch these young men tool on down the road, like 
I'm an anthropologist whose theory has been validated. 
</P>
<P>
 Others may rely on scholarly studies, polls, or the latest blurbs from USA 
Today or People magazine to assess the mood and direction of modern life. I'll 
continue to use my observations collected from my two-wheeled perch. 
</P>
<P>
 That silly, sour posture speaks volumes.

FEMINISTS FACE OFF IN WAR OVER MENOPAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA WARRICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unpalatable truth must be faced that all post-menopausal women are 
castrates . . . . Our streets abound with them -- walking stiffly in twos and 
threes, seeing little and observing less. It is not unusual to see an erect man 
of 75 vigorously striding along on a golf course, but never a woman of this 
age. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the first time in history, women may share the promise of tomorrow as 
biological equals of men. Thanks to hormone therapy, they can be feminine 
forever.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Dr. Robert A. Wilson 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 30 years since the original estrogen evangelist, Dr. Robert A. 
Wilson, brought us the breathtaking news: Menopause can be cured! 
</P>
<P>
 The "change of life," Wilson reported in his hot bestseller "Feminine 
Forever," was just another disease -- not unlike diabetes or other hormone 
deficiencies. And like some other diseases, it could be treated, even 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 For the "tragedy of menopause" -- and its 26 awesome symptoms from frigidity 
to suicide -- the balding Brooklyn gynecologist fed his patients "youth pills" 
of pure estrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from the shackles of hormone deprivation, he predicted, aging women of 
the future would universally reclaim their sexuality, stand up straight, even 
play golf. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the future is here. But the legions of women taking hormones to "escape 
the horror of living decay," as Wilson put it, are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the great menopause debate.  
</P>
<P>
 On one side, there are the "I Love My Menopause!" feminists who see "The 
Change" as the perfect time to celebrate the end of life as a sex object. "No 
longer am I a servant of the species!" crows one such believer. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from the New Agers and naturalists, they urge us to go with the 
flow, so to speak. Menopause is a breeze, they say -- or can be with the right 
combination of vitamins, herbs, acupuncture and knees folded into chests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the biomedical camp are the Freudians, the drug companies, a good many 
doctors and other scientists who have seized the symptoms of ovarian shutdown 
as yet another opportunity for better living through chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hormone replacement therapy, argue these guys -- yes, most of them are guys -- 
promises a veritable fountain of youth for over-the-hill gals. It is estimated 
that 15% to 20% of menopausal-age women are now using hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a feminist with hot flashes to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the natural childbirth crusade all over again," says Pam Cosby, 
director of an Indiana women's clinic. "We learned all the breathing and 
exercises so we wouldn't disappoint and then when we found out we needed drugs 
to get through it, we were devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 A former leader of New York City's National Organization for Women says she 
pored over stacks of medical literature before reluctantly deciding to begin a 
regimen of hormone supplements at age 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "I vowed I would not feel guilty about taking hormones, and I don't," she 
says. "But if you print my name, I'm through." 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of selling out the sisterhood is palpable in some parts of the women's 
movement these days.  
</P>
<P>
 With new bibles on how to do menopause from Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer, 
women eager to be politically correct are feeling angry and confused. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco author writing about her decision to go against the feminist 
party line recalls that she was prepared to feel bullied by the medical 
Establishment -- "but not by those sworn to protect women from patronizing 
men." 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Area psychotherapist Alexandra Gotsch confessed recently to Menopause News 
that as a feminist, she thought that if middle-aged women became depressed, "it 
was because they have emotional problems which happen to coincide with 
menopause and are not caused by it." 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed, she wrote, "when my personal experience forced a 
reassessment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Friedan's book, "The Fountain of Age," the mother of the modern women's 
movement dismisses menopause as something that apparently happened to her, but 
not so as she would notice. 
</P>
<P>
 What did pique Friedan's attention as she charged into her research on aging, 
however, was the intensification of what she calls "a new brouhaha" about 
menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own feelings of uneasiness and dismay increased," she wrote. "I didn't 
exactly suspect a new conspiracy against women, which was somehow co-opting us. 
But there seemed to be a suspicious coincidence of the demographic emergence of 
this incredible market -- 50 million women hitting menopausal age -- with the 
revived definition of menopause as disease." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Greer began exhorting women to embrace age as "an art." 
Menopause, she promised, was a time to explore the freedom of being non-sexual. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be unwanted is also to be free," the author of the "The Female Eunuch" 
reassures us today. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the post-menopausal Greer, menopause brings one "back into the 
self you were before you became a tool of your sexual and reproductive 
destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about mood swings. In the fight for women's liberation, Greer was the 
spokeswoman for a generation of women who routinely fought the notion that they 
were prisoners of their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cramps and monthly mood swings had no place in our battles," recalls 
therapist Gotsch. 
</P>

 So now that science has shown menopause can be "cured," the question remains: 
Should it be? 
</P>
<P>
 Until the turn of the century, most women didn't survive long enough to be 
troubled by menopause or its politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a fashionable new argument for the use of estrogen and progesterone 
supplements to restore pre-menopausal hormone balance is to look at the 
cessation of menses as an evolutionary oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 In ancient times, any woman who lived to see The Change was put on a pedestal 
and worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
 According to goddess historians, such survivors were believed to possess great 
powers and were given the title Great Crone, 
She-Who-Holds-Her-Blood-to-Make-Wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as outspoken, body-savvy baby boomers approach their own menstrual 
pauses, menopause is a cause celebre. 
</P>
<P>
 As 21 million American women bear down on this milestone over the next decade, 
menopause is expected to replace kids, shrinks, even mortgage rates as the hot 
topic for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer a mere medical event, the phase-out of fertility has become a 
political rallying point at which to reflect on the very essence of womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who fought for reproductive freedom in their 20s and had their first 
babies in their 30s and 40s now want to know everything and control everything 
about the next phase: the alarmingly titled c limacteric.  
</P>
<P>
 Emboldened by their ability to revolutionize women's health care, they are 
determined to take charge .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike other female uprisings, the villains here are not obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the multinational pharmaceutical companies are still in the lineup, 
say the feminaturalists. 
</P>
<P>
 To this latest harangue against sexism, ageism, greedy drug companies and the 
male medical model has been added a new group of co-conspirators -- the 
menopausal women themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, a support group has formed to steel women against the power 
of hormonal temptation. "It's based on AA," one member explains. "We don't want 
to give in to our symptoms -- hot flashes, depression, headaches, whatever -- 
and ask for a prescription." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the debate is not just the safety of hormone replacement 
therapy, but the very question of what makes a woman a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it hormones? Is it ovaries? Or is it a female state of mind? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very upsetting to be caught in the middle of this," confides the leader 
of one Southwestern menopause support group who is secretly devoted to hormone 
replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be a much simpler decision than it is," concedes T. Keta Hodgson, 
coordinator of the Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although trained as a nurse, Hodgson recognizes the value of alternative 
answers. For example, she has found that cutting back on refined sugar can be 
helpful for certain symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Refinements in hormone replacement regimens have almost universally convinced 
doctors that it is safe for most women who want it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many recent studies suggest that the risks of cancer -- mainly breast and 
endometrial cancer -- are minimal compared to the protection hormones can offer 
from the more common threats of heart disease, osteoporosis, even Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increasingly volatile politics of menopause is affecting the very 
research that will answer the questions about hormone replacement's full 
effects. Hodgson and others say strong feelings for or against use of hormones 
have kept many women away from their scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a backlash to the backlash, I suppose," Hodgson says. "I'm seeing lots 
of passion on both sides of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Can a woman re-balance her hormones without being a traitor to her nature, her 
sex, her true self? 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," A.P. of Katonah, New York, recently wrote to a women's 
newsletter, "we are all acting peculiar."

UNMASKING THE MYTH; WHILE FIGHTING FOR URANIUM MINERS, STEWART UDALL CAME TO 
STARTLING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT U.S. NUCLEAR POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stewart Udall is talking about 50 years of secrecy and deception by government 
officials obsessed with nuclear weapons, when he is interrupted by a phone 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends several minutes in the next room talking to the family of one of 
hundreds of uranium miners he has represented in a 16-year legal battle with 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Udall returns looking glum. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new diagnosis of lung cancer," he says. "They just keep coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 The miners, many of them Navajos, were exposed to deadly concentrations of 
radon gas 40 years ago while digging uranium ore in several southwestern states 
for the nation's expanding nuclear arsenal. The link between the radioactive 
gas and incidence of lung disease was established and, according to testimony 
before Congress in the late 1970s, the government knew many miners would 
develop cancer and other lung ailments, but never warned them of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Udall, a former congressman and Secretary of the Interior, led a drive for 
legislation after federal judges dismissed lawsuits brought by miners and 
cancer-plagued "down-winders" (people who lived near the Nevada Test Site) on 
grounds of sovereign immunity -- the doctrine that the government cannot be 
sued without its consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the federal Radiation Exposure Compensation Act has made 
reparations to some sick miners and survivors, but many claims are being 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're interpreting this law very strictly and denying half of them," Udall 
says. "The Justice Department operates on the assumption that people would lie 
in order to qualify. That assumption is outrageous when you understand the 
Navajo Indians and their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Helene Goldberg, director of the Justice Department branch that administers 
the program, concedes that half the claims have been rejected, but says many of 
them were for illnesses not covered by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have consistently gotten these criticisms from Mr. Udall and they're just 
not founded," Goldberg says. "More than occasionally, someone doesn't qualify, 
but those eligibility standards were set by Congress." The program has 
dispersed close to $200 million since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Udall, who took the cases on a contingent fee basis, paid for the expenses of 
litigation through fund raising and out of his own pocket and for years 
received no legal fees. He now receives fees out of the compensation program 
limited by law to 10% of whatever his clients are awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Udall, who earns a modest income from lecturing, writing and legal 
work, stick with the miners? "Where I come from, if you take on a job, you 
finish it," he says. "Particularly when you look at the tragedy inflicted on 
these people -- I just couldn't let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Udall's outrage at this and every other aspect of U.S. nuclear policy is 
expressed in his new book, "The Myths of August" (Pantheon), which grew out of 
his handling of the uranium miners' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtitled "A Personal Exploration of Our Tragic Cold War Affair with the 
Atom," the book portray's Udall's view that leaders and scientists, intoxicated 
by the awesome power of nuclear weapons, forged a secret "national security 
state" answerable to no one. 
</P>
<P>
 His most startling conclusion is that, decades of official assurances to the 
contrary, there was no military need for the United States to drop atomic bombs 
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the assaults that ended the war with Japan in 
August, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 For Udall personally, the 11 years he spent researching and writing the book 
forced an anguished reassessment of his heroes, including Presidents Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and Secretary of War Henry Stimson. 
</P>
<P>
 At 74, Udall is well-suited to his subject. 
</P>
<P>
 He experienced war as a gunner aboard a B-24 bomber in World War II. He later 
became a lawyer, and in the 1950s served three terms as an Arizona congressman. 
As Secretary of the Interior under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. 
Johnson, Udall helped preserve vast tracts of wilderness and write far-reaching 
environmental legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a preacher," he confesses. "My wife says I preach too much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Udall's passion for public policy debate is remarkable, given that he has been 
out of government for a quarter-century. He left Washington in 1979 for Phoenix 
to work on the uranium miner cases. Lee, his wife of 47 years, and four of 
their six children assisted as investigators and by doing legal work. The 
Udalls settled in Santa Fe a few years ago to be near several children and 
grandchildren (son Tom is New Mexico's attorney general). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his liberal political leanings and willingness to skewer sacred cows, 
Udall is the product of an old-fashioned upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in St. John's, a town of 1,200 in northeastern Arizona not far from 
the Zuni and Navajo reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Udall's father was a Mormon lay leader and country lawyer who became chief 
justice of Arizona. With his five siblings (including brother Morris, who would 
succeed him in Congress), Stewart lived on a small subsistence farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Myths of August" relates Udall's Cold War odyssey. Like many in his 
generation, he accepted the rationale for the arms race. Then he visited the 
Soviet Union in 1962, the first member of Kennedy's Cabinet to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by his friend, the poet Robert Frost, Udall took an 11-day tour, 
meeting engineers and others who were developing the country's resources. He 
and Frost also met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center of Cold War thinking was that the Soviet Union was a monolith and 
it was reaching out to dominate the world," Udall says. "I didn't see any 
hostility. I didn't sense any." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, Udall watched skeptically as Johnson escalated the war in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us in the domestic side of the Cabinet in those last five years under 
Johnson were doves," Udall says. "I think he knew that, but our opinions 
weren't sought." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Udall took the miner cases in the late 1970s, his conversion to 
distrust of government was complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just having to dig out the facts about these tragedies made me question all 
my assumptions," he says. "The harder I looked at it, the more I saw this 
culture. They proudly lied because they were patriots defending the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Myths of August" is most riveting when Udall probes the use of atomic 
bombs on Japan in August, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 It has long been said that if the bombs had not been used, as many as a 
million Americans would have died invading the Japanese home islands. But 
according to materials Udall cites from the National Archives, secret military 
estimates at the time put the number at between 20,000 and 46,000 deaths in 
action -- if an invasion were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the myths of August is we faced another year of a brutal war if we 
didn't do it," Udall says. "You talk to anybody who was a soldier in that war. 
It's embedded in their mind that the bomb ended the war and saved their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 But Japan was already defeated. With its Navy lying at the bottom of the 
Pacific and Allied bombers established within easy range of the home island, 
Japan could not import the petroleum and raw materials needed to continue 
fighting. It was only a matter of time before Japan capitulated, Udall argues. 
</P>
<P>
 Udall thinks the man most responsible for the bombings, which killed more than 
100,000 Japanese civilians, was Stimson, a distinguished elder statesman who 
had honorably served a long line of Presidents, beginning with William Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the war lasted three months longer, with all the killing and 
everything else, because he thought it was important to see what kind of weapon 
this was," Udall says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the months after the bombing and Japan's surrender, another of what Udall 
regards as the myths of August, 1945 took shape: a well-orchestrated government 
public relations effort to tout the peaceful use of atomic energy. The promise 
of cheap, reliable energy led to the headlong construction of heavily 
subsidized nuclear power plants in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, with the onset of the Cold War, the development of bigger, better 
nuclear weapons took on new urgency. Yet the whole process was shrouded in 
secrecy, overseen by the Atomic Energy Commission, Udall says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The AEC people really developed an attitude that they were the front line of 
defense," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first casualties of that mind-set were American ideals of honesty and fair 
play, Udall says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War era "was really a replication of World War II," he says. 
"Deception became a way of life. They justified it on the basis that this was a 
war situation and you had to sacrifice morality." 
</P>
<P>
 Some scholars who have studied the origins of America's nuclear policy 
question Udall's conclusions. John Mearsheimer, a professor of political 
science at the University of Chicago who studies nuclear policy, contends that 
the development and deployment of nuclear weapons maintained the peace, brought 
the Soviets to their knees and helped preserve a civilian-controlled government 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nuclear weapons are the ideal middle-class weapons for Americans," he says. 
"They provide massive amounts of deterrence on the cheap. If we hadn't had 
nuclear weapons, we would have had to have a much larger conventional army." 
</P>
<P>
 Mearsheimer also thinks that the emphasis Udall and others have placed on the 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings is misplaced, because the March 10, 1945, 
firebombing of Tokyo, which killed more than 80,000 civilians, was easily as 
destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mearsheimer says critics of America's Cold War strategy have forgotten how 
serious the Soviet threat once appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the Cold War is over with, it's kind of hard to take the Soviet 
Union seriously," he says. "We won, period. We ran them into the ground and 
that was the name of the game. It was a strategy of preponderance." 
</P>
<P>
 With "The Myths of August" behind him, Udall still represents miners with 
claims under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. He still spends most 
mornings writing. He tends to legal business in the afternoon, checking in with 
his youngest son, Jay, who runs the office, interviews clients, and researches 
medical records and employment histories. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad doesn't pay a lot of attention to details," Jay confides. "He's the 
heavy hitter when the Justice Department needs a tongue-lashing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lately Udall senior has been trying to get the compensation law liberalized by 
arguing that the miners were really subjects of a gruesome medical experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Udall keeps a low profile locally out of deference to his attorney general 
son, but he recently joined other residents in dissuading actress Shirley 
MacLaine from building a controversial home on 37 acres of ridge-top land 
adjoining the national forest. 
</P>
<P>
 He also couldn't resist proffering political advice to Roberto Mondragon, a 
former Democratic lieutenant governor running for governor on the Green Party 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he's learning to enjoy the perspective that accompanies elder 
statesman status. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great advantage of old age," he says, "if you keep your mind open and 
lively and thinking and arguing, is you can see more of the landscape."

BODY WATCH; KICK OFF THE FLAB; THE MARTIAL ARTS MIGHT LET YOU GET THE DROP ON 
AN ATTACKER--AND DROP A FEW POUNDS TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS RUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What sort of fitness program helps you fight off both flab and bad guys? 
</P>
<P>
 Martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of academies across Southern California teach self-defense techniques 
from all over the globe, from boxing and karate to more exotic forms, such as 
Israeli Krav Maga, Brazilian capoeira and French savate.  
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream gyms such as the Sports Connection and even the sweaty old YMCA 
offer classes for men and women of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a good turnout for our boxing, kick-boxing and Kung fu classes," says 
Tamara Provance of the Hollywood-Wilshire Y. "People really like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martial arts -- some of them thousands of years old -- are also leaping in 
popularity in Bruce Lee and "Karate Kid" movies and on television, from ESPN to 
pay-per-view Ultimate Fighting Championship programs on cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Studying any of the martial arts can build self-confidence and give you the 
skills to defend yourself. And doctors, chiropractors and mental health 
professionals say there may be other benefits as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're burned out on -- or bored by -- pumping weights and climbing fake 
stairs, the defense disciplines combine a body-toning workout with mental focus 
and personal safety. The basic moves of kicking and punching work the whole 
body, and classes should begin and end with stretching warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Joe Lombardi of the Beverly Hills Police Department holds a black belt in 
the Korean art of tae kwon do and has studied a couple of other martial arts. 
He is "wholeheartedly in agreement" that martial arts can provide a tremendous 
workout, and that the skills can and should be used for self-defense under 
certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is holding a gun to your head, give up your car or money," he 
says. "But if you're attacked, you can fight back and have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Capoeira is a graceful hybrid of combat and dance created a couple of 
centuries ago by Africans in Brazil. It's probably the most acrobatic and 
visual of the martial arts -- with plenty of flips, cartwheels and handstands. 
Mestre (master) Amen Santo runs a capoeira academy at the Brasil Cultural 
Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the twists, kicks and cartwheels, the capoeiristas move two by 
two across the floor in dance-like steps. As Santo sings and bangs out rhythms 
with congas, tambourine and berimbau, two people enter the circle, join hands, 
and then cartwheel into action with a series of sweeping kicks, feints, lunges 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal trainer, massage therapist and acupuncture student Rod Ussing has 
studied capoeira for more than 18 months. He appreciates the Brazilian style as 
much for its art as for its almost complete physical workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a complete workout with a variety of movements, and work more muscle 
groups than in the martial arts that just use kicking and punching," Ussing 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, capoeira doesn't have much contact, so it's less shocking to the joints. 
And its graceful moves promote the flow of axe (energy) through the body. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So that one may walk in peace. That's how grand master Imi Lichtenfeld sums up 
the purpose of studying Krav Maga (contact combat), a form he created for 
Israeli troops nearly half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A star athlete and coach in his native Czechoslovakia, Lichtenfeld studied the 
instinctive reactions to various forms of attack and then designed defenses 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Students work out in sweats rather than the ghi of most Asian martial arts, 
although the kicks, punches, elbows and knees of Krav Maga frequently resemble 
those forms. Most of the time, students pair up and take turns attacking and 
defending, using heavy pads to absorb the punishing blows. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. chief instructor Darren Levine, who has been teaching for 
more than 10 years, Krav Maga requires less training than other self-defense 
techniques because "you go with what is already in you -- instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine and his wife, Marni, the highest-ranking female instructor in the 
country, teach at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. DEA and FBI agents 
and the Beverly Hills Police Department SWAT Team have taken classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Krav Maga is one technique that's strictly about what works on the street -- 
it is not a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to kick someone in the head, knock him to the ground first and 
then kick him in the head," says Levine, scoffing at the effort wasted on 
flashy moves in some other disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another once-obscure form finding popularity is savate, kick-boxing with a 
French accent, which dates to the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Monaghan, who teaches savate at Boulevard Health Club in Los Angeles, says 
it combines some of the best kicks and punches from other martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monaghan's classes, students strike the classic boxing pose, with gloved 
hands raised. Punches are pretty much out of boxing, too, but kicks to the 
knees, thighs and lower body pack most of the punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Monaghan is working at Boulevard with Tony Cortes, who trained Linda Hamilton 
for "Terminator 2" and continues to train her several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes earned a physical education degree from Cal State Fullerton's sports 
medicine program. He and Monaghan are developing a program of martial arts for 
ultimate physical conditioning, combining moves from several defense 
disciplines to create a workout with greater fat-burning and cardiovascular 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 They use a heart monitor to gauge the client's level of exertion. With it, 
they can determine the best combination of moves to maximize cardiovascular 
exertion -- without exceeding health limits, but without the stop-and-go of the 
usual martial arts class.  
</P>
<P>
 For Monaghan, who holds black belts in three martial arts and has studied half 
a dozen more, the arts are more than just a good workout or means of 
self-defense. The discipline and spirituality inherent in them helped Monaghan 
survive a troubled adolescence, and he now teaches actors, dancers and gymnasts 
(through the UCLA Theater Department) to coordinate mind and body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Self-confidence and esteem go hand in hand through martial arts, not because 
you can kick ass, but more because you learn how to take care of your body and 
how to avoid confrontations," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Jim Pathman, a blue belt who studied Krav Maga for five years 
before a weightlifting injury sidelined him, was one of the first in Los 
Angeles to learn the form. He noticed an enormous effect on some of the younger 
people in those early classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids didn't make eye contact initially, but after a few months they 
became outgoing, assertive, affectionate and confident," Pathman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a psychologist, part of what I recommend to patients who have children 
with self-esteem problems and learning disabilities is some form of martial 
art. It is also very therapeutic and curative for victims (of crime and 
abuse)," Pathman says, adding that exercise is one of the classic treatments 
for depression because patients will experience increased energy from using 
their bodies physically. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiropractor Daniel Sovetky, a third degree black belt and Krav Maga teacher, 
believes a main fitness benefit of the classes is the stretching period in the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, then there's the element of self-defense. Says Sovetky: "Many 
students have come and told me, 'You saved my life.' "

A POET OF THE ORDINARY; ART: KEITH CARTER'S PHOTOGRAPHS, NOW SHOWING AT G. RAY 
HAWKINS GALLERY, REFLECT AN AFFINITY FOR RURAL AMERICANA AND FOR 'UNSUNG 
HEROES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "I was once at a lecture given by the writer Horton Foote, and he made the 
observation that in order to be an artist you have to belong to a place, and 
that idea really hit home with me," says artist Keith Carter, a Texas-based 
photographer whose work is on view in Los Angeles for the first time, at the G. 
Ray Hawkins Gallery through Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that I'd been scattering myself and running away from Beaumont, 
Texas, where I was raised, but that deep down I really loved it. So, I decided 
to just let it course through me -- and that's when I started making the 
pictures I wanted to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's affinity for the rural South permeates every picture he takes, and 
it's been central to each of the books he's published. In "From Uncertain to 
Blue," published in 1988, Carter explored small Texas towns, while "The Blue 
Man" out four years later, focused exclusively on east Texas. His 1992 book, 
"Mojo," examined black folklore of the South, while Carter's next book, "The 
Heaven of Animals" -- slated to be published next year by Rice University Press 
-- is a series of portraits of Southern people and animals.

 "It's not a popular idea around here, but I believe this is an extraordinary 
region," says the 46-year-old artist, speaking by phone from Beaumont, where he 
lives with his wife of 20 years, Pat, and a dog named Rosie. "And, the thing 
that distinguishes the South from the rest of the country is its black culture 
-- it's a palpable presence here in everything from folk art and religion to 
music and language, and it moves me deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 Working in black and white, and citing Henri Cartier-Bresson and Eugene Atget 
as seminal influences, Carter favors a classical style of photography that's a 
bit out of vogue at the moment, but never really loses its audience. 
Conceptually straightforward and unabashedly beautiful, Carter's timeless, 
graceful pictures are like the photographic equivalent of comfort food -- 
looking at them makes you feel better. Some of Carter's pictures were clearly 
caught on the wing (this is particularly true of his pictures of animals), 
others are carefully composed and lit. All, however, are freighted with mystery 
and tenderness. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "People's lives are a lot more fragile than most of us want each other to 
know, and that region of fragility is what I try to illuminate in my pictures," 
says Carter, who's taught photography at Lamar University in Beaumont for the 
past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like imperfection -- people with crooked teeth or a woman whose slip is 
showing -- and I'm interested in the poetry of the ordinary. It's not a 
terribly original thought, but I have an abiding love for ordinary people and 
unsung heroes. It's what moves me the most, and I need to be moved in order to 
take pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Madison, Wis., the eldest in a family of three children, Carter has 
lived in east Texas since the age of four, when he was introduced to the 
camera. "I grew up around photography," recalls Carter, a soft-spoken gentleman 
who says wonderfully Southern things like "I beg your pardon" and "Thank you, 
ma'am." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was four, my father deserted our family and left my mother to raise 
us," he continues. "Prior to marrying, she'd traveled around the Midwest 
photographing college girls, so she opened a studio and took pictures of 
children as a way of supporting us. At night she'd turn our kitchen into a 
darkroom, and my sister and I would lie on pallets on the floor watching her 
work. She didn't consider what she was doing art -- she saw it strictly as a 
way of supporting the family -- but I was entranced by her work when I was 
young." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until he was 18 when it occurred to Carter that he might want to 
take pictures himself, but when the idea hit, it hit with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until then I'd had no involvement with fine art," says Carter, who's 
essentially self-taught, "but I was lucky enough to befriend a sculptor in 
Beaumont who had a great art library -- which, needless to say, was a rarity in 
these parts. His books really lit a fire under me. Then, when I was 25, I took 
the bus to New York and spent a month looking at the photography collection at 
the Museum of Modern Art. That experience left me completely obsessed, so when 
I returned to Beaumont I got a studio with no phone or air conditioning for $75 
a month, and just worked and worked. After about 10 years of that, I finally 
began to arrive at a style of my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter supplements his income as an artist with commercial work, and he's done 
album cover photography for several musicians, including Merle Haggard, George 
Strait, Los Lobos, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and R.E.M. (Michael Stipe's admiration 
for "Mojo" led to Carter's work being seen on R.E.M's next album due out late 
this year.) One might assume such liaisons would make Carter something of a 
celebrity in the small town of Beaumont, but such is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody takes me seriously here or cares about what I do -- and I don't lament 
that fact because it allows me to get a lot done," Carter says, laughing. "This 
is an insanely peculiar place, and that's a big part of the reason why I don't 
think I'll ever exhaust the South as the subject matter for my art."

GETTING MELLOW: THE EVOLUTION OF PAULY SHORE; ACTING: THE DEATH OF HIS 
EX-GIRLFRIEND, A PORN FILM ACTRESS, MAY BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE COMEDIAN'S 
LIFE. HE WANTS TO SHED HIS PARTY-BOY PERSONA.

 Pauly Shore looks upset as he curls into a fetal position on an expansive sofa 
at the Bel Age Hotel. In fact, the 26-year-old former MTV personality and teen 
pop icon could not be more unlike the hyper-hysterical-surfer-space-cadet that, 
over the past few years, has made him the idol of aspiring slackers and bete 
noire of any sane person over 25. Something is very wrong with Pauly. Several 
minutes into the interview to discuss his film "In the Army Now," which opens 
Friday. Shore uncurls himself, sits up and asks: 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what just went down, don't you?" His visitor looks perplexed. "My 
ex-girlfriend, the porn star, just killed herself." 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-July, 23-year-old Shannon Wilsey, who was known as porn superstar 
Savannah, shot herself in the head just hours after crashing her white Corvette 
and injuring her face. Shore sinks back into the couch and discusses his 
ex-lover. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the nicest, most beautiful girl I ever met," he says softly. "It was 
a very dramatic thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why she killed herself, he says: "She became Savannah. She became her 
character, who was into drugs, and needed reassurance all the time. She forgot 
who Shannon was." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple broke up in late 1992 after 11 months, and then Wilsey's life took 
a downward slide. "I knew she wanted out (of the porn business)," he says. "She 
said to me: 'What do I do? I don't know anything else.' " Now he looks upset. 
"Her looks were semi-starting to fade -- that was tough for her. She wanted a 
little family, but she felt that her past was going to haunt her so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Shore says he was with her when she died in St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank. 
He pauses, staring blankly, then mutters: "That's the main thing in this 
business: Don't become your character. Grow up and learn. Life is your biggest 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 If Shore is visibly shaken by Wilsey's death, it nonetheless could be a 
turning point for him. After five years of perfecting his obnoxious man-child 
shtick as a stand-up comic, as the host of MTV's "Totally Pauly" show and as 
the star of last year's unexpected fish-out-of-water film hit "Son-in-Law," 
Shore is taking great pains to distance himself from his old persona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pauly's appeal is evolving," says "In the Army Now" director Daniel Petrie 
Jr. "He is growing up, whether he likes it or not, and his audience is growing 
up with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Shore seems ruefully aware of his space-cadet legacy, which was spawned 
during his two-year stint as the host of "Totally Pauly." He has said that 
starring in a movie was a chance to show the film industry that he was not on 
drugs and that he could be responsible. Pauly still insists that despite his 
party-boy persona, he has always eschewed hard drugs of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian credits his pedigree as the son of veteran comedian Sammy Shore 
and Comedy Store owner Mitzi Shore as providing the rarified background for 
learning Hollywood survival early on. "Growing up around the Comedy Store and 
seeing so many comedians transfer from stand-up to the movies, I knew how 
important it was to be on time and to respect your elders," he says. "I saw too 
many other comedians (expletive) up. I always said to myself that when I got a 
break, I wasn't going to screw up." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, few industry insiders ever thought that the first two movies on his 
three-picture deal with Disney would be hits. But 1992's low-budget "Encino 
Man" grossed more than $40 million domestically; "Son-in-Law," more than $36 
million. "In the Army Now" isn't likely to sweep next year's Academy Awards, 
but it may succeed in showing another dimension in the Pauly persona -- and not 
just because he got his trademark long locks buzzed on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Preview audiences have gasped as the Army barber shoves Shore into a chair and 
gives him a buzzcut, which he sports for the rest of the film. "I didn't know 
it was going to be such a big ordeal," he says. "After they scalped me, I had 
hundreds of people going: 'Oh, my God! What'd ya do that for?"' 
</P>
<P>
 "The two immediate identifying factors for Pauly are his hair and his 
clothes," says director Petrie. "And for 'Army,' the first thing we did was 
shave his head and throw him in a uniform. So he's working naked, if you will." 
</P>
<P>
 Without any irony, Shore cites Tom Hanks as an actor whose career path he 
would like to follow. "He started out doing 'Bosom Buddies' and 'Bachelor 
Party' and brainless stuff like that. But the brainless stuff is fun stuff -- I 
don't regret where I've put myself." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, Shore called his many critics "bitter and jealous" of 
his success. Now, a considerably mellower Shore fosters no such ill will. "I've 
read things from the critics who don't like what I do and that's fine," he 
says. And when asked what he thinks is the source of the criticism, he replies: 
"I think it's about the womanizing thing. I don't know what to say about that. 
I'm a man. If it was a girl, she'd be talking about a guy. There's no way I can 
win. I try to be nice to everyone."  
</P>
<P>
 Shore's romantic life has been undeniably conspicuous. "I'm in a real weird 
situation as far as women are concerned," he says. "It's like almost impossible 
for me not to cheat on a girlfriend because of the situation I'm in. When I go 
on the road, I'll meet this hot chick and she will want to be with me, or she 
won't want to be with me but just hang with me. And I can't handle the guilt of 
going home and seeing my girl and knowing that she's been faithful and knowing 
that I haven't. So I can't have a girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Shore's last three relationships have all lasted less than a year. "Then it 
gets to a point where they either move in or you break up," he explains. "And I 
didn't want to get deeper into quicksand." 
</P>
<P>
 Shore has just completed his third comedy album, "Pink Digilly-Digilly," due 
out this month on Priority Records. "It's probably the heaviest thing that I've 
done," he says. Unlike his first two albums, this album is much more 
autobiographical, containing vignettes on oral sex, high colonics and the Marky 
Mark/Calvin Klein billboard on Sunset Boulevard. "People are going to want it 
because it's just sooo weird."

NOTHING ARTIFICIAL ADDED; JUST PLAIN FOLK AGAIN, THE SWEETHEARTS OF THE RODEO 
ARE TAKING AN ACOUSTIC SPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there life after country stardom? For Janis Gill and Kristine Arnold, the 
sister duo better known as the Sweethearts of the Rodeo, the dwindling of their 
country hits and the subsequent end of their contract with Columbia Records led 
not only to personal rejuvenation but to some of the best music they've ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill and Arnold, who play the Coach House tonight, have returned to their folk 
and bluegrass roots with a wonderful acoustic-based album, "Rodeo Waltz," on 
the independent Sugar Hill label. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone last week from her Nashville home, Gill discussed the 
Sweethearts' transition from country hit-makers, who pulled five hit singles 
from their debut album in 1986, to acoustic music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we were trying too hard to make records for the radio," she said. "I 
think that's a trap. It's hard to avoid sometimes when you have a few hits and 
then you try to re-create the last record, but different." In any case, by the 
Sweethearts' third album, "Buffalo Zone," the hits had stopped coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Kristine and I started reaching a little too far away from where 
we're most comfortable," Gill continued, "and that's kind of natural. You want 
to try other things. That's a natural process. (But it) led us to a dead end -- 
which eventually led us right back to our roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kristine and I grew up singing acoustic folk and bluegrass-influenced music," 
she noted, recalling their youth in Manhattan Beach. "It wasn't until we came 
to Nashville 10 years ago and got a record contract that our sound became 
electrified to fit within the context of radio. The acoustic sound is where we 
are most comfortable, and maybe you can hear that on the album itself with our 
vocal performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, their singing on "Rodeo Waltz" is their most impressive ever. "You 
know, we recorded all those vocals in two days," Gill said, "and we cried when 
we were done. We thought, 'Oh no, we're all done. There's no more songs to 
sing.' Usually, you're relieved to finish an album." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gill also said that recording on Sugar Hill released her and her sister from 
the pressures of producing hit singles, and the result was a surge of 
creativity. "The president of Sugar Hill literally said, 'Just go have fun.' 
That was the criteria. I produced the record, and we had total freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a couple of friends a time or two would come up and pat us on the 
back and say, 'Don't worry, girls. Maybe someday another major label will pick 
you up.' I wouldn't know how to reply. I would want to say, 'Are you crazy? 
This is where it's at.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Their last days with Columbia had not been especially happy ones, Gill said. 
"We were still out there on the road plodding along with no more radio hits, 
not knowing what was going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt as though we were going to be dropped from the label at any moment. 
We decided to ask for a release before that happened. The interesting thing is 
that they refused. We said, 'Come on, come on, you're going to let us go 
anyway. Just let us walk away with our dignity.' They said, 'Nope. We still 
think we can do something.' We begged them, and they finally let us go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sweethearts had wanted to avoid pouring their creativity into an album 
that would receive no support. "It's like rearranging chairs on a ship that's 
going down," Gill said. "What's the sense? You know they're not interested in 
you anymore. The writing's on the wall. They're not promoting your records. You 
release them, and they die. They're dead before they even come out. We just 
wanted to get away and try to salvage our career or start over somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "They finally did let us go. The frightening thing is that we had trouble 
getting any interest from any other major label. 'We're not touching women 
artists right now,' they said. Then we really felt desolated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our manager told us to go away and try to remember why we started doing this 
in the first place. I was sitting right here in my office one day after that, 
and I started to think it would be wonderful if we could just make an acoustic 
album of some of the old songs we grew up singing. Even if nobody ever heard 
it, it at least would keep our sanity together. I thought maybe Sugar Hill 
would be interested ,and it turned out they were thrilled to have us." 
</P>

the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Show time: 8.
