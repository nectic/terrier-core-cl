JAPANESE POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I had to laugh (through my tears) at Steven C. Clemons' Op-Ed piece (April 
10) about deep-seated political corruption in Japan that led, he contends, to 
the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the comic relief: "The key issue for Japan is that none of its current 
leaders matured in a clean political system.They are powerful because they 
built the best political machines, raised the most money and secured the 
greatest amount of government resources to return to their constituents. No 
politician has been exempt from this reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Does this remind you of a certain other country, very large, very rich, often 
self-righteous, very confused, edging toward decadence?

 * It's about time someone complimented The Times for its excellent coverage of 
Japan. As a longtime student of a Japan, having lived there and written a 
thesis on its economy, it was always difficult to find good current information 
on the country. That lack of information frequently justified the common 
complaint I heard from my Japanese friends: You Americans don't understand us. 
For anyone who has been reading The Times lately that no longer is the case. 
Your staff in Japan is doing a great job of giving your readers penetrating 
insight into, what is in fact, a difficult country for Americans to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 At this historic juncture between our two countries, not completely unlike 
that of Commodore Perry's time, knowledge and understanding of Japan are 
crucial. SHELLEY NORWOOD

AIR BAG THEFT

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We have read with great interest "Air Bag Theft an Expanding New Problem," 
April 7. An excellent report, finely written and serving the public good.We 
salute you for delving into this growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 However, we were taken aback by one paragraph, which states, in part, "auto 
dismantlers buy the bags as salvage items with no questions asked." This would 
seem to imply that all or any auto dismantlers are involved in such unsavory 
conduct, which, of course, is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 We are professional, licensed, regulated and a highly policed industry -- the 
nation's 16th largest. We deal in salvaged vehicles, usually obtained from 
insurance auctions and sales. Rather than collaborate with thieves, as the 
article might imply, we work with various law enforcement agencies to rid our 
industry of just the people the article describes. In fact, most of the 
criminal activity investigated by the various agencies is reported by our own 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope any future articles of this nature will make it crystal-clear that you 
are talking about a minute number who would violate the law.

CHOOSING A NEW JUSTICE

<P>
 * In choosing a Supreme Court justice, an excellent legal mind, by itself, is 
not a sufficient criterion.There are many cold-blooded, excellent legal minds. 
Another criterion, such as life experience, which contributes to how a person's 
point of view is formed and how he will make decisions, is an equally valuable 
resource. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional factors, such as a commitment to balance on the court, should be 
weighed. With these considerations in mind, how about giving Professor Anita 
Hill the nod on this one?

DEBATE OVER SCHOOL PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "A Duel Over Prayer in Schools," April 13: Anyone who is so inclined may 
pray at home, in church/synagogue, or silently, anytime and anywhere (including 
the classroom). The attempt by Pat Robertson, et al. to force prayer into 
schools has nothing to do with free speech -- it's the first step in an attempt 
to make Christianity the state religion. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm amused by their reliance on "majority rules" -- how quickly they'd change 
their tune if the majority were Jews, Muslims, etc.!

 * Let's get honest in the school prayer debate. There always has been prayer 
in school. Any child can pray anytime he or she wants, as many times as he or 
she wants, silently. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is about whether other children can be forced to hear someone 
else's prayer. What the religious right wants is to have the government force 
my child to hear their particular prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as there are algebra tests there will be prayer in school.

 * "If the prayer offended one person in the class, then we shouldn't have had 
it," said Abhi Shellat, freshman at Harvard University. That typically is the 
minority thought concerning prayer in school these days throughout America. 
Could someone please ask Shellat and all those who agree with him what their 
answer would be to the following statement: If being unable to pray offended 
the majority of students in a class, and over 90% of the population, then 
shouldn't they be able to pray?

<P>
 * When I graduated from high school, attendance was optional at the 
baccalaureate service at which a nondenominational prayer was given. This 
"prayer" was simply a brief moment of reflection and gratitude appropriate for 
the occasion. A reasonable person would not have considered it to be the 
"establishment of religion." 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to understand why the same legal experts who say our 
government should not permit one 60-second prayer in 12 years of education, 
because it might offend even one student, have successfully argued that that 
same government should permit the public sale of pornography, be allowed to 
operate its own gambling institutions, and be restrained from measures to stop 
the increase of real physical violence to those same students who they fear 
would suffer apparently irreparable harm at having to sit through one little 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be simpler if those students who find the graduation prayer to be 
offensive were simply more tolerant, like those who find, say, homosexuality 
offensive are expected to be. If the self-appointed state censors will pardon a 
biblical reference, it certainly seems that we are straining at gnats and 
swallowing camels.

COURT WATCH; THE PUBLIC PAYS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second, punitive phase of the Rodney King civil trial is due to begin 
today; the first phase, in which King sought compensation from the City of Los 
Angeles for the injuries he suffered in the now-infamous 1991 police beating, 
resulted Tuesday in a jury award of $3.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
 In having to pay King that much, has Los Angeles learned anything? The carping 
from City Council member Hal Bernson and former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
that King didn't deserve $3.8 million misses the point.The law does not require 
that King be perfect. He was horribly abused by officers entrusted to represent 
law and order. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the King case is just one of many police misconduct cases in 
which the city has had to pay up with hard-earned taxpayer dollars. Part of 
that no doubt is the cost of doing tough police work in a big city. But another 
reason Los Angeles has been plagued so with police misconduct lawsuits over the 
years has to do with a lack of accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 Too few council members or police brass have asked: Are there ever 
consequences if officers abuse their authority? Before the King case, the 
answer often was "no." 
</P>
<P>
 Where does it go from here? The city is not being held liable for punitive 
damages, but the council could decide to cover costs assessed against 
individual officers, who are or were city employees (though that's unlikely). 
Whatever happens now, L.A. taxpayers should at the very least be able to expect 
the worst police misconduct lawsuits to be behind them and never have to worry 
again about such egregious, and costly, incidents.

'NO' TO SEXISM IN JURY SELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In picking juries, prosecutors and trial lawyers have long attempted to shape 
the panels to their liking by excluding older or younger people, men or women 
or others on the basis of stereotypical assumptions about group sympathies. The 
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that jurors may not be excluded on the basis of 
their sex alone. The ruling is welcome, a logical and overdue extension of a 
1986 Supreme Court decision that barred peremptory challenges of potential 
jurors because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the 6-3 majority, in one of his last opinions before retiring, 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun called selection by sex an "unconstitutional proxy" 
for juror impartiality and competence, adding that such discrimination ratified 
"archaic and overbroad stereotypes" about gender. 
</P>
<P>
 A sarcastic dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia charged the majority with paying 
"conspicuous obeisance" to equality of the sexes in the interest of political 
correctness. The ruling, Scalia said, undermines the ancient English common-law 
concept of peremptory challenges by which each side gets a certain number of 
exclusions for which no reason is given. "Unisex is unquestionably in fashion," 
he wrote sneeringly. He was joined, predictably, by the two other members of 
the court's medieval wing, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice 
Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ruling has been hailed by women's groups, it is worth noting that 
the case at issue was an appeal from an Alabama man who claimed that he was 
denied a fair trial in a paternity case because all his jurors were female. And 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, reluctantly concurring with the majority, observed 
that gender does make a difference and that the ruling could hurt female 
defendants in cases such as that of a battered wife who wounds her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor has a point. But in a way her opinion bolsters Blackmun's view, for 
surely a male rape defendant deserves the same impartiality or gender sympathy 
that the battered wife deserves. In recent years, lawyers have perverted jury 
selection by using high-paid consultants who rely on dubious psychological 
profiles. It may be hopelessly idealistic to think that justice can ever be 
blind, but the high court's ruling is a step in the right direction.

SIGH OF RELIEF FOR CANCER PATIENTS; NEW STUDY BACKS LUMPECTOMY/RADIATION 
APPROACH AFTER RECENT TEST SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent disclosures that some breast cancer research results were falsified 
caused anger and fear among many of the millions of women who have undergone 
treatment for the disease. They will receive badly needed reassurance from a 
new study, published this week. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine researchers found that lumpectomies -- in which only a cancerous 
tumor is removed -- followed by radiation treatment are as safe and effective 
as mastectomies, in which the breast and the lymph nodes are removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The university researchers studied nearly 6,000 women in Orange County whose 
breast cancers were diagnosed between 1984 and 1990. The researchers found that 
larger hospitals, especially those affiliated with universities, were more 
likely to perform lumpectomies. The study urged that the procedure be used more 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 The results reinforced the conclusions of the National Cancer Institute, which 
insisted last month that falsifications of research in an international study 
of breast cancer did not undercut the basic findings. After a Montreal 
researcher was found to have altered background data on 100 women in the study 
and after a "discrepancy" was found in files of another Montreal hospital, the 
coordinator of the international research was forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Journal of the American Medical Assn., which published the results of the 
new study, rightly recognized the need for reassurance by making it the lead 
article. A JAMA editor called the fraud "appalling and tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that one in eight women will suffer breast cancer, a disease 
that carries with it a strong emotional component. Two decades ago, a common 
treatment was removal of an entire breast and the pectoral muscle. Later, the 
amount removed usually was reduced to the breast and the lymph nodes. In the 
last decade, lumpectomy and radiation treatment have become more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said that patients and doctors alike need more education about the 
benefits of lumpectomy. For women fighting a terrifying disease, UCI 
researchers have provided valuable information and grounds for optimism that 
less drastic treatments indeed can be safe and effective.

RWANDA MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I find it astounding that the international community deems it an absolute 
moral imperative to quickly and vociferously condemn the deaths of 30 people in 
the aftermath of the tragic events of Hebron, and yet has virtually not 
responded to the horrendous massacre of over 20,000 people in fewer than five 
days of civil strife in Rwanda (April 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Is it because there is no mobilized Rwanda lobby or constituency here in 
America? Is it because there are more TV cameras in the Middle East than there 
are in the continent of Africa? Maybe, or most especially, it is because Rwanda 
is neither a geopolitical crossroads nor an economic hotbed or oil-producing 
nation. No one's national interest (except that of the citizens of Rwanda) is 
served by international condemnation. Most probably, it is a combination of all 
of the above factors. 
</P>
<P>
 We let the war in Bosnia run far too long without any convincing intervention 
by the international community. Ironically, on the day that NATO airstrikes are 
finally taking place to try to stop the ethnic cleansing, forced rape and 
inhuman barbarism taking place in southern Europe, the same thing is happening, 
on an even larger scale, in Africa without international notice or moral 
outrage. Let us not allow ourselves to be further desensitized to the plight of 
the thousands of people who are now falling victim to yet another form of 
nationalist barbarism. Let us take notice, and let the world take action.

 * Welcome, American news media, to the horrors of Burundi and Rwanda. Where 
have you been for the last six months? Only the spectacular 
shoot-down/assassination of two African presidents (April 7) was enough to jolt 
you from your indolence. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely respected British journal the Economist reported a few weeks ago 
that at least 100,000 people in Burundi were killed between October and March. 
Yet until this month, the American news media have apparently deemed this story 
unworthy. What is your excuse in ignoring human suffering of such magnitude? 
Let me guess . . . more important stories? Maybe Bobbitt's missing member? 
Nancy's latest $10,000 skating outfit? Tonya's cigarette brand? 
</P>
<P>
 The media's fixation with tabloid trash and indifference to news of substance 
are very telling. They give credence to the claim that most news editors are 
concerned much more with ratings and agendas than actual news. Now that we see 
how you "dropped the ball" on Burundi and Rwanda, how long will it take you to 
begin properly reporting other newsworthy events such as an equal if not 
greater calamity occurring in Sudan?

PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH REFORM; GOOD PROFITS CAN MEAN GOOD CARE; CRUSADERS ARE 
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CAP ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND PROFITS. THEY RISK CRIPPLING 
INNOVATIVE NEW HEALTH PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAIN C. ENTHOVEN and SARA J. SINGER, Alain C. Enthoven is a professor of 
public and private management at Stanford University's Graduate School of 
Business. Sara J. Singer, a health-policy analyst, is his special assistant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The path to health-care quality, says the California Medical Assn., is to 
reduce administrative costs and health-plan profits. To support that assertion, 
the doctors' group released a study on the profits and costs of administration 
of California health plans, suggesting that some plans spend too little on 
direct medical care. In response, state Assembly member Burt Margolin, the 
chairman of the Assembly's Health Committee, proposed a bill that would limit 
combined health-plan profits and administrative costs to 15% of premiums 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not know how much an efficient, high-quality provider of health-care 
services should spend on profit and administrative costs. But we do know that 
the Assembly does not know, either. There are valid reasons for relatively high 
overhead costs and plenty of reasons for not mandating limits on such costs. 
Not all profits and administrative costs are wasteful. Profits are necessary to 
finance expansion; administrative costs support quality measurement and 
analysis of how to improve services and reduce future costs. Limits on profits 
and administrative costs could seriously damage the managed-care industry. It 
would make it hard for new managed-care organizations to start, for good ones 
to finance expansion and for all to manage appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical association suggests that the health plan spending the least on 
direct medical care apportions 18.2% of revenues to administration and takes 
12.7% of revenues as profit. But to achieve these figures, interest expense is 
charged to administration and the profit they list is the pretax gross. In 
addition, these amounts are not unreasonable in comparison with other 
industries. Applying the same analysis for Hewlett Packard, for example, a 
world-class industrial competitor known for quality, reveals that in 1992, 
administration and profit accounted for 36.1% and 8.1% of revenue respectively. 
Profits of other California companies in 1992 ranged from 1% on average for 
wholesalers to 19% on average for energy companies. Health-plan profits fall 
squarely within this range. 
</P>
<P>
 Limits on administrative costs would be susceptible to gamesmanship and 
accounting tricks. Health-plan managers currently use cost-accounting as a tool 
to help them manage the delivery of care; within broadly accepted accounting 
practices, each plan has different methods. Tomorrow, under a limit on 
administrative costs, you can be sure that items charged to administration 
costs will include the bare minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Low administrative costs do not necessarily suggest superior management or 
superior health care. In Medicare, for example, the government has relatively 
low administrative costs, but Medicare is renowned for the administrative 
headaches it causes hospitals, doctors and patients. In addition, low 
administrative costs for Medicare do not translate into low overall costs. 
Medicare outlays continue to grow at unacceptable rates despite government's 
ability to lower reimbursement rates and shift costs to private payers. And the 
program spends billions on unnecessary and inappropriate care. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason not to impose ceilings is that the most successful managed-care 
organizations need to reinvest profits to finance expansion. Small health plans 
also have relatively high administrative costs because they have fewer 
subscribers over which to spread them. The medical association reported that 
WellPoint Health Networks Inc. had the lowest direct-care spending in 1992. The 
report did not state that WellPoint had the highest sales in 1992 of any 
California company incorporated since 1990. They need profits to support this 
high growth rate. A limit on administrative costs and profits would create an 
undesirable barrier to entry for new health plans such as WellPoint. 
</P>
<P>
 We Californians are to blame more than California health plans for high 
administrative costs. Our employer-provided health insurance that subsidizes 
inefficient health plans, our demand for the most expensive health care without 
regard for value-for-money and our failure to hold health plans accountable for 
cost or quality allow substantial waste in the system. Many California 
physicians must also share responsibility; by demanding fee-for-service payment 
from individual patients instead of a fixed monthly payment for each plan 
member, they are refusing to take responsibility for managing the cost and 
quality of the care they deliver. This forces health plans to spend more on 
administration to manage the doctors. Unchecked, fee-for-service medicine has 
incentives to provide more, but not necessarily better, care. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a true free-market approach, health plans would compete on the basis of 
cost and quality. But this is possible only when consumers have incentives to 
choose health plans on the basis of value -- and information with which to 
compare plans. At that point, health plans will have an incentive to maintain 
the administrative costs that will allow them to most efficiently manage the 
cost and quality of their plans. And they will maintain the profits necessary 
to fulfill capital and expansion requirements.

IN THE EYE -- OR THE MIND -- OF THE BEHOLDER; ART: ALICE WALKER'S CRITICISM OF 
THE ROBERT GRAHAM ART ECHOES THE SMALL-MINDEDNESS OF HER OWN CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LINK, David Link is a writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Novelist Alice Walker, named a "state treasure," says she was shocked when she 
saw the award, a statuette of a nude woman's torso. She called it an embodiment 
of society's acceptance of the mutilation of women. But the only thing 
mutilated in this episode was respect for art.  
</P>
<P>
 Walker initially was not going to accept any award from the state for 
political reasons. Excerpts from her beautiful, complex and engaging stories 
caused a furor among religious conservatives when they appeared in a state test 
of student aptitude; state educators caved and Walker was rightly maddened by 
the whole affair. The mess was finally resolved in a manner acceptable to 
Walker, and she agreed to accept the state's honor on behalf of those who had 
fought for her work based on its unmistakable merit. 
</P>
<P>
 But she who lives by the sword dies by the sword. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interpretation," Susan Sontag wrote, "is the revenge of the intellect upon 
art." For several decades now, that observation, stretched well beyond art, has 
been the modus operandi of our political discourse. Christian conservatives 
join with gay-rights advocates, the NAACP, Islamic fundamentalists and just 
about anyone else with a grievance against someone in mining every work of art 
and every public utterance for some mother lode of offense. And given the 
peevish and testy character of our age, the unavoidable complexity that runs 
through both art and life provides an endless source of peas to bruise our 
princess-tender psyches. 
</P>
<P>
 The paradox of Walker's offended sensibilities is breathtaking. The statue was 
designed by one of the most gifted sculptors of our time, Robert Graham. 
Without getting into the fascinating and complicated beauty of his work -- now 
in a number of Los Angeles public areas and museums worldwide -- it should be 
enough to point out that Graham's vision and execution are evocative precisely 
because they are not simple. His works elude easy explanation in exactly the 
ways that make Walker's work so brilliant -- and so troublesome to those who 
see art as mere propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is large, and we are too dedicated these days to reducing it. I was 
appalled when the state first caved in to the religious zealots seeking to 
remove a passage from Walker's story "Roselily" from the aptitude test. The 
excerpt was viewed as promoting unwed motherhood, but that cramped view robbed 
the passage of its complexity and thus its beauty. Students could agree, 
disagree or a little of both with the ruminations of a pregnant young woman 
just before her marriage. The passage provoked thought -- exactly the kind of 
thing that makes for a good essay. Diminishing it to some kind of commercial 
was an aggressive act of interpretive violence, worthy of the strongest 
condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's reaction to Graham's statuette was the same kind of reductive 
aggression. Starting only from her own sensitivities, Walker "read" the statue 
as a "message" about domination and violence. But the statue contains a message 
only in the sense that "Roselily" contains a message about pregnancy before 
marriage or Walker's great novel "The Color Purple" contains a message about 
lesbianism. "The Color Purple" speaks to the heart, and no featherheaded 
translation is needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, as W.H. Auden said, those to whom evil is done do evil in return. 
Perhaps Walker is lashing out at other artists because her work has been the 
subject of so much unfair interpretation. But hyperinterpretation is our chosen 
mode of artistic suicide these days. When offense is the standard, 
interpretation works against art with toxic efficiency. Offense is a purely 
subjective experience, an entirely solipsistic exercise. When it is made to 
appear objective -- when the offense I take is construed to be the offense 
anyone will take -- only the least objectionable art will make it into the 
public realm. Anyone can be offended by anything. Walker may have felt offense 
at Graham's work, but if an artist cannot see how beauty transcends offense, 
how a work of art has meaning that transcends a meaning, how can we expect 
anyone else to? 
</P>
<P>
 At best, Walker was ungracious in accepting an honor the state bestows on too 
few genuine artists. At worst, she has given aid and comfort to those seeking 
to dismantle the greatness of art by turning it into a particularly pernicious 
branch of advertising, the better to control it through the politics of the 
marketplace.  
</P>
<P>
 If Walker thought the statue was ugly, she could certainly have said so. That 
subjective standard is the one that applies to art. As long as Walker views 
Graham's art as advertising rather than as an aspiration to beauty, she should 
not complain when non-artists look at her, too, as a propagandist rather than 
an artist.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A PALE AND FADING PICTURE OF FOUR INVISIBLE WOMEN; NOW YOU 
SEE HER BY WHITNEY OTTO ; VILLARD $20, 303 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitney Otto's metaphor for white American women in their 40s is the same as 
Ralph Ellison's for black American men of all ages. Kiki Shaw, with all her 
brightness and perception, isn't an Invisible Woman yet, but she's getting 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 She and the other 40-year-olds in "Now You See Her" are all trying to make 
their way, one way or the other, through the American Dream. The trouble is, 
they aren't doing the dreaming. Men are doing it, 40-year-olds and others, and 
after a while the men switch dreams -- to younger women or, in one case, 
temporarily back to their wives -- and if Kiki and her friends are not quite 
gone, they are going, going. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Collier, a whiz at running her video production company, has staked her entire 
emotional life on the occasional afternoons or weekends when Gordon, her 
married lover, can see her. Other times she might as well have disappeared. 
Conversely, when Gordon is regaling her with his sensitive and loving energy, 
it is his wife, Les, who might as well have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Nora, with a talent for writing and a master's degree in French, is secretary 
to a hot-shot executive; as he shoots up so will she, and if not, not. 
Meanwhile, she is his office wife. Instead of "where are my socks?" it is 
"where is my file?" At the office, his home wife is invisible; when he goes 
home, Nora is. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kiki, who is floating and distracted by nature -- she has a perfectly 
suited job assembling trivia for a television game show -- her main 
not-quite-squeeze is the wonderfully imaginative and affectionate Henry. Almost 
he could be a computer-model devised to meet female objections to male defects, 
except that he lacks energetic constancy. He was her lover once and is trying 
conscientiously to recapture the dream, but his attention wanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad for Kiki; parts of her begin to disappear -- an arm, an elbow. A 
fellow worker enters her cubicle and leaves a note because he can't see her. 
Alarmingly, her skin is praised for its translucence. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto, author of "How to Make an American Quilt," treats her theme with wit and 
grace. Once more she works by patchwork: small scenes, distractions and 
reflections, seemingly diverse but stitched together to make a pattern.  
</P>
<P>
 There is something of Calvino's buoyancy and wit in her fizzy alternation of 
half-absurd philosophizing and faintly surreal narrative. The rhythm, which is 
part of the charm, is reminiscent of Renata Adler's "Speedboat." There is a 
kinship with Nicholson Baker, too, in her use of miniature to place and 
unsettle us at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Otto is dealing with an extremely well-worn theme, and although she 
embroiders it, she doesn't really shift it. Collier's plight as the Other Woman 
blurs nicely into her realization that it is the home-loving Gordon's wife who 
is the Other Woman. He can't be faithful even to infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it takes more than embroidery to make a type into an archetype. 
Collier's story is the stuff of decades of women's magazines and television 
serials. The same is true of Nora's secretary plight and of Les's housewife 
plight, well-written as they are. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kiki's plight takes longer to show itself -- being so charmingly distracted 
by her de-materializings and wittily balanced series of variations on women and 
moon imagery -- it is fairly inert when shown. 
</P>
<P>
 The movements Otto invents to escape the inertness are so contrived as to make 
it worse. Patly, Collier turns from Gordon to follow up an old yearning to play 
the piano, Les decides she doesn't need him either, and Nora throws up her job 
and becomes a travel writer. Judging from the excerpts, she is not half so good 
a writer as Otto. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiki finds herself in Paris, where she communes with the lusty ghost of her 
namesake, Kiki of Montparnasse -- Man Ray's mistress, model and collaborator -- 
and takes lessons in eating large meals and getting in Paglia-like touch with 
her own assertive womanhood. She will be happy in France, we are told, because 
women there are allowed to be themselves and, above all, visible to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 This has some truth, although it is more likely that the French in general, 
not just women, are more visible to themselves than Americans are; at least 
those of Otto's sophistication. A very visible society tends to make you 
visible, if only because you bump against its corners. Still, it is a cliche 
and used as such and -- along with the three other pat endings -- it turns "Now 
You See Her" from its initial effervescence into a fairly flat swallow.

 Gilligan Heads for Big Screen: We've already seen "The Beverly Hillbillies" on 
film, and "The Flintstones" comes to the big screen Memorial Day Weekend. Now 
get ready for "Gilligan's Island," the movie. Turner Pictures announced 
Wednesday that it will produce the film with Brillstein/Grey Entertainment, 
with Sherwood Schwartz, the 1960s TV show's original creator, writer and 
producer, serving as co-producer and co-writer. Production is set to begin next 
year with "major star castaways." The original TV series -- featuring Gilligan, 
the Skipper and the rest of the gang -- ran from 1964-67 on CBS. THE ARTS

 Staying Happy: Grammy-winning musician Bobby McFerrin has been named "creative 
chair" of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra for the next two seasons, with a 
mandate to develop and conduct educational concerts for the Minnesota ensemble. 
McFerrin, whose 1988 a cappella song "Don't Worry, Be Happy" sold more than 10 
million copies, will focus on in-school appearances, music demonstrations and 
special concerts to expand young people's interest in different types of music, 
including classical. "My creative focus has always been about getting people 
excited about music," said McFerrin, who has been a guest conductor with more 
than 40 orchestras including the Los Angeles Philharmonic. "I want to get 
people to let their hair down about classical music and involve them directly 
in what's happening on stage."

 * Disney's Broadway Record: The critics certainly aren't raving, but that 
hasn't kept the public away from Disney's Broadway version of "Beauty and the 
Beast." The musical, which opened Monday at the Palace Theatre, on Tuesday 
broke the all-time Broadway box-office record for one-day sales, ringing up a 
total of $603,494 to surpass the previous record of $548,460 set by "The Who's 
Tommy" last June.

 * Celebrating African Arts: The fourth biennial National Black Arts Festival 
this year will collaborate with the 1996 Olympic Games' Cultural Olympiad to 
produce a "Celebrate Africa!" festival in Atlanta. The festival, which runs 
from July 29-Aug. 7, will feature more than 100 African performers, including 
the a cappella group Ladysmith Black Mambazo and pop singer Youssou N'Dour, 
plus an African Village and Marketplace offering demonstrations from artisans 
and craftspersons from throughout Africa. "Celebrate Africa!" is produced by 
Stephanie Hughley, a former general manager for the New York Shakespeare 
Festival and the founding artistic director of the National Black Arts 
Festival. It is intended to prepare for the Olympics by "bringing the world to 
(Atlanta's) doorstep and allowing us to gain a better understanding of the many 
cultures that make up the Olympic family." TELEVISION

 Snyder Staying Put: Despite being named by David Letterman as a personal 
favorite to take over the 12:35 a.m. slot behind his own hit CBS series, Tom 
Snyder says he wants to continue as a talk-show host on the CNBC cable channel. 
Asked during a CNBC telecast Tuesday about rumors that he'd been talking with 
CBS, Snyder said, "There have been no conversations with anyone at the CBS 
television network. I'm a happily employed member of the CNBC 'Talk All-Star' 
team, and I hope that relationship continues for a long, long time." POP/ROCK

 Nirvana Sales Still Growing: Nirvana sales continue to climb in the wake of 
lead singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. The group's 1993 "In Utero" album -- which 
sold more than 1.5 million copies in the United States last year but had been 
dropping down the charts before Cobain's death was discovered April 8 -- sold 
an estimated 69,000 copies last week. That's up from 18,000 two weeks ago, 
enough to pull it to No. 11 on the Billboard chart. But sales were modest for 
"Live Through This," the new album by Hole, the band fronted by Cobain's widow, 
Courtney Love. It sold 19,000 copies in its first week in the stores, landing 
at No. 55 on the chart. Love, meanwhile, said she will give the shotgun Cobain 
used to kill himself to the advocacy group Mothers Against Violence in America, 
which will melt it down along with other weapons owned by the late singer. Said 
Love, "I don't, obviously, want to keep them and hopefully by turning over 
these things I can make a difference and I can make some sense out of something 
so bereft of sense at all." QUICK TAKES

 Velvet is a naughty, naughty club.  
</P>
<P>
 Not simply because the Sunday night affair at West Hollywood's Peanuts 
features slinky, gyrating go-go dancers in baaarely-there lingerie, but because 
the early-KROQ music format attracts a very young crowd.One can only imagine 
the kids lucky enough to pass for 18 -- ID is a club requirement -- going back 
to school the next day with eye-popping stories of the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by an endless video reel of prancing, topless femme fatales such as 
Betty Page and Jayne Mansfield -- yes, breasts do come in all shapes and sizes 
-- club-goers let down their own, er, hair. See-through tops appear to be the 
requisite outfit for women.  
</P>
<P>
 The music lineup caters to the young, post-pubescent L.A. scenesters. Velvet 
promotes itself with as "a new wave 'striptease' dance club" and it is just 
that. From Blondie to Depeche Mode to Bow Wow Wow, Velvet's deejay offers a 
loud, nostalgic trip through new wave's past.  
</P>
<P>
 When they venture into the '90s, it's with the assurance of a current 
alternative hit, possibly something from Nine Inch Nails or the Breeders. Ears 
ringing, you leave with the disturbing notion that alternative formats such as 
KROQ are the future homes of classic rock.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MANCINI'S BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE FILLED WITH SONG, CELEBRITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 70th-birthday tribute to Henry Mancini at Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA 
campus Tuesday night was produced with the smooth professionalism and polish 
that always has been associated with the veteran film composer. 
</P>
<P>
 The floor of the Pavilion was filled with softly lit tables for a post-concert 
gala, while the side bleachers overflowed with high school and university music 
students -- the immediate beneficiaries of the event's fund-raising effort for 
the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts and the Los Angeles County High School 
for the Arts.In a rousing opening, the colorful UCLA Marching Band trooped in 
with a brassy rendering of "The Pink Panther." 
</P>
<P>
 The first two-thirds of the program mixed montages of Mancini's film music 
with a series of tributes. Blake Edwards recalled a producer's insistence that 
"we have to drop that (expletive) song" ("Moon River") from "Breakfast at 
Tiffany's"; Bob Newhart and Dudley Moore offered a humorous send-up of more 
obscure Mancini accomplishments such as his music for "The Creature From the 
Black Lagoon"; and Quincy Jones conducted the theme from "Peter Gunn." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Williams, hosting the show, reprised his hit versions of "Moon River," 
"Days of Wine and Roses" and "Dear Heart," and John Williams and Jack Elliott 
conducted various Mancini works. Best of all, Julie Andrews sang three 
lesser-known Mancini tunes -- "Crazy World," "Whistling Away in the Dark" and 
the superb "Two for the Road" -- with grace and musical understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The final third of the program was given to an overly long and oddly out of 
context "Operatic Salute" by Luciano Pavarotti. Granted the presumed need for a 
headliner to generate ticket sales for the benefit, it still was difficult to 
comprehend why Pavarotti's segment needed to be fleshed out with two utterly 
irrelevant (in this setting) operatic overtures. DON HECKMAN

ART REVIEWS; SELF-HELP CULTURE SKEWERED AT FOOD HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Durant's installation at Food House is incisive and ambiguous, stripped to 
the bone and loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Durant conjures the image of an alienated individual, earnestly struggling for 
self-improvement. At the same time, his homemade bookshelves, second-hand 
self-help books and morale-boosting posters ridicule the idea that 
life-defining habits can be changed as easily as a paperback can be read. 
</P>
<P>
 Five blurry photographs of posters usually found in the lunchroom of a small 
business or the waiting room of a social worker bear messages, such as 
"Believing in yourself is the first step to success" and "The secret of getting 
ahead is getting started." Squinting to see the words clearly, you get dizzy 
reading these rules-to-live-by. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's impossible to disagree with these bits of popular wisdom, they 
still sound like half-truths. Durant forces a viewer to experience what it's 
like to get blurry eyed and disoriented from reading too much, from tirelessly 
searching for answers but never finding them in words. 
</P>
<P>
 His bookshelves, partly filled with paperbacks, also emphasize the difference 
between knowing what to do and actually doing it. Desperation and futility are 
evoked by entire sections devoted to get-rich-quick schemes, love relationships 
or self-respect -- sometimes with as many as eight dog-eared copies of the same 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Durant's homemade library suggests that simple, step-by-step lessons found in 
books may look good on paper but are ineffective in life. His art is powerful 
because it wholeheartedly embraces the desire to change, yet it recognizes the 
difficulty of real transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 The critique of self-help sub-cultures includes the art world, offering a 
scathing assault on the current demand that art be therapeutic. For Durant, the 
idea that art makes us better is ridiculous -- part of the problem, not the 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Durant's art neither provides lasting respite from life nor improves its 
viewers. It simply identifies complex problems and draws us into discussions by 
inviting us to see things differently.

Ligon's politically motivated prints inject new meanings into old adages and 
racist stereotypes. At Ruth Bloom Gallery, the young, New York-based, African 
American artist's two series from 1993 are considerably more interesting than a 
flat-footed set of etchings from 1992. His recent work adds layers of 
significance to popular opinions, allowing humane values to echo off 
destructive prejudices with neither element dominating the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The racist idea that all blacks look alike haunts "Runaways," a portfolio of 
10 lithographs in which 10 different descriptions of the artist are juxtaposed 
with small depictions of slave life in America, in the style of 19th-Century 
woodcuts. (The portfolio was also shown earlier this season at Kim Light 
Gallery.) 
</P>
<P>
 With remarkable nuances, the descriptions paint a collective portrait of Ligon 
that tells us as much about his appearance as it does about those who wrote 
them. The details range from the obvious, such as height, weight and hairstyle, 
to the more intimate, such as habits of speech and personal idiosyncrasies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ligon casts himself as a runaway slave to mock art collectors who believe they 
own a piece of the artist when they buy his work. In a market dominated by rich 
whites, in which the work of oppressed others is currently hot property, 
Ligon's "Runaways" symbolize his unwillingness to fit into restrictive 
categories. For him, that would be tantamount to being a good slave. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of nine etchings titled "Narratives" fleshes out Ligon's refusal to 
serve as a token demonstration of racial openness. Playing off the phrase, "You 
can't judge a book by its cover," his prints mimic the 19th-Century 
frontispieces of true-life stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers are given only hints of the autobiographies within. We're left on the 
outside, only able to imagine what the artist's life might be like. From this 
position, no one is able to appropriate Ligon's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Both series slyly undermine the idea that art captures the artist's self. 
Ligon contends that human identity is an on-going negotiation that begins 
between two people and always involves innumerable others. Only violence 
reduces this complex process to a simple opposition between black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruth Bloom Gallery, 2036 Broadway, Santa Monica, (310) 829-7454, through May 
22. Closed Mondays. * Images in Flux: Vernon Fisher's three-dimensional images 
interspersed with words combine elements of painting, sculpture and drawing 
with such apparent ease that it's impossible to determine which of these 
categories they belong to. Six new, remarkably elegant pieces at Mark Moore 
Gallery might best be described as mini-installations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, visually entering one of the Texas-based artist's mixed-media 
hybrids is like entering a dense cluster of micro-environments. Scanning a 
typical piece demands moving among tangible objects, illusionistic images, 
diagrammatic grids, digitized representations and written words. 
</P>
<P>
 But describing Fisher's art in this way makes it sound divisive and clunky, as 
if it were an awkward hodgepodge of strategies arbitrarily stuck together. 
</P>
<P>
 A better approach is to think of his works as events, as ongoing occurrences 
that began before you arrived at the gallery and will continue long after you 
leave. It's difficult to suppress the suspicion that the components of his 
pieces are rearranging themselves when you're not looking. 
</P>
<P>
 Painted on blackboards and repeated in many works, Fisher's images seem to be 
in constant flux. Crisp black-and-white drawings float out of cloudy, smudged 
erasures. Even sharper color pictures momentarily grab your attention and lure 
your eye deep into illusionistic space. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their dynamism, Fisher's works are never restless or pushy. As a 
whole, his show has the feel of an inquisitive mind contemplating its 
operations simply because it has the spare time to do so. Far from being 
solipsistic, his art welcomes viewers along for the ride as memories drift in 
and out of focus and consciousness gets lost only to find itself somewhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Moore Gallery, 2032-A Broadway, Santa Monica, (310) 453-3031, through 
May 14. Closed Mondays. * Surface Appeal: George Stoll's wax casts of 
Tupperware cups, bowls, pitchers and variously shaped kitchen containers come 
in more colors than the originals. His handcrafted vessels are also prettier 
than their plastic counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, these characteristics are the only advantages Stoll's 
imitations have over the real thing. Too fragile to use, his sculptures are 
meant to be judged formally, by their shapes, textures and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 As three-dimensional compositions, his works at A/B Gallery are blandly 
decorative. More than 100 pieces casually stacked on shelves or clustered on 
pedestals are superficially attractive but conceptually empty. Their initial 
visual appeal quickly wears thin; no interesting ideas or critical concepts 
emerge to save them from being forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that they try to combine Pop's ironic attack on high art with 
formalism's insistence on art's autonomy or purity. This work falls short 
because it doesn't take either style very seriously, instead treating them as 
flexible packaging materials free of content and rigor. 
</P>
<P>

WINE OF THE WEEK:

<P>
 1992 Seghesio Winery Chardonnay, Sonoma County ($9) -- Tasting through 54 
Chardonnays from the 1992 vintage may sound like fun, but after a while the 
palate cracks from too much alcohol and oak. Since I prefer lighter, 
leaner-styled Chardonnays, I had a difficult time finding 10 to really love. 
</P>
<P>
 This one was among the top group and was the least expensive. The aroma is 
delicate with nuances of pear and spice, but there's excellent fruit in the 
mouth and more fruit than oak in the finish. The wine is half from the cool 
Russian River Valley and half from almost-as-cool Dry Creek Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite wine of the tasting was 1992 St. Clement Vineyards Chardonnay 
($16), with classic lemon zest and spice aromas and a sensational texture. Try 
it with grilled swordfish.  
</P>
<P>
 Other 1992 Chardonnays that did well were Belvedere Winery ($13), with spiced 
fruit like apples and quince; Carneros Creek Winery ($13), lightly tropical 
with a marvelous crisp texture; Iron Horse Vineyards ($18), with green apple 
and lime; Shafer Vineyards ($15.50), laden with tropical fruit notes and 
richness without much oak, and Handley Cellars ($11), a Dry Creek-area wine 
with lean, crisp notes. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer a richer style, the 1992 Dehlinger Winery ($14) was 
interesting and tasty. DAN BERGER

CONFLICT OF INTEREST ALLEGED IN BGH APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three congressmen, including Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Riverside), have 
asked the General Accounting Office to look into a possible conflict of 
interest involving the federal government's 1993 approval of the controversial 
animal drug recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who chairs the influential House Science and Technology Committee, and 
Reps. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) and David Obey (D-Wis.) have formally asked the 
Government Accounting Office to investigate the Food and Drug Administration's 
approval of the Monsanto Co. drug, designed to increase milk production in cows 
by as much as 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, would review allegations that two top 
FDA officials with former ties to Monsanto continued to play a role in the 
agency's rBGH approval process and a subsequent labeling regulation after 
joining FDA. The drug is the first major food product developed through 
biotechnology or genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot at stake here," said Rep. Sanders in a telephone interview 
with The Times from his Burlington, Vt., office. "Monsanto is a 
multibillion-dollar company that invested hundreds of millions in rBGH 
development, and that is a huge investment for any size company. . . . The 
whole process has been extremely controversial from the beginning. . . . And 
if, in fact, it can be shown that the process was tainted -- that you had key 
people in FDA who made approval and labeling decisions who are closely 
affiliated with Monsanto -- then you call into question the entire process and 
the legitimacy of the process." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the allegations are Michael R. Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner 
for policy, and Margaret A. Miller, deputy director of FDA's office of new 
animal drug evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, while an attorney for the Washington-based firm of King & Spaulding 
from 1980 until 1991, did work for Monsanto. Miller, an endocrinologist, was 
employed as a senior research biologist for Monsanto and was a key participant 
in the company's rBGH safety tests between 1985 and 1989. Both went directly 
from their previous positions to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim O'Hara, FDA deputy commissioner for public affairs, said the agency's 
legal counsel had thoroughly reviewed Taylor's case and found no ethical 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that at no time was Miller involved in FDA's review of the Monsanto 
application for rBGH, nor did she participate in writing any of the subsequent 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have looked at these allegations in the past and feel comfortable that we 
have taken appropriate safeguards against conflict of interest," O'Hara said. 
"If a third party wants to also look at them, then we welcome that." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor did sign the FDA's interim regulation, which appeared in the Federal 
Register in February and stated that milk from rBGH-treated cows did not need 
to be labeled as a product of biotechnology. The guidelines also placed strict 
limits on claims that could be made for dairy products that originated from 
cows that did not receive the rBGH drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulation angered consumer groups and some in the dairy industry because 
it prevents firms from using any "rBGH-free" terminology on milk and milk 
products. Instead, companies that want to differentiate their products from 
those produced with the assistance of Monsanto's rBGH drug must include 
extensive language stating, in part, "No significant difference has been shown 
between milk derived from (rBGH) treated and (non-rBGH) treated cows." 
</P>
<P>
 (Just last week, Vermont and Maine signed into law regulations mandating that 
milk and milk products derived from cows treated with the rBGH drug be 
identified on the label.) 
</P>
<P>
 FDA's O'Hara said that while Taylor's signature appeared on the interim 
regulation, he did not write it. The authors, he said, were scientists in the 
agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Taylor was operating within federal ethics guidelines when he 
signed the regulation. Taylor came to FDA in 1991 and recused himself from any 
matters involving former clients -- such as Monsanto -- for a year, as required 
by law. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-month recusancy expired well before FDA formally approved Monsanto's 
rBGH drug in November, 1993, and issued the labeling guidelines in February, 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's former law firm, King & Spaulding, which still represents Monsanto, 
has sent numerous letters on behalf of the drug company to dairy processors who 
have attempted to adopt rBGH-free labeling, warning them they are out of 
compliance with FDA regulations. As part of the correspondence, King & 
Spaulding include a copy of the FDA's interim guidelines, the same guidelines 
signed by former King & Spaulding attorney Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, King & Spaulding have sent letters on our behalf to companies that we 
believe were not following the law in terms of what they were saying about 
their products and the use or non-use of rBGH," said Tom McDermott, Monsanto's 
director of communications in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Monsanto has filed lawsuits against two dairy processors who have 
persisted with rBGH-free labeling, McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressmen said their request for the GAO investigation was prompted, in 
part, by an unsigned letter, dated March 16, from employees in FDA's Center for 
Veterinary Medicine who contend that former Monsanto employee Miller has been 
active in the agency's rBGH policy deliberations which they contend was an 
apparent conflict of interest.

 Fetzer Vineyards announces a recipe contest ("The Great Salad Toss") for 
"wine-friendly" salad recipes. This is more of a challenge than you might 
think; most connoisseurs insist vinegar spoils the flavor of wine.The deadline 
is June 15; 15 finalists and their guests will get to spend a September weekend 
at the Fetzer Food & Wine Center, where the winner of the $5,000 grand prize 
will be announced. Call (800) 959-4035 for contest guidelines. Write 100 Times:

 A recent issue of the journal Pediatrics reported on eight children, aged 14 
to 27 months, whose abnormally slow growth was traced to drinking too much 
apple juice. When their parents started providing three full meals and two or 
three snacks a day -- and keeping the apple juice ration below half a cup -- 
the children started to grow normally again. Wholesome though it is, apple 
juice just doesn't provide enough protein, minerals and fat for growing 
children. Wheat Thins Aren't Thin? We're Shocked, Shocked!

 Nabisco Biscuit Co. says it will introduce reduced-fat Oreos -- as well as 
low-fat Ritz Crackers and Chips Ahoy! and reduced-fat Triscuits, Better 
Cheddars and Wheat Thins -- on April 25. The original varieties will continue 
to be available. Maybe It's Ultra-Lean

COUSCOUS; THE TUNISIAN VARIATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Say North Africa to a food lover and chances are he'll say couscous. In 
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, it is by far the most popular food. It is famous, 
it is simple, it is soothing and it is delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a container with a perforated bottom, fill it with a thousand tiny grain 
pellets, place it above a bubbling stew and voila ! The vapors from the stew 
will both swell the granules and flavor them. Eat the pellets and the stew 
together, and the result is happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people think of couscous as a grain. Not so; it's basically a way of 
treating grain. You can steam whole-barley or green-wheat kernels as couscous, 
or even green barley shoots. But many people make their couscous from ground 
semolina, in which case it's something more akin to pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 They blend fine semolina flour and coarse semolina with a little water, roll 
it into little lumps and then press them through a sieve to form minute and 
uniform balls. These balls are rolled around on another sieve to remove excess 
flour. They can be steamed and eaten right away, or they can be steamed, dried 
and stored. The dried form is the couscous "grains" you buy at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Africa, making couscous by hand is a tradition handed down from 
mother to daughter, and the average family eats couscous about twice a week, 
making it a staple. But since making it by hand takes time and many modern 
North African women work, the old method is rapidly falling out of favor. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip to Tunisia I had a chance to visit the world's largest and 
most modern couscous factory, Couscousseries du Sud, located in Sfax, the 
second city of Tunisia and a major port. I didn't know quite what to expect -- 
perhaps a thousand women in neat factory rows making couscous all at once. 
Instead, I found a completely automated plant run by men, an almost nightmare 
maze of broilers, vats and chutes that turn out tons of couscous a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Tunisian couscous is not as well known as the Moroccan 
style, but as I discovered, it can be very good. Chile peppers sound the 
predominating note. One of my favorites is a red and green specialty called 
kuski mfawwar , which combines fennel and carrot tops with celery leaves and 
powerful flavors such as red pepper, scallions, coriander, caraway and garlic. 
Use two pounds of greens for every pound of couscous and you will discover how 
much flavor and earthiness they can contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuski mfawwar has many variations. In Sfax, they make it with malmouth , or 
grilled and cracked barley grits, instead of couscous grains, and I have also 
tasted it with whole-wheat couscous. But the best version is a recipe given to 
me by Aziza ben Tanfous, curator of the Sidi Zitouni Museum on the island of 
Djerba, who learned it from her grandmother. Since it tends to be slightly dry, 
you may want to serve it the traditional way, with glasses of buttermilk. 
</P>
<P>
 The special texture and lightness of small-grain couscous makes it an ideal 
substance for desserts. A delicious nut, date and custard dessert uses a 
fine-grain couscous known as mesfouf which, when steaming, swells to the size 
of the medium couscous available in stores. Often Tunisians will substitute 
coarse-grain semolina, and that is what I have used. You can find coarse 
semolina at a Middle Eastern grocery. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert couscous is more popular in Tunisia than in Morocco. In Morocco it is 
rich with butter and sugar, and eaten warm or even hot. Tunisian couscous is 
less sweet and is served cool or even chilled, often mixed with fresh fruits in 
season such as small grapes, or pomegranate seeds mixed with seedless black 
raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe for the sweet couscous below comes from Sfax. What I especially 
like about it is that, while Tunisian sweet couscous dishes tend to be a little 
on the dry side, this one is moist due to a layer of creamy pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a large couscous known as mhammas. Pellets about the size of 
Italian acine de pepe are rubbed in olive oil, steamed for a full hour, then 
dumped into a sauce so that they continue cooking until they become soft. Their 
silky and almost sodden texture is much appreciated in many southern parts of 
Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 I found any number of delicious fish couscous recipes in Tunisia too. A 
particularly appetizing one is prepared on the island of Djerba in a 
three-tiered steamer. Slices of bluefish, embedded in a mixture of chopped 
mint, parsley, Swiss chard and fennel leaves are steamed over a 
cinnamon-and-cumin scented broth. The couscous, steaming in solitary splendor 
on top, absorbs the aromas from the two tiers below. In southern Tunisia, dried 
fish, octopus and bits of pungent lamb jerky called qadid (spiced, dried and 
preserved in oil) are often used, with cubes of apricots mixed in to punctuate 
the salty flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular home-style couscous on Djerba uses red pepper, coriander, 
tomatoes, fresh green chile, lamb, olive oil, qadid and dried baby sardines 
called ouzef , which add a distinctive fishy flavor that acts as a taste 
stimulant and catalyst. You can eliminate the sardines but not the lamb jerky, 
which gives the dish its unique flavor and a mildly crunchy texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Many modern Tunisian couscous dishes are hot and spicy, with lots of fiery 
harissa, ground coriander, cumin and garlic. Older ones, which tend to taste 
both mellow and exotic, are often made with quince, raisins and a curious blend 
of dried rosebuds, black pepper and ground cinnamon. Lately it has become 
popular to mix the two styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Morocco, you can find couscous that is both spicy and sweet, the two 
contradictory tastes interacting and tantalizing the tongue. There is the 
simplest Berber couscous -- tossed with fresh favas, then downed with 
buttermilk -- and the most lavish palace version in which pigeons, stuffed with 
various fillings, are nestled in the grain. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a spicy couscous in which chiles and ground pepper sound the 
predominating note, and there's the great classic sweet Moroccan couscous of 
Fez, in which onions, raisins, chick peas and lamb are served together in 
perfect harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunisians tend to steam their couscous covered, while Moroccans and Algerians 
do not. As a result, the Tunisian version tends to be more tender and moist; 
the Moroccan and Algerian, a little fluffier and lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunisian couscous is also presented differently. Tunisian cooks moisten their 
steamed grains with lots of broth and often mix the ingredients into the grains 
so that the dish comes to the table like a pilaf or paella. Moroccan and 
Algerian cooks prefer to moisten the grains lightly, with thin broth, then make 
a well in the center for the remaining broth and vegetables. Restaurants 
usually serve the various ingredients separately so that each diner can take 
what he likes. But in the home, couscous, like most North African food, is 
traditionally presented in one large bowl or platter. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of couscous just grows and grows. Many countries have come up 
with native versions of the North African original. There is keskes in Senegal, 
cuscuz in Brazil, kuskus in northern Greece and Turkey, and even cuscusu in 
Trapani, Sicily, for which the sauce is the local fish soup. In Lebanon and 
Jordan, they make a couscous of large round semolina pellets cooked with onions 
and chicken and call it mughrabiyya , which means "from the Mahgreb," the 
collective noun for Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. COUSCOUS WITH GREENS (Kuskim

 In 1492, when the last Moorish kingdom fell in Spain, not all the Andalusian 
Moors fled to Morocco. Some sailed into the bay of Tunis to settle south of the 
city in a town called Testour. They introduced their own spice usages to the 
Tunisian culinary spectrum, the most important being a spice mixture called 
twabil, used in recipes for salads, stews and couscous. (A confusing note: In 
the Tunisian dialect, word tabil or twabil -- which means "spices" in Arabic -- 
is often applied to ground coriander alone, but it's also the name of the 
following spice mixture.)

 This delightful couscous, the most popular one on the Tunisian island of 
Djerba, is eaten "from one day to the next," said the local cook who taught it 
to me. Made with fine-grained couscous, it is flavored with red pepper, 
coriander, tomatoes, fresh green chile, lamb, olive oil and two unusual 
ingredients: qadid (a lamb jerky that contributes a pungent flavor and a 
pastrami-like texture) and ouzef, dried baby sardines with a distinctive fishy 
taste that acts as a taste stimulant and catalyst. You can eliminate the dried 
fish, but not the jerked meat, which gives the dish its unique flavor and a 
mildly crunchy texture.  
</P>
<P>
 This couscous can be made in advance and reheated, uncovered, in small 
quantities in the microwave.  
</P>

 1 cup green peas, shelled or thawed 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 4 tablespoons minced green chile to taste 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl soak Qadid in warm water until soft, 10 minutes. Drain and discard 
bones. Cut meat into small chunks. 
</P>
<P>
 In bottom of couscous cooker heat 3 tablespoons olive oil and oil from Qadid. 
Add onions and lamb and saute 5 minutes. Cover and cook over low heat until 
meat gives off moisture and reabsorbs it. Add Qadid and tomato paste. Cook, 
stirring, until meat is well coated and glossy. 
</P>
<P>
 Add crushed tomatoes, Tabil, caraway and 1 cup water, cover and cook 15 
minutes. Then add 1 quart water and bring to boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, rinse couscous in sieve, spread on baking pan. Let stand until 
grains swell, 5 to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Break up lumps by raking couscous through your fingers. Lightly oil inside of 
perforated top and fasten onto couscous cooker. Seal 2 containers, if 
necessary, with strip of wet cheesecloth. When steam is rising through 
perforated holes, pile couscous into top container, cover and steam couscous 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer steamed couscous onto baking pan. Gradually break up large lumps of 
couscous with long spoon while sprinkling couscous with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 
1/2 cups cold water. When couscous is cool enough to handle, break up any lumps 
with moistened fingertips. Allow couscous grains to swell 5 minutes. Then 
sprinkle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and lightly rake couscous grains with 
fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 Add carrots, potatoes and drained fish to simmering broth. Make sure there is 
enough water to cover all solids by 1 inch. Bring broth back to boil. Fasten on 
perforated top, pile couscous into top container, cover and steam 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lift top container, slip in peas, parsley and green chile to simmering broth, 
return top container and steam another 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip couscous into wide serving dish. Taste cooking liquid. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Broth should be just thick enough to lightly coat back of 
wooden spoon. Add contents of cooker to couscous and gently toss to combine. 
Cover and let stand 15 minutes before serving. Makes 6 servings.

 Note: Dried baby sardines, size of whitebait, can be found in Asian food 
stores, where they are called niboshi (in Japanese), ca com (in Vietnamese), 
joetkal (in Korean) and chao pai (in Chinese). Look for bright, shiny-skinned 
firm fish, which will keep indefinitely in dry place. Though it is not 
necessary to remove heads from Tunisian ouzef (unless they are sandy), it is 
wise to do so with Asian substitutes, because, according to Jacki Passmore, 
author of "The Encyclopedia of Asian Food and Cooking," some fish heads will 
turn bitter when cooked.

 Qadid is a sort of North African confit, where lamb is preserved in olive oil. 
The spicing and drying of the meat is similar to the treatment given to Turkish 
bastourma. The resulting flavorful, pastrami-like flesh is used by Tunisian 
cooks to infuse aroma, spicy flavor and richness to an endless number of 
recipes, including dishes of beans and lentils, bread, couscous and even 
scrambled eggs. Shoulder chops have just the right amount of bone and flesh for 
preserving. The preserving oil, called dhen, should not be discarded because it 
makes an excellent fat to use for Tunisian soups and stews. Tunisian cooks 
insist Qadid will keep a year if well stored, but I have never kept it for more 
than two months. Tunisian Spiced and Preserved Meat (Qadid) 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds lamb shoulder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup coarse sea salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 head crushed cloves of garlic 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground caraway 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried mint, pressed through sieve 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups olive oil or more as needed 
</P>
<P>
 Cut each chop into 3 or 4 long strips. (Use cleaver to crack through bones.) 
Rub flesh with salt and garlic. Stack strips in deep bowl, cover and 
refrigerate overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Following day, dry meat with paper towels, rub with red pepper, caraway, 
coriander and mint and set on cake racks in 175-degree oven to dry, about 8 
hours. Meat is ready when dry to touch but still supple enough to bend 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 In deep skillet or saucepan heat olive oil, add meat and fry until light crust 
forms on all sides. Remove from heat and allow meat to cool in oil. Divide meat 
between 2 (1-pint) Mason jars. Cover with frying oil and top off with fresh oil 
to completely cover meat by 1 inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Store in refrigerator. As you remove pieces of Qadid, add fresh oil to keep 
all remaining pieces from being exposed to air. 
</P>
<P>
 Always soak Qadid in water to remove excess salt before cooking, about 15 
minutes. Makes 15 to 20 strips Qadid.

 The first and most important step in making any couscous dish is the steaming. 
Steaming couscous is not difficult, but it is necessary, no matter what the 
instructions on the package might say. The grains of a good couscous must be 
light, separate, tender and fluffy, and steaming is the only way to achieve 
these qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 I have tried various so-called "instant" brands, followed instructions and 
found the results indigestible if eaten in any quantity. Couscous can expand to 
many times its original size. One pound (2 1/2 cups) of processed couscous, 
"pre-cooked" at the factory, can expand with proper steaming to 12 cups. If you 
don't steam it properly, beware: It will just go right on expanding in your 
stomach! 
</P>
<P>
 But to begin at the beginning . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Place the couscous in a fine sieve and set under cool running water until 
completely wet. Dump into a bowl and allow the pellets to swell for five 
minutes, then break up the lumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Fill the bottom part of a couscous pot with water or broth and bring the 
liquid to a boil. If you don't own a couscoussiere, a deep kettle with a 
snug-fitting vegetable steamer or colander will do. If the latter doesn't fit 
perfectly, use padding. Dampen a cheesecloth, twist it into a strip long enough 
to wrap completely around the kettle top, and tuck it between the two parts, to 
make sure the steam rises only through the perforated holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly oil the inside of the steamer. But don't line those holes with 
cheesecloth! The rising steam will prevent the grains, no matter how small, 
from falling through. Don't let the perforated top touch the boiling liquid 
below either. 
</P>
<P>
 With the perforated container in place, pile the moistened couscous in it when 
the liquid below comes to a full boil. If directions call for covering, cover 
tightly, and steam 15 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove top half of couscous maker, place the couscous in a large, shallow pan 
and spread it out with a long fork. Sprinkle some salt and cold water (one cup 
per pound of couscous) over the grains. Separate and break up lumps by lifting 
and stirring gently. Oil your hands lightly and gently rework the grains. 
(Moroccans allow the couscous to dry at this point; Tunisians don't.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pile the couscous back into the pot and continue steaming, covered if called 
for in the directions, until fully cooked, about 10 to 15 more minutes. (The 
color of the couscous becomes lighter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dump the couscous into a wide serving dish. Fluff up with a fork and moisten 
with some of the prepared broth and garnish. Cover and allow the couscous to 
swell 10 more minutes before serving. You can completely assemble couscous in 
advance and reheat portions in the microwave, uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 One last, but very important note: The stew in the bottom of the couscoussiere 
may be fully cooked before the couscous is ready. If so, transfer the stew to a 
separate saucepan, keep warm, and continue steaming the couscous over boiling 
water. PAULA WOLFERT

COUSCOUS; A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE NOODLE

 The story of couscous is one of elegance, innovation -- and laziness. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most worthwhile inventions serve laziness (or "save time and 
energy," as we prefer to say). In the case of couscous, a lazy way of doing 
things accidentally opened the door to a whole new aesthetic realm: a way of 
cooking grain into something incomparably light and delicate. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks as if couscous was invented in the 11th or 12th Century in northern 
Morocco or Algeria, or maybe even in Spain, which in those days was culturally 
and politically part of North Africa. Originally it was a hurry-up way of 
making noodles without kneading the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 We knead noodle dough in order to "awaken" or "develop" gluten. Unlike the 
other proteins in wheat, gluten forms long, springy structures in well-kneaded 
dough. If you try to make noodles from under-kneaded wheat dough, however, they 
won't have gluten's resilience and they'll turn into mush when you boil them. 
</P>
<P>
 So will pasta made from most other grains, because they lack gluten (an 
exception being the Chinese "cellophane" noodles that are made from glutinous 
rice). This is why cooks around the world usually deal with grains other than 
wheat either by boiling them or making them into unleavened flat-breads, which 
are more or less porridge dried out by baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike noodle dough, couscous isn't kneaded one tiny bit. The traditional way 
of making it is to put a big bowl full of flour in your lap, sprinkle it with 
lightly salted water and then run your fingers around the bowl in circles and 
figure-eights until little granules form. From time to time, you sieve the 
flour to get the granules out. You segregate them by size and dry them until 
you're ready to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the granules haven't been kneaded and the gluten is still "sleeping," 
the only thing holding them together is the shorter strands of other proteins, 
which don't have to be "developed." Naturally, if you boil couscous (especially 
hand-made couscous) like pasta, it turns into a porridgy mess. If you steam it, 
though, it fluffs up into something completely lacking the chewy quality of 
gluten -- something amazingly tender, practically ethereal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time couscous was invented, the Moors were making several kinds of 
noodles, mostly little orzo- like soup noodles, rather than linguine-like 
strands of pasta. The noodle recipes in two 13th-Century cookbooks from Moorish 
Spain say to knead dough and then "twist" it into tiny lumps described as 
looking like small garbanzos ( hummais ), wheat grains or peppercorns. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th-Century cookbooks already knew the couscous technique, however. One 
of them, entitled "The Superfluity of the Table," gives a recipe called zabzin 
, said to be a dish from the Spanish quarter of the city of Fez, Morocco. It 
uses the couscous technique of sprinkling water on flour and running the 
fingers through it. The recipe says to make granules "like small garbanzos." 
</P>
<P>
 Another recipe in the same book describes making the usual sort of Moorish 
soup noodle out of kneaded dough, "twisted" into balls the size of peppercorns. 
However, it casually mentions that these dough balls might also be "spun in the 
kneading trough like zabzin , for him who wants to accomplish it quickly." The 
name of this noodle-or-couscous deal is muhammas -- which means "made like 
garbanzos," echoing zabzin 's small-garbanzo size, even though muhammas itself 
is in the peppercorn league. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual nature of muhammas lives on. Even today, mhammas or mhammsa (the 
modern Arabic form) or timhemmezt (the Berber form) is a noodle in some parts 
of North Africa and a largish couscous in others. 
</P>
<P>
 The word couscous itself has the same dual nature in a 13th-Century cookbook 
from Syria. "The Link to the Beloved" gives two couscous recipes: kuskusu , a 
small kneaded soup noodle, and " kuskusu of the North Africans," which is 
proper couscous, made by rolling and steaming. So we can't be certain whether 
couscous or muhammas came first. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's anybody's guess how the idea of steaming came about. If the first 
people to stir up a bunch of couscous granules had tried to boil them, the 
result would have been disappointing, and couscous might never have become 
popular. Maybe the first workable procedure was the one spelled out on American 
couscous boxes (and despised by North African couscous connoisseurs): Pour 
boiling water over the granules and cover them until the grain smells cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, though, whether by accident or experiment, somebody steamed 
couscous. The results clearly impressed people, and cooks went wild for the 
idea of steaming. Even today, Moroccans often steam regular noodles instead of 
boiling them. Both the 13th-Century Moorish cookbooks actually give recipes for 
steaming bread crumbs like couscous, complete with the process of taking the 
contents out of the steamer several times during the steaming and buttering it 
and raking with the fingers to keep the steamed product light and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once people found how appealing couscous was, it became a necessity of life to 
North Africans. A 16th-Century Arabic book entitled "The Breath of Scent" 
recounts an anecdote from the early 14th Century:  
</P>
<P>
 " 'A North African stayed with me and fell sick,' recalled an old man, 'and 
the sickness lasted so long that I begged God to comfort both him and me with 
either death or health. In a dream I saw the Prophet, prayers and peace be upon 
him, and he said, "Feed him couscous." ' " 
</P>
<P>
 As you'd expect in an anecdote of this kind, the couscous totally cured the 
mysterious ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 The anthropologist Sophie Ferchiou has speculated that couscous is a way of 
preserving flour. Whole grain doesn't spoil; the germ is protected from the air 
by the seed coat (bran). Once the grain is ground into flour, though, the oils 
in the germ start to go rancid. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, couscous is made from freshly ground whole-grain flour, which 
is much better for the purpose than refined flour, because the bits of bran and 
germ gather the smaller starch particles around them, serving as the nuclei for 
couscous granules, much as grains of sand form pearls. Ferchiou points out that 
this process protects the oxidizable part of the grain by surrounding it with a 
coat of starch. Not everybody accepts her theory, but it is interesting that 
North African travelers always used to take the largest size of couscous with 
them on journeys, and presumably the larger the variety, the better protected 
it is from staling. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the real reason for the popularity of couscous is aesthetic. In many 
parts of North Africa, wheat is difficult to raise, and people mostly eat 
gluten-less grains such as millet, barley or corn. Couscous doesn't depend on 
gluten, though, so you don't need wheat to make it. If it weren't for couscous, 
grain cookery in many parts of North Africa would just about begin and end with 
porridge. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't even have to use grain at all. In the Kabyle Mountains of Algeria, 
ahethut is a sort of couscous made from a mixture of barley flour, bran and 
ground acorns. The Teda, who live around the Tibesti Mountains deep in the 
Sahara, sometimes use the seeds of a variety of goosefoot weed, which makes a 
black couscous. (Restaurants questing for novel colors in food might want to 
think twice -- the Teda only make black couscous in time of famine.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our word couscous comes from the Arabic term kuskusu , but the Arabs clearly 
borrowed it from one of the indigenous Berber languages of North Africa. 
Inconveniently, no Berber language uses exactly that word; in Morocco and 
Algeria, where most present-day Berbers live, they usually call it seksu . 
</P>
<P>
 Kuskusu / seksu refers to a middling-sized granule. The medieval recipes also 
mention larger couscous in the "tiny garbanzo" range, such as zabzin . The 
recipe in "The Superfluity of the Table" also refers to zabzin as barkus , 
which is clearly the same word as berkukes , the usual North African word for a 
larger size of couscous. Berkukes seems to be something like the word couscous 
with the Berber prefix ber -, meaning large.  
</P>
<P>
 The medieval books sometimes refer to a smaller size too, which they compare 
to peppercorns or ants. It must be the ancestor of seffa or mesfuf , the 
smallest modern grade of couscous. Traditionally mesfuf is steamed over water 
and then flavored with butter, rather than being steamed over stew and served 
with the stew as a sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesfuf appears to be an Arabic word, like muhammas , which suggests that the 
development of couscous took place in both the Arabic- and Berber-speaking 
populations. Another evidence is the fact that the Berbers (who now are 
primarily found the mountains of Morocco and Algeria, the Touareg territory of 
the Sahara and scattered villages and oases) include several Arabic words in 
their couscous vocabulary.  
</P>
<P>
 The Berbers have a couple of unique terms of their own. Originally abelbul may 
have meant a large or coarse sort of couscous, as it still does in northern 
Morocco, but today it's a barley couscous in Algeria and corn couscous in the 
Atlas Mountains. Morocco has special Berber names for couscous dressed with 
sour milk: sikuk in the north, ihellehen in the Atlas Mountains. (In the north, 
a suspiciously similar-looking word, ahelhul , means corn couscous.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, in the Berber heartland, the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, 
many dialects call couscous by the Arabic for "food" ( ta'am ), or by a word 
derived from the Arabic word meaning "to twist." For that matter, North African 
Arabs often call couscous ta'am.  
</P>
<P>
 It's only in North Africa that couscous is an essential part of life. Still, 
couscous has been known in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon for hundreds of years. It's 
also traditional in Sicily and Brazil. In Africa it has spread to Chad, Mali, 
Senegal and Nigeria. And it's still spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, it reached the Touareg of the Sahara only in this century, but 
now the words keskesu and tikhammezin are common in their oases and camps. 
Forty or 50 years ago, a visitor among the Touaregs could look forward to 
nothing but millet porridge, perhaps baked in sand. These days, though, when a 
Touareg says howdy, you can expect to feast on couscous.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a little more work than millet porridge, but it's worth it. And when you 
think about it, it's not that much work.

GOOD COOKING: BREAD LEFTOVERS: GOOD TO THE LAST CRUMB

 One of the most valuable leftovers to have on hand gets too often tossed out: 
dried-out bread. On the other hand, there are some cooks -- I'm one of them -- 
who save every crumb of bread. My freezer is full of little plastic bags of 
bread ends. But even when used in the usual way, we bread savers typically end 
up with an over-abundance of bits and ends. After all, there are only so many 
turkeys you can stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, too many cooks forget that beyond bread crumbs and stuffing, 
beyond breakfast toast and French toast, beyond bread-based pizzas and grilled 
sandwiches, there are other interesting ways to use these leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 How about soups thickened with bread instead of potatoes or flour? Bread 
puddings, both sweet and savory, are wonderful. And, of course, croutons add 
crunch, flavor and style to soups and salads. 
</P>
<P>
 With the following recipes, you can accumulate bread leftovers in the freezer 
and use them as the assets they truly are. Old bread isn't necessarily a crumby 
thing to have around.

 Sweet garlic and onion bread soup is as smooth as soup made from the most 
carefully cooked veloute sauce, yet the thickener is simply good old bread. The 
garlic mellows out as it cooks but the soup still smacks of its wonderful 
flavor. The parsnip -- and the process of sweating the vegetables until they 
are caramelized -- sweeten the soup to just the right point. Croutons are a 
great garnish, sopping up the garlic soup.  
</P>
<P>
 SWEET GARLIC AND ONION BREAD SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 very large head garlic, separated into cloves, peeled and halved 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium onions, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium parsnip, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup stale 3/4-inch bread cubes (without crusts)  
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Dash cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Croutons 
</P>
<P>
 Snipped fresh chives, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium heat. When hot, add garlic, 
onions and parsnip. Stir well. Lay piece of wax paper right on vegetables to 
sweat them. Cook, in this manner, until vegetables are lightly caramelized, 
about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid burning. Discard wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Add broth. Bring to boil. Simmer, covered, 20 minutes. Add bread cubes. Let 
stand few minutes until bread is soaked through. 
</P>
<P>
 Puree soup in blender until smooth. Season to taste with salt and cayenne. Can 
be made ahead and refrigerated up to 3 days or frozen as long as 3 months. 
Serve hot, garnished with croutons and snipped chives. Makes 3 3/4 cups, or 4 
servings.

 Bread puddings are in great favor these days but typically they are rich and 
sweet. This pizza bread pudding is neither; it's a delicious, homey dish that 
can easily make a meal with a salad of mixed greens. You can add other typical 
pizza ingredients, such as green pepper, sausage, etc., although the pudding is 
very tasty as is. When tomatoes are at their summer best, substitute two cups 
diced fresh tomatoes and their juices for the canned diced tomatoes.  
</P>
<P>

 Simplicity wins out here. There's no cooking in this dessert. "Day-old" 
toasted brioche or challah bread cubes are saturated with berry puree and 
juices, then compacted into individual souffle dishes. Plain high-quality bread 
can be used as well. Puree the berries with the sugar and let the mixture stand 
for about one hour at room temperature to bring out the essence (and liquidity) 
of the berries before tossing with the bread cubes.  
</P>
<P>
 BERRY BREAD PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 1 pint strawberries, hulled 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pint raspberries 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups stale 1/2-inch brioche or challah bread cubes 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly sweetened whipped cream, creme fraiche, softened frozen vanilla 
low-fat yogurt or ice cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Puree strawberries and raspberries with 2 tablespoons sugar. Taste. Mixture 
should be slightly tart. Add remaining sugar if needed. Let mixture stand at 
room temperature 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss bread cubes with berry mixture in 1 1/2-quart bowl. Let stand until all 
liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes, tossing often.  
</P>
<P>
 Line bottoms of 4 (3/4-cup) individual souffle dishes with circle of parchment 
or wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide bread-berry mixture between dishes, pressing down with back of spoon. 
Drape with plastic wrap. Weight dishes down (easily done by stacking 2 and 
weighting top dish with 14 1/2-ounce full can). Refrigerate 4 hours or 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, run knife around edge of each dish. Invert onto dessert plates. 
Serve with dollop of whipped cream. Makes 4 servings.

 When making bread pudding, it pays to toss bread cubes with the liquid and 
other ingredients in a mixing bowl, so that everything can be well mixed. For 
best results, the bread must absorb all the liquid as evenly as possible before 
being transferred to the baking dish. Some breads do this more quickly than 
others. ABBY MANDEL

CROUTON BASICS

<P>
 Great bread that's a day or more old makes great croutons. They're a good way 
to use up those miscellaneous ends of left-over loaves that pile up in the 
freezer.Here are some crouton tips and instructions on how to make them: 
</P>
<P>
 * To make neat cubes for croutons, freeze bread and thaw it just enough so 
that a sharp (not serrated) knife can cut through. Room-temperature bread, even 
old bread, is impossible to cut neatly.  
</P>
<P>
 * Remove crusts of semi-frozen bread and cut into cubes, usually about 3/4 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heat oil in a microwave oven until very warm; warm oil expands and goes 
further, making it possible to make croutons with less fat. Toss bread cubes 
with warm oil.  
</P>
<P>
 * Croutons are excellent plain but they can be flavored with herbs, black or 
red pepper, garlic and shallots. BASIC CROUTONS 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups of 3/4-inch bread cubes 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil, heated until very warm 
</P>
<P>
 Put bread cubes in small bowl. Sprinkle with warm oil. Toss to distribute oil. 
Cubes will not be coated. Spread single layer on baking sheet. Bake at 425 
degrees, stirring occasionally, until toasted and brown, about 8 minutes. Cool 
on wire rack.  
</P>
<P>
 Can be kept at room temperature few days, stored in airtight tin. To freshen 
up croutons, bake on baking sheet at 300 degrees until heated through, about 3 
minutes. Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about:

HOME COOK: SPRINGTIME: WHEN THE COOKING IS EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you don't consider yourself a good cook, you can become better by simply 
buying freshly harvested produce. And you don't have to learn lots of tricky 
cooking skills and techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The best sources for these fruits and vegetables are places where you can buy 
directly from the farmers. Roadside stands can be found along many rural roads; 
U-Pick farms allow you to pick the fruits or vegetables yourself (ideal if you 
do a lot of canning and preserving). Of course, farmers markets can now be 
found in almost every town or city in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying from farmers not only gives you the best available fruits and 
vegetables, it is a fine excuse to get away from the usual routine of shopping. 
Nothing beats a leisurely drive along rural country roads or a stroll outdoors 
at the farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to buy the best of the best, you need to learn how to pick out prime 
produce. Look and feel are the best guides. Most vegetables should have good 
color and a firm feel. Potatoes, for example, should be very firm to the touch. 
String beans should be crisp and bright-green. Garlic should feel heavy. 
Asparagus should have firm tops and not be soft and droopy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone fruits should yield when pressed gently but should not be soft. Cherries 
should always feel very firm. The best rule at farmers markets is to watch for 
stalls with lots of customers. Regular shoppers quickly figure out who raises 
the best fruits and produce.  
</P>
<P>
 Cook vegetables by gently boiling or steaming. Serve vegetables with very 
little dressing, as in the following recipe for asparagus with a modest amount 
of sesame mayonnaise. Good vegetables never suffer when served plain, lightly 
salted, with a touch of butter or olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The strawberry angel pie is certainly not simple, but it is a wonderful way to 
welcome the early strawberries of the season. If you want to serve strawberries 
that take very little preparation, try this: Hull them, slice them if you like, 
sugar lightly and pour freshly squeezed orange juice over them with a little 
grated orange zest. Toss lightly and chill until serving time. COLD ASPARAGUS 
WITH SESAME MAYONNAISE 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 to 1 teaspoon sesame oil  
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds asparagus, rinsed and trimmed 
</P>
<P>
 Place mayonnaise in bowl and stir in 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. Taste and add 
more, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook asparagus in large pot of salted, boiling water until just done, about 2 
to 5 minutes, depending on how thick stalks are. With tongs remove asparagus 
from water and let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until 
serving time. Serve each portion with scant tablespoon of sesame mayonnaise. 
Makes 6 servings.

 Meringues are temperamental. Don't be alarmed when the crust collapses a bit 
and cracks as it cools. This is as it should be -- the cracks won't show when 
the pie is filled.  
</P>
<P>
 STRAWBERRY ANGEL PIE 
</P>
<P>
 4 eggs, separated, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups strawberries, rinsed, hulled, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Combine egg whites, salt and cream of tartar in large mixing bowl. Beat with 
electric beater until soft peaks form. Slowly add 1 cup granulated sugar and 
beat until shiny peaks form. Spread mixture over bottom of buttered 9-inch pie 
pan, building meringue up around rim about 1 inch higher than edge of pan. Bake 
at 275 degrees until lightly golden and firm to touch, about 1 hour. Turn off 
heat and let cool in oven with door open. 
</P>
<P>
 While crust cools, beat egg yolks in pan until thick and pale. Slowly beat in 
remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Add lemon juice and zest. Cook over low heat, stirring 
constantly, until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Be careful not to let 
custard stick or scorch. Remove from heat and let cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat cream in mixing bowl until stiff enough to hold peaks. There should be 
about 3 cups. Refrigerate until time to assemble pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle powdered sugar over strawberries in bowl and gently toss to sweeten 
evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gently stir 1 cup whipped cream into cooled lemon custard, mixing only until 
well blended. Spread mixture over bottom of meringue shell. Fold strawberries 
into remaining 2 cups whipped cream and pile on top of lemon layer. Decorate 
surface of whipped cream with whole berries or bit of reserved strawberry 
juice. Makes 6 servings.

IN THE KITCHEN; THE SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most fruits and vegetables come into season quietly, on cat's feet. One day 
you look and there is asparagus. Or you're out shopping and realize artichokes 
are finally coming down in price. You think, "Oh, how nice," and pick up a 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception to this is strawberries. Strawberries come into season 
accompanied by waving flags and blaring brass bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's because strawberries are the best fruit Southern California has 
to offer -- with the possible exception of citrus, which we take so much for 
granted it could be culinary wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet nowadays, when you can find something called a strawberry in the market 
year-round, trucked in from Mexico, flown in from Chile . . . at this time of 
year it pays to stop at a farmers market or even one of the strawberry stands 
that still dot the area and pick up the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bite into one of these strawberries and you'll be amazed. These berries are 
soft, sweet and spicy -- a far cry from the tasteless Styrofoam that passes for 
strawberries most of the year. (There are two things to check to get the best 
berries: You should be able to smell them as you approach the stand, and they 
should be of the Chandler variety, the king of California early-season 
berries.) 
</P>
<P>
 When you've got really perfect berries of the kind we're getting now, you want 
to treat them as simply as possible. The first few boxes I picked up I simply 
sliced and sugared and ate with vanilla ice cream. (Again, a short checklist: 
Always rinse and dry the berries before topping them, and -- unless it's 
absolutely impossible -- don't stick them in the refrigerator. It kills the 
perfume.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the newness wears off, you can move into more involved recipes. Right 
about now, I'm deeply into strawberry shortcake, traditionally the best 
American strawberry dessert. In fact, I'm so far into strawberry shortcake that 
I spent a couple of days trying recipe after recipe, searching for the ultimate 
version. Let me tell you, there are a lot of shortcakes out there. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, let's define what we're talking about. Shortcakes are not the 
things you find for sale in most produce departments. They may call them 
shortcakes but they're spongecakes, with an emphasis on sponge. They look more 
like a piece from an automobile shock absorber than a shortcake. Actually, I 
think what some people do is find a shuttered auto parts plant someplace in 
Michigan and convert it for the summer to making these little foam disks. 
</P>
<P>
 Real shortcakes are short. In baking terms, that means they crumble when you 
cut them with a fork, rather than being soft and pillowy. They're actually 
sweetened biscuits, and most recipes for them are very similar -- flour, 
butter, sugar, baking powder and whipping cream. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you get down to testing them, you find that within those five 
ingredients there's a lot of room for variation. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the shortcake in Janeen Sarlin's "Food From an American Farm" 
(Simon & Schuster: 1991) has only 1/4 teaspoon sugar per cup of flour and no 
butter whatsover. It's a Grant Wood kind of biscuit -- monochromatic and severe 
as a Midwestern still-life. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Silverton's, in "Desserts" (Harper & Row: 1986), is sweeter (2 1/2 
teaspoons sugar per cup of flour) and is made with butter, but she also uses a 
little more baking powder than most. She also bakes the cakes at a lower 
temperature for a longer time than the others. It makes a brown, crumbly 
biscuit with a pronounced wheatiness from the longer baking and a bit of 
bitterness from the baking powder. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortcake in the 1975 edition of my "Joy of Cooking" (Bobbs-Merrill) was 
somewhere between those two -- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar per cup of flour, but 
finished with milk rather than cream. It was good but -- dare I say it? -- not 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 Maida Heatter's shortcake ("Great American Desserts," Knopf: 1985) was 
something else entirely -- two tablespoons of sugar per cup of flour and 
finished with milk mixed with an egg rather than cream. It was baked in two 
nine-inch cake pans and served all at once. Never mind, it was too sweet and 
too cakey. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortcake that came closest to the one I had in mind was Lindsey Shere's 
in her "Chez Panisse Desserts" (Random House: 1985). (Why is it that everything 
I bake from this book turns out tasting almost exactly like what I have in 
mind?) Anyway, the Shere cake has the same amount of baking powder as 
Silverton's but a little more sugar -- one tablespoon per cup of flour. It's a 
very small difference, but it moved the bitter-sweet balance in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I added a bit more sugar, and that proved to be exactly right to my 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we have to talk about whipped cream -- the crowning glory for any 
great shortcake. It should go without saying that only cream you've whipped 
yourself will do, but these days you can't be too careful. It's not hard, 
really. In fact, when I took a mess of shortcakes and strawberries to a 
friend's house for dessert, they didn't have a whisk to whip the cream, so I 
used a fork. It was a bit more strenuous, but ultimately it worked fine. 
Remember, don't whip the cream too stiff -- it should just hold soft mounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't oversweeten it. These aren't ordinary everyday biscuits or 
strawberries it's topping, and you want to be able to taste the cream -- save 
the sugar for the Styrofoam and shock absorber. ULTIMATE STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE 
</P>
<P>
 4 pints strawberries, rinsed and hulled 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 10 shortcakes 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups whipping cream, whipped 
</P>
<P>
 Cut strawberries in half and toss with sugar. Set aside 1/2 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Split each Shortcake while still warm. Spoon plenty of strawberries over 
bottom of each shortcake, top with generous spoonful of whipped cream and set 
top half of Shortcake on top. Makes 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about:

 It's important that your baking powder be active for the recipe to work, as 
there is no other leavener. The first couple of times we tried it in The Times 
Test Kitchen, the biscuits looked more like cookies than cakes. A change of 
baking powder did the trick.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortcake 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chilled butter, cut into 8 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into medium mixing bowl. Rubbing 
between fingers, or cutting with crossed knives or pastry cutter, work butter 
into dry ingredients until mixture forms consistency of cornmeal, with few 
larger lumps of butter left intact. Add half of cream and stir into dry 
ingredients with fork. Add remainder of cream, bit by bit, until mass forms 
that pulls cleanly away from bottom and sides of bowl. You may not use all of 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
 On lightly floured work space, quickly and lightly knead dough until smooth 
and cohesive. Gently roll out 1/2-inch thick. Cut out biscuits with 3-inch 
biscuit cutter, or lightly floured juice glass. Gather leftover dough together, 
knead again briefly and roll out again. Cut remaining biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Place biscuits on unbuttered baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees until 
light-brown and slightly crusty, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and 
cool slightly before splitting and serving. Makes 10 biscuits.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: TAH DIG IT, MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest concentration of Iranian-American businesses in Los Angeles is 
still, of course, that Westwood Boulevard commercial strip just south of the 
movie theaters and office buildings, a mile of video stores and groceries, 
places where you can have your sofa reupholstered, have jewelry appraised or 
buy odd candies made with rosewater and freshly roasted pistachio nuts, all, if 
you like, without speaking anything but Farsi. 
</P>
<P>
 Also along the strip are a number of sleek Iranian restaurants, all elegantly 
decorated, all serving more or less the same shish kebab-heavy menu -- and most 
of them have pretty good food. Shekarchi, next door to Rhino Records, is one of 
the best, a modern place with recessed spotlights and accents of elegantly 
corroded metal. It sort of looks as if it came out of a textbook of late-'80s 
postmodern restaurant design, right down to the open kitchen, oblique angles 
and obscurely placed panes of glass. Soft-hits radio drips out of overhead 
speakers. Sharezad Flame up the street may still be my favorite place for 
broiled whitefish and hot tanuri bread, but Shekarchi does have a following. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we hear that Shekarchi is catering a reception," an Iranian-wedding 
musician said to a friend of mine, "we try not to eat for a day before. You 
save more room that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The main thing at Shekarchi, as at most Iranian restaurants, is long-grained 
rice, vast amounts of rice, lofty drifts of rice that stretch the length of the 
platters, frosted with a yellow scattering of more rice that has been tossed 
with egg yolk and an almost medicinal tincture of saffron. (The best appetizer 
here is tah dig , the crunchy crust from the bottom of the rice pot -- smeared 
with a tomato-based split-pea stew and a sort of spinach-lima bean stew called 
ghormeh sabzi -- that is as hard to stop eating as guacamole and chips.) 
</P>
<P>
 At one corner of the rice mountain stands a broiled tomato, blackened, oozing 
sweet juice; along the northern flank lies a half-pound or so of broiled meat: 
rather over-marinated chunks of beef filet, good lamb, the garlicky ground-beef 
sausages called kubideh , and crusty, blackened chicken either on the bone 
(better) or not. You will probably want to season the meat with lemon, but 
nothing cuts through the richness like a side dish of torshi, more or less a 
vegetable relish pickled in a violently pungent vinegar brine.  
</P>
<P>
 There are different kinds of pilaf ( polo ) here: a dullish sort flecked with 
dill and lima beans, generally served with slabs of overcooked fish; also one 
topped with sour cherries, another garnished with a delicious, penetratingly 
sweet toss of candied orange peel, pistachios and slivered almonds, which goes 
nicely with the grilled chicken. The ubiquitous zereshk polo , translated on 
Shekarchi's menu as "Berry Berry rice," is tossed with sauteed barberries, 
which have the kind of bittersweet tartness you may associate with cranberries, 
but far more depth of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have not been trained to appreciate the, er, special flavor of 
rosewater, Iranian desserts -- rosewater-flavored pistachio ice cream, 
rosewater-flavored tangles of fried dough, a kind of rosewater ice shot through 
with toasted noodles -- may be something of a disappointment.

<P>
 DEAR SOS: We often dine at I Cugini in Santa Monica and are thoroughly 
intrigued with the chopped olive appetizer. We would all love to have the 
recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARILYN 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR MARILYN: It's more a method than a recipe -- and it's an idea that 
certainly didn't start with I Cugini. But it's a wonderful prelude to the food 
of executive chef Joe Venezia. Says Carla Ugolini, general manager: "I'm a bit 
embarrassed -- it's really quite simple." Aren't all good things? I CUGINI 
OLIVE PUREE 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups imported Kalamata olives, drained and pitted 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Put olives through meat grinder or food processor until chopped to medium-fine 
consistency. Moisten enough with olive oil to spreadable consistency. Amount of 
oil used will vary with type of olives, as some are more oily than others.  
</P>
<P>
 Stir before serving. It's best to work at room temperature. Keep refrigerated 
when not in use. Use as spread for toasted bread or crackers. Makes 1/2 cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Each tablespoon contains about:

 POLO , ANYONE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BURUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Persian foods are defined by the way rice is incorporated in the dish. 
Pilaf-style dishes of rice cooked together with other ingredients are known as 
polos . When plain boiled rice is served with a topping, it's called chelo ; 
kebab served with plain rice, for instance, is called chelo kebab. 
</P>
<P>
 Chelo is traditionally brought to the table piled into a mound on a large 
platter. The topping may be a khoresh (a thick, opulent stew-sauce) or one of 
many varieties of kebab. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cooks like to accompany chelo with tah dig , the crunchy rice that sticks 
to the bottom of the pot. Tah dig has become so popular that cooks have 
perfected several ways to ensure there will be lots of it. One method that 
works -- even when you're using a rice cooker -- is to mix a portion of cooked 
rice with a little egg yolk and butter, spread it into a 1/2-inch-thick layer 
on a rimmed baking sheet and bake it until it crisps.  
</P>
<P>
 A popular way to garnish chelo is to toss a small portion of it with 
saffron-flavored butter and sprinkle the golden grains onto the mound of plain 
rice.  
</P>
<P>
 The Iranian polos are the forebears of Indian pilaf and biryani rice. These 
can be fairly plain, with just a few herbs or spices flavoring the rice, or 
they may be opulent productions of rice studded with meat, assorted dried 
fruits and onions all perfumed with orange-flower water.  
</P>
<P>
 The most popular polos among Iran's hundreds of varieties include sabzi polo , 
loaded with fresh herbs; zereshk polo , with tart red barberries flavoring the 
rice; albalu polo , cooked with sour cherries and chicken; and shirin polo , a 
pilaf studded with syrup-sweetened orange peel, nuts and saffron-flavored meat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This stew for chelo isn't strictly authentic, but many Persian cooks here in 
the United States have started using ingredients that they wouldn't normally 
find in Iran. Turkey, for instance, is a big seller in many of our Persian 
markets -- in large part for its relatively low cholesterol content. In the 
following recipes, I've adapted two fruit stew recipes from Najmieh 
Batmanglij's "Food of Life," using turkey. These dishes are wonderful for 
entertaining from a practical point of view because they can be cooked a few 
days in advance and need only be reheated at serving time. The dishes may even 
pique your Iranian guests' curiosity.  
</P>
<P>
 Here are two recipes in one. Adjust the sugar, lemon juice and split peas, as 
indicated, according to the fruit you have chosen. Serve the dish with chelo 
and torshi (Iranian vinegar pickles).  
</P>
<P>
 QUINCE STEW OR APPLE STEW WITH TURKEY MEAT 
</P>
<P>
 2 large quinces or 5 tart cooking apples such as Granny Smith 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound turkey thigh meat cut into 1-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 Water 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground saffron dissolved in 1 tablespoon hot water 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow split peas 
</P>
<P>
 Persian Style Steamed Rice 
</P>
<P>
 Using apple corer, remove quince seeds, or peel and core apples. In skillet 
saute fruit in 2 tablespoons oil. Remove fruit and place in bowl, cover with 
plastic wrap and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat remaining oil in Dutch oven and brown onions. Push onions to side of pan, 
add turkey and cook, turning until browned. Add salt, pepper, cinnamon and 3 
cups water. Cover and simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 If using quince, add 3 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice, dissolved 
saffron, 1/3 cup yellow split peas and reserved fruit. Cover and simmer 
additional 35 minutes. If using apples, add 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons 
lemon juice, dissolved saffron and 1/4 cup yellow split peas. Cover and simmer 
30 minutes longer or until meat is tender. Add apples to pan and simmer 5 
minutes longer or until apples are tender but not mushy. 
</P>
<P>
 Taste and add more sugar or lemon juice, if necessary. Serve over 
Persian-Style Steamed Rice. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>

 STALKER CASE: Ventura County's first felony stalking case ended in a two-year 
prison term for an Oak View man who refused to quit harassing his ex-girlfriend 
(B1). . . . A judge sent Harold Owen Edwards to prison because he was "too 
great of a risk to be put on probation." Edwards twice broke into the woman's 
home, ransacked her bedroom, shredded her lingerie and made repeated threats on 
her life, court records showed. He even told her that her unhappiness was 
"worth going to prison for." 
</P>
<P>
 CYBER SPACE: Federal rule-makers have opened two more lanes on the information 
superhighway. And both of them promise to transform how we communicate and 
watch television (D1). . . . The Federal Communications Commission has approved 
interactive video that will allow viewers to respond to broadcasts on their 
television sets such as home shopping channels. The FCC is also opening up 
two-way paging and cellular phone technology that will soon resemble Dick 
Tracy's wristwatch radio. Says Jim Jouett, a Ventura cellular phone dealer: 
"It's a whole new ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 NIGHT MOVES: Ventura County takes on a completely different look in the wee 
hours of the morning (Ventura County Life, Page 30). . . . Streets that bustle 
by day become lonely outposts awash in the warm glow of street lamps. Most 
restaurants close by 9 p.m., leaving few public places for nighthawks to strut 
their stuff. An avowed night owl takes a nocturnal journey through a patch of 
suburbia known for rolling up its sidewalks within a few hours of nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 CAPITALIST WAYS: Russian businesswoman Marina Rudkovskaya is spending two 
weeks living with Ventura County Supervisor Maggie Kildee and working as a 
clerk and saleswoman in Bob Kildee's Shop for Men. She hopes total immersion 
into American-style capitalism during her internship will leave a lasting 
impression. What has she noticed so far? "In my country, it is a seller's 
market and so the sellers don't pay much attention to their customers." 
Rudkovskaya said. "In your stores, it is different."

 CHANGING TIMES: "Orange County to me is mainstream now," says Mark Russell, 
humorist and longtime observer of the political scene, who performs at UC 
Irvine Tuesday (OC Live!). "I don't know what happened to the John Birch 
Society, or those billboards that said 'Impeach Earl Warren.' That was always 
the stereotype," Russell says. "The only vestige of that is Congressman Bob 
Dornan -- 'B1 Bob.' He keeps the spirit alive." 
</P>
<P>
 BEATING ON BOB: Dornan, a conservative Republican from Garden Grove, is used 
to being targeted by the opposition. A local Democratic group called BeatBob 
has put out a set of eight trading cards with Dornan's picture, complete with 
colorful Dornan quotes and his record. . . . Dornan's response: "The BeatBob 
people have everything but a candidate. Really, they aren't serious about 
beating me. They're using my national image to keep their party from 
bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 REACHING OUT: Since almost the turn of the century, the local Japan America 
Society has worked to improve relations between the United States and Japan. 
What better way, its officials decided, than to throw a lavish dinner party for 
Japan's new consul general here, Seiichiro Noboru. . . . He'll also speak at 
the event -- co-hosted by several groups -- tonight at the Four Seasons Hotel 
in Newport Beach. Says a spokesman: "With the political changes in Japan, he'll 
have a lot to talk about."

 RIM RAT: Costa Mesa's Maris Valainis portrayed star basketball player Jimmy 
Chitwood in the 1986 movie "Hoosiers," and is still recognized eight years 
later playing in a Santa Ana recreational league (C1). . . . He's often asked 
how he made 12 consecutive jump shots without missing during a scene with his 
coach (played by Gene Hackman). Valainis said it wasn't planned, but a 
production assistant lent a hand by letting the air out of the ball so it 
wouldn't rattle around the rim and bounce out.

 PRETENDER: Perhaps you recall David Miller, ex-prez of the Granada Hills 
Chamber of Commerce who was sentenced to life last year for killing one of his 
two wives. . . . Well, he's back in the public eye, this time in a new book, 
"Deadly Pretender," by Karen Kingsbury. "He thought he could have anything he

 QUAKE TOLL: The impact of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake on Woodland 
Hills-based 20th Century Industries is far greater than anticipated. The 
company reported a first-quarter loss of $265.1 million, mainly because of 
quake insurance claims, including 31,000 from homeowners (D2). . . . The 
company, which first projected quake costs of $160 million, has revised that

 TOUGH TEEN: Taft High's Brahna Pastorini has exchanged her tennis racket for a

knows only one way -- aggressive. . . . After a great tennis career, however, 
she's relieved to share the spotlight with her softball teammates (C10).

 SURPRISE STOP: We were supposed to be shut out of any shuttle landings this 
year, but Mother Nature had another idea. Because of poor weather in Florida, 
the shuttle Endeavour touched down Wednesday at Edwards Air Force Base. . . . 
The mission was a success, collecting "an unprecedented view of our planet," 
one official said (B18). 
</P>
<P>
 PARTY TIME? The folks on San Fernando Mission Boulevard have put up with dust 
and noise as crews fix the quake-damaged Simi Valley Freeway. So, as a reward, 
they've been promised a block party on May 7. . . . But don't barbecue those 
chickens quite yet. Said one resident who lives near the Santa Monica Freeway: 
"Don't hold your breath. We haven't gotten anything we were promised" (B4).

DELAYS PLAGUE 2ND ROUND OF SCHOOL TESTS; EDUCATION: LATE DELIVERY OF MATERIALS 
DISRUPTS SCHEDULING BY CAMPUSES, SPARKING FURTHER CRITICISM OF TROUBLED CLAS 
PROGRAM. A DISTRIBUTOR IS PREPARING A REPORT ON THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM.

 Hundreds of schools throughout the state have had to postpone the second round 
of California's controversial standardized tests because of delays in 
delivering the exam materials, causing scheduling conflicts and administrative 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Southern California school districts, including Simi Valley Unified and 
Ventura Unified, that were supposed to give the California Learning Assessment 
System tests during the last few weeks have been forced to put plans on hold 
because materials did not arrive in time. Most have now received their packages 
-- a week or more later than expected -- but some were still waiting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, it's thrown our whole testing schedule into chaos," said Peter J. 
Boothroyd, assistant superintendent of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District. 
"How we're going to undo that mess will be determined by what day they arrive. 
If the tests arrive tomorrow we'll be OK, but we don't know. . . . We're just 
sitting on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, school officials in Fillmore and Ventura were forced to 
postpone planned testing dates to later this month or May. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Simi Valley Unified School District, 100 boxes full of tests 
originally scheduled to arrive last week were not delivered until Tuesday 
because of trucking and printing delays, said Rebecca Wetzel, the district's 
testing coordinator. Simi Valley principals were expected to pick up the tests 
by today, with schools administering the exams on Friday and during the next 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are unsure how extensive the delivery problem has been. 
Minnesota-based Questar Data Systems, the company hired to package and deliver 
the tests for the state, is preparing a report detailing how widespread the 
delays were and how much extra it will cost, state Department of Education 
spokeswoman Susie Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange attributed the delay to "just a series of problems . . . with moving 
millions of sheets of paper" and said Questar was not entirely responsible for 
the delay. Despite the problems, she said, all eligible students will be able 
to take the tests this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its second year, CLAS will test well over 1 million fourth-, fifth-, 
eighth- and 10th-graders at a cost of $26 million. Several private companies in 
California and out of state handle parts of the processing under state 
contract, and testing dates are staggered based on school schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tests have only been delayed about a week in most cases, the 
situation has launched further criticism of CLAS, which in recent weeks has 
been attacked because of problems in scoring last year's tests and by 
conservative groups that are outraged over its content. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most schools, it's just an inconvenience," Lange said of the delays. "I'm 
not minimizing that, but there were no costs incurred for them. It's just a 
matter of rescheduling." 
</P>
<P>
 But local school officials are worried that CLAS will now conflict with other 
standardized tests planned for later in the spring or other scheduled events 
such as field trips, open houses or staff development days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put out to schools in August the testing calendar for the coming year and 
they try to schedule other things around that," Los Angeles school district 
testing coordinator Linda B. Lownes said. "Now this piles a lot of tests on top 
of each other and schools will be trying to give the CLAS tests at times they 
have . . . other things planned." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Los Angeles schools were scheduled to administer the tests this 
month, Lownes said. Calling the situation "very, very disruptive," she said the 
district has postponed CLAS three times and now plans to give CLAS between May 
4 and June 3 -- the same period previously set aside for the California Test of 
Basic Skills, which is also given to all students. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators also said they are frustrated that arrangements they made for 
CLAS testing are now for naught, and that there is less time to sort through 
the material and train teachers to give the new segments of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 And although principals typically warn students, teachers and parents of 
testing days to encourage attendance, a good night's sleep and a healthful 
breakfast, some administrators said now they now will be forced to spring the 
tests on children with no notice. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state's plan, each school district was to give the tests 
between its 135th and 155th day of instruction, with some starting in March and 
others testing through the first weeks of June, but most scheduled for April 
and May. Schools planning to test next week or afterward should not have any 
delays, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questar was supposed to collate and deliver the exam packages on a rolling 
schedule that matched each school's calendar and testing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The disruptions began last month. Administrators who were awaiting arrival of 
the tests instead received a series of memos from Questar announcing the 
delays. None explained the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS will test students in reading, writing, math, science and history and 
measure performance against tough statewide standards. Results of the 1993 
tests released in March painted a grim portrait of California students, with 
one-third demonstrating little or no understanding of basic math concepts.

JOHN MCLIAM; BROADWAY, FILM CHARACTER ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John McLiam, a Broadway character actor who also worked extensively in films 
and television from "My Fair Lady" to "Dynasty," has died. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 McLiam died Saturday in Woodland Hills after suffering from Parkinson's 
disease and melanoma, his wife, Roberta, said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known for a remarkable facility with speaking in various accents -- 
British, Cockney, Irish, Australian, Russian, Swedish, or Western, Southern or 
Brooklyn -- and moved easily from roles in Shakespearean productions to the 
part of Pa Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
 Born John Williams, the actor later assumed the Gaelic version of his surname, 
McLiam, as his stage name. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied English at St. Mary's College in Northern California and earned a 
master's degree from UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief stint as a reporter for the San Francisco Examiner, he appeared 
in a couple of plays and did so well that he moved to New York to go into 
theater. After studying playwriting, acting and directing, he made his Broadway 
debut as an actor in "Barefoot in Athens" in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1950s, McLiam appeared in several Broadway plays and scores of 
television and radio programs originating from New York. He also wrote plays, 
including "The Sin of Pat Muldoon," which was produced on Broadway in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 McLiam moved to California in 1961 and concentrated on films and episodes of 
prime-time television series including "Dynasty," "Two Marriages" and "Highway 
to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to "My Fair Lady," his films included "Cool Hand Luke," "In Cold 
Blood," "The Iceman Cometh," "The Reivers," "The Missouri Breaks" and "First 
Blood." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, McLiam is survived by a daughter, Claire, of Santa 
Barbara, and one granddaughter, Rose Alice.

SCOTT HARRIS: A BITTER STING FOR THE BEE HIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have been friendly neighbors for more than 30 years now, the two little 
businesses at the southwest corner of Ventura and Van Nuys boulevards. The 
Sherman Oaks Newsstand, anchored to the exterior wall since 1949, is a source 
of out-of-town papers and periodicals that range from the Yale Review to Juggs. 
Next to it is the Bee Hive Beauty Supply, which is also known for its rich 
variety of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of calls from other beauty suppliers," Scott Schiffman boasts. 
"Someone will ask for something that no one has ever heard of. And it's: 'Go to 
the Bee Hive. They'll have it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is where Scott Schiffman grew up. Back in 1964, he was the 7-year-old boy 
who scratched his name in wet concrete out back. He played in the alley and 
helped in the store. He remembers Clint Eastwood seeking his father's counsel 
on how to color his graying whiskers, and child star Kristy McNichol 
brandishing her first MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything but the walls and the memories came crashing down Jan. 17. A pile 
of plastic bottles three feet deep oozed a vivid, fragrant honey of peroxide, 
shampoo, nail polish, polish remover, creams, colognes and makeup. Before long, 
inspectors put a red tag on the door. Customers who call now hear a recording 
saying, "Believe it or not, we're still closed," and Schiffman's buoyant 
promise that he'll soon announce the Bee Hive's new location. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving is hard. What makes it harder, it seems, is that the Newsstand is 
squeezing the Bee Hive out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's putting it too harshly. Although Schiffman felt bitter a few 
weeks ago, he says he doesn't feel that way now. He doesn't think his landlord 
or his publicity-shy neighbor means to force him out. Now he reserves his anger 
for the Small Business Administration, wondering why his loan is taking so damn 
long to process. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a million stories in the quaking city and this is just one. But amid 
such upbeat news as rebuilt freeways and reopening stores, the tale of the Bee 
Hive is a reminder that for many others the recovery is a slow and painful 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be especially true in this stretch of Ventura Boulevard that cuts 
through Sherman Oaks, a community built upon the soft, shaky earth where the 
Los Angeles River used to stray before it was tamed by concrete channels. 
Merchants who've been fortunate enough to reopen must cope with the fact that 
the quake forced much of their old clientele to move out of condos and 
apartment buildings nearby. The more unfortunate are those such as Schiffman, 
who realizes that every day the Bee Hive remains closed, another customer may 
shift loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiffman speaks like someone from the old school, a businessman who prefers 
handshakes to contracts. Having grown up in the business, he remembers 
entrepreneurs who started out by mixing potions in their garage. The 
billion-dollar industry of today, he laments, is run by "people my age with 
MBAs who look at everything as dollars and cents." He also misses the old 
village atmosphere along Ventura Boulevard. He remembers the deli market that 
occupied the corner where Tower Records is now. "Before you would have a 
diner," he says. "Now you have Starbucks." 
</P>
<P>
 And he misses Charlie, the old landlord "who was like an uncle to me." 
Charlie, he says, had once assured his father that if he ever were to sell the 
building, it would be to him. Scott figured he had inherited the promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie died last year. After the quake, Scott was stunned to learn that 
Charlie's widow had agreed to sell the building to the 70-year-old owner of the 
Newsstand on the condition that the structure could be saved. And then he 
learned that his neighbor, starved for space, would need the back portion of 
the Bee Hive -- so much space, Schiffman says, the Bee Hive has no choice but 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schiffman shared the story as we as sat in two salon chairs. The Bee Hive 
wasn't the smartest place to be, but there was no aftershock. Schiffman 
speculates that Charlie, in his last months, decided that the Newsstand's 
owner, after 45 years, deserved first dibs. The anger has passed. "But when I 
think about leaving this space," he adds, "I get knots in my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 No use crying over spilled shampoo. There have been blessings, too. In a 
couple of weeks, Schiffman's first child will be born. His wife had been shaken 
so severely in the quake that they worried they might lose the baby, but 
everything is fine. Things could be a lot worse. But things would be better, 
Schiffman adds, if the SBA gets its act together. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked out the back door, past the Newsstand, and stopped at the corner 
beneath one of the plastic bee-girls who decorate the dull yellow facade. She 
had long dark lashes and pink lips. Thirty years later, she was still smiling.

BARKLEY CAN'T QUIT TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Barkley's at it again. He threatened retirement before and he's saying 
it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley said in Wednesday's Phoenix Gazette he's finished after this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm retiring either way," Barkley said before the Suns' home game Tuesday 
night against Seattle. "It's time. I've made up my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 He's said several times this season that it may be his last. But other times 
he has said he wouldn't decided until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Suns president Jerry Colangelo wasn't convinced, telling the Gazette he 
believed Barkley wasn't ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said all along, I think Charles Barkley is going to continue to play," 
Colangelo said. "I think he should. I think he enjoys it and I believe he will, 
so I don't pay much attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Colangelo said he hasn't talked with Barkley about his plans after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he comes to me and tells me he's through, then I'll know it's 
legitimate," Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's win over Seattle, Barkley said: "You can write whatever you 
want. You've got me for two more months and then that's it. I'm out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if anyone could change his mind, he said, "No. I'm serious." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Barkley said he struggled with retirement because of his back. 
When he returned in February after the tendon tear, again he hinted, but said 
he wouldn't make a decision until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley is averaging 21.9 points and 11.3 rebounds in 63 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "About two months ago, I thought I was done," Barkley said Tuesday. "I 
couldn't play in back-to-back games. I didn't have any strength in my legs and 
back. I was playing terrible. I was embarrassed about it, but there was nothing 
I could do about it."

JACKSON SLIDES GIANTS TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Jackson, the San Francisco Giants' temporary closer, knows he's no Rod 
Beck. But on Wednesday, his slider was hard enough to save the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson got the final four outs in the Giants' 5-4 victory over the 
Phildelphia Phillies after coming on in the eighth with the bases loaded to 
preserve the Giants' one-run lead. He got Mariano Duncan to swing on three 
straight sliders to end the threat, gave up a hit in the ninth and ended up 
with his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to pick up the slack until we get a healthy Rod Beck," said 
Jackson, the setup man who has been the closer since Beck, who saved 46 games 
last year, went on the disabled list April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we get him back in there, I'm sure all that pressure won't lean toward 
me as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who hasn't allowed in a run in his 10 1-3 innings this season, 
inherited the eighth-inning jam after Rich Monteleone gave up three consecutive 
hits, the last a run-scoring single by Kevin Stocker to make it 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan, who went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts, said Jackson was too tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a bad day at the plate," he said. "I think I've got one hit in 18 
at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, who have been struggling at the plate, got only seven hits, but 
took a 5-2 lead on Barry Bonds' two-out, two-run single in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Bill Swift walked, went to second on Darren Lewis' single and scored 
on Willie McGee's infield single, which was mishandled by third baseman Dave 
Hollins. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollins then bobbled Matt Williams' grounder for an error -- his sixth this 
season -- to load the bases for Bonds, whose line drive to right made it 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry came up with a big hit," Swift (3-1) said. "We haven't had too many 
two-out hits in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Giants committed two errors, Philadelphia's defensive problems 
stood out more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played well defensively," manager Jim Fregosi said. "It's a 
concern. We've played 15 games and made 18 errors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies got a run back in the sixth when John Kruk singled, Hollins 
walked and Darren Daulton's fielder's choice moved Kruk to third. Wes 
Chamberlain, who went 3-for-5 in his first start this season, followed with an 
RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Thompson then hit a sharp grounder that caromed off third baseman 
Williams' glove into left, but Bonds picked it up and made a perfect throw home 
to cut down Daulton trying to score from second. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia closed to 5-4 in the eighth on Stocker's RBI single off Rich 
Monteleone. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift, who brought a 0.42 ERA in the game, had an uncharacteristically bumpy 
outing, giving up a leadoff homer to Lenny Dykstra, walking four and hitting a 
batter. He gave up three runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillies starter Jeff Juden (1-2) went six innings, giving up five runs, three 
earned, on six hits.

 For a state hardened to football teams -- the New York Giants and the New York 
Jets -- that won't use its name and sports announcers telling viewers New 
Jersey events are in New York, it was one insult too many. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an outrage," George Zoffinger, chairman of the New York-New Jersey World 
Cup Host Committee, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unbelievable because when we first put this whole thing together 
three years ago, the understanding was clear that it was New York and New 
Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, all promotional materials for the World Cup games have described the 
location for the metropolitan-area events as "New York-New Jersey." Zoffinger 
said the state host committee accepted that designation because New York's name 
was needed for international marketing of the tournament, which begins June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The postal service said Wednesday that was the reason the map depicts game 
sites in several major cities when the stadiums are really in nearby suburbs: 
Boston, instead of Foxboro, Mass.; San Francisco and Los Angeles, for Palo Alto 
and Pasadena, Calif.; and Detroit, instead of Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 But several New Jersey politicians considered the decision a slight and fired 
off faxes to postal and World Cup officials asking them to correct the mistake 
before the souvenir sets go on sale May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those complaining about New Jersey's treatment were Gov. Christine 
Whitman, Sen. Frank Lautenberg and Rep. Robert Toricelli, whose district 
includes Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.19 sets include three stamps showing soccer players kicking, trapping 
and heading a ball -- a 29 cent domestic stamp and international stamps worth 
40 cents and 50 cents -- plus a sheet listing the 24 participating teams 
surrounding a U.S. map depicting the nine game sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal service spokesman Jim Van Loozen said the omission is regrettable but 
there isn't enough time to reprint all the souvenir sheets by May 26. He said 
60 million sets have been printed, plus another 300 million each of the 40 and 
50 cent stamps and 200 million 29 cent stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our design and we put the cities on the list," Van Loozen said, 
responding to a report that the World Cup staff was responsible for the 
omission. "The decision to use the major markets was ours." 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't stupid about the venues," Van Loozen said. "We knew where they 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted the World Cup staff saw the map's design in January and said 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 John Griffin, press officer for World Cup USA 1994 in New York, said the 
organization had been discussing the case with postal officials all day, but 
also believed it was too late to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as an organizing committee share with New Jersey its regret that the name 
of the Garden State was omitted from the postal service souvenir sheet," 
Griffin said.

GYMNASTICS / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; MILLER COMES BACK STRONG TO CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shannon Miller, defending world champion in the all-around, rebounded from a 
disappointing opening day during Wednesday's World Gymnastics championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 17, from Edmond, Okla., qualified second behind teammate Dominique 
Dawes in the beam event and third behind Romania's Lavinia Milosovici and Dawes 
in the floor exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 It as an improvement after Tuesday when she was fourth in qualifying for the 
vault and missed out on a place in the final of the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do as well (Tuesday) as I would have liked, so today I really wanted 
to hit my routines," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was more confident on the beam and in floor exercises than in the 
other two disciplines, despite never having won a medal on the beam at a world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I had a pulled stomach muscle (last month) I didn't get as many 
repetitions on the bars as I would have liked, plus I added a new trick," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Nunno, U.S. coach, said Miller has made spectacular progress since 
suffering the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shannon's getting better every day," he said. "By Friday, everyone will see 
her back in top form. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to come back slowly, but a metamorphosis has taken place over the last 
two weeks with Shannon's performances. She's looking good and feeling 
confident. She's progressing, not just maintaining her skill level." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller will be off today before defending her all-around title Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These past two days have just been a warm-up for the all-around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawes, meanwhile, loomed as a threat to Miller and Milosovici -- who has 
qualified for the finals of all four apparatus events -- in the all-around. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawes, 17, from Silver Spring, Md., scored 9.837 to lead the qualifiers for 
the beam ahead of Miller (9.825) and Milosovici (9.762). 
</P>
<P>
 Milosovici, a dual gold medalist in Barcelona, scored 9.837 in the floor 
exercise, and Dawes scored 9.825 and Miller 9.787.

TENNIS / OJAI TOURNAMENT; THIS DIVERSE EVENT IS A SHOWCASE FOR THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year was 1938 and the sound of playing cards slapping on a table mixed 
with occasional laughter wafted from a dimly lit hotel room in the small town 
of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 At one corner of the table sat 16-year-old Jack Kramer, deeply engrossed in a 
late-night game of poker with some friends. 
</P>
<P>
 They had gathered to while away the evening after competing in the Ojai Valley 
tennis tournament during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew then what an impressive tennis career awaited Kramer. They knew, 
however, that he was winning a lot of their money and they kept him playing 
late into the night in an attempt to win it back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kramer didn't know the time of his next match had been changed from 10 
a.m. to 8 a.m. and the joke was on him when he lost to Arthur Marx, son of 
Groucho Marx, in the semifinals of the boys' interscholastic division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to take anything away from Arthur Marx," Kramer said. "But I 
would have won that tournament if I hadn't played cards all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Things haven't changed much at the Ojai tournament, which begins today and 
continues through Sunday. Young players still are encouraged to socialize in a 
relaxed atmosphere -- citizens open their homes to board many of the more than 
1,600 players that converge on the town to compete in the tournament's 34 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament includes the Pacific 10 and Big West Conference championships, 
independent and community college divisions, as well as interscholastic, junior 
and open divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is probably the most unique event in the world for the diversification of 
people that are there," said Kramer, 72, who returned to Ojai last year to help 
dedicate the tournament to Arthur Ashe. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the 95-year-old tournament provides an early glimpse of future 
tennis stars. More than 25 Ojai champions have gone on to win Wimbledon, 
including Kramer, who won the 1937 and 1939 Ojai boys' interscholastic singles 
titles for Montebello High and the 1942 Ojai men's open singles and doubles 
titles before winning the 1946 and 1947 Wimbledon doubles and the 1947 
Wimbledon singles titles. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Geoff Abrams of Newport Harbor High is top-seeded in the boys' 
interscholastic singles division and Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks is 
top-seeded in the girls' 18-and-under singles division. Wayne Black of USC is 
top-seeded in the Pac-10 men's singles division and Laxmi Poruri of Stanford is 
top-seeded in the Pac-10 women's singles division. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 men's matches are played at Libbey Park, and the Pac-10 women are at 
the Ojai Valley Inn. Big West matches are at the Ojai Valley Racquet Club. 
Junior events are at Thacher School. Open matches are at lower Libbey Park 
courts as well as 30 private courts in Ojai. Semifinal and final matches are at 
Libbey Park on Saturday and Sunday.

RTC CLEARED IN HANDLING OF S&L FAILURES IN TEXAS; BANKING: BUT JUSTICE DEPT. 
SAYS STAFF CHANGES AND FREQUENT TRANSFERS OF CASES BETWEEN ATTORNEYS HAS 
DISRUPTED OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Treasury Department probe into S&L cleanups in Texas concluded that while 
there was no "wide-ranging failure" to pursue S&L officials, the government is 
unlikely to recover much money from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas accounted for more than 40% of the nation's thrift failures, and current 
and former Resolution Trust Corp. officials there have been harshly critical of 
the agency's ability to recoup taxpayer-backed losses, particularly from S&L 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Few S&L officials there have had their personal financial records subpoenaed, 
even though RTC figures show that 57% of suspected insider fraud cases were 
centered in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm 
of Congress, losses in Texas could cost taxpayers up to $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was prompted in part by testimony before the Senate Banking 
Committee last fall in which Thomas Burnside, a former RTC attorney in Dallas, 
said that the failure to file subpoenas against most S&L officials hurt the 
agency's ability to recover money from S&L insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not a wide-ranging failure to pursue professional liability claims 
in Texas," the Treasury Department's report concluded. "Dallas . . . attorneys 
and investigators generally believe that professional liability cases are 
adequately investigated, and not closed merely because the statute of 
limitations is about to expire." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report also noted that controversial staff changes and the 
frequent transfers of cases from one attorney to another "have been extremely 
disruptive to the operation of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also slammed "inadequate management of personnel in Dallas and 
inadequate oversight by the RTC in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 The major controversy, however, centered on the agency's failure to subpoena 
records from S&L officers and board members in cases where looting may have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnside and other critics have insisted that in order to adequately prepare a 
case -- and to find out if looting took place -- it was important to subpoena 
these people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press reported in January that in 99 of 122 cases investigated 
through early 1993, no subpoenas were issued against S&L insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Recoveries from insiders, to date, total about $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department report insists, however, that issuing subpoenas 
against insiders is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of civil cases investigated in America do not rely on 
pre-complaint administrative subpoenas because only a few government agencies 
and no private litigants have this authority," the report stated. "For the 
majority of RTC cases handled before 1992, administrative subpoenas were not 
used as an investigative tool to determine whether to file a lawsuit" against 
an S&L director or officer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the RTC expressly asked for -- and received -- the power to issue 
administrative subpoenas, making it one of "only a few government agencies" 
with this authority. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the RTC automatically gains access to the failed S&L's records, 
administrative subpoenas are needed to delve into the private financial matters 
of S&L officials who may have defrauded the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury report maintained that once a suit is filed, government attorneys 
can then pursue those individuals -- an approach Burnside equated with firing a 
gun while blindfolded.

BLUE CHIPS FALL AMID INTEREST RATE WORRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faltering cyclical stocks contributed to a selloff on Wall Street Wednesday 
amid worries that rising interest rates will curb economic growth and crimp 
future corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market managed to bounce off the bottom and finish above its 
worst levels thanks to an afternoon bond rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.11 points to 3,598.71, standing just 
above its lowest close of the year at 3,593.35, reached April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining shares outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 
3 on the New York Stock Exchange where trading was brisk. Big Board volume 
totaled 366.55 million shares, up from Tuesday's 323.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 All broad market measures lost ground. The NYSE composite index skidded 0.71 
to 244.66 and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index shed 0.58 to 441.96. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies dropped 7.33 to 705.52. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields fell for a second straight day, pushed lower mainly by 
technical trading known as short selling. In short-selling, traders borrow 
investments, then sell them immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 Yields were little changed for most of the day until buying picked up in the 
afternoon. At the close, the key 30-year Treasury bond's yield fell to 7.31% 
from 7.37% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant forces influencing stocks included quarterly corporate income 
news and interest rate-related concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Harrington, senior vice president and technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane, said movements in individual stocks appeared to have a 
bigger impact than normal on the overall market. 
</P>
<P>
 Program trading tied to the bond market caused stocks to veer in varying 
directions throughout the session and intensified the volatility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * American Telephone & Telegraph, which issued an upbeat quarterly report, 
rose 1 1/2 to 52 1/8, both in active turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakness in cyclical stocks came amid strength in non-durable consumer stocks, 
whose earnings are not as closely linked to the swings of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar dropped 4 7/8 to 103 1/2 despite reporting a sharp rise in 
first-quarter profits. Other capital goods stocks were also hammered, with 
Deere & Co. off 4 7/8 to 75 5/8 and Clark Equipment down 5 3/8 to 58. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks, another cyclical group, tumbled. Ford fell 2 to 54 3/8, 
Chrysler lost 2 1/4 to 46 1/4 and General Motors ended off 5/8 to 54 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Morton International, a maker of specialty chemicals and automobile air bag 
inflaters, dropped 10 1/8 to 82 3/4 despite strong quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elsewhere, Compaq Computer reported first-quarter earnings well above 
analysts' forecast, and the stock gained 3 1/8 to 101 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lotus Development lost 7 7/8 to 56 3/4. The software maker's quarterly 
results showed lower-than-expected revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks were mixed: 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks ended sharply lower with the Nikkei 225-share average was off 
310.16 points or 1.54% to 19,882.18. London's Financial Times 100-share average 
fell 29.7 points to 3,098.3. In Frankfurt, the DAX average ended at 2,182.64, 
up 10.22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar remained on a bearish track, falling against most major foreign 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, light sweet crude oil for delivery in May settled up 
33 cents at $16.82 per barrel on the New York Merc. It was the highest finish 
since before Thanksgiving. Gold and silver also posted gains.

TV REVIEW; 'SCARING' RAISES INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?," an ABC News special that examines our 
"fears" about pollution, crime, cancer and other topics, goes mano a mano with 
some favorite targets -- the media and big government to name just two -- and 
manages to land some decent blows. But there are enough lapses on the part of 
the program's writers and producers that all sides emerge bloodied. 
</P>
<P>
 Host John Stossel is credited as one of four writers, and since this is billed 
as "his first original prime-time special," three years in the making, we'll 
let him take the heat (though he does indict himself along with the rest of the 
media for distorting reality and serves up clips from his past as proof). 
</P>
<P>
 The show's best segment is a look at the crime rate and the feeding frenzy 
over gore that passes for the nightly news, plus the public's reaction to same. 
Surprise: The crime rate is essentially flat. No surprise: That isn't what most 
people think. Stossel rightly skewers the media for shoddy reporting and reams 
politicians for riding the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, moral issues take a back seat here and throughout "Scaring"; 
something's amiss with a society that has 24,000 murders a year, even if the 
numbers are flat in relation to population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The next segment looks at pollution and toxic waste. Stossel relies heavily on 
risk analysis here, asking what is justified in terms of cost and benefit, 
arguing that we waste billions on "unneeded" regulations and cleanup. This may 
be true, but Stossel has stacked the deck with experts making his case (and the 
moral equation again gets short shrift). 
</P>
<P>
 The segment is also weakened by a setup with Ralph Nader in which the consumer 
activist is made to look silly, giving one-sentence answers to a Stossel 
peppering him with "watch out for poultry" and "carpets are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nader circus sets the show's increasingly hysterical tone, the same tone 
that Stossel decried earlier as the media at their worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective is everything -- some things scare the bejabbers out of us yet are 
relatively harmless, others are ignored yet kill us with quiet efficiency -- 
and Stossel is clearly on to something. Our money could be spent better, with 
greater benefits for a greater number of people. But who will spend it and who 
will determine where it goes? Do we simply exchange one set of bureaucrats and 
experts for another set? "Scaring" raises some important questions but leaves 
too many others hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?" airs at 10 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 
3, 10 and 42). A follow - up discussion with officials and activists airs at 
11:30 p.m. on "Nightline."

WESTSIDE WATCH: SUNSET BILLBOARD BRINGS OUT THE ACTIVIST IN THERAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Writer, therapist and lecturer Laura Huxley never considered herself an 
activist. But when the 82-year-old widow of author Aldous Huxley saw an 
advertising sign for a jeans company on Sunset Boulevard, she decided to take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The coincidence of the sign's message, "A child is the ultimate pet," with the 
theme of her upcoming conference, "Children, Our Ultimate Investment," 
compelled her to gather a few friends and stage a protest last week. And the 
Joop Jeans sign, showing a baby with a leash around its neck, came down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working for children doesn't always bring as quick a result. It's usually 
about the future," she said. "Even if the sign didn't come down, it was right 
to show the outrage. The sign coming down is a real extra." 
</P>
<P>
 But for advertising executive Heiner Maasjost, it was business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our usual rotation. It was up for two weeks and now we have another 
sign up," he said from his New York office.  
</P>
<P>
 The new sign pictures a man and a woman, blindfolded, wearing fins on their 
feet, underwater. The message is, "In the uterus of life, we are all blind cave 
fish." 
</P>

 AUX ARMES, LES CITOYENS: A French flotilla is about to form off Santa Monica! 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's a joint U.S.-French operation, so there's nothing to get up in 
arms about. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's a dramatic way of saying "merci " for the Allied invasion of 
Normandy 50 years ago, including a symbolic re-enactment of the amphibious 
landings on D-Day -- June 6, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the French Navy frigate Prairial, based in Tahiti, and the Navy 
frigate Copeland to anchor offshore, together with a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, 
on June 1. On the beach, there will be a display of World War II armaments 
including a landing barge, a tank, Jeeps and trucks. There will be speeches, an 
outdoor showing of D-Day footage from the "Victory at Sea" television series, 
and patriotic music by a U.S. Navy band. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage warplanes will fly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the French consulate in Los Angeles, the event is scheduled to be 
part of a weeklong commemoration of the invasion that led to the liberation of 
France from German occupation and helped turn the tide of World War II.

 PEROTISTA CANDIDATE: A group of former Ross Perot supporters has found a 24th 
Congressional District candidate to back as an independent in the fall 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks chapter of United We Stand America has decided to throw its 
support behind Rhett Wooden, a Thousand Oaks film cameraman and grip, in a 
district represented by veteran Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
The group must collect at least 10,000 signatures this summer to get Wooden on 
the ballot for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I tell people most often is that they keep looking for hope from the 
Democratic and Republican parties," said Wooden, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they get hope from something that is the problem? So new leadership 
has to come from outside," said Wooden, who was active in Perot's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The district includes portions of Malibu.

CHILD-CARE CRUNCH; PROTEST: RALLY IN WESTWOOD WILL BE PART OF NATIONWIDE EFFORT 
TO CALL ATTENTION TO LOW WAGES PAID TO THOSE WHO SUPERVISE YOUNGSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When she was a college student in the late 1970s, Carol McGlaze of Santa 
Monica taught at a Brentwood child-care center but eventually quit because the 
pay was so low. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when she began looking for day care for her son, McGlaze felt 
relieved that she left the field when she did. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The pay was) only $8 per hour for a teaching job," McGlaze said. "I thought, 
'My God, people pay more to have their garbage picked up than they pay for the 
care and education of their children.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McGlaze is among a group of parents and day-care teachers planning to 
demonstrate at 4:30 p.m. today at the Federal Building in Westwood. Their 
protest is part of a nationwide "Worthy Wage Day" campaign being organized by 
child advocacy groups to draw attention to the low wages paid to child-care 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, a coalition of 300 child-care and advocacy groups including the 
Children's Defense Fund, the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children 
and the National Head Start Assn. has been demanding higher wages and health 
benefits for all child-care employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups have not specified how money should be raised to meet those goals, 
but they oppose increases in child-care fees, arguing that family child-care 
budgets are already stretched thin. They hope greater public awareness of the 
plight of child-care workers will prompt politicians to study such alternatives 
as a broad-based tax to raise money for child-care workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think that anyone can watch a little kid," said Gay McDonald, the 
head of child-care services at UCLA. To attract and retain skilled teachers, 
day-care centers must be able to offer their teachers more money, said 
McDonald, who is also director of the local chapter of the Southern California 
Assn. for the Education of Young Children, a child advocacy group composed of 
day-care center teachers and directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-care teachers who have a bachelor of arts degree or at least 12 units of 
early childhood education usually earn $8 to $9 an hour. For many, that isn't 
enough to live on. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Porter, a day-care teacher at the Assistance League School, a Santa 
Monica preschool run by the United Way, earns $8.50 per hour, and takes home 
about $1,060 a month. "I starve on the wages," said Porter, who says car 
insurance payments and rent for her Santa Monica apartment consume practically 
her entire paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many in her field, she took a second job -- in her case as a waitress. 
She recently lost that job, though, when the restaurant went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of low wages and a dearth of benefits, 27% of day-care teachers in Los 
Angeles County leave the profession each year, according to a 1991 study by the 
Southern California Assn. for the Education of Young Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Chatowski, director of Mt. Olive preschool in Santa Monica, says it is 
difficult to pay teachers more because child-care fees already appear high to 
many parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatowski's center typically has 90 children under care. An additional 60 
children come to day care part-time. Her staff consists of 24 teachers who work 
from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. or later. 
</P>
<P>
 With her monthly overhead of $39,000, Chatowski has to pay for supplies, 
morning and afternoon snacks for the children, the salaries of 24 teachers, 
rent for the center, which is adjacent to the Mt. Olive Lutheran Church, and 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a full medical plan was out of reach, she said, Mt. Olive is able to 
pay up to $500 annually for each employee's medical costs. Parents' fees are 
$120 per week for a full day and $80 per week for half a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Chatowski has seen the demand for quality child care soar. But 
if wages remain low, she said, the supply of qualified teachers will be scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those college students in child development courses can't find a job that 
pays enough money, they leave the field," Chatowski said. Ultimately, she said, 
many schools may resort to hiring less qualified teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Westside preschools, such as the Learning Center in Santa Monica, are 
part of a national chain and thus have the resources to offer benefits 
packages. The Learning Center provides teachers with medical and dental 
coverage, two weeks paid vacation, 50% reimbursement for job-related study, a 
retirement plan, and disability insurance. But in the child-care business, such 
compensation is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Learning Center and Cornerstone Childcare, which opened last year in Santa 
Monica, are operated by Bright Horizons, a Cambridge, Mass., corporation that 
runs about 70 day-care centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Child-care fees at the Learning Center range from $90 per week for children 
ages 2 to 5, to $170 for infants. At Cornerstone, parents pay $185 a week for 
infant care, and $135 for toddlers and preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Learning Center Director Karen Brown said she agonizes over the fact 
that she can only pay her teaching assistant and teachers from $6.50 to $10 per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most frustrating part is to see these talented teachers who love what 
they do leaving for no other reason than they can't afford to continue 
teaching," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department of Education has funded a study to determine whether the 
state can offer health benefits to child-care workers, but childrens advocates 
say such a program would be hard to sell politically unless public awareness of 
the child-care problem is improved. Meanwhile, many preschools are holding 
fund-raisers and seeking sponsorships from major corporations to help pay their 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that at least in the short term, times will continue to be tough 
for child-care workers. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlaze enrolled her son, now 2, in the Learning Center. A few months ago she 
left her bookkeeping job on a work-related injury, and her husband, a salesman 
for a clothing company, was recently laid off. She is considering a return to 
the day-care field because the Learning Center has offered her a discount on 
her fees if she works there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing some serious soul-searching to see if I could give up a little, 
monetarily for my son," said McGlaze, who would be earning less than half the 
$16 an hour she made as a bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping her child in a good day-care center, she said, may be worth the 
sacrifice. "Parents need to have a place to leave their children, where they 
can go to work and not question the care, the love, the nurturing, and all 
those things that kids need," she said. "Without that, we aren't going to be 
able to raise decent adults."

CITY LEAVES PARK DRUG PROBLEM TO POLICE CHIEF; CRIME: SANTA MONICA COUNCIL 
REJECTS PLAN TO CONTROL NARCOTICS DEALING IN PALISADES PARK BY ASSIGNING 
OFFICERS THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council has rejected Councilman Kelly Olsen's proposal 
to immediately assign police officers full time to Palisades Park to stop 
persistent drug dealing in the coastal bluff-top park. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council voted 5 to 2 to ask Police Chief James T. Butts to devise 
his own deployment plan for keeping peace in the park while taking into account 
public safety needs in other parts of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can sit here and run down a list of other pockets of the city I've received 
complaints on," Councilman Tony Vazquez said. "We have to look at it (from) a 
holistic point of view and not in a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing Olsen's idea, Vazquez got into a heated exchange with Olsen's lone 
supporter, Councilman Ken Genser, who suggested that his colleagues were 
underestimating problems in Palisades Park -- problems, he said, that they 
would see firsthand if they would go to the park at 2 a.m., as he has done. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might want to go to Cloverfield, right next to the freeway," Vazquez 
responded, another area where drug dealing takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Asha Greenberg objected to Olsen's plan because it impinged on 
the chief's prerogative to deploy his forces as he sees fit. Butts, she said, 
is far better-equipped to make that decision than politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an outstanding police chief, and we have tied his hands in many 
ways," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen responded that he was "dumbfounded" that his colleagues would not 
immediately assign patrol officers to the park, which he called "the jewel of 
the city," and pay them overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the park is due to reopen in early summer after a $1.5-million 
renovation, an ideal time to get a handle on problems that he said also include 
antisocial activities by a large homeless contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, 1,000 drug arrests have been made in the park during 
sting operations. But the dealers return after the undercover operations -- 
financed by overtime pay -- are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen said that if the council didn't act favorably on his proposal "our 
credibility . . . goes straight out the window. . . . Taking control of the 
park again is the responsibility of this council." 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, police union President Steve Brackett said he was 
disappointed. He said Olsen's proposal would have forced the council to come to 
grips with what it takes to provide for increased public safety -- a 
willingness to spend more money on policing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the council's discussion of the issue, a suspected Palisades Park drug 
dealer led police on a high-speed freeway chase. Brackett said Raoul (Cuba) 
Perez, 25, was arrested after he rammed into a car. The police sirens could be 
heard in the Council Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a known dealer of drugs in the park," Brackett said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sunday, Rosa Parks will discuss her book "Rosa Parks: My Story" at a 
charity event in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks became known as the "mother of the civil rights movement" for her 
refusal in 1955 to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Ala. 
Her arrest and conviction for violating segregation laws led to a bus boycott 
in Montgomery that galvanized the civil rights movement nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks is scheduled to speak during a brunch at 11 a.m. at the Hotel Nikko. 
Tickets are $100 and include a copy of Parks' autobiography. Reservations are 
required. Proceeds will benefit the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for 
Self-Development and the Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital Foundation, 
both in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks founded the institute nearly eight years ago to provide youth services 
in the Los Angeles area.

MEDIA; A LITTLE BIT OF BLIMEY FROM HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
 The crowd at Ye Olde King's Head devours British Weekly. If ever they need a 
partner for snooker, or maybe a bargain fare to Manchester, they know where to 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody reads it," says bartender Hilary Kenny, leaning over the rail at 
the Santa Monica pub as customers look up from their ale. "It disappears as 
soon as we get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny nods at a diminishing stack of the Venice-based tabloid as if to prove 
her point. The sun may have finally set on the British empire, but that's OK. 
Hundreds of thousands of Her Majesty's former subjects would rather watch the 
sun set on the Pacific Ocean, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 British Weekly is their community newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years the free tabloid has provided a slice of the old country for 
expatriates who have no taste for American media sensationalism. Instead, they 
prefer a dose of British media sensationalism, packaged in 16 pages with ads 
for immigration lawyers and bone-china shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper caters to the estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million British expatriates 
living in Southern California, many of them in Santa Monica and Venice. 
Determining a precise number of residents is impossible, British Vice Consul 
Angus Mackay said, because many British nationals do not report their comings 
and goings to immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Beach Boys, palm trees, fast cars -- and the weather. That's what draws 
most Brits here," said Neil Fletcher, 31, editor and publisher of British 
Weekly and a Windsor native who immigrated to the United States a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd like to see the paper do," Fletcher said, "is enable people to hold 
on to Englishness as part of their cultural identity. There's a tendency to 
lose Englishness really fast in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much chance of that happening to regular readers. British Weekly covers 
political and other big news from back home, most of it recycled from the 
London dailies. Southern California news of interest to Brits is also 
mentioned. There is travel and legal advice, plus a biweekly column poking fun 
at American manners -- or the lack of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher prints 35,000 copies every week, but estimates a total readership of 
75,000 because copies of the paper are often passed around. 
</P>
<P>
 He started writing for the paper when it was established in 1984 and took over 
as owner four years ago. He edits and produces British Weekly on a personal 
computer in his Venice apartment and sends it out to be printed by another 
community newspaper. It is distributed at 200 Southland locations, mostly pubs 
and British-themed gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
 News and editorials are unsigned, but columns by free-lancers -- some of whom 
are also advertisers -- get prominent play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooting From the Lip," by Alan Darby Drake, the pseudonym of Westwood writer 
Alan Shadrake, is filled with the anti-Yankee musings of a fictional, 
champagne-tippling English crank. Every column ends with the tag line, "Pop 
another cork, Rosie!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said the column generates 90% of the paper's hate mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's slightly zany," Shadrake said of the column. "It's tongue-in-cheek, but 
at the same time enables me to exorcise my irritation" at American customs. One 
recent column took aim at Americans who have urged a pardon for a U.S. 
teen-ager sentenced by Singapore to be flogged for vandalizing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us give (the youth) an American welcome, a ticker-tape parade down Santa 
Monica Boulevard, a medal, film and book rights, talk shows, and 50 cans of 
free paint," the columnist facetiously suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper's editorials are not as controversial, although Fletcher does not 
shy from taking sides. He said he admires former Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher as much as he loathes her successor, John Major. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Fletcher asked, "Where else can you go to find out where to buy a pint of 
Guinness in L.A.?"

COMMUNITY NEWS: MAR VISTA: STRAY BULLET KILLS BOY IN SOUTH-CENTRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As 12-year-old Ernesto Escobedo strolled with his family toward a bus stop in 
South-Central Los Angeles, a stray bullet struck him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mar Vista boy died Monday afternoon, almost a day after he was shot near 
54th Street and Budlong Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just isn't fair, he was barely starting his life -- he never once started 
a fight or anything," said Imelda Escobedo, Ernesto's 16-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Imelda says her family remains in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother just can't believe he's gone," she said. "We love him very much and 
we're going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto had just finished visiting his stepfather, who was walking with him 
and a younger brother and sister to catch a bus to the children's home in Mar 
Vista Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stepfather heard something, turned around and thought his son was having 
a seizure," said Lt. Sergio Robleto of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
Ernesto was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto lived with his mother, brother and two sisters in a rough neighborhood 
where, Imelda said, the temptations for truancy remain high. Nevertheless, 
Ernesto rarely missed class at Marina del Rey Middle School and was imbued with 
a drive and sweetness, family and friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved school and always had good grades and an excellent attendance 
record," Imelda said. "He was quiet, but funny and liked to collect baseball 
and football cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Adela Oceta, a longtime friend of Ernesto's mother, said he wanted to be an 
architect and eventually build or buy a house for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Robleto said that although many people were standing near the corner where 
Ernesto was shot, none said they heard gunfire. Seeking witnesses to someone 
shooting the gun is like "looking for a needle in a haystack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police asked anyone with information to call the LAPD South Bureau at (213) 
237-1310.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW: FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME IN BLACKS TARGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The colorful, carefully detailed ad is hardly the sort associated with babies: 
a fetus curled up in an umbilical cord, suckling a grotesquely oversized bottle 
of malt liquor for nourishment, a tear squeezing out of one closed eye. "Her 
Birth Defects Came in 40 oz.," reads the ominous slogan across the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo assaults viewers rather than giving them the warm fuzzies, and that 
is exactly the effect Zola Jones is after. "We have a serious problem with 
alcohol, and it needs to be addressed seriously," said Jones, project director 
of Great Beginnings for Black Babies, a Crenshaw-based organization that 
provides prenatal care and information services. "It's not negative, it's 
provocative." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Jones and other Great Beginnings staffers announced the launching 
of their latest media campaign, this time aimed at reducing Fetal Alcohol 
Syndrome among the black population. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-hitting ads -- more than 4,000 of them -- will go up next month all 
over Los Angeles County on billboards and buses, and in shopping malls and 
subway and rail stations. The warnings against drinking during pregnancy will 
also be disseminated in community lectures, forums, workshops, radio ads, 
health fairs and exhibits over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Great Beginnings generated some controversy with its last campaign, 
a graphic depiction of the effects of a mother's drug use on a newborn, and the 
new one is also controversial. At the unveiling, some health educators objected 
to the ad's implication that all African Americans swill the cheap, potent malt 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the fact is that Olde English, Colt 45, these companies target blacks in 
their marketing," Jones said. "We have to target just as hard. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jones had her way, the word would be spread even further. A retired nurse 
for the county health department, Jones and a core staff of about six have 
worked tirelessly since 1990 to reduce the black infant mortality rate, which 
is high among blacks. (In 1991 in Los Angeles County, the infant mortality rate 
for blacks was 15 per 1,000 live births; for whites, 8.7; for Latinos, 6.7, and 
4.9 for Asians/Pacific Islanders.) ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: PACIFIC PALISADES / BRENTWOOD: FIRM TO UNVEIL PARKLAND 
PROPOSALS FOR CANYONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will have the opportunity to comment on plans for 210 acres of 
canyon land in Brentwood and Pacific Palisades, the last major undeveloped 
tracts in the area, at public hearings today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than six months of gathering community input, Community Development 
by Design, a park planning firm, will unveil 19 proposed uses for the land, 
including botanical gardens, equestrian areas and playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The land encompasses five sites: 140 acres in Temescal Canyon, 31 acres in Los 
Liones Canyon, 26 acres in Las Pulgas Canyon, 8 acres in Sullivan Canyon and 5 
1/2 acres in Marquez Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracts are either owned by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy or are 
targeted for ownership by the organization. In the case of Marquez Canyon, the 
conservancy is negotiating a lease between the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, which owns the property, and an equestrian group that uses the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm will gather responses to the proposals and present its 
recommendations to the conservancy. Community Development by Design declined to 
elaborate on the proposals. Marcia McNally, a partner in the Berkeley-based 
firm, would only say that many of the proposals originated from community 
groups and residents. Altogether, she said, more than 100 people, including 
residents, community activists and environmentalists, were interviewed during 
the public comment period.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, McNally said it would be difficult to predict the response to the 
proposals at the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meeting will be at 7:30 p.m. at the Presbyterian Conference Center, 
15601 Sunset Blvd., Pacific Palisades, and will address the Los Liones and 
Sullivan Canyon parcels. Saturday's meeting, scheduled for 9 a.m. at Gabrielson 
Hall in the Pacific Palisades Community United Methodist Church, 801 Via de la 
Paz, will deal with plans for Las Pulgas, Marquez and Temescal canyons. SCOTT

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD: EXCHANGE VISITORS EMBRACE CITYSCAPE 
</P>

<P>
 The Zimbabwe government official was impressed by Los Angeles' low-income 
housing. The Manila school superintendent marveled at the city's ethnic 
diversity. And the local government commissioner from Bangladesh had trouble 
relating to all the advanced technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Such were some of the impressions visiting fellows expressed last week after 
touring Los Angeles as part of an "Urban Enhancement" workshop sponsored by 
UCLA Extension Public Policy Program. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, UCLA was among four universities in the United States selected to 
sponsor an enhancement workshop by the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program, 
which operates under the U.S. Information Agency's Fulbright Exchange Activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty fellows from 37 developing nations took part in the program, in which 
UCLA faculty members and community agencies presented workshops on community 
organization, environmental policies and urban development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the exposure given to us in the ethnic communities and neighborhoods 
(of Los Angeles)," said Paraluman Rino Giron, assistant superintendent in the 
Manila City Schools Division in the Philippines and a Boston University 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 The fellows took field trips to Los Angeles landmarks and neighborhoods. Last 
Wednesday, for example, a group of 16 fellows interested in urban housing 
visited the Route 2 Cooperatives residential development in east Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Allan Heskin, head of the UCLA urban planning program and a co-op 
resident, met with the group and spoke on creating and maintaining affordable 
housing. Some participants said they hoped such projects could be duplicated in 
their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many things happening in Los Angeles," said Tinoidziwa Zinyandu, 
deputy secretary for the ministry of public construction, management and 
national housing in Zimbabwe. "What impressed me is how low-income people house 
themselves." He said he would seek to develop similar projects in his country. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fellows said some presentations seemed impractical for their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect to find all the solutions," said Naila Suraiya, assistant 
commissioner for the Dhaka Collectorate in Bangladesh. "Sometimes I feel 
alienated because the issues are too high-tech." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program was started more than 15 years ago 
to bring professionals to the United States and enable them to learn the latest 
skills in their fields, including communications, public policy analysis, urban 
planning and finance. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW: ROBINSONS-MAY GETTING REPAIRS AND NEW STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Robinsons-May in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza will celebrate its 46th 
anniversary in June with a splashier event than store officials had in mind, 
but one they say is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The store was forced to close its doors because of extensive damage from the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake.Recently, a Robinsons-May official announced 
plans to reopen June 6, not only with structural improvements but new 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the opportunity to paint the whole store, put in new flooring and 
replace all of our merchandise," said Robinsons-May spokesman Jim Watterson. 
"It was time to improve the store anyway. This is something the community has 
wanted for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Watterson said heavy water damage and extensive structural cracks forced the 
store to remain closed longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The store had been a May Co. outlet until last year, when Robinson's and May 
Co. merged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take everything out of the store anyway, so this was a perfect time 
to do what we had intended to do for a while," Watterson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two community-based operations that had operated out of the store -- the 
Museum of African American Art and the OASIS senior center -- will also reopen 
June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, OASIS classes were held throughout the Crenshaw area, 
including at Christ the Good Shepherd Church, Crossroads Arts Academy and the 
Delta Sigma Theta Life Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 For merchants with businesses on the mall's upper level next to the 
Robinsons-May entrance, the reopening won't come too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the closure, they said, foot traffic has declined, and sales, which had 
been sluggish anyway, have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Bruning, vice president of mall developer and owner Alexander-Haagen Co., 
said new tenants coming aboard will nearly fill the mall by December. Occupancy 
now stands at 68%. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: BRENTWOOD: ZONING ACTION DELAYED ON RADISSON HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with what they say are noise and parking problems from banquets and 
conventions at the Radisson Bel-Air Hotel, Brentwood homeowners last week 
thought they had finally received some relief when the Los Angeles zoning board 
placed restrictions on the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the joy was short-lived.Just hours after the board took action, it 
rescinded the limitations after the hotel's lawyer arrived late for the hearing 
and asked the board to reconsider its decision until another hearing could be 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The board complied. The neighbors are angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents were suspicious of the postponement because the hotel's 
counsel, Benjamin M. Reznick, has close ties to Mayor Richard Riordan, who 
appointed the five members of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Reznick campaigned 
for Riordan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the most bizarre experiences I've ever had," said Lawrence 
Cardoza, vice president of the Brentwood Homeowner's Assn. "I doubt the same 
privilege would have been given to city officials if they had been late." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Weil, chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals, said he believed 
Reznick deserved some consideration.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than just entering a default -- it's not like he's done this 30 
times before. He made a mistake," Weil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friction between the hotel's owner, Efrem Harkham, and his neighbors began 
after the businessman bought the 161-room Radisson in 1983 and expanded it in 
1986 to accommodate business meetings, conventions and banquets. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complained that streets were jammed with vehicles during large 
functions at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkham's recent proposals have been rejected by city zoning officials. But 
the hotelier has asked the Board of Zoning Appeals to overrule officials. The 
board has scheduled a hearing on the matter for May 24. ADRIAN MAHER

MIXED SIGNALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a Wednesday afternoon in Hollywood, and Victoria Looseleaf is taping 
another segment of what she calls one of television's "best-kept secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 The guest is local chef Mark Peel, who has published a cookbook and brought 
some samples to the studio at Continental Cablevision. Looseleaf conducts the 
interview between mouthfuls of grilled asparagus. "Do you really feed your kids 
these wonderful meals?" she asks. "How would you describe your culinary 
philosophy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Peel is, of course, plugging his book and restaurant. And the host, a Westside 
harp teacher, is plugging "The Looseleaf Report," a half-hour interview show 
she hopes will someday find a more lucrative home away from cable's 
public-access channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a stigma of being on public access, but I've risen above that," 
Looseleaf says after the taping. "I'd like to get paid for my efforts. I have 
to get an agent and a producer. But (public access) is a great training 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after its debut, commercialism is creeping into 
public-access television. Many viewers have scorned the medium as an inert, 
amateurish forum for cranks and fringe groups that can't get exposure anywhere 
else. Yet that hasn't stopped Looseleaf and legions of other would-be David 
Lettermans from hoping for crossover success on mainstream television. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that public-access is supposed to be non-commercial, even though 
experts agree that such rules are made to be broken, or at least bent. Many 
series are intended as audition tapes for network or syndication deals. Some 
clever entrepreneurs have even used public access to run barely disguised 
infomercials for hairstyling, chiropractic and dentistry services. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: The Los Angeles Chiropractic Society, a trade association, uses 
public-access facilities throughout the metropolitan area to produce a series 
-- "Chiropractic Today and Beyond" -- featuring member doctors and shows on 
such topics as "Whiplash" and "Manipulation Under Anesthesia." At the end of 
each show, viewers are advised to call an 800 number to get more information. 
Callers are referred to a practitioner in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has succeeded in building more awareness of chiropractors, says 
Tony Winders of Murphy O'Brien Communications, a Beverly Hills-based 
public-relations firm that developed the 13-part series. Winders acknowledges 
that public-access rules forbid marketing and advertising, but says "the 
studios all know" about the series' goals and haven't complained. 
</P>
<P>
 For such users, the chief advantage to public access is that it costs nothing. 
In most cases, even the training and materials are free. The tab is picked up 
by cable company operators, who collect their revenue from -- you guessed it -- 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Public-access channels are governed by franchise agreements between the cable 
companies and each city or town. Most communities require users and producers 
to get training, but otherwise they take a hands-off approach to production and 
distribution of videotapes. The lack of oversight has made it easier for users 
to edge closer to commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
 In most communities, as long as a program is not explicitly obscene or 
commercial, public-access administrators must air it unedited. Censoring a 
program, administrators say, would violate cable franchise agreements and the 
First Amendment, though some programmers admit they practice a form of 
censorship by putting undesirable shows on very late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, public access has broadcast nude talk shows and sex videos. And 
in Southern California, users have stopped just short of violating bans on 
advertising and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "On all the access channels, people have found ways to use it for their own 
personal agendas," says Paul Steinbaum, executive director of Beverly Hills 
Community Access TV. "That's fine as long as they try to follow the guidelines 
of public access. They can't be commercial and they can't try to sell a product 
overtly. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are always people pushing the envelope. It's become a way of 
getting advertising without buying advertising . . . or a place for people to 
create audition tapes (for free). I don't think it's what public access is 
supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, public access is not the ideal get-famous-quick scheme. Looseleaf 
has interviewed hipsters such as alternative-music performer Henry Rollins, 
writer Kathy Acker and director Percy Adlon. Yet, after seven years on the air, 
her show has never been picked up for syndication or commercial broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Westside author Art Fein, who for 10 years has hosted a roots-music show at 
Continental's Hollywood facility, also has been unable to make the leap to 
another broadcasting level. Fein has published a book about the Los Angeles 
rock music scene and interviewed scores of musicians, but so far he's taken the 
show no further than public access. Its ideal home, he says, would be on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art Fein's Poker Party" typically features Fein shooting the breeze with 
guests such as country singer Dwight Yoakam and ex-Stray Cat Brian Setzer. As 
on most public-access shows, lighting, direction and editing are done on the 
fly, with the final result coming closer to "America's Funniest Home Videos" 
than "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "All the shows you see (on public access) are auditions," Fein says. "Not 
pilots, because pilots have a lot of money and time behind them. (Public 
access) is an outline, a kernel of an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Skip E. Lowe is a retired stand-up comic who spends 30 to 40 hours a week 
working on a Beverly Hills interview show with aging stars such as Stella 
Stevens, Virginia O'Brien and Milton Berle. He says he books guests by 
attending Hollywood parties and chatting up celebrities who happen to have seen 
his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a one-man operation," Lowe says. "I've had many people try to syndicate 
the show, but they wanted me to sign everything over to them, and I could never 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe's devotion to his current format may be a rarity among others who appear 
on public-access TV. Looseleaf, Fein and others hope their tapes will somehow 
be seen by a channel-surfing media executive on his way to work. Public-access 
users typically "bicycle," or import, their tapes to a number of outlets for 
the largest possible audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cole, director of the UCLA Center for Communication Policy, says that the 
proximity of major entertainment companies in Southern California has led many 
users to exploit public access as an audition tool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most experts say the chances of a public-access show catching on are 
extraordinarily slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pipe dream," says Luis Remesar, access coordinator at Continental 
Cablevision, which produces about 31 new shows per week. Remesar estimates that 
90% of the programs produced at his facility are meant to cross over to network 
or syndicated TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "The broadcast industry doesn't look at public access as serious TV," Remesar 
says. "Some people might look at it as the vanguard of TV, but I've never seen 
a show make it, other than 'Mr. Pete.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Pete," hosted by Pete Chaconas, was a Letterman-style talk show on L.A. 
public access that was briefly picked up for syndication several years ago. The 
show did not do well and was soon dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Public access was never conceived as a vehicle for would-be screen tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the late 1960s and early '70s, nascent cable companies were eager to 
negotiate franchise agreements with sometimes reluctant cities and towns. To 
sweeten the pot, the companies agreed to devote one or more channels to public, 
educational or government (PEG) access, with no cost to the user. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that cable companies would compensate the city for the use of 
the taxpayers' (electronic) right of way," says Susan Herman, general manager 
of the Los Angeles Department of Telecommunications. "The companies would 
provide public-benefit services, like free drops (i.e., hookups) for schools, 
hospitals and so on. They would also provide access for governments and the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This access has made it possible for virtually anyone to get on the air -- 
including "Wayne's World" wanna-bes. Two recent UCLA graduates, Brian Ormsby 
and Brad Dodge, have spent the past year producing an hourly talk show called 
"Too Much Free Time." They tape the program near their South Bay home and 
bicycle it to cable systems on the Westside -- including Century Cable in Santa 
Monica -- and to the San Fernando Valley. They estimate they have a potential 
audience of 670,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 Ormsby says that "Too Much Free Time" taps into the trend toward "real-life 
TV" pioneered by such shows as MTV's "Real World" and popularized by the movie 
"Wayne's World." Traditional taste is evidently shelved during taping. One show 
featured a chat with lesbian strippers. Another featured Ormsby saluting 
outgoing Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert by dropping his trousers and baring his 
backside for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to make it big and make a lot of money," says Ormsby, who is 
unemployed. Ormsby adds that he and Dodge, a waiter, are seeking sponsors for 
their program: "We're trying to syndicate it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the odds don't favor such a ploy, Herman, the city cable spokeswoman, 
notes that the 14 franchises overseen by her department cover most of Los 
Angeles County and reach 520,000 households. She says the public-access 
facilities involved churn out a systemwide average of 720 half-hour segments 
every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmers argue that public access will become even more important as cable 
companies offer hundreds of channels and desperately seek all kinds of 
programming, whether amateur or professional. If there really are 500 channels, 
the reasoning goes, quite a few of them might be devoted to Looseleaf, Fein, 
Lowe and others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which is good for amateur talk-show hosts. But is it good for public-access 
TV? 
</P>
<P>
 "Public access was originally designed for smaller communities that didn't 
have access to the major news media," says Continental's Remesar. "But now, in 
the smaller communities, no one is doing public access. And in the larger 
communities, everyone's doing it. In my opinion, it's backwards from what it's 
supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Cole is even more blunt in his conclusion. "Public access is an 
extraordinary resource that hasn't been used very effectively," he says. "That 
doesn't argue against it. It's there to be used, stupidly or effectively."

 An extraordinary tribute to film is now playing. Not in your local theater, 
but at a gallery near you. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has 
brought together film costumes of yesterday and today, in recognition of the 
40th anniversary of the Costume Designers Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, "Building Character: Costume Design for the Cinema," presents a 
colorful account of more than six decades of Hollywood. Opening Friday in the 
academy's fourth-floor gallery, the show features works by nearly 100 designers 
and includes more than 150 pieces such as jewelry, costumes, hats, shoes, 
design sketches and set photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These treasures are being lost and stolen," said Eloise Jenssen, an Academy 
Award-winning designer and co-chairwoman of the exhibit. "We tried to show 
everyone living and dead who's important in the motion picture business." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibition curator Ellen Harrington said the show is a rare exhibition 
combining film costumes and related accessories such as the gold and silver 
cigar case carried by Clark Gable in "Gone With the Wind" and jewelry worn by 
Rita Hayworth in "Salome." 
</P>
<P>
 To arrange such an elaborate exhibit, Harrington, Jenssen and co-chair Mina 
Mittleman have spent almost a year acquiring items and planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces came from a variety of sources, including the academy's Margaret 
Herrick Library, the Costume Designers Guild and many designers and sketch 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is organized by styles -- from Victorian England to 
futuristic-wear to the Wild West and more -- rather than chronologically. The 
costumes include Valentino's "suit of light" from "Blood and Sand," Vanessa 
Redgrave's crown and coronation gown from "Camelot," and the white suit worn by 
Gary Oldman in "Bram Stroker's Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more interesting that we can take a sketch from the 1930s or 1940s 
and place it near a similar costume made today," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood hasn't always been as careful as it should have in keeping its 
history," said Harrington. "No one thought there was a huge value for these 
things. What we are trying to do is to preserve this artwork." 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is at 8949 Wilshire Blvd., 
Beverly Hills. Gallery hours are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday,

BOARDWALK: THE DEBATE CONTINUES OVER REFURBISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Ryavec, the executive director of the Venice Boardwalk Assn., seems to be 
impervious to the truth. On a standing vote, which he himself called for at the 
meeting sponsored by the Recreation and Parks Department to solicit community 
sentiment, his plan for refurbishing the Venice Boardwalk was resoundingly 
rejected. His statement to the press the following day was that there was "no 
serious opposition to the project." He now uses your Westside section letters 
column to blandly throw out the red herring that his opponents "are largely 
outsiders who do not have the community's interests at heart." The name for 
people who fine-tune the truth like this is, I believe, spin doctor. Mr. Ryavec 
will not be able to anesthetize us.

<P>
 Much ink and breath has already been spent in regard to the proposed Venice 
Ocean Front Walk Refurbishment Plan. Many believe that all of these meetings, 
letters and your several articles are part of an exercise to "blow the ink dry" 
on this proposal that has long been the favorite of L.A. city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the conditions in Venice's Oakwood district, it seems unthinkable 
that any plan proposing $650 trash "receptacles" to replace existing "cans" so 
infrequently emptied, $1,000 benches to replace unrepaired ones stacked within 
the walls of our derelict ocean-front oil site, and $150,000 restrooms to 
replace those now standing seat-less and overflowing, could find approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue here is not the aesthetics of the proposal, but rather its source of 
funding in present-day Los Angeles. The drawings, diagrams and sketches would 
be far more appealing if even matching funds were offered by the merchants who 
pay -- and property owners who collect -- in the area of $1,000 a yard per 
month for frontage. If the proposal is approved, (public) monies will go 
largely to the commercial redevelopment of the Venice oceanfront. Only token 
consideration is given to repair of the Venice Pier and much needed restroom 
facilities -- both of which also serve commercial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Assertions that this plan concerns itself with preservation and the historical 
continuity of the community are little more than a ploy. This concourse never 
was brick-surfaced; the proposed substitutes for "pedestrian scale" street 
lighting, removed because they were inadequate, will require major repair or 
replacement of existing security lighting. This proposal, when read in its 
entirety, not only proposes major redesign, but additionally relocation of the 
beachfront pagodas. Following this line of "historic" devotion one might 
anticipate replacement of the Pavilion facilities with a "turn-of-the-century" 
six-story pink concrete parking structure with gas lights and pull-chain 
toilets for "authenticity." 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously, the plan proposes demolition of The Venice Pavilion. The 
structure's only stay is the fact that all of the available money, and then 
some, is devoted to the preceding extravagances. Ironically, one reason given 
for its demolition is lack of parking for the 800-seat theater. Where do the 
150,000 daily summer visitors park? For nearly two years Venice Arts Mecca has 
been negotiating with the city to reopen this facility with corporate donations 
and at their own succeed-or-fail risk. The cost is comparable to the cost of 
returning the site to sand. 
</P>
<P>
 We will soon know where the city Park and Recreation Department's sympathies 
lie -- with the commercialists and their "Ocean Front Mall," or with the 
community. Surely some more reasonable (and prudent) Venice plan must arise.

 At its annual convention in Toronto next month, the International Reading 
Assn. will present an award to Will Rogers Elementary School. Unfortunately, 
there may be no one from the school in Toronto to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district said it's impossible to send us," said principal Juli Di Chiro, 
laughing at the irony. Di Chiro and teacher Maureen Bradford, who helped 
implement the reading program being lauded, each need about $1,000 for the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The school received an award from the Delaware-based association for excelling 
in teaching reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Rogers Elementary was chosen as the school with the best reading program 
in California. Di Chiro said the school's "whole language" program is the 
reason that students do so well.  
</P>
<P>
 In the program, students read a story, write about it, discuss it, and 
practice listening skills by talking with teachers and each other.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to scrape the money together to go," Di Chiro said. CAROL

EDUCATION: GIVING CHILDREN AN EARLY START ON READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Helping children get a head start on academic subjects can significantly boost 
their school careers. 
</P>
<P>
 And reading is the skill probably most worthy of early polishing. 
</P>
<P>
 In most public schools, students start learning to read at age 5 or 6. But 
before then, there's a lot parents can do to help their child prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 First, set up a reading area at home. Include good lighting, chairs or floor 
pillows, and paper and crayons. Put your children's books on low shelves or in 
stacks on the floor so they can reach them any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition of letters is the first and most important skill to work on; most 
youngsters are ready for this about age 3. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many fun ways to practice naming letters. For example, the child can 
trace letters you have written, or use stencils. He or she can also shape them 
out of clay or cut them from white paper and color them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the child has made a whole alphabet, post it in the reading area and from 
time to time ask him or her to name the letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, have your child practice phonics -- the sounds that letters represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hooked on Phonics" and other packaged programs are popular but unnecessary, I 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
 It does just as well to point to letters and ask, for example, "What sound 
does B make?" and then, "Can you say a word that starts with B?" 
</P>
<P>
 After phonics, the child should be ready to learn sight vocabulary. That means 
learning to recognize entire words without having to sound them out first, 
increasing reading speed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Start by teaching the child to recognize his or her name, usually the first 
word a child learns to spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Labeling frequently used objects around the home will help too. Let your child 
help you make the labels. After some practice, remove the labels, jumble them, 
then ask the child to put them back on the right things. It may take a few 
tries, but don't let them get discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of rhyming words is one that is quickly learned by most youngsters 
because it's what makes their favorite nursery rhymes and songs so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Make a game of it by saying a word, then asking the child to name another word 
that rhymes. If his or her name is easy to rhyme, start there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequencing of words is a crucial skill because words have to be in some kind 
of order to form sentences, and sentences must be properly sequenced in order 
to form paragraphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the child to retell a favorite story in his or her own words. Teach him or 
her to follow directions by completing a step-by-step exercise or puzzle, or 
assembling a toy. Comprehension of printed material that is heard, not just 
read, is important too. 
</P>
<P>
 Play records or tapes of the child's favorite stories, songs or nursery 
rhymes, then ask basic questions about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating one's own written work is a fantastic final step because it makes the 
child incorporate all of the previous ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The child can do this even if he or she can't write yet. Have the child 
dictate a letter to a favorite relative or friend, or an original story that 
you then staple together as a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the child has tangible proof of his or her learning.

 BASKETBALL AWARDS 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard High forward Olympia Scott received the Cheryl Miller Award as The 
Times' Girls' Basketball Player of the Year during an awards breakfast Sunday 
at the Guest Quarters Suite Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard girls' Coach Lori Pawinski and Pacific Hills boys' Coach John 
Bobich were honored as the Westside coaches of the year. It was the third time 
in four years Pawinski has won the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester guard Danny Walker became the first sophomore to be named Westside 
Boys' Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount Coach John Olive was the keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who will attend Stanford University in the fall, also received a plaque 
for being selected to the Westside girls' first team for the third consecutive 
season and a trophy for being chosen the Westside Girls' Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-year starter, Scott averaged 18.8 points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker became the third underclassman to be honored as the player of the year. 
The previous two recipients won as juniors: Beverly Hills center Luke Buffum in 
1993 and Crossroads center Austin Croshere in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offensively, Danny was as good of a player as anywhere in the Southland," 
Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said. "He could shoot from any distance. He handles 
the ball like a point guard. He has great vision and sees the court well. And 
he's unselfish." 
</P>
<P>
 For the second season in a row, a coach from the Delphic League was honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobich guided Pacific Hills to a 24-9 record, its second consecutive Southern 
Section Division V title and a berth in the State Division V championship game 
where the Bruins lost to Ripon Christian, 60-46. Last season, Crossroads' Daryl 
Roper took top coaching honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawinski led St. Bernard to a 29-4 record and its second consecutive State 
Division IV championship. The Vikings beat Bear River of Grass Valley, 53-43, 
to win the title. RIVALRIES 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two seasons, the Western League baseball title has come down to a 
two-game series between Westchester and University. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams may decide the title again when they meet Monday at University and 
Wednesday at Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Warriors (12-5-1) have played consistently throughout the season, 
the Comets started slowly. On Monday, the Comets (8-8) beat Manual Arts, 3-0, 
to win their sixth consecutive game and eighth in their last nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to play much better defensively," Westchester Coach Ron 
Kasparian said. "We're getting timely hitting and the pitching is starting to 
come around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets' top hitter is catcher Rod Washington, who is batting .435. Center 
fielder Seka Edwards (.407) is proving to be as good of a baseball player as he 
was a quarterback. Westchester is also getting timely hitting from middle 
infielders Henry Jones (.365) and Ramel Greenfield (.352). 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets' top pitchers are senior right-handers Jelani Ferguson (4-3) and 
Mike Escamilla (3-2). POWER SURGE 
</P>
<P>
 In its last five games, Brentwood has scored 71 runs on 70 hits. The Eagles 
improved their record to 7-4 and 2-0 in the Delphic League after victories over 
Whitney, 12-7, and Pacific Hills, 17-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Marz leads the team with a .750 batting average (18 for 25) and junior 
Jake Willens, a two-time Delphic League batting champion, has a .570 average. 
</P>
<P>
 However, David Corletto was last week's hero, hitting two solo home runs in 
the same inning -- the sixth -- against Pacific Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Eagles will play Crossroads at 4 p.m. at Cloverfield Park in a 
battle of potentially undefeated Delphic League teams. Both teams were 2-0 in 
league play entering this week's games. SWEEPING STATEMENT 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica softball team won five consecutive games, including three 
wins over Bay League rival Inglewood last week. Pitcher Heather Marshak and 
Fabiola Gonzalez each pitched a no-hitter as the Vikings swept Inglewood, 25-0 
and 18-0, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Gonzalez had a single, triple, a home run and four runs 
batted in. In the second game, second baseman Nicole Garlind had four hits, 
three RBI and scored two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings also beat Inglewood, 8-0, as Marshak earned her eighth win by 
pitching a one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshak (10-2) was also the winning pitcher against St. Bernard, 6-1, and 
North Torrance, 9-3, on Saturday in the El Segundo tournament. Marshak had 29 
strikeouts in her four victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a three-way tie for first place between Venice, Palisades and 
Westchester in the Western League softball race entering this week's games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Hankey had a grand slam and a two-run home run to highlight Venice's 
11-8 victory over Palisades Tuesday. But Westchester beat the Gondoliers, 7-3, 
and Palisades beat Hamilton, 3-2, last Thursday to create the tie. VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance Volleyball Club is staging tryouts for boys in grades 7-12 for 
the United States Volleyball Assn. season, which begins Sunday and April 24 at 
the North Torrance High boys' gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The registration fee is $5. Information: Tim Ittner (310) 429-0905. SEAN

REGIONAL REPORT: LITTLE TOKYO; FATAL CARJACKING RENEWS EFFORT FOR POLICE 
OUTPOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the slayings of two Japanese college students in San Pedro 
during a carjacking, Little Tokyo community leaders are stepping up their 
efforts to open a ko-ban, or police outpost, on 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two years, community leaders have sought to open a police outpost 
in Little Tokyo that would provide assistance to crime victims in Japanese and 
English. But the project became entangled in red tape at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 With the March 25 killings of the two Japanese students and the resulting 
concern about crime among visitors, Little Tokyo community leaders want Mayor 
Richard Riordan and other city leaders to make the ko-ban a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders have also added tourist information -- such as public 
transit schedules and sightseeing tips -- to the list of services they hope to 
offer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very fitting right now. We can provide tourists assistance at the 
ko-ban, " said Brian Kito, a Little Tokyo merchant and member of the Greater 
Little Tokyo Anti-Crime Assn., a community group spearheading the project. "The 
city should jump on board." 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders envision an outpost-information center staffed by bilingual 
volunteers. Police officers would stop to take reports and provide information 
and assistance, similar to an arrangement used in Chinatown for the last nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Such small police booths are found on many street corners in Japan, providing 
victims with a convenient and non-threatening place to report crimes. Little 
Tokyo community leaders hope a similar setup will encourage crime victims, 
particularly tourists, to report even small incidents such as items stolen from 
cars. Many crimes go unreported, they said, primarily because of the language 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-crime association has gathered a corps of volunteers and has been 
seeking space in a city-owned building at 303-307 1/2 1st St. as a ko-ban site. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters has backed the proposal. But the early 1900s 
building needs to be repaired and seismically improved. City construction crews 
had expected to have their work done by December, 1992, but a series of 
construction and bureaucratic problems created delays and threatened the police 
outpost project. 
</P>
<P>
 A key problem was a city plan for only two store spaces in the renovated 
building rather than a restoration of the original four spaces. General 
Services Department officials believed two larger spaces would be easier to 
lease and use, particularly because the site has narrow street frontage, said 
Frank Mercier, a senior real estate officer for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would have left no room for the police outpost because two prior 
tenants, a restaurant and a water purification company, wanted to return to the 
building, community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 So ko-ban supporters enlisted the help of Walters and Gloria Uchida, the 
area's Community Redevelopment Agency project manager, who persuaded city 
general services officials to provide a third space in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have this thick bureaucracy . . . and it went around in circles," said 
Carolyn Cooper, a senior analyst in the City Administrative Officer's 
department who supported the three-space concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said she expects repairs on the building to proceed quickly now that 
the number of spaces has been clarified. The city has budgeted about $600,000 
for the improvements. The money will come from seismic retrofitting bonds 
approved by voters in 1990, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doc Nghiem, a city structural engineer, said the building has been gutted and 
architects should have interior plans, including upgraded restrooms and 
improved access for the disabled, drafted by early May. 
</P>
<P>
 The project should go out to bid by June and construction, which is expected 
to last four months, should begin by September, Nghiem said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do the best we can to speed it up," Nghiem said, although he noted that 
city construction and engineering employees have been occupied with Northridge 
earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, community leaders hope to get mayoral and City Council support for 
a low-rent agreement for the police outpost. The anti-crime association would 
like a nominal lease, such as the $1 per year some other nonprofit groups and 
agencies pay for renting city properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alternative that community leaders want to discuss with city leaders 
is having the anti-crime association become the building's landlord and benefit 
from rents provided by the other tenants. The association would sublease the 
spaces and use rent proceeds to help pay the police outpost's insurance and 
maintenance costs.

REGIONAL REPORT: LONG BEACH; MERCHANTS CLEARING AWAY THE SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS and JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reddish glow of cigarettes went out in Long Beach restaurants, bowling 
alleys and employee lunchrooms this week as the city's toughest no-smoking law 
to date went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance became effective Tuesday morning as City Council members 
validated last week's citywide election in which voters approved the 
anti-smoking law by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city, restaurateurs put up no-smoking signs and swept ashtrays 
off tables -- marking the end of a three-year battle to eliminate smoking in 
public areas and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters spoke loud and clear. The ordinance passed by a healthy margin in 
every single district," said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who introduced 
the anti-smoking proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law prohibits smoking in any eatery or workplace, including attached 
bars, hair salons, bowling alleys, health-care facilities and business offices. 
Puffing is limited to a third of the seating area in separate bars that do not 
share a ventilation system with a restaurant, and in a third of the patio area 
of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The law does not cover any buildings under control of another governmental 
body. But agencies that are exempt, such as the Veterans Administration or 
school district, have no-smoking policies or expect to implement similar 
restrictions within the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the council has been trying to enact a no-smoking policy in public 
areas, but has twice came up against well-financed campaigns by the tobacco 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, council members have repeatedly warned businesses 
that nonsmoking was the wave of the future and stricter laws were inevitable. 
Still, some restaurateurs are bristling under the law, or seeking ways to dodge 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Americana Restaurant -- a downtown haven for retirees who linger for 
hours over a bottomless cup of coffee and endless cigarettes -- customers and 
employees spoke angrily about their constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarettes are not illegal, waitress Loretta Miller said while she had a 
lunchtime burger 24 hours before the no-smoking law took effect. Three 
chain-smoking customers, seated at the table with Miller, grunted their 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take away (smoking) is to take away our freedom of choice, constitutional 
rights," Miller declared. "This doesn't feel like the United States anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 In Belmont Heights, Aimee Jarrels, owner and manager of the Reno Room bar, 
which features a neon sign out front proclaiming "Open at 6 a.m," said she 
hasn't decided how to react. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time believing they will have the money or manpower to enforce 
it," Jarrels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Department won't be sending out officers to check for compliance, 
Ross said. But if citizens complain about a certain eatery, the law does have 
teeth: Scofflaw business owners will be referred to the city prosecutor and 
could be charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 The first offense carries a minimum $50 fine, with penalties being raised 
incrementally for subsequent violations, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses that opposed the ordinance when it was introduced have since 
accepted -- even embraced -- their nonsmoking fate. Management of one of 
downtown's fancier restaurants, L'Opera, was cheerful this week as the smoke 
cleared.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first we were opposing it," said Sonia Woodruff, one of L'Opera's 
managers. "We have a large Italian and Japanese clientele and we worried that a 
ban would change their minds about coming here. But we're a well-established 
restaurant and I feel it won't change our clientele."

REGIONAL REPORT: PASADENA; SITE FOR HEALTH CENTER FOR NEEDY IS OBTAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Health care for the needy in northwest Pasadena is a step closer, now that the 
city has acquired a building for a proposed community health center. The next 
hurdle is finding funding for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to bring critical services for a population that's been 
underserved," said Jacqueline Stiff, the city's health officer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the city will seek grants from the federal government and private 
foundations to treat patients at the proposed Pasadena Community Health Center 
at 1845 N. Fair Oaks Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will serve the one in four Pasadena residents who have no medical 
insurance -- about 33,000 people -- as well as those with inadequate coverage. 
Many of them live in the northwest part of the city. The center also will 
handle Medi-Cal patients.  
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials announced recently that they had purchased the 
61,000-square-foot former Pasadena Community Hospital for $1.7 million. The 
site, which includes three buildings, will be renovated at a cost of about $5.5 
million. The city has issued bonds, secured a grant and other funds to pay for 
the purchase and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money that must be raised for treatment has not been determined, 
Stiff said. The health center could open in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is expected to house a public health clinic offering outpatient 
services, including well-child and prenatal care, alcohol- and drug-recovery 
programs, and testing and treatment for HIV and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 It will have a contingent of doctors and nurses to treat routine injuries and 
illnesses. Serious cases, such as heart attacks and major injuries, will be 
referred to area hospitals, most likely Huntington Memorial Hospital and St. 
Luke Medical Center, Stiff said.

REGIONAL REPORT: EL SEGUNDO; ELECTION TURNS 'MAYBERRY' INTO MAYHEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents in tiny, insulated El Segundo affectionately refer to the city as 
"Mayberry," and often praise the town for its tranquil streets and small-town 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Then come the elections. Every two years, rival political camps square off 
over City Council seats. Signs are pilfered, accusations fly, aspersions are 
cast and "Mayberry" transforms to mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's horrible," said Wendy Wallace, owner of Wendy's Place, a gathering spot 
in downtown El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace placed a sign in her cafe's window recently chiding a resident who 
took out a political ad in the local newspaper. The ad suggested that incumbent 
Alan West, whose daughter was stabbed and strangled in February, might be 
reelected in last week's election out of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to walk in here and put a 'for sale' sign in the window," she said. 
Something that personal and painful should not be part of politics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the tame elections in many South Bay cities, El Segundo's politics are 
often down-and-dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 During a candidates' forum several weeks ago, City Councilman Michael Robbins 
sat in the front row of the audience and held up a sign reading "LIAR" when 
incumbent J.B. Wise spoke, many who attended the forum said. Robbins was not 
available for comment. At the same forum, Wise called one of the other 
candidates a "son of a bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Cable Advisory Committee convened an emergency meeting and 
voted to edit potentially slanderous comments from another candidates' forum 
before it aired on the local cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am as thoroughly disgusted as I've ever been," said Wise, a 
third-generation resident who, along with West, lost in last week's election to 
two political newcomers. "For the first time in my life, after that forum, El 
Segundo didn't feel like it was home." 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo's 15,000 residents live in an enclave virtually cut off from the 
rest of the South Bay. Los Angeles International Airport blocks off 
neighborhoods to the north, Chevron's oil refinery seals the southern side and, 
to the east, a cluster of commercial buildings separates the city from 
Hawthorne. On the west it is cut off from the ocean by the Hyperion sewage 
treatment plant.  
</P>
<P>
 The result is a Midwestern-style community that is both "Mayberry," a cozy, 
small town where children still play hide-and-seek in their neighbors' yards -- 
and the self-proclaimed "Aerospace Capitol of the World," where some of the 
world's most sophisticated high-tech machinery is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attribute the often mean-spirited politicking to a heightened concern for 
El Segundo's future. The city has been hit hard by the decline in the aerospace 
industry, and candidates debated how to fill the city's many empty buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say it's just good old, small-town politics, where personality 
conflicts play as big a role in elections as policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Liam B. Weston, 29, said raucous political fights are in his blood. The newly 
elected councilman's mother campaigned for an El Segundo council candidate 
shortly after his birth in a similarly rough election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that helped prepare me for all the nasty business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election neared, residents flooded the local newspaper with letters, 
wielding accusations and chiding candidates. When the letters were rejected for 
being too long, some took out ads and crammed pointed words into small boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Waag Friedkin, who knocked on residents' doors as she campaigned for a 
council seat, said El Segundo is "cliquish." She said she was frequently asked 
how long she has lived in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be an El Segundoan you have to have practically lived your whole life 
here," Friedkin said. Because she has resided in the city 23 years, Friedkin 
said she believes she passed the test: She won a seat on the council.

MYANMAR PAYS HOMAGE TO A BUDDHIST RELIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A relic believed to be Buddha's tooth arrived in Myanmar from China on 
Wednesday and was greeted by thousands of chanting devotees. 
</P>
<P>
 The relic was immediately placed on a jewel-covered litter after it arrived at 
Yangon's international airport. It was carried to the World Peace Pagoda on a 
decorated carriage drawn by an elephant and followed by four other elephants. 
Devotees lined the three-mile route. Many sank to their knees in homage. 
</P>
<P>
 The tooth relic from China is one of two believed to have survived since 
Buddha's death 2,500 years ago. The other is kept in Sri Lanka.

PUBLIC DEFENDER SUPPORTS JUDGE; COURTS: CLAYMAN ASKS OFFICIALS TO RESIST D. 
A.'S DISQUALIFICATION OF LAWRENCE STORCH FROM FELONY CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman on Wednesday urged Ventura County court 
officials to resist pressure from Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and allow the 
county's most experienced Superior Court judge to continue to preside over 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman's request comes one day after prosecutors moved to end Superior Court 
Judge Lawrence Storch's career on the criminal bench by using a rare legal 
challenge to disqualify him from hearing any new felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bradbury has successfully forced four other local jurists to be 
reassigned during his 16-year tenure, prosecutors in most other counties avoid 
using the legal maneuver, according to the statewide Judicial Council of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty rare," said Ellen McCarthy, a Judicial Council spokeswoman. She 
said the council is unaware of any other instance in which a district 
attorney's office has effectively forced a judge to switch assignments by 
issuing a series of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 But Storch, who began hearing a murder case Wednesday, may soon join four 
other jurists whose assignments were changed under such circumstances, Ventura 
County court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry F. Flitt said the district attorney's office barred him from hearing all 
but traffic cases in the early 1980s, when he was a Juvenile Court referee. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor's office apparently objected to the fact that Flitt, now 78, 
did not have a law degree. He had served as an Oxnard police officer, a county 
probation officer and a Juvenile Court officer, he said in an interview 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just a Juvenile Court referee, and that didn't require a law degree," 
said Flitt, who retired in 1984. "They wanted lawyers to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert Soares was barred from hearing vehicular 
manslaughter cases after the district attorney's office objected to the way he 
handled a case in 1992, officials said. Soares could not be reached for 
comment. Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said he did not have any other 
information on that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 And current Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson said she has not 
tried a felony case since 1985, when prosecutors banned her from hearing 
criminal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it didn't affect us very much because we had a lot of civil 
trials," Johnson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth jurist was the late Commissioner John Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, the public defender's office has also executed legal maneuvers to 
disqualify judges from hearing certain cases. But Clayman said he has always 
left such decisions up to the discretion of attorneys handling a specific case 
instead of issuing a policy directive. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys are required to 
state the reason for disqualifying a judge, officials said. Lawyers are also 
allowed to dismiss potential jurors before cases go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr., felony division chief, said 
prosecutors have not given a reason for disqualifying Storch. Bradbury refused 
to comment. And his chief deputy McGee would only say that the judge's decision 
to reduce a Newbury Park man's first-degree murder conviction to second-degree 
murder is one of a variety of factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there was no one thing that was determinative," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said there is little court officials can do other than transfer 
Storch to the division that handles civil cases. He said Storch has an 
inventory of felony cases already assigned to him that would keep him busy for 
the next couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say whether Storch's cases would be transferred to Johnson, 
since she has been previously disqualified by the prosecutor's office. If that 
were to occur, prosecutors would be powerless to disqualify Johnson because 
they have only one disqualification per case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, that's an option," Campbell said, but stressed that that decision 
has not been made. Johnson, the presiding judge, could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to Johnson, Clayman said Storch should not be removed from the 
felony division. 
</P>
<P>
 If Storch is transferred to the civil division, as Johnson has said he would 
be, then prosecutors would not have to use their disqualifications on him and 
could use them on another judge, Clayman said.

MEASURES PRESSES FOR PLAN FOR HOMELESS; VENTURA: THE COUNCILWOMAN CALLS FOR 
COMBINING IMPROVED SOCIAL SERVICES WITH STEPPED-UP POLICE ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures on Wednesday called for a comprehensive 
plan to deal with the city's homeless, saying the city needs to move homeless 
encampments out of the Ventura River bottom and "work diligently at cleaning up 
downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a city housing committee meeting, Measures said the plan should 
combine improved social services with some kind of stepped-up police program to 
monitor panhandlers or homeless people who become a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her comments came after homeless advocates presented a proposal to build a 
campground for the homeless near the river bottom. Measures said residents will 
accept the campground only if they believe that it is part of a larger 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can address other situations besides just assistance, that's the way 
we're going to get business and social acceptance of this (campground 
program)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures organized a committee made up of Police Capt. Randy G. Adams, 
representatives from four charities that deal with the homeless, the owner of a 
RV park near the riverbed and a representative from the business community. She 
and other housing committee members asked the volunteer group to draft a list 
of objectives concerning the homeless and bring the list back to the housing 
committee at its June 8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures and others also expressed concern that successful homeless programs 
would turn Ventura into a magnet for transients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we want to deal with (homeless people), but we don't want to be so 
attractive to them that we attract people from all over the area," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, many at the committee meeting said, might involve a police 
crackdown on vagrancy to discourage the idea that Ventura is a friendly place 
for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 But police crackdowns can have pitfalls, such as lawsuits. Santa Barbara has 
so far circumvented the problem by combining tough vagrancy laws with a 
comprehensive social services program, noted Rick Pearson, executive director 
of Project Understanding, a homeless aid organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why Santa Barbara is getting away with doing more police things -- 
because they have these other (social service) things in place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures agreed: "If we provide more options for the homeless, then we have 
more latitude in law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures' request for a wide-ranging plan, however, was met with skepticism 
from other council members and homeless advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as cleaning out the whole downtown, that's an immense thing you are 
asking these people to do," Councilman Jack Tingstrom told Measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very tall order," said Clyde B. Reynolds, executive director of the 
Turning Point Foundation, which serves Ventura's homeless mentally ill. 
Reynolds said he liked the idea of organizing a comprehensive plan, but worried 
that concentrating only on the long-term would prevent the city from making 
improvements that are needed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless Ventura families and single homeless women can find shelter in the 
city. But single homeless men must either sleep outdoors or travel to Oxnard 
for a formal shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates said the campground proposal would solve this inequity 
because it would not limit who could park a vehicle or set up a tent at a 
yet-to-be-identified vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the campground project would also provide social and job search 
services to homeless residents, who could stay up to a year. The city is 
considering about half a dozen sites near the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Single men are "not the most popular group to do things for," Reynolds said. 
"It's much easier to do things for families or for children. But this is the 
group (that) people are expressing the most annoyance about."

RIVER MAY BE REGULATED AS ENTIRE SYSTEM; RESOURCES: WITHOUT ITS MANAGEMENT, 
LEGAL BATTLES COULD OCCUR THE NEXT TIME A DRY CYCLE HITS, ORGANIZERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With increasing diversions from the Ventura River and the certainty that dry 
years will return, those who draw river water from above and below ground are 
taking the first steps toward regulating how the stream is used. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions are still preliminary, but if a ground-water or river water 
management agency is formed, it would mark the first time that the 16-mile-long 
Ventura River has ever been regulated as an entire system. 
</P>
<P>
 The two largest river users -- the Casitas Municipal Water District and the 
city of Ventura -- are taking part in the effort to decide how the river should 
be managed. But smaller players such as the Ventura River County Water District 
are involved as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other ground-water management agencies have been formed in Ventura 
County -- the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency regulates water below 
the Oxnard Plain, and an Ojai ground-water agency regulates the basin below the 
Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one agency oversees how much water is taken from the Ventura River 
Valley. And short of paging through county well permits and doing a field 
survey of how much each well draws, there is no way to find out how much water 
is pumped from the river's below-ground basins. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Water Resources Control Board regulates how much water can be taken 
from the surface of a river, but no state law directly regulates how much water 
can be drawn from the ground. And wells within the river valley suck down the 
level of the surface water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ground and surface water might not be connected in the eyes of the law, but 
they certainly are connected in every other way," said John Johnson, general 
manager of Casitas. Casitas, the largest river water user, diverts an average 
of about 14,040 acre-feet of river water per year -- enough to supply 28,000 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Without some form of management for the cities, water districts and 
individuals that draw water from the river, legal battles could result the next 
time a dry cycle hits the county, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole bunch of competing uses on the river," Johnson said. "And 
sooner or later, we will get into a discussion about whether one use is more 
important than the other. It's better to head it off now and keep it out of 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Chuck Curtis, general manager of the Ventura River County Water 
District, are heading the effort to bring the competing interests together. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the years go on and the droughts keep coming, we'll be shorter and shorter 
of water," said Curtis, whose district uses about 1,200 acre-feet of water a 
year to serve customers between Casitas Springs and Ojai. "We want to work out 
a plan where we can use the river to its fullest for everything -- 
environmental reasons as well as water for people to drink." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis and Johnson have contacted other water districts in the area, along 
with the city of Ventura; the Farmont Corp., which plans a golf course in the 
area; Ventura County, and Mark Capelli, executive director of Friends of the 
Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli, a lecturer in coastal systems at UC Santa Barbara, praised the effort 
to bring all the parties together to manage the river, but he said the concept 
does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're suggesting that they broaden the scope to include a management plan for 
the entire watershed," he said. The watershed -- the area where runoff is 
collected to feed the Ventura River and its ground-water basins -- is 226 
square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli said the Ventura River should be approached in the same fashion as the 
Santa Clara River. A team of state, county and local interests, including 
property owners, growers, water districts and wildlife agencies, is drawing up 
a plan to manage the entire 100-mile-long Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 John Turner, senior hydrologist and a ground-water authority with the county 
Public Works Department, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to manage the entire system, you need control over the whole system 
and its watershed," Turner said. He said the adjacent Ojai Groundwater 
Management Agency should be combined with any new organization to best manage 
the Ventura River Valley and its basins. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stage of the Santa Clara River study has been funded by the 
California Coastal Conservancy. Capelli said he is trying to arrange a meeting 
between the Coastal Conservancy and organizers of the Ventura River management 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Calkins, director of public works for the city of Ventura, said a plan to 
manage the river as a whole is necessary to balance the needs of all users of 
the river. The city is the second-largest user, taking an average of 10,000 
acre-feet of water a year. But it has plans to increase its diversions by a 
yet-unknown amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are making decisions about using the river independently of what other 
people are doing," he said. "I don't think that's in the best interest of the 
people or the river."

MAN SENT TO PRISON FOR STALKING HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND; OAK VIEW: HE WILL SERVE TWO 
YEARS IN FIRST CASE OF ITS KIND IN COUNTY. JUDGE REFUSES TO GRANT PROBATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A judge hearing Ventura County's first felony stalking case sentenced an Oak 
View man to two years in state prison, citing the defendant's history of 
violence toward the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. said Harold Owen Edwards was "too 
great of a risk to be put on probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Edwards, 37, stalked Lisa Hale of Oak View after the woman 
ended their 13-year relationship. Edwards twice broke into the woman's home, 
ransacked her bedroom and shredded her lingerie, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna 
K. Gissing, who recommended the two-year sentence. Edwards could have received 
a prison term of up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, prosecutors have been able since 1990 to file felony charges 
against accused stalkers, but Edwards' case was the first one to be tried in 
local courts. The felony stalking law was passed after a series of women -- 
notably slain actress Rebecca Schaeffer -- were followed, threatened, attacked 
or even killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, who pleaded guilty to one count of stalking in February, asked 
Campbell to grant him probation. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney blamed Edwards' criminal behavior on an addiction to 
methamphetamine, but said the defendant has voluntarily attended anti-drug 
classes in Ventura County Jail while awaiting trial. Edwards has been in jail 
since August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like what Mr. Edwards has done while in the County 
Jail," Deputy Public Defender Stephen P. Lipson told the judge. "Mr. Edwards 
has apparently learned his lesson and has taken the appropriate steps to make 
himself a successful probationer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gissing argued against granting probation, even though Edwards has no past 
criminal record and has participated in the anti-drug classes in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the behavior not of a drug addict. This is the behavior of a 
batterer, someone who beats women," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was also charged with two counts of residential burglary for allegedly 
stealing the defendant's checks. He was convicted of those counts by a jury, 
although the verdicts were dismissed after Hale later found the missing items, 
Gissing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they were able to file charges against Edwards because his 
harassment against Hale was blatant. For example, one morning a year ago, 
Edwards showed up at Hale's house just as she was about to go to work and 
refused to leave her yard, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Hale discovered Edwards hiding behind her bedroom door at 5 
in the morning. She called sheriff's deputies, who served Edwards with a copy 
of a temporary restraining order, which he later violated, Gissing said in 
court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After that early morning bedroom incident, prosecutors said Edwards continued 
for several more months to harass the woman until he was finally arrested and 
charged under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipson said Edwards overreacted to a relationship gone bad. But Gissing 
accused the defense of minimizing the terror that the victim endured.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; GUEST READERS ENLIVEN LIBRARY STORY HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four-year-old Jena Losch just couldn't stop dancing. She spun in circles, her 
long brown hair flying in every direction, her black leather shoes pounding on 
the floor.  
</P>
<P>
 For Jena, who wants to be a dancer when she grows up, Wednesday's regular 
story hour at the Camarillo Library offered a special surprise -- three Ventura 
County performers reading, and in some cases romping, to their favorite tales. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong event was part of National Library Week and the American Library 
Assn.'s Day of 1,000 Stars, a nationwide storytelling program in which local 
residents read aloud to children. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth year the Ventura County Library Services Agency has 
participated in the event, which featured guest readers at two county 
libraries.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's to get the message out (about) how important reading is for children," 
said Trish Cavanaugh, volunteer community relations manager for Library 
Services. "What a wonderfully nurturing thing it is to have someone reading to 
you. It's a reminder of what books do for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, at the Avenue Library, Ventura College basketball Coach Phil 
Mathews and players Brandon Jessie and Joey Ramirez read to 25 third- and 
fourth-grade students from Sheridan Way Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, dancer-choreographer Patsy Swayze, singer Lee Orgel and 
writer-actor Rex Waggoner read to a group of about 25 preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's lots and lots of books about dancing," Swayze told the group of 
children huddled around her. "And I'm going to talk about girls and boys and 
animals that dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Swayze, mother of actor Patrick Swayze, read from a book called "Moondance," a 
story about a dancing bear. After the story, the Simi Valley resident directed 
the squirming youngsters through a series of dance exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Swayze said she volunteered as a storyteller because she believes children 
need to be exposed to literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it opens a lot of doors that may not have been opened otherwise," she 
said. "And because they watch too much TV . . . they need to know another form 
of entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 The children and parents in attendance enjoyed the special program, which was 
scheduled during the library's weekly storytelling hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Joey Schuberg said he wasn't thrilled with the hopping around 
but liked the story about the bear, especially the part where "he danced in the 
rain and did all those cartwheels and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Somis resident and former preschool teacher Beth Miller volunteers at the 
Camarillo Library by reading stories to children three times a month. Since 
budget cutbacks have eliminated storytelling by librarians, Miller said, the 
guest speakers were a treat for the kids.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really positive experience for them," she said. "Any type of 
storytelling that brings parents and children together is great." TRACY WILSON

<P>
 An Oxnard man jailed on suspicion of murder 11 days ago was indicted Wednesday 
and charged not only with the April 10 stabbing death, but also with severely 
beating his girlfriend in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald William Culbertson, 22, faces charges of murder and use of a deadly 
weapon in connection with the slaying of David Rubio, 19, of Oxnard.In 
addition, the grand jury returned an aggravated assault indictment in the 
September beating of Mysti Giralde, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Culbertson at the scene of the stabbing, an alley behind the 
5200 block of Columbus Place. Rubio had borrowed a car from Culbertson's sister 
and was late returning it one night, Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Glynn said. That 
led to an argument and eventually to Culbertson stabbing Rubio, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 After arresting Culbertson, investigators discovered outstanding warrants 
against him in the September beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charge that Culbertson hit and kicked Giralde, beating her so 
brutally that she was hospitalized twice and unable to eat for weeks. She was 
fed intravenously while her pancreas healed, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culbertson remains in Ventura County Jail on $250,000 bail. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; TRIAL BEGINS FOR MAN ACCUSED IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Oxnard man should be convicted of second-degree murder because he fatally 
stabbed his ex-girlfriend's son on Christmas Day after the victim tried to 
persuade the defendant to leave his family's yard, a prosecutor said during 
opening statements of the murder trial Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But a defense attorney said Jose Jimenez stabbed 21-year-old Isaias Guerrero 
in self-defense after Guerrero "kept hitting him like a machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Joseph P. Villasana told the jury during his opening 
remarks that he planned to prove that Jimenez is not guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, 32, has been held at Ventura County Jail since Dec. 25, when Guerrero 
was stabbed in the yard of his family's Campbell Way home around 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is being conducted before Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Kossoris told the jury that Guerrero and other family 
members -- including his mother, Graciela Guerrero -- were celebrating during 
the early morning hours Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Jimenez showed up at the house uninvited and walked inside. Graciela 
Guerrero had recently broken off their relationship because "she was upset that 
he was drunk too often," Kossoris said. The prosecutor said Jimenez left after 
being told that he was not welcome, but he came back around 3 a.m., throwing a 
rock at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris said Isaias Guerrero was stabbed three times in the chest after he 
and other men tried to escort Jimenez away from the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Villasana, however, said Guerrero confronted Jimenez and began attacking him. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, all hell breaks loose," Villasana said. He said that was when 
Jimenez knifed the victim in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony continues this morning. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PANEL APPROVES EAST SIDE DEVELOPMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission has approved a developer's request to build 
160 condominiums and 42 single-family houses on a 19-acre parcel on the city's 
east side. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted unanimously Tuesday night to approve the project by the 
Camarillo-based Pardee Construction Co.The plan must still go before the City 
Council.  
</P>
<P>
 The parcel is near the intersection of Mission Oaks Boulevard and Woodcreek 
Road. The development is less dense than was stipulated in the developer's 
original 1991 application, project manager Bill Teller said. He added that the 
company opted to go with a lighter-density development because of the 
surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Burrow, a senior planner with the city, said the commission asked 
the developer to erect a wall along Mission Boulevard and change driveway 
entrances on the thoroughfare to dampen the level of traffic noise that could 
affect residents of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also required that at least 20% of the units be made available 
to low-income families. The City Council is scheduled to consider the project 
at its May 11 meeting. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 7% HIKE IN SEWAGE, WATER RATES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water and sewage rates could rise 7% for the average Ventura household if the 
Ventura City Council approves a recommendation made Wednesday by the city's 
utilities committee.  
</P>
<P>
 A median city household today spends about $75.25 on water and sewage every 
other month.The recommendation, approved 2 to 0 by the committee, would raise 
that bill by $4.91 bimonthly. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Steve Bennett and Mayor Tom Buford voted to recommend the 
increase. Councilman Jack Tingstrom, the third member of the three-member 
council committee, was absent for the vote. However, he has opposed the 
increase in the past because it would increase sanitation rates 12% to 18% for 
industrial customers, and up to 10% for commercial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee hikes will pay for increased operating costs and future water and 
sewer projects. A limited amount will also finance a low-interest loan program 
to help businesses invest in sanitation pre-treatment facilities that would 
lower their overall sanitation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff had recommended raising the water and sanitation rates by an 
additional 1% to 2% to pay for increased administrative costs, but Buford 
balked. "I think there comes a point where it's going up and going up, and 
people say, 'I don't care why you are doing this, the fees just keep going up,' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tingstrom absent and Bennett voting to recommend the additional increase, 
the administrative increase proposal will go to the full council next month 
without a formal recommendation from the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also recommended raising an average family's flood control 
assessment by $2.49 -- to $7.40 a year -- to pay for a federally mandated 
storm-water treatment program. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BANKER PLEADS GUILTY TO 1 COUNT OF 
FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks banker Phillip L. Chase pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of 
bank fraud on the agreement that he would not serve time in prison, an 
assistant U.S. attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase was sentenced to 200 hours of community service and fined $5,000, 
according to Assistant U.S. Atty.Brent Whittlesey. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence came the day after Chase's banking partner and co-defendant, Olen 
B. Phillips, pleaded guilty to two other counts of the same 12-count 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles accused the two of 
understating their debts when applying for loans from banks in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 That indictment followed a trial on related charges that ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than face the expenses of a second trial and the possibility of 
spending time in prison, Chase pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment, 
said Richard Marmaro, Chase's attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Chase admitted "leaving off some liabilities on a financial statement" to a 
Los Angeles bank, Marmaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 All other counts of the indictment were dropped.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment on the agreement, Whittlesey said: "I don't make comments on 
those decisions. I'm just the lawyer for the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, who is scheduled to be sentenced June 13, could face up to 24 months 
in prison, as well as more than $200,000 in fines and restitution. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE: RAIN THREATENS TO DOUSE BEACH PARTY WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fog that hung over the Ventura coast Wednesday is expected to return today 
and last through the weekend, when rain is forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system from the Gulf of Alaska threatens to douse the California 
Beach Party, the annual festival set on Ventura's beachfront promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "These storms are tricky, but right now it's not looking too promising" for 
the festival, said Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a 
private forecasting company. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren predicted that showers would start Saturday afternoon and continue 
periodically Sunday. However, Clay Morgan from the National Weather Service in 
Oxnard said the storm appears to be slowing, so the rain may not arrive until 
late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TEEN-AGER ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON YOUTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks youth, arrested five days earlier in a suspected gang fight, 
was booked again Wednesday and accused of bursting into a teen-ager's home and 
beating him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady Willmon, 18, a former football player at Westlake High School, was in 
Ventura County Jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, Ventura 
County sheriff's deputies said.Because of his earlier arrest, bail was 
increased from $5,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies charge that Willmon and two other youths rushed into the home of 
18-year-old Daniel Ihle in the 1400 block of Grissom Street with knives and 
small clubs, shouted gang slogans and began hitting and kicking the Thousand 
Oaks youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ihle, suffering minor injuries, was taken by ambulance to Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center and later released. Ihle told sheriff's deputies that Willmon 
was one of his assailants, police said. Investigators were still looking for 
two other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 In an incident last Friday, Willmon was arrested on an assault charge stemming 
from a fight in Newbury Park, authorities said. He was accused of hitting a 
juvenile with a broom handle, deputies said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY COUNCIL SEEKS TO CLARIFY PARKING 
LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to clear up a fuzzy law that seems to criminalize driveway parking, the 
Thousand Oaks City Council has ordered staff to rewrite part of the Municipal 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing law bans parking in the "yard or other open space provided around 
any building," a definition that officials said includes driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many residents park in driveways, the city has never prosecuted 
violators. But at Tuesday's council meeting, Councilwoman Judy Lazar urged her 
colleagues to do away with the law "to clean up city codes . . . so it's clear 
that while the driveway is part of the front-yard setback, it is certainly 
viable for parking." 
</P>
<P>
 In a heated debate, Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski opposed 
the proposed change. The law does not specifically ban driveway parking, they 
said, so a revision would be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somewhat absurd to want to change the Municipal Code," Zukowski said. 
"Why are we creating work?" 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a complaint she received about a homeowner who routinely parks several 
cars in the driveway, Zeanah said an ambiguous law would allow city staff 
enough flexibility to crack down on problem cases. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STUDENTS TO BE SURVEYED ON SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of an effort to improve safety at Simi Valley schools, district 
officials are planning to survey students on the presence of weapons, drugs, 
sexual harassment and racial conflict on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The anonymous survey will also ask students if their school grounds are 
well-kept, if disciplinary rules are fair, and if they feel comfortable talking 
with teachers about problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators with the Simi Valley Unified School District hope to distribute 
the questionnaire to all students in the fourth through 12th grades. Employees 
will also be surveyed on campus safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board is expected to review the questions in the survey 
at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrator Ann Eklund said the results will be used to identify the biggest 
safety concerns of students and staff members. On Wednesday, a draft copy of 
the survey was previewed by a committee of parents, district employees and city 
officials. The committee, formed to review campus safety after the Feb. 1 fatal 
stabbing of 14-year-old Chad Hubbard, has been charged with developing short- 
and long-term plans for ensuring that students are safe at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee member Jerry Garon, a physical education and science teacher at 
Hillside Junior High, said he believes that the questions on the survey are 
relevant, including those that ask students to identify their ethnic 
backgrounds. "We need to know if people of different backgrounds are treated 
differently or feel that they are treated differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, school officials say the stabbing has prompted more students 
to turn their fellow classmates in for bringing knives, guns and other weapons 
to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven expulsion hearings have been held since Feb. 10, and five more 
are scheduled. During the first half of the year, 19 students were targeted for 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, expulsion hearings for the 1993-94 school year have climbed to 51, 
contrasted with 23 during the 1992-93 school year and 17 the previous year, 
officials said. JULIE FIELDS

 Ventura County prosecutors have charged a Simi Valley man, who is accused of 
running over a 54-year-old man, with vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated 
and evading arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Rodriguez, 39, is being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $10,000 
bail.He was charged Tuesday and is set to be arraigned April 28, said Deputy 
Public Defender William Markov. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was arrested Friday after his car hit several parked cars and struck 
Raphael Lachmiller, who was walking from his car to his family's house on 
Whitcomb Avenue in Simi Valley, police said. Lachmiller died later from 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy in the area saw Rodriguez's 
vehicle strike two parked cars and followed him, police said. The deputy then 
saw Rodriguez's vehicle hit Lachmiller, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's vehicle ran a stop light while police were chasing him, and his 
car finally stopped when he crashed into a planter, police said. PEGGY Y. LEE

STATE FAULTS DEVELOPER'S PLAN TO PROTECT SITE OF RARE WETLAND; MOORPARK: 
WILDLIFE OFFICIALS CONTEND THAT THE SAFEGUARDS IN THE 550-HOME PROJECT'S IMPACT 
REPORT ARE INADEQUATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A developer's plan to build 550 homes in southeast Moorpark fails to 
adequately protect a rare wetland, state wildlife officials said Wednesday, 
adding that they may challenge the project when it goes before city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Meyer, a plant ecologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, said 
Carlsberg Financial Corp.'s housing development threatens two plants on the 
state's endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer's plan to protect the species has been approved by city planners 
and is scheduled to go before the City Council on May 6, but Meyer said the 
plan as it now reads will not protect the rare species. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel the area would be adequately protected with this plan," Meyer 
said. "It's an odd situation. The city has taken the view that they know what 
is best for endangered species even though they have no training in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game has asked Carlsberg to set aside about 50 of the 500 acres in 
the development. The agency's intent is to provide a buffer zone around the 
seasonal wetland -- called a vernal pool -- and keep the hillsides that provide 
it with water runoff free of houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg President Ron Tankersley said the developer's plan to set aside 15 
acres and provide a new water source for the wetland is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already provided" for the wetland, Tankersley said. "I don't see why 
they're so focused on setting aside more acres. . . . The development would not 
be economically feasible if we followed their plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Tankersley said the project would divert runoff from houses in the area away 
from the wetland and keep its seasonal aspect intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The wetland will be preserved through a new drainage system that will carry 
runoff from undeveloped hillsides to the pool in the same amounts it has 
historically received, Tankersley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernal pools fill with water in the spring and are dry most other times in the 
year. The seasonal character of the wetland nurtures a unique set of plant and 
animal species that have evolved to survive the long dry spells, wildlife 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark vernal pool is home to two endangered plants -- the California 
Orcutt's grass and the Lyon's pentachaeta , a yellow-flowered aster. Fish and 
Game botanists called the area "one of the major botanical finds" in Southern 
California after the plants were discovered in a survey last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to save the wetland and avert a legal confrontation between the two 
sides, a local environmental organization is searching for public or private 
money to purchase the vernal pool and the 50 acres around it. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters sent this week to conservation groups and government agencies, the 
Moorpark branch of the Ventura County Environmental Coalition asked for 
donations to buy the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this would be the best way to protect the area," said Janet 
Murphy, vice president of the organization. "It really needs protection, and we 
don't know if the developer's plan to protect the area -- which is 
experimental, really -- will do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 The site, which has a pronounced dark reddish color most of the year and is 
visible from the Moorpark Freeway near Tierra Rejada Road, is the only wetland 
within a 120-mile radius to provide habitat for the endangered plants found 
there, environmentalists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have sympathy for the developers," said Margaret Koenig, who is active in 
the Environmental Coalition. "But this is a unique place we must protect." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that setting aside 50 acres is unnecessary and that 
Carlsberg's plan is adequate. If the developers were forced to set aside all 
the acreage recommended by Fish and Game, officials say, it would kill the 
project, which is expected to earn the developer as much as $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the same amount of water will reach the site" under the 
developer's plan, said Jim Aguilera, Moorpark's director of community 
development. "It will be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental impact report on the project has already received 
preliminary approval from city planners, Aguilera said. The next step puts it 
before the Moorpark City Council for a vote. If the council approves the plan, 
it would probably be another six to eight months before building permits could 
be issued. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Environmental Coalition's plan, Aguilera said the city would not 
object to the purchase. He said he was skeptical that the developers would 
consider an offer unless it fully compensated them not only for the land, but 
also for the 145 houses that would be built on that part of the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Coalition proposal "is a shot in the dark," Aguilera said. 
"It's not a serious offer, so no one has taken the time to make the 
calculations about just how much it would cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy conceded that the group is not sure how much it would cost to purchase 
the area, but said the proposal is serious. She also hinted that the 
environmental group might try to block the project unless more of the wetland 
is preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a positive thing," she said. "It could be a win-win situation, and it 
will ensure that the wetland is protected without us having to contest the 
permit. In the long run, it's a lot smoother way for the developer to get what 
he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Fish and Game officials said purchasing the property would be 
a perfect way to protect the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether money is found to buy the area or not, they said, it must be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're willing to pursue that avenue, but with limited funds and an unwilling 
seller, there's no guarantee a purchase could be made," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that this is an extremely uncommon and unique resource that must 
be protected one way or the other." Vernal Pool Environmentalists want to buy 
more than 50 acre in the 500-acre Carlsberg development to protect a seasonal 
wetland known as a vernal pool.

COUNCIL OKS USE OF STRIP MALL DIRECTORY SIGNS; THOUSAND OAKS: CITY ACTION IS 
LATEST IN BID TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH ENTREPRENEURS AND RETAILERS. CODE 
REVISIONS FACE PUBLIC HEARINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks council members have approved the concept of installing 
directory boards outside strip malls, boosting an ongoing effort to support the 
city's retailers and entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 From monthly Business Showcase Awards highlighting local companies to regular 
meetings of the Mayor's Business Roundtable, city officials have been trying to 
build bridges with a long-alienated community. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent example came Tuesday night when each City Council member 
lavished praise on a proposal to allow shopping plazas to install free-standing 
directory signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of complaining about visual pollution, council members voted 
unanimously to change city laws to allow directory boards listing strip mall 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed code changes still face public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But business leaders hailed the council's conceptual approval as evidence that 
politicians are trying hard to improve an often-prickly relationship with local 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The first boost to small businesses came late in the fall, when the council 
voted to hang signs on the Ventura Freeway and at busy intersections directing 
drivers to local gas stations, restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sign of empathy for small companies, council members two weeks ago 
emphatically rejected a draft law that would have banned photographers, 
hairdressers and other entrepreneurs from working out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps because it's election time, most people are starting to feel sympathy 
for small businesses," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce. "Instead of looking at businesses as exploitative, they've 
realized that businesses are the foundation of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members' stated commitment to small businesses will be tested in two 
hearings: 
</P>
<P>
 * On May 10, the council will consider speeding up the city permit process. 
The proposed change would allow most business owners to spruce up a building's 
facade or expand square footage without going through a lengthy administrative 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * On May 17, the council will vote on a draft law allowing restaurant owners 
to place five outdoor tables on the sidewalk or lawn without increasing the 
number of customer parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of council members have expressed enthusiasm for both proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a direction and emphasis from the City Council to 
streamline our processes and provide better customer service," Assistant 
Planner Haider Alawami said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, indeed, some recent arrivals to Thousand Oaks have found the City 
Council, and city staff, unexpectedly flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was considering opening a store in Thousand Oaks, Matt Goldfield said 
friends warned him that the city "can be really tough and interfere a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Brushing off their predictions of endless red tape, Goldfield decided to jump 
in, setting up Big League Stuff on Thousand Oaks Boulevard four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In establishing and running his store, Goldfield said he has enjoyed amicable 
relations with city staff. 
</P>
<P>
 So has Valerie Forgo, who owns the nearby European Tailoring store. "I've had 
no trouble -- everything's OK," Forgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another tenant in the Palm Plaza strip mall, Nathan Samuels of Mocha 
Mania, touted Tuesday's decision to allow directory boards as a sign that the 
council "is getting a little more sympathetic to business." 
</P>
<P>
 But the unanimous support for small business does not extend to big-time 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent sign changes at The Oaks shopping center and the Auto Mall squeaked by 
on 3-2 votes, and a deadlock effectively denied Mervyn's request for a marquee 
monument at Janss Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, both strong backers of 
small businesses, have consistently voted against the bigger developers -- a 
dichotomy that has drawn some criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can support only one sector of the business community and 
not another," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "It's unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski, however, defended her votes on the grounds that the city has too 
often granted special treatment to large companies while ignoring small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big tax revenue speaks loudly, but if you really look at it, all the small 
businesses taken together have more weight than one single large applicant," 
she said.

LAZAR PROPOSES ABOLISHING COUNCIL PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fed up with bickering about the role of council committees, Thousand Oaks 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar has suggested dramatically altering local government by 
abolishing all council committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the city's five standing committees include two council members, a 
staff representative and several residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The committees review major policy issues each month, making recommendations 
on topics ranging from affordable housing to city officials' perks. The entire 
council then reviews each committee report and takes appropriate action. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski have revived 
complaints that some of the committees operate secretively and fail to inform 
other council members about their deliberations. They have targeted in 
particular the finance committee, which includes Lazar and Councilman Alex 
Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Lazar and Fiore say they regularly brief the council on finance 
committee decisions, although they do not provide detailed accounts of each 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since there seems to be so much distrust, perhaps we should abolish council 
committees altogether and work as a whole group," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her suggestion won partial support from Zeanah and Zukowski, who agreed that 
the finance committee, at least, should be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel that we have too much subcommittee work and, in some ways, that 
divides us and contributes to strife on the council," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Frank Schillo argued that delegating work to committees saves 
countless hours. If the entire council had to debate every single issue from 
scratch, he said, the government would face an overwhelming logjam. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is perfectly capable of tearing a committee's report apart, but 
at least when a committee reviews something, we all have a well-thought-out 
plan to look at," he said. STEPHANIE SIMON

CARPINTERIA MAN ARRESTED IN ASSAULTS ON 2 WOMEN AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies have arrested a 45-year-old Carpinteria man 
on suspicion of sexually assaulting two women in separate incidents as they 
sunbathed on remote Ventura County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Matson, general manager of Santa Barbara-based San Bar Air, was arrested 
at his air-conditioning company Tuesday on suspicion of attempted rape, robbery 
and other sexual battery charges, said Sgt. John Fitzgerald, supervisor of the 
sheriff's sexual assault unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not much of a reaction from him" when he was taken into custody, 
Fitzgerald said. "I think the people at the workplace were totally shocked over 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said an oil worker came to the rescue of a 22-year-old Ventura 
woman who was struggling with a knife-wielding attacker about a week ago at 
Seacliff Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to help her and, in the process, he saw the guy fleeing the scene in 
a company vehicle," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the description of the suspect and the truck bearing San Bar's name, 
detectives spent about a week in surveillance before they served a search 
warrant Tuesday at Matson's house and workplace, Fitzgerald said. They arrested 
Matson at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have also linked Matson to the sexual assault of a 25-year-old 
Thousand Oaks woman that occurred Jan. 3 at La Conchita Beach, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both instances, the assailant preyed on a young woman sunbathing alone in 
an isolated part of the beach, putting a knife to her throat, Fitzgerald said. 
Both assaults took place between noon and 1 p.m., Fitzgerald said, and Matson 
fit the description of the assailant in both incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Matson was being held at Ventura County Jail on $220,000 bail. He was 
scheduled to be arraigned today. PEGGY Y. LEE

THOUSAND OAKS HOMEOWNERS AT TOP OF QUAKE RELIEF LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks residents with quake-damaged homes will get first crack at a 
$501,000 federal relief grant -- but city officials have not yet determined how 
much money will be available to homeowners or how it will be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing uncertainty about how best to use the windfall has frustrated 
at least one City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had it on our agenda for two weeks in a row, and it's just been five 
people stumbling around trying to figure out what to do with the money," 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because city staff has not yet tallied a precise damage estimate, council 
members this week decided to postpone a decision on allocating the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they simply set out general priorities: Homeowners will get first 
dibs, and leftover funds will be used to repair masonry walls around housing 
tracts or along main streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alex Fiore dissented, arguing that the city should devote more 
resources to fixing tilted cement-block walls. "Someone could get hurt walking 
down the sidewalk if one of those walls topples," he said. "It's a health and 
safety issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who have suffered property damage are encouraged to file claims with 
the city. But the federal funds will be granted only to individuals who have 
exhausted other sources of money, including Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, the Small Business Administration and private insurance. Households 
with low to moderate incomes will probably receive priority, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the limited amount of money, Schillo warned residents not to expect too 
much. Council members have already received several pleas, Schillo said, adding 
that "it's not our responsibility to go out and promise everyone they'll get 
full funding." STEPHANIE SIMON

ANGELS SOAR WITH LEITER'S ARM, 8-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels signed him as an afterthought. He was simply a name on the waiver 
wire, and there was no guarantee he would last longer than a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In two months, starter Mark Leiter has not proved to be a godsend to the 
Angels, but he has personified the heart and soul of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, proving that good things do happen to good people, stymied yet another 
powerful lineup Wednesday night, enabling the Angels to defeat the Baltimore 
Orioles, 8-2, at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He inspires this whole team," said Angel left fielder Dwight Smith, who had 
three hits, scored two runs and drove in two runs. "It's very special to all of 
us to see what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember talking to him when he got back (from his son's memorial service). 
I told him how I lost my mom in '86, and that gave me inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "His son has given him that strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, whose 9-month-old son, Ryan, died April 4, says that he is inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, away from his wife and 3-year-old son for the first time since Ryan's 
death, has had difficulty with the separation during this trip. His phone bill 
is going to be expensive, he says, but it was going to be enjoyable recanting 
Wednesday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave the Orioles fits for eight innings, yielding only six hits and two 
runs. Leiter limited Baltimore's first seven hitters to three hits, and if not 
for Jeffrey Hammonds' two-run double in the fifth, might have had a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told myself before the game, 'If I give up two runs or less, I'm going to 
win,' " Leiter said. "I felt that confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I'm not surprised at all what I'm doing. If I said that, it's like 
saying, 'I shouldn't be here.' I've always believed in my ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the rest of the American League is starting to believe. Leiter, who has 
developed a split-finger fastball this season, is 2-0 with a 2.57 earned-run 
average, and the Angels have won all three of his starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question was whether the Angels would score enough runs. But once 
again in the ninth inning, the Angels scored six runs to break open a 2-2 tie. 
The Angels have scored 25 of 81 runs in the ninth this season, the most in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the ninth," said Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds, who haunted his 
former teammates by going three for four with two RBIs. "It's pressure. It's 
fun. It's exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, nobody gets paid for extra innings, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 45,851 sensed the game's outcome the moment Oriole Manager Johnny 
Oates went to the mound in the ninth with one out and Reynolds on first base. 
</P>
<P>
 They booed Oates, imploring him to leave starter Mike Mussina in the game. It 
didn't matter that Mussina already had thrown 121 pitches. They simply wanted 
no part of that bullpen, which excluding stopper Lee Smith, has a 10.27 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates ignored the crowd's sentiments and summoned Alan Mills (24.92 ERA). Gary 
DiSarcina hit Mills' first pitch into right field. Damion Easley walked, 
loading the bases. That brought up Smith, who lined a single into right field, 
scoring Reynolds and DiSarcina. Tim Salmon followed with a sacrifice fly. Chili 
Davis drove in another run with a single to center, knocking Mills out of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds greeted Brad Pennington with a single to center, scoring their 
fifth run. Chad Curtis walked. Greg Myers loaded the bases with an infield 
single. Reynolds walked, forcing in the sixth run. It finally ended when 
DiSarcina, the inning's 11th batter, popped up to second baseman Mark McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, the Angels (7-8) ended their three-game streak of one-run 
defeats and made one team look foolish for releasing Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful thing that I got released from the Tigers," Leiter said. "If 
I was still with the Tigers, I'm sure Sparky (Anderson) would have me in the 
bullpen by now like he has every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I was kind of hoping I'd get claimed by the Orioles because I spent 
my first five years in this organization, but I never made it to the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know, things have worked pretty good here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, this has been a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels couldn't agree more.

THIS TIME BUTLER'S BAT SAVES DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, Brett Butler did it with his glove. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, he did it with his bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours after making a game-saving catch in Philadelphia, Butler 
stroked five hits, including the game-winning single in the 11th, to beat the 
New York Mets, 6-5, at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler began Wednesday with a one-out triple and scored the first Dodger run. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hours and four hits later, he was back at the plate with the bases loaded 
and nobody out in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 1-1 pitch from Doug Linton, Butler hit a soft liner into left center. 
Although he was playing shallow, center fielder Ryan Thompson couldn't catch up 
to the hit, allowing Jose Offerman to score from third, bringing a roar from 
what was left of the crowd of 34,350. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell, the fourth Dodger pitcher of the night, got the win to improve 
to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dodgers were riding a high after coming back from a five-run deficit to 
beat the Philadelphia Phillies Tuesday, Butler did his best to sustain it. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who made the running backhanded catch in the ninth inning Tuesday to 
preserve the win, opened up Wednesday's game with a triple to right field and 
subsequently scored on Mike Piazza's sacrifice fly to center to give the 
Dodgers the lead in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it stayed until the Mets began teeing off on Dodger starter 
Kevin Gross in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 3.21 ERA and 21 strikeouts in 14 innings, Gross entered Wednesday's 
game without a decision this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he couldn't blame Wednesday's no-decision on lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
 New York rocked Gross for a pair of home runs in the fourth to take the lead, 
Joe Orsulak hitting his first of the season with nobody on and Thompson hitting 
his fourth with a man aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers showed some power of their own in striking back. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros collected his first homer of the season in the fifth and Henry 
Rodriguez evened the game in the sixth with a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 That inning might have been even bigger if things were going better for 
Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 The National League rookie of the year last season when he hit 35 home runs, 
Piazza came up in the sixth with two men aboard and hit a long fly down the 
left-field line that brought the fans to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, that ball might have fallen into the seats to the right of the 
foul pole in fair territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But all Piazza, who entered the game hitting .228 with two home runs, got for 
his effort was another bit of aggravation when the ball landed to the left of 
the pole in foul territory, by no more than a foot. Piazza then took a called 
third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied going into seventh, but Gross then gave up three singles, 
the last a line drive by Orsulak just past second baseman Delino DeShields to 
score pinch-hitter John Cangelosi. 
</P>
<P>
 On came Roger McDowell in relief of Gross, but he also gave up a single, to 
Jeff Kent, that drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth consecutive game the red-hot Kent has driven in at least one 
run, tying a club record. Kent began play with a .423 average, eight home runs, 
tied for the major league lead, and 22 RBIs, best in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent has all kinds of numbers he can boast about. He already has set a club 
record for RBIs in April, and his two hits Wednesday extended his hitting 
streak to nine games, a personal best. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite another productive night by Kent, the Dodgers were able to come 
back in the bottom of the seventh inning, and again, it was Butler supplying 
the spark. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, coming up with two men aboard, he smashed a ball off the shoulder 
of first baseman David Segui and on into right field to once again tie the 
score.

REYNA MAKES WINNING START IN 3-0 U.S. VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The talents of U.S. national team midfielder Claudio Reyna finally were 
unveiled Wednesday, and the setting could not have been more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson Field at Davidson College is where Reyna helped the University of 
Virginia win two of its three NCAA soccer championships. On Wednesday night, it 
became the setting for Reyna's first start for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The clamor for the 20-year-old to start had nearly deafened Coach Bora 
Milutinovic, who had remained Sphinx-like when it came to commenting on last 
season's college player of the year. Since Reyna joined the team amid much 
fanfare in January, his playing minutes have been parceled out in precious 
portions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Reyna's obvious talent in midfield, it became clear that Milutinovic's 
reserve was less about ability than humility -- let Reyna display the 
appropriate gratitude for being with the team. Break the college kid of his 
expectations to play every minute, and he'll begin to see the minutes in games. 
</P>
<P>
 When at last the shroud was lifted off the team's youngest player, it revealed 
a glittering prize. Such is Reyna's sense of time and place -- to say nothing 
of drama -- that he scored his first international goal in his first start. He 
sparked the U.S. team to a 3-0 victory over a suspiciously well-tanned team 
from Moldova. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their 1-1 tie against the U.S. team last week, the Moldovans, playing in 
their first international matches, apparently discovered their hotel's minibars 
and swimming pool. Their effort Wednesday night, in front of 4,790, was no 
match for their tenacity of last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither did the Americans field the same team. Starting were a handful of 
seldom-used players who comported themselves on the field as if they were 
fighting for their professional lives. As, indeed, they are. Each player is 
aware of the impending roster cuts, expected to come as early as next month. 
Some, like Reyna and the formerly injured Frank Klopas, have had little 
opportunity other than during practice to impress Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both made the most of their starts. Klopas scored the game's first goal, a 
long-range blast in the third minute. Reyna's goal came on a header in the 59th 
minute. And, enhancing the night's firsts, defender Mike Lapper scored his 
first international goal, off a rebound of a Reyna shot, in the 40th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Klopas' goal was his first since Sept. 4, 1991 and he called it "a gift from 
heaven." Some might argue that Reyna's is the true gift. After months of 
buildup and anticipation, Reyna did not fail to impress. His knack for holding 
the ball in the midfield and his ability to move quickly into space changes the 
landscape for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.S. staff has been guarded about lavishing praise on Reyna, lest 
he take his position for granted, no one could poor mouth his performance 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch his first move," said assistant coach Steve Sampson. "He explodes into 
space at the same time as he collects the ball. Other players get the ball, 
pause, then move. That's the difference with great midfielders. We are a 
totally different team with Claudio in." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna has learned to play the game, on and off the field, and after the match 
he talked about how he was happy just to get the start and hoped he wouldn't do 
anything to ruin his chances. But he knows, the players know and the coaches 
know. Now, everyone knows. The wraps have come off.

MORNING BRIEFING: PEANUT GALLERY ROASTS HER FOR THIS PITCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bonnie Blair, speedskating gold medalist, was taken to task by Newsweek 
magazine for "using her Olympic success as a platform for gushy, unrelenting 
product endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, a spokesperson for a peanut butter company, "scored a 9.9 in shilling 
during an appearance last week on NBC's 'Today' show," the magazine reported. 
"The plugfest began when Blair appeared holding a jar of the sandwich spread 
and wearing a shirt with the (company) logo on its turtleneck -- thus ensuring 
the brand name stayed on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the TV spot, she . . . racked up six product mentions." 
</P>
<P>
 Said "Today" host Katie Couric: "Honey, they are getting their money's worth 
from you this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for most free throws made during the 
playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney don't surf: He wears No. 50 in honor of his native Hawaii and enjoys 
hanging out at the beach and scuba diving. But pitcher Sid Fernandez of the 
Baltimore Orioles no longer body surfs after surviving a brush with disaster at 
the famous, but precarious, break known as Sandy Beach on Oahu seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to kick out of a wave, and it slammed me right into the ground," 
Fernandez told the Baltimore Sun. "I crashed headfirst into the sand, and I 
thought for sure I had broken my neck. I thought that was it. It really scared 
me, and I haven't surfed since." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow time: Jay Leno, on President Clinton's excitement over the Olympic team's 
recent visit to the White House: "He saw those red, white and blue jackets and 
he thought -- 'Oh! The Domino's Pizza guy is here!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Swept away: Wrote Lyle Spencer of the Riverside Press-Enterprise, after 
opening night at The Diamond, home of the Lake Elsinore Storm of the Class-A 
California League: "This cozy little ballpark by the lake is part Ebbets Field, 
part Fenway Park and all joy. Shelter for the Storm is sanctuary for the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxygen debt: Jackie MacMullan of the Boston Globe wrote of the surprising 
success of the Chicago Bulls: "For Chicago, winning the East would be a 
stunning statement: You can keep on breathing without Air." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Jerry West, with 1,213, 163 more than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Shawn Boskie, traded recently from the Chicago Cubs to the 
Philadelphia Phillies and owner of a 19-30 record: "I fully expect to some day 
be the best pitcher in baseball." JERRY CROWE

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; ROOKIE GOALIE BLANKS SHARKS FOR 4-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detroit rookie goaltender Chris Osgood, making his first appearance in an NHL 
playoff game, gave the Red Wings the boost they needed in their 4-0 victory 
over the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday at Detroit to even their best-of-seven 
Western Conference series at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first playoff shutout by a rookie Detroit goalie since Terry 
Sawchuk shut out Montreal in 1951. But it was Osgood's second shutout of the 
Sharks this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew this afternoon that I was going to play," Osgood, 21, said. "And I was 
excited because I've never played in a playoff game before. But I knew I had to 
just go out there and play and not worry about the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Burr gave the Red Wings a 1-0 lead in the second period. Bob Probert, 
Dino Ciccarelli and Nicklas Lidstrom each scored goals in the first 6:43 of the 
third period to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 During the regular season, Osgood appeared in 41 games for Detroit and had a 
23-8-5 record while giving up 2.86 goals per game. 
</P>
<P>
 The series shifts to San Jose for the next three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 4, St. Louis 2 -- Mike Modano slid a rebound under Curtis Joseph 2:58 
into the third period for his second goal to lead the Stars to victory at 
Dallas and take a 2-0 lead in their first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked for our goals," said Dallas Coach Bob Gainey, referring to the 
Stars' 51 shots. "We had to get around him often enough. On a night when we 
have a little more good luck, then maybe they'll go in more easily." 
</P>
<P>
 The series returns to St. Louis on Friday with the Blues still trying to 
figure out how to defeat Dallas goalie Darcy Wakaluk, who won for the second 
time as veteran Andy Moog watched from the Stars' bench. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis seemed to be behind all night, forcing Joseph to make stop after 
stop to keep Dallas from running away. The Stars outshot the Blues, 51-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 7, Vancouver 5 -- Al MacInnis had two goals and three assists and Joe 
Nieuwendyk scored twice at Calgary as the Flames tied their Western Conference 
NHL playoff series, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 MacInnis' five points set a Flames' record for points in a playoff game. The 
previous high was four held by several players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames did everything they didn't when the Canucks defeated them, 5-0, on 
Monday. Calgary scored four times on the power play and once shorthanded. 
Goaltender Mike Vernon also made key saves when needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sullivan, German Titov and Theoren Fleury also scored for the Flames, who 
for the fifth consecutive year won the second game of the opening round of the 
playoffs after losing the series opener. The series will return to Vancouver 
for two games Friday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 1, Chicago 0 -- Todd Gill scored 2:15 into overtime and Felix Potvin 
out-dueled Ed Belfour in a goaltending battle at Toronto, as the Maple Leafs 
took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference series that resumes 
with Games 3 and 4 in Chicago this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago has lost 10 consecutive playoff games, including a four-game sweep by 
Pittsburgh in the 1992 Stanley Cup final and a first-round 1993 sweep by St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared that nobody would score as Potvin and Belfour took turns 
frustrating their opponents.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Moorer should be considered dangerous. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 All punchers are. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, any checklist for the heavyweight title fight Friday night at Caesars 
Palace in Las Vegas would give the edge to champion Evander Holyfield in 
determination, big-time experience, heart, conditioning and chin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time in a while that Holyfield will be fighting someone his 
own size. He usually looks up to people in the ring but will be eye to eye with 
Moorer at 6 feet 2. They each weighed 214 pounds Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer is the first left-hander to oppose Holyfield since he dispatched one 
Jesse Shelby in the third round eight years ago in Corpus Christi, Tex. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other southpaws have challenged for the heavyweight title, both times 
in Germany against Muhammad Ali. Karl Mildenberger went in the 12th round in 
Frankurt in 1966, and Richard Dunn in the fifth in Munich in 1976. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield probably will get the job done before the limit Friday and then face 
Lennox Lewis for the undisputed championship in November, providing that Lewis 
defeats Phil Jackson as expected May 6 in Atlantic City. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A year after his first retirement, Holyfield is talking about working until 
1996 and anticipating a mega-bucks bout against Mike Tyson just before the 
Olympic Games in his hometown of Atlanta. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One punch from Moorer could spoil the plans, but if he doesn't pull a 
surprise, Michael should try baseball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That sport, you know, is in dire need of hard-throwing southpaws. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Something must be wrong with the marketing of baseball when its best player, 
Barry Bonds, can't crack the list of the nation's 10 most popular athletes. . . 
. 
</P>

NBA ROUNDUP; O'NEAL SCORES 53 IN BARELY THREE QUARTERS 
</P>

<P>
 It didn't matter if it was a dunk, a turnaround jumper or a hook. It seemed 
like Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal couldn't miss and the Minnesota Timberwolves 
would never find a way to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who took over the NBA scoring lead from San Antonio's David Robinson, 
had 34 in the first half and finished with a league-high 53 Wednesday to lead 
the Magic to a 121-101 victory at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just had dunk after dunk after dunk," Minnesota Coach Sidney Lowe said. 
"If he gets the ball inside as close as he was getting it, then there's nothing 
you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who sat out the last 9:13 of the game, made 22 of 31 shots and nine of 
13 free throws. He also had 18 rebounds and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 117, Washington 111 -- Dell Curry scored eight points in a 9-0 run 
in the final minutes as the Hornets kept their playoff hopes alive with a 
victory at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning had 25 points and 12 rebounds for the Hornets, who still trail 
Miami by 1 1/2 games in the race for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 109, Cleveland 98 -- Reggie Miller scored eight of his 29 points in 
the final four minutes at Indianapolis as the Pacers moved into a tie with the 
Cavaliers for fifth place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had four three-point baskets for Indiana, which has an advantage over 
the Cavaliers in the first playoff tiebreaker by owning a 3-2 advantage in the 
season series. Cleveland's John Williams had 22 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 103, Detroit 78 -- Lee Mayberry scored a career-high 19 points as 
the Bucks ended a nine-game losing streak with a victory over the Pistons in a 
battle between the Eastern Conference's two worst teams at Milwaukee.

LAKERS LOSE RECORD 8TH IN ROW; PRO BASKETBALL: PEELER LEFT UNFULFILLED BECAUSE 
OF INJURY AS SUPERSONICS INCREASE L.A.'S WOES, 112-90. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The season that wasn't is nearing the end for Anthony Peeler, the Lakers' 
leading scorer until last week but hardly a leading man. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been on the injured list since Jan. 21 because of a stress fracture in 
his left leg, which came after opening the season on the injured list because 
of tendinitis in his right knee, which came after missing much of training camp 
because of the same ailment. Which is why, after a promising rookie campaign, 
his second season has been one giant pain in the potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating," Peeler said Wednesday night at the Forum, where the 
Seattle SuperSonics sent the Lakers to a club-record eighth consecutive loss, 
112-90, before 15,283. "I had so many expectations in the summertime. I wanted 
to do well for the team and myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets frustrating because I wanted to play real bad. Now I just try to stay 
mentally focused and learn a lot about what other people are doing. I try to 
make my game better that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, he managed to sneak in 30 appearances, all starts, and average 14.1 
points, good enough to pace the Lakers before Vlade Divac recently moved ahead. 
In between, the Lakers went through three other starting shooting guards -- 
Sedale Threatt, Tony Smith and Doug Christie -- and Peeler had to be content 
watching from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our best creator," Coach Magic Johnson said. "He's the guy who can get 
his own shot without having someone set a pick or anything. Anthony is probably 
the most talented guy on the team. There's the one problem -- health." 
</P>
<P>
 With Nick Van Exel back but out of the starting lineup after missing Tuesday's 
game at Denver because of flu, Johnson opened with Threatt at the point and 
Christie at shooting guard. Threatt responded with a game-high 28 points, 
Christie had 16 and James Edwards, starting in place of the injured Divac, 
added 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp led the SuperSonics, who have clinched the best record in the 
league and home-court advantage through the playoffs, with 23 points, 21 of 
them coming in the first half. Ricky Pierce contributed 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The season might be over for Vlade Divac. X-rays taken Wednesday confirmed he 
suffered nothing more serious than a sprain in the fourth quarter the night 
before at Denver, but he didn't play against the SuperSonics, his first miss 
since February of 1992, and has already been declared out for Saturday's game 
at Golden State. That leaves the Sunday afternoon season finale against Utah at 
the Forum, and the Lakers list him as hopeful. . . . Antonio Harvey, released 
after three nights in the hospital, attended the game and said doctors gave him 
a clean bill of health despite failing to determine what forced him out of 
Saturday's game against the Clippers with an irregular heartbeat. "If I wasn't 
on the injured list, I could play right now," the rookie forward said. "They 
said they couldn't find anything abnormal with my heartbeat, the heart rhythms, 
anything." Harvey will wear a monitor when he practices this summer -- he may 
spend a few days next week with Magic Johnson and his touring team -- so 
doctors can see what effect that has. Otherwise, he feels back to normal after 
a scary situation. "I thought about those guys -- Hank Gathers, Reggie Lewis," 
he said. "Of course those things come to mind. That's why I said something." . 
. . No Los Angeles Laker team had ever lost eight in a row before this. Where 
that ranks in franchise history is not immediately known because records from 
the Minneapolis days are hard to research.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: GURNEY TESTING CARS OF FUTURE WITH EYE ON INDY CAR 
CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Gurney helped lead a group of Indy car owners who broke with the U.S. Auto 
Club in 1978 and formed what became Championship Auto Racing Teams to oversee 
all races except the Indianapolis 500, which remained under USAC's control. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Gurney is an interested observer as Tony George, president of 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has started another possible Indy car civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, George resigned from the CART board, declaring his dissatisfaction 
with Indy car racing's direction. He also said he would establish a schedule 
and rules for a new series of races that would include the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
 George refused to divulge details, saying he did not want to detract from the 
May 29 Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder if he's still not thinking out his plan," said Gurney, who is 
involved in creating a Toyota Indy car to race in 1996. "He and Johnny Capels 
(USAC director of competition) were here at All American Racers not long ago, 
talking about the future of Indy cars. Tony was quite vague about the whole 
thing, asking more questions than giving answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that whatever happens is critical to me, my 90 employees at AAR 
and to Toyota, but he didn't give a hint as to what to expect. I'll be as 
anxious as everyone else to hear his next message." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Manuel Fangio II and P.J. Jones, Gurney's two drivers who dominated 
International Motor Sports Assn. Camel GT competition the last two seasons, are 
testing partial prototypes of what will be a Toyota Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, while Fangio was driving in the pro-celebrity race at Long 
Beach, Jones was testing a '93 Lola, with a Judd engine modified in the Toyota 
Racing Development shops in Torrance, on the company's 10-mile oval test track 
near Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "While TRD is working to develop a competitive Indy car engine in Torrance, 
All American Racers has a design crew in Santa Ana creating a new Eagle," 
Gurney said. "We want to develop both the engine and the chassis at the same 
time, so as one progresses, we'll know right where we stand with the other." 
</P>
<P>
 To help develop the new chassis, Toyota and AAR added a moving ground-plane 
wind tunnel to the plant in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the latest state-of-the-art wind tunnel," Gurney said. "It has a rolling 
road that travels beneath the model to simulate a car at speed on a racetrack 
so we can measure the downforce and drag and come up with the best balance." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Toyota IMSA car retired, Fangio and Jones are ready for a full 
testing program. Already they have run at Laguna Seca, Phoenix, Sebring, Fla., 
and Firebird Raceway in Chandler, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to develop a base line that we can use later on," Jones said. "Dan is 
keeping both Juan and me busy, which is good for us too. There is nothing like 
seat-time in a car to keep a driver sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 Fangio also was one of three drivers in the winning turbocharged Toyota MR2 at 
the Bathehurst 12-hour race in Australia on April 2. It was the second year in 
a row that Fangio was a winner. Jones was scheduled to take a fling at NASCAR 
Winston Cup racing, but dropped out before the Daytona 500 after a dispute with 
the car owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what Tony (George) has up his sleeve, but if it turns out to be 
for the best in racing, I'm all for it," Gurney said. "I'd just like to know 
for sure what direction our new Toyota Eagle should take. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell the sport is growing with the coming of Honda and Reynard and 
now Mercedes-Benz into Indy cars. I was elated to hear that Mercedes is coming 
back. They haven't been in Indy car racing since 1915, and their presence will 
be a major plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph DePalma won the Indy 500 in a Mercedes-Benz in 1915, the last year the 
German manufacturer was represented. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercedes nameplate will appear on the Ilmor-developed pushrod stock-block 
engines in three cars entered by Roger Penske. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes: 
</P>
<P>
 MIDGETS -- The final night of ESPN's Saturday Night Thunder series at Ventura 
Raceway will be Saturday with the last two winners, Billy Boat and Tony 
Stewart, expected to resume their rivalry against the U.S. Auto Club's western 
regional drivers. Racing will begin at 5:30 p.m. to accommodate TV, with a TQ 
midget program to follow the main event. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- The 41st NASCAR Winston West season will open Saturday night at 
Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield with the $45,000 California 200. Ron Hornaday 
Jr., two-time Southwest Tour champion from Palmdale, will be in the Spears 
Motor Sports Chevrolet Lumina driven to championships in 1991 and 1993 by Bill 
Sedgwick, who is now the crew chief. . . . NASCAR Grand Americans will be 
featured Saturday night at Saugus Speedway, with sportsman cars in the 
spotlight at Cajon Speedway in El Cajon. . . . Modifieds and dwarf cars will 
run Sunday at Kern County Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- Overshadowed by the powerful Penske domination of the Toyota 
Grand Prix of Long Beach last Sunday were two fine performances by rookie 
drivers in their first Indy car race. Robbie Flock of Los Angeles went from 
29th to 13th and Franck Freon of France went from 27th to 12th. . . . Drivers 
often do their best in front of a hometown crowd, but Robby Gordon, who 
finished third at Long Beach, said the presence of friends and family from 
Orange might have hampered him. "I think it slowed me down a little bit too 
much," Gordon said. "I didn't want to make any mistakes in front of all those 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- Costa Mesa Speedway will hold its third 25-race program of 
speedway racing Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds track. . . . 
Southern California's other three speedway tracks will open next month, Glen 
Helen Park on May 4, Lake Perris on May 5 and Speedway USA in Victorville on 
May 7. . . . The U.S. qualifying round for the world speedway championships 
will be at Ventura Raceway on May 21. . . . The Sacramento Mile, second round 
of the Grand National dirt track season, will be run Saturday night at the 
Cal-Expo. Chris Carr, winner of the opening race at Daytona Beach, Fla., and 
Scott Parker, last year's Sacramento winner, are favored. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- The Golden State Challenge series for winged sprint cars will 
be at Santa Maria Speedway on Saturday night. . . . Sprint Car Racing Assn. 
drivers will make their only Northern California appearance this weekend, 
racing Friday night at Antioch Speedway and Saturday night at San Jose Speedway 
before returning to Imperial Raceway in El Centro on April 30. . . . The SCRA 
has set up a fund to help Mike Sweeney, 36, who suffered multiple injuries to 
both knees and his right ankle when he flipped through the fence at Manzanita 
Speedway on April 9. Contributions can be sent to Sweeney Recovery Fund, SCRA, 
9723 Washburn Rd., Downey CA90241. 
</P>
<P>
 OFF ROAD -- The fourth round of the Mickey Thompson stadium series is 
scheduled for Saturday night at Sam Boyd Silver Bowl in Las Vegas. . . . The 
Spangler 200, a La Rana Desert Racing event, will start at 9 a.m. Saturday,

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CLEMENS RETURNS TO FORM WITH SHUTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox pitched a two-hitter and struck out 10 
Wednesday night to out-duel Steve Karsay and get his first shutout in nearly a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens gave up only a leadoff single to Stan Javier in the fourth and a 
one-out single to Mike Brumley in the fifth as the Red Sox defeated the Oakland 
Athletics, 2-0, at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Clemens' 36th shutout, the first since May 11 at Baltimore. He recorded 
10 strikeouts for the 55th time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if down the road I'd be afforded the opportunity to finish," 
Clemens (2-0) said. "I needed to smell the finish line. I think if I let a guy 
on in the ninth, I was out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Karsay (1-1), a rookie who began the game with the American League's best 
earned-run average at 0.60., matched Clemens in strikeouts and scoreless 
innings until the seventh, when he gave up both runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him in Yankee Stadium growing up," said Karsay, 22, who grew up in New 
York. "But it was a little different seeing him from the dugout than seeing him 
from the stands, especially the way he was throwing." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Texas 3 -- Pat Borders hit a two-out single in the 11th inning to 
score John Olerud and lift the Blue Jays at Toronto to their fourth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Olerud and Carlos Delgado worked Tom Henke (1-1) for consecutive one-out walks 
before Ed Sprague bounced into a fielder's choice, sending Olerud to third. 
Borders followed with a single, handing the Rangers their fourth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stewart gave up one run and seven hits in seven innings, but Todd 
Stottlemyre (2-0) gained the victory by yielding one hit over 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 11, Detroit 6 -- Gary Gaetti hit two home runs and tied a career 
high with six runs batted in as the Royals won for the sixth time in seven 
games by defeating the Tigers at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaetti, who had three hits, hit a three-run homer off Jose Lima in the second 
and added a three-run shot in the fifth off Bill Krueger. Lima (0-1), making 
his first major league start, gave up five hits and six runs in four innings. 
David Cone (2-1) yielded five runs and nine hits in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 8, Milwaukee 6 -- Tim Raines had three singles and walked four times 
to tie an American League record by reaching base seven times in a game without 
making an out and Julio Franco singled home the go-ahead run in the 12th inning 
at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 7, Seattle 4 -- After struggling to score against Randy Johnson for 
seven innings, the Yankees broke through for four runs in the eighth inning 
against Bobby Ayala (1-1) at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees managed only three runs against Johnson despite having 15 runners. 
But they took advantage of two misplayed bunts, three walks and an error, to 
rally in the eighth.  
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 6, Cleveland 5 -- The Indians' Steve Farr (0-1) walked in a run with 
the bases loaded and defensive replacement Wayne Kirby made a fielding error 
that allowed the winning run as the Twins rallied for two runs in the ninth 
inning at Minneapolis.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUBS' HOME LOSING STREAK CONTINUES, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their frustrations mounting after a record-tying eighth consecutive loss at 
Wrigley Field, the Chicago Cubs made some noise Wednesday. Most of it, though, 
was off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry shouts and profanities, originating from a weight room, resounded 
through the Chicago clubhouse after a 7-5 loss to the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the players involved was shortstop Shawon Dunston, who did not play 
Wednesday. Back problems have caused Dunston to miss most of the last two 
seasons. He had been told a day earlier by Manager Tom Trebelhorn he would not 
play to rest his back. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Dunston could be heard yelling: "Get off me. Get off me. . . . 
Don't push me." However, there were no signs of a scuffle. Dunston, who refused 
to comment on the incident, might have been responding to needling. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's eighth consecutive home loss to open the season ties a club record 
set in 1957. The Cubs have lost six in a row overall and 10 of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not winning games and I'm getting a little sick of us not playing up to 
our potential," said catcher Rick Wilkins, whose eighth-inning throwing error 
helped Houston score twice and break a 5-5 tie. "If you play well and get beat, 
that's one thing. But we're not. It's frustrating. We've got to stop making the 
stupid mistakes we're making and play fundamental baseball. We're not doing 
that right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 16, Florida 6 -- Andres Galarraga drove in five runs with two home 
runs and Ellis Burks knocked in four runs with a homer and double to lead the 
Rockies at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies had 16 hits, nine for extra bases, with Burks, the NL's leading 
hitter (.469), putting the Rockies ahead, 2-0, in the second with a two-run 
homer off Marlin starter Pat Rapp, who had not given up a home run in his 
previous 58 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Barry Bonds' two-run single in the fifth 
inning helped Bill Swift to his third victory as the Giants defeated the 
Phillies at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift (3-1), who started with an 0.42 earned-run average, gave up a leadoff 
home run to Lenny Dykstra, and yielded three runs, five hits and walked four in 
6 2/3 innings. Mike Jackson got the final four outs for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 8, Atlanta 3 -- The Braves lost consecutive games for the first time 
since last Aug., giving up a three-run home run to Todd Zeile and a two-run 
homer to Ray Lankford at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury (4-0) became the National League's first four-game winner. Tom 
Glavine (2-1) gave up three runs and eight hits in five innings, struck out six 
and walked five. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- Pittsburgh remained the major leagues' only 
winless road team as Hal Morris drove in five runs, matching his career high at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris drove in three runs off Paul Wagner (1-2), then singled home two 
go-ahead runs in the seventh off Jeff Ballard. Pittsburgh is 0-5 on the road

EMPIRE LEAGUE BASEBALL; IMPROBABLE KATELLA NOW ALONE IN FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would have been easy for Katella Coach Tim McMenamin to savor the Knights' 
7-3 victory over El Dorado on Wednesday. But he's a worrying man, right down to 
those sorry-looking, worn-out cleats he wears as superstition. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, McMenamin should enjoy the moment. The victory left the Knights 
(12-6-1, 6-2) in sole possession of first place in the Empire League. By 
handling the Golden Hawks (13-6, 5-3) at El Dorado, Katella ran its unbeaten 
streak to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a long way to go still," McMenamin said. "I'm not going to count on 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Knights' fifth consecutive league victory got them a step closer to 
their first championship since 1981, something that even amazes their coach. 
After all, this was a team that had only three starters back and was going to 
depend heavily on two things -- unproven juniors and Jaret Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 That the juniors were league champions as freshmen and on the junior varsity 
last season helped. That Wright, a senior, was considered the top prospect in 
Orange County helped even more. The Knights got a lift from the both Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was hardly sharp. He walked seven batters but also struck out nine. 
Wright (5-1) closed the game with authority, striking out the last two batters 
with runners on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggled in the middle innings," Wright said. "But when you get to the 
last inning, you can smell a victory. You dig deep and go after them." 
</P>
<P>
 Two juniors put Wright and the Knights in that position. Drake Gustafson had a 
two-run double and Mike Villegas hit a two-run single to key a six-run fifth 
inning that gave the Knights a 7-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage came with El Dorado ace Don Jamieson watching. Jamieson (8-1) took 
a 2-1 lead into the fifth, but was pulled with one out and a runner on first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don was getting behind on the count and he wasn't getting the ball over," El 
Dorado Coach Steve Gullotti said. "I wanted to get someone in there who would 
throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Posien came in and walked three batters in the inning. The pitches he 
did get over the plate were hit hard. Gustafson's double gave the Knights a 3-2 
lead. Villegas' single gave them breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright took it from there, striking out five in the final three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 3, Los Alamitos 2 -- Jason Webb singled home two runs with no outs 
in the bottom of the seventh to give host Esperanza (9-8, 4-5) the victory.

SEA VIEW LEAGUE BASEBALL; SANTA MARGARITA RALLIES TO TIE TUSTIN FOR FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FORREST LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overlooked? Santa Margarita Coach Tip LeFebvre believes so. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-run rally in the sixth inning propelled host Santa Margarita to a 7-5 
Sea View League baseball victory over Tustin and into a first-place tie with 
the sixth-ranked Tillers. Both teams are 6-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Reightley's two-run double with two outs in the sixth drove in Paul 
Nicotra and pinch-runner Lou Manera for the winning run. Robbie Redwitz added 
an RBI single to cap the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin, ranked No. 2 in Division III with a 14-5 record, had entered the game 
as one of the county's hottest teams, winning 10 of its last 11 games and all 
six in league. Santa Margarita has been hot of late, too, LeFebvre said, but it 
hadn't attracted as much attention, particularly after a 1-6 start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't understand . . . we've played Brea-Olinda, Fountain Valley, 
Marina twice, Edison, San Clemente and Troy," said LeFebvre, whose team won its 
sixth in a row and improved to 10-7 overall. "We've played the top teams to be 
ready for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Looks were deceiving early against Tustin, too. Ryan Winmill's three-run homer 
to left off Ed Dryden in the first gave Tustin a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles cut the gap to 3-2 with a run each in the first and second innings. 
Tustin increased it to 5-2 in the third on a sacrifice fly by Rick Gonzalez and 
Jeff Cunningham's run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicotra and Barry Hawkins each had RBI singles in the fifth, scoring Brian 
Griffin and Chris Collins to slice Tustin's lead to 5-4. Two batters later, 
Reightley, who was two for three with two doubles and two RBIs, doubled to 
left-center for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 4, Corona del Mar 2 (8 innings) -- Geoff Noisy's two-run single in the 
eighth gave Irvine (10-10, 3-4) the come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 7, Woodbridge 6 (9 innings) -- Eddie Mejia's leadoff ninth-inning 
home run gave Saddleback (10-8-1, 4-3) the victory. Mejia finished with three 
hits and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 University 4, Newport Harbor 1 -- Tim Blackbrun pitched a two-hitter and 
struck out seven, as University (1-6 in league) won its first league game of 
the season.

GYMNASTICS / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; MILLER IS BACK IN THE RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shannon Miller, defending world champion in the all-around, rebounded from a 
disappointing opening day during Wednesday's World Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 17, from Edmond, Okla., qualified second behind teammate Dominique 
Dawes in the beam event and third behind Romania's Lavinia Milosovici and Dawes 
in the floor exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an improvement after Tuesday, when she was fourth in qualifying for the 
vault and missed out on a place in the final of the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Nunno, U.S. coach, said Miller has made spectacular progress since 
suffering a pulled stomach muscle last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shannon's getting better every day," he said. "By Friday, everyone will see 
her back in top form. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to come back slowly, but a metamorphosis has taken place over the last 
two weeks with Shannon's performances."

PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; MATER DEI SERVES NOTICE WITH 3-0 VICTORY OVER EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Toro coaches tip-toed around the idea that the Mater Dei game was any more 
important than the others on the Chargers' South Coast League schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 But after El Toro's 3-0 loss, it was pretty evident: The Mater Dei game is 
crucial to any team's championship hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-ranked Monarchs (14-3, 3-0) made that clear by beating pitcher Misty 
Lauby (11-5) and winning for the 10th time in their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also stopped the county's longest winning streak at six. El Toro 
fell to 14-8, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wasted a great pitching performance by Misty," said El Toro Coach Jim 
Daugherty, who watched Lauby strike out nine and give up seven hits. "You know 
exactly what they're going to do -- use their speed, their daring and 
aggressiveness, and if you aren't up to the task, you get steamrolled." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers got flattened in the fourth inning. Patty Godwin was hit by a 
pitch, and an error on Candace Kollen's bunt put runners at first and third. 
Kollen stole second base, her 25th of the year, and Margaret Hollis singled 
down the left-field line to make it 2-0. Lauby escaped further damage by 
striking out the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei added a run in the sixth inning when Kollen singled, stole second 
and eventually scored on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Chargers had trouble mounting a threat against Godwin (11-2) 
and her defense. She pitched a four-hitter and struck out two. Only one batter 
got past first base, but Kim Martin was thrown out at third after rounding the 
bag too wide on the second of Dana Gulick's two singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's Michelle Zerucha was on the only other player with two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great win because we beat a quality team on their field with a 
great pitcher," Monarch Coach Doug Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hollis, who is batting .400: "We faced them like we faced all our games; 
we came out ready to play." MARTIN HENDERSON

Hills in a Freeway League baseball game Wednesday at Sunny Hills.

sixth and tripled in the seventh. Glenn, who hit his first two homers of the 
season Friday, finished with three runs batted in and two runs scored.

stolen bases and drove in a run for Buena Park (10-6, 6-2).

CRESPI HAS 3 HITS, 9 ERRORS, NO CHANCE IN 12-3 SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crespi's baseball team couldn't do anything right in Wednesday's 12-3 Mission 
League loss to Notre Dame at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celts went through five pitchers and changed their batting order, but 
nothing could compensate for sloppy defense and lack of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi (12-6-1, 4-3) committed nine errors and managed only three hits off 
Notre Dame left-hander Rich Igou, who pitched a complete game and improved to 
5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got holes in our game and when you find them we're in a lot of trouble 
and they found them all today," Crespi Coach Scott Muckey said. "It kind of 
makes you wonder how we won 12 (games) this season."  
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (12-4, 6-1) scored in each of the first six innings. The Knights 
had 11 hits, seven off starter Sam Clemons (5-3), who gave up six earned runs 
in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really hit the ball well today and we haven't been lately," Notre Dame 
Coach Tom Dill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things couldn't have gone better for us as far as swinging the bat."  
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame outfielder Justin Bunch went three for four with two runs batted in 
and Ryan Benner went two for three with two RBIs. Joey Orlando also had two 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights opened the scoring in the first when Bunch drove in Orlando with a 
single to center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame scored two more in the second and four in a lengthy third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Jerkens singled home Jon Lichterman and Ryan Benner's triple to center 
drove in Chris Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame got its last two runs of the inning on Crespi errors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights scored solo runs in the fourth and fifth, capping their scoring 
with a three-run sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Clemons) was not getting any help out there," Muckey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he was totally on, but we might have been in it if he got some 
help."  
</P>
<P>
 Crespi got all its hits and its second run in the fourth inning, which 
included singles by Rich Gonzalez and Brad Farlow and an RBI double by Mike 
Glendenning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celts' other runs resulted from an error in the second inning and a 
bases-loaded walk in the fifth.

NEWBURY PARK'S SMITH LEAVES ROYAL WITHOUT MUCH CHOICE, 8-2; HIGH SCHOOL 
BASEBALL: PANTHER ACE STRIKES OUT NINE, SEVEN LOOKING, TO PICK UP HIS FIRST 
MARMONTE LEAGUE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guessing sometimes works on multiple-choice exams. But at bat with two 
strikes, it's usually not such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for a curveball and watch a fastball go whizzing by for strike three and 
you're likely to look pretty silly, likely to look like the Royal High baseball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park's Keith Smith struck out nine Highlanders in the Panthers' 8-2 
Marmonte League victory on Wednesday, and seven of them went down with bats on 
their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they really were looking for certain pitches and (pitching coach John 
Marsden) had 'em guessing," Newbury Park Coach Gary Fabricius said. "When they 
were looking for a fastball, they got a curve. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you need a horse on the mound. It doesn't matter what pitches you call if 
he can't throw them for strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Smith's strikeouts came on fastballs on the outside corner, but he was 
also fooling Royal hitters with a good curve and a changeup. He walked two in 
the first inning, but got out of a bases-loaded jam when catcher Jeff Bennett 
picked off Maki Kramer at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Smith cruised while his teammates built him a sizable cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I just felt I was really hitting my spots," Smith said. "I hadn't been 
doing that since . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Since Ray (Clinton) started taking all my wins." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (4-1) picked up his first league victory in four starts. Although the 
first-place Panthers (14-4, 7-0 in league play) have won all four of those 
games, Clinton picked up the victories in relief in the first three. Smith left 
two of them with a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right after the game," catcher Jeff Bennett said, "the first thing (Smith) 
said to me was, 'Finally, a complete game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith gave up six hits and walked four, but those numbers are misleading. He 
might easily have taken a no-hitter into the seventh. None of the four hits he 
surrendered in the first six innings left the infield. Three were routine 
ground balls to shortstop Matt Cassaro, who simply took too long to get the 
ball to first base. The other was a chopper that Clinton, playing third base, 
stopped but could not pick up. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Egan, with two infield singles, was Royal's leading hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't come close to hitting the ball until the last two innings and 
by then it was too late," said Coach Dan Maye of Royal (11-6, 4-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park jumped to a lead in the second inning on Clinton's two-out, 
two-run single against David Vicari (1-3). In the third inning, Bennett drove 
in a run with a single and Kes Anderson drove in two more with a double, giving 
the Panthers a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Collins led the Panthers' 11-hit attack with a double and two singles. 
He scored three runs and had an RBI. Shawn Adams and Clinton each had two hits, 
with Clinton driving in three.

PREP NOTES: UNIVERSITY'S ZEIGLER IS HEADED TO CORNELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 University's Demitrius Zeigler, Orange County's leading scorer the last two 
seasons, announced Wednesday that he will play basketball at Cornell next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 He will not sign a letter of intent; Ivy League schools don't offer athletic 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler, a 6-foot-3 guard, was a first-team All-Orange County selection last 
season. He averaged 25.9 points and 8.3 rebounds in helping the Trojans reach 
the Southern Section I-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler set the University record with a 46-point performance against San 
Pedro. He made 10 three-pointers in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Elfman, whose girls' soccer teams at Santa Margarita have won the Sea 
View League title and lost in the first round of the section Division I 
playoffs the past two years, has resigned his walk-on position, Athletic 
Director Richard Schaaf announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfman, whose teams were 30-8-9 in his two seasons as varsity coach, said 
coaching conflicted with his work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Mariano, a 6-3 outside hitter for the El Toro boys' volleyball team, has 
accepted a scholarship from Long Beach State, Charger Coach Mike Jagd 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano leads El Toro, currently the county's No. 1 team and ranked second in 
section Division I, in kills (149), digs (58) and aces (72). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Tyus, a 5-4 defensive specialist for the Laguna Beach girls' 
volleyball team, has signed a letter of intent at Colorado, Artist Coach Mike 
Soylular announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyus, who led her team in digs and aces, will join former Artist teammate 
Rachel Wacholder at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe Linsey, Calvary Chapel's 6-5 center who averaged 24.7 points and 14.1 
rebounds, has said she will enroll at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 In other signings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- La Quinta's Linda Rodriguez, a guard who averaged 21.5 points and made 72 
three-point baskets, will attend Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Susan Flaming, whose 10.7 assists per game helped Cypress reach the 
Division II-A semifinals, will attend Biola. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Estancia's Laura Czingula will attend La Verne. Czingula, a 5-10 forward, 
averaged 15 points and 10.8 rebounds for the Eagles, who reached the Division 
III-A girls' semifinals.

PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; ESTANCIA NOT UP TO CHALLENGE AS LAGUNA BEACH SWEEPS TO 
VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was supposed to be the match that Estancia, ranked ninth in Orange 
County, would prove it could challenge Laguna Beach, perennial league favorite, 
for the Pacific Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Estancia entered the match unbeaten, the Eagles had not seen a team 
with as many weapons as the Artists, who pounded their way to an easy 15-6, 
15-10, 15-3 victory Wednesday at Estancia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Styles had 16 kills and Szilard Kovacs had 10 kills and five blocks for 
Laguna Beach (8-0, 5-0 in league), the second-ranked team in Orange County. 
Estancia fell to 9-1, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the score was lopsided, the match was closer than it appeared and 
gave Estancia Coach Dave Castle cause for hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia was tied with Laguna Beach, 5-5, in Game 1 before the Artists scored 
10 of the last 11 points. In Game 2, Estancia led, 10-7, before Laguna Beach 
won the final eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Estancia wins that game, they know they are in the match," Laguna Beach 
Coach Michael Soylular said. "This is the best I've seen Estancia in the past 
four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Castle: "We're terribly disappointed because we knew we had an 
opportunity to beat them. Take nothing away from Laguna Beach, they're a 
tremendous team and their passing was superior, but I think we're pretty much 
equal with them in any other area." 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia's Dave White had 15 kills and Mike Truong added seven despite playing 
with the flu. While both demonstrated explosive spiking ability, the Eagles' 
poor passing made it tough for setter Dave Earle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ball control, that's the name of the game," Soylular said. "Everybody can 
hit, but if you get good serving, some good digs and you control the tempo, 
that will make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Having top-flight players doesn't hurt either. Kovacs, a 6-9 middle blocker 
from Hungary, has signed with USC. His presence gave the Eagles' hitters 
problems all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach setter Kurt Nelson finished with 47 assists, spreading it around 
evenly. Beau Bianchi had 11 kills, Trevor Whalley eight, and Justin Maison six.

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 4 RUNS IN NINTH KEEP MISSION ON PACE IN SCAC RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For several innings, Mission College baseball Coach John Klitsner implored his 
players to take charge. He had little success. 
</P>
<P>
 But just when things seemed hopeless, the Free Spirit responded with one of 
their most impressive rallies of the season to pull out an improbable 7-4 
victory over East Los Angeles in a Southern California Athletic Conference game 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission (22-14, 14-7 in conference play) knocked off the Huskies (16-16, 9-8) 
with a four-run outburst with two out in the ninth to set up an important 
three-game series with Cerro Coso starting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit trailed Cerro Coso (12-5) by one-half game before Wednesday's 
action. The teams will meet in a doubleheader starting at 11 a.m. Saturday at 
Mission and in one game Wednesday at Cerro Coso. 
</P>
<P>
 But East L.A. almost pushed Mission a little farther from first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies led, 4-3, with two out in the ninth when Jesus Perez slapped a 
single to left on a full count that chased left-hander Aaron Magdaleno, who had 
scattered eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Sammy Loza, the ace of the Husky bullpen with six saves, relieved 
Magdaleno but was greeted with a single by Dave Valdez and a two-run double by 
Gary Matthews that gave Mission the tying and go-ahead runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean-up hitter Dereck Ornelas drove in Matthews with a single, took second on 
an error by the left fielder and scored on a hit to right field by Rob Walley. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Flores followed with Mission's sixth consecutive hit but Loza 
retired John Toven on a grounder to second for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were waiting for someone to stand up and get things rolling and Matthews 
did," Klitsner said. "The guys got excited and started swinging." 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Robert Ballester, a freshman from Monroe High, pitched a strong 7 
1/3 innings, giving up four runs on five hits and one walk, and striking out 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave way to John Romero (4-4), who finished the eighth inning and picked up 
the victory, and Ray Rivera got his first save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner said Rivera (10-2), a freshman right-hander from San Fernando High 
who has become the ace of the staff, will pitch one of the two games against 
Cerro Coso on Saturday and start again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews, who drove in the first Mission run with a double in the first, was 
three for five with three RBIs, and Valdez and Walley each also had three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Arrieta, who homered in the fifth, and Ramon Ruiz each collected two 
hits for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
 In another game: 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont 4, Cal Lutheran 1 -- Marc Weiss gave up three runs to the Warriors 
(23-14) in the first inning on two walks and three hits to take his first loss 
for Cal Lutheran (21-5-1) at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss (7-1), a junior transfer from Cal State L.A., lasted only into the third 
inning before being replaced by David Jaglowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen's only run in the nonconference game came in the fourth inning 
when John Becker grounded into a double play to score Scott Sebbo from third 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles by Sebbo and Chris Fick opened the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Jason Wilson notched his team-high 21st stolen base for Cal 
Lutheran.

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; HELPED BY SOME OLD FRIENDS, CONTRERAZ THROWS SHUTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come crunch time, Alemany High ace Sophie Contreraz is at ease. 
</P>
<P>
 She stands confidently in the pitching circle, bolstered by an infield that 
has been around her for nearly half her life. She knows what to expect from 
them and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of an error-free defense, Contreraz pitched herself out of jams 
in the late innings to help Alemany secure a 1-0 victory over Bishop Montgomery 
Wednesday in a Mission League game at Sybil Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Indians (13-2, 6-0 in league play and bidding for a 
repeat as Mission champions) a one-game lead over the Knights (11-5, 4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany, which has lost only to Simi Valley and Crescenta Valley, scored the 
only run in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Indians loaded the bases on three singles, Contreraz scored when 
Gloria Dominguez drew a walk with two out. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreraz (13-2) threw just 73 pitches. She allowed five hits, two of them 
consecutively to start the Bishop Montgomery seventh. But the Indian defense 
held and Contreraz retired the side on two ground balls and her third 
strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty familiar with each other," said Contreraz, who played in a 
Sylmar youth league with four of her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we have a strong defense and they'll make the play as long as I can 
keep the ball in the infield or where the outfielders can get to it."  
</P>
<P>
 The Indians however, supplied Contreraz with little offensive support. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming into the game, four batters were at .400 or better. But Alemany managed 
just five hits off Shannon Stanovich (7-5), who walked five batters, including 
three in a a row in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're used to getting more hits," Alemany Coach Dudley Rooney said. "But, 
(Stanovich's) change-up really threw us off balance today."  
</P>
<P>
 Contreraz (.429), who has the fourth-best batting average on the team, went 
two for three, ripping line-drive singles into left field in the second and 
sixth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany left the bases loaded in the first and second innings and threatened 
again only in the fifth. With runners on first and second and one out, Alba 
Cano ripped a drive on which center fielder Mari D'Ambrosi made a diving catch. 
D'Ambrosi jumped to her feet and threw out Dominguez scrambling back to second 
to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery threatened in the sixth when D'Ambrosi doubled down the 
left-field line with one out. But Jill Sarmiento popped up to second baseman 
Sonja Maldonado and Jenni Purchase grounded out. PAIGE A. LEECH

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CONVENTIONAL PRACTICE GOES BY THE BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most sports teams stick to a certain routine for warmups, and the Cal State 
Northridge men's volleyball team is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is safe to say that the Matadors' routine is, well, anything but. 
</P>
<P>
 Before practices, Northridge players warm up by playing their own version of 
indoor soccer. The team is divided in half with Gary Reznick and Chris McGee, 
the club's senior setters, serving as captains. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bleachers in the school's gymnasium pushed back, the entire floor is 
considered in play. The "soccer" ball actually is an old volleyball. A section 
of wood wall planking marks the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The competitors attack the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go for it," Coach John Price said. "Last year it was getting a little 
out of hand. Guys were driving each other into the bleachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the split squads played one best-of-seven soccer series, then 
switched sports -- to basketball, using all six baskets in the gym 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty funny to watch," Price said. "Normally in basketball you want 
to stay between your guy and the basket. But the way they played it, your guy 
could just change directions and run off to another basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Price: "It's a change of pace. Besides, it's better than jogging in a 
circle." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking the Write Stuff 
</P>
<P>
 To say that Hawaii has a huge baseball following would be an understatement. 
Hundreds of fans -- kids and adults alike -- routinely wait outside the Rainbow 
locker room for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 One adult fan even presented the Matadors with a baseball to sign. Maybe the 
Northridge players thought the guy was a little old for such activity. By the 
time the ball was handed to Coach Bill Kernen, it had mysteriously been 
autographed by John Wooden and Wilt Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Nelson laid down the sacrifice bunt that moved the eventual winning run 
into scoring position during Northridge's 2-1 victory over Hawaii last weekend. 
In the process, it cost him a noteworthy streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson was 0 for 2, ending a streak of 33 consecutive games in which he has 
reached base. He has reached base in all but two of the Matadors' 43 games and 
has an on-base percentage of .441. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bunting is kind of a new thing for me," Nelson said. "I'm hitting down in the 
order because my batting average isn't real high, so I'm trying to find other 
ways (to contribute)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson , a junior third baseman from Simi Valley High, is batting .269 and has 
three sacrifice bunts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fame is fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 2-1 victory, catcher Eric Gillespie delivered what proved to be the 
winning run with a clutch single in the fifth. Later that night, Gillespie was 
excitedly watching the TV sports highlights of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was identified as "Eric Gullipsee." 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked Gillespie: "What's a guy gotta do?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Matador foursome of Marshall Evans, Troy Collins, Chris Brown and Akiem 
Brown -- no relation to Chris -- moved to second on the all-time school list in 
the 1,600-meter relay Sunday by timing 3 minutes 10.32 seconds to finish second 
in their heat of the Mt. San Antonio College Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did not get rave reviews from Coach Don Strametz, who noted two major 
blunders during the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was a poor baton pass between Evans and Collins that cost Northridge 
a few tenths of a second.  
</P>
<P>
 The second -- and bigger -- gaffe was Akiem Brown's decision to run the anchor 
leg in Lane 2 on the outside shoulder of Cal State Los Angeles' Keadrick 
Washington instead of tucking in behind him until the final straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision might have cost Northridge -- which finished behind Cal State 
L.A. -- three- or four-tenths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what (Akiem) was thinking, but it wasn't smart," Strametz said. 
"The (1,600) relay didn't run very smart, but still ran the second-fastest time 
in school history. That shows you that they're capable of running much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, home- field advantage for the Northridge softball 
team translates into better home- run production. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked Matadors (35-6) have hit 24 home runs, including 13 in their 
last 10-game home stand. In 18 home games this season, Northridge has hit 17 
homers. In 23 road games, the Matadors have hit only seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence? Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our field is a home-run field," Coach Gary Torgeson said. "We practice on it 
every day and we visualize on it every day. I think we're gonna be a long-ball 
hitting team when we're at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge ripped an NCAA-record 40 home runs last season. The chances of 
catching home-run leader Arizona -- which had clubbed 62 going into Wednesday's 
doubleheader against Arizona State -- are slim, but Torgeson said defending the 
home-run title was never a goal this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at 24 now and we may very well reach 40," Torgeson said. "But (this 
season) we want to make better contact and get base hits. We don't want to rely 
on the long ball like we did last year." JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Timely Thoughts 
</P>
<P>
 A new rule this season in college baseball that forces a batter to keep at 
least one foot in the batter's box -- except under specific circumstances -- to 
speed up games is getting mixed reviews at the junior college level. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, the rule says that a batter can't fully step out of the box once 
he steps in unless he fouls off a pitch or calls time out. An automatic strike 
is called if a batter breaks the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if it is speeding up games because I'm not timing the games," 
said Chris Johnson, Valley coach. "I'm old-fashioned. There's no time clock in 
baseball and I think that's one of the appeals of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 But John Klitsner, the Mission coach, doesn't see a problem with keeping the 
games from dragging eternally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it. I think it's a good idea," Klitsner said. "The games seem to be 
going a little bit faster, and it's been used under pretty good discretion by 
the umpires." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons Coach Len Mohney also likes the spirit behind the rule but is not sure 
whether it has made an impact on the length of his team's games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we've had faster games, but if we had, it might be because we 
haven't hit," Mohney said. THE MASTER'S 
</P>
<P>
 Big Boost 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang baseball team has struggled through a tough season, but the club 
gave itself a major boost Tuesday by upsetting Cal State Dominguez Hills, which 
entered the game ranked second in NCAA Division II play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured it might go this way and we'd play our best baseball the last two 
or three weeks of the season," Coach Chris Harrison said. "That was a good win 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was made possible by clutch performances from a few unlikely 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 David Scott and Matt Henzie, the sixth and seventh batters in the Mustang 
lineup, combined for seven hits, and Tony MacCaughtry, usually an outfielder, 
held the lead in 4 2/3 innings of relief pitching. Around the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * If Northridge somehow manages to win the Western Athletic Conference West 
Division title, first baseman Jason Shanahan would be a top candidate for 
player of the year. Shanahan has a 10-game hitting streak, is batting .341 and 
leads the team in RBIs (40, tied) homers (seven), stolen bases (six) and total 
bases (92). In 15 WAC games, Shanahan has been particularly torrid. He is 
batting .426 with four homers, 21 RBIs and has a .721 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chris Beck leads the NAIA District 3 with 119 strikeouts. The Master's 
College right-hander has a 56-strikeout lead over Jeff Beckley of Southern 
California College. With the exception of Beckley, Beck has fanned more than 
twice as many batters as any other pitcher in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeff Tomlinson, The Master's senior catcher, is among NAIA District 3 
leaders with a .346 batting average, 45 hits, 29 runs scored, three triples and 
12 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teresa Stricklin solidified her hold on second on the all-time Northridge 
list in the women's discus when she threw a personal best of 164 feet 9 inches 
to win the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational last week. Stricklin's previous best was 
161-3, set last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge catcher Eric Gillespie, who already has seen duty at designated 
hitter, also has played in left and right field over the past week. Gillespie, 
a freshman, is batting a team-high .342.

KOTSAY, FERGUSON PACE TITAN VICTORY

THEATER REVIEW; A SLICE OF SUBURBAN WARFARE; DESPITE BUILT-IN SETBACKS, IRVINE 
COMMUNITY TROUPE CREATES TENSION IN A WORK ABOUT A WOULD-BE RAPE VICTIM IN A 
'SAFE' TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's more than a little eerie passing through the safe, quiet suburban streets 
of Irvine's Turtle Rock neighborhood and walking into the community recreation 
center to watch William Mastrosimone's play about a man trying to rape a woman 
who lives . . . on a suburban street. 
</P>
<P>
 The unspoken message underlying the Irvine Community Theatre's production of 
"Extremities" is that it can happen here. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Mastrosimone's highly orchestrated and sometimes arch drama is 
also about how the woman, Marjorie (Sydney Thorton-Smith), fights back. But as 
when fire threatened Turtle Rock last autumn, fear is in the air in director 
Lenore Stjerne's pressurized staging. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure comes mostly from Stjerne's actors, who have more than a few 
strikes against them going in. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the theater's fairly ridiculous stage in the community hall, a shallow 
space fit for a band or lecturer, but not for an intense four-character drama. 
Further, the raised stage is so far from the non-raked audience seating that, 
without actors committed to putting the play across, no play has a chance in 
this hall. The program, with extreme understatement, refers to "less than ideal 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The second strike against the actors, oddly enough, is Mastrosimone's play. On 
one hand, he's concocted a can't-miss situation. Marjorie, alone, finds Raul 
(Michael Hebler) in the home she shares with two female roommates. She foils 
his attempted rape, hogties him, and tortures him into such submission that her 
roommates actually begin to sympathize with the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, just as Mastrosimone can't hide the natural conflicts here, he also 
can't hide crude plot and character manipulations and a bewildering inability 
to maintain a tone. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing for Chekhov to inject laughs into his play's tragically absurd 
incidents, but quite another for Mastrosimone to eke out guffaws when the 
stench of rape and pain is thick on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie's roomies are stick figures and plot servants -- Terry (Valerie 
Ludwig) is all weakness and indecision, while Patricia (Terra Shelman) is 
official spokeswoman for the liberal, social-worker set. She's also the voice 
of law and reason compared to Marjorie's law-of-the-jungle revenge ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what kinds of friends are these? Patricia, liberal feminist though she may 
be, comes very close to accusing Marjorie of asking for it by puttering around 
the house in her nightie. At times like this, "Extremities" feels lost in an 
orgy of pseudo-dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost, though, becomes found at Irvine. This is partly because Mastrosimone 
remains very clear about Marjorie's and Raul's characters. But it's largely 
because Thorton-Smith and Hebler are very serious about their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorton-Smith never, ever, lapses into victim mode and suggests Marjorie's 
fear that she may be capable of matching Raul's ruthlessness. Hebler is a 
revelation, a trapeze-wire actor if there ever was one, forever daring to make 
Raul a smart, winning guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul is always trying to spread charisma around the room. Hebler indicates 
that, given other conditions, his Raul might have his own talk show, or even a 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastrosimone has described "Extremities" as "revenge at its peak," but a 
performance like Hebler's considerably complicates the revenge factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with this unsightly stage, the secondhand nature of the (uncredited) set 
and the play's forced ending, the victim-oppressor equation is something to 
mull over as you walk out into the suburban night. 
</P>

ART REVIEW; FASHIONING A FRESHER PERSPECTIVE; THE THREE BEST INSTALLATIONS IN 
'SYMBOLIC GARMENTS' AT CYPRESS COLLEGE INCORPORATE CLOTHES INTO NON-COSTUMEY, 
NON-FUSSY WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clothing has had a checkered history in contemporary Western art: When the 
work isn't goofy "wearable art," it tends to be a passive tribute to the 
garments of non-Western cultures, a fussily stylized assemblage, or a stage 
costume that's hard to appreciate out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 But three of the seven bodies of work in "Symbolic Garments," at Cypress 
College Fine Arts Gallery through Tuesday, make this uneven show worth a visit. 
Kerrie Peterson, Suvan Geer and Kim Abeles have come up with several fresher 
ways of incorporating garment structures into works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson's black linen dresses for famous artists' sculptures are lovely, 
amusing and engagingly feminist. Shown on streamlined metal stands, "Standing 
Woman ((Alberto) Giacometti)" is tiny-shouldered, with a wasp waist and a 
pencil-slim, super-long skirt, while "Standing Woman ((Gaston) Lachaise)" is 
cut with an ample bosom, wide armholes and a broad swath of material gathered 
around the hips. 
</P>
<P>
 By viewing the Swiss and French sculptors' typical female forms as if they 
were real women who would need appropriate clothing, Peterson gently reminds 
the viewer of the range of "acceptable" body types in art. The same era that 
fostered rule-shattering modernism in art also spawned a dictatorial world of 
fashion, in which "basic black" was de rigueur , and women's body types were 
either in or out of vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geer's installation, "A Little Breathing Room," a "coat" fashioned of tree 
bark wraps around a faintly ominous thick black spill, like the aftermath of a 
fire, that wends its way down the wall and onto the floor. A tattered black fan 
whirs slowly and silently inside the garment, as if the life force inside the 
wounded tree were still faintly beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The hum of a floor fan and the sound of airplanes nearly drown out the 
elusive, whispering voice that issues from inside the coat: "Solitude . . . 
bullfrog's throat . . . small waves raised by the evening wind . . . this is a 
delicious evening . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The extreme attentiveness required of viewers is akin to the delicate 
watchfulness that transforms a casual walk in nature into a series of tiny 
discoveries; the frustration level seems designed to mirror the tension between 
nature's cycle and human impatience after such natural disasters as last fall's 
Laguna Beach fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abeles has several pieces in the show, including "Cocktail Shirts," two demure 
cocktail dresses made out of scorched men's shirts -- presumably botched by 
some tippling housewife. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece suggests various contrasts between public and private behavior: the 
well-documented secret alcoholism of women versus the social drinking 
encouraged at the "cocktail hour"; and the rigid 1950s household caste system 
according to which married women's lives were largely concerned with household 
tasks and serving as ornamental appendages in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining elements of a kimono with a weathered clock and hanging fabric 
swatches representing time cards, Abeles' "Sweatshop Down the Hall and 
Sometimes It's Me" links traditional Japanese garments with the U.S. garment 
industry, infamous for abuses of immigrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rigorous symmetry of this meditation on immigrant labor and the structure 
of a life also suggests the ironies of leaving one highly structured culture 
for the lock-step culture of another. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Symbolic Garments" remains through Tuesday at Cypress College Fine Arts 
Gallery (Room 114 of the Fine Arts building), 9200 Valley View St., Cypress. 
Hours: 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday through Friday; 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Wednesdays.

BOPSICLE'S STAND IS AN EDUCATION; JAZZ: PERFORMING IN AN ORANGE COAST COLLEGE 
CLASSROOM, THE BAND GIVES A LESSON IN HOW TO BLEND FINE MUSIC AND FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bopsicle is as comfortable in the classroom as it is on the bandstand. The 
five-member ensemble, whose songs celebrate the stars and styles of jazz, gives 
performances that are instructional as well as entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 So it made perfect sense for Orange Coast College instructor Charles 
Rutherford to have the group visit the regular afternoon session of his jazz 
improvisation course Tuesday. With its songs about be-bop and such legends as 
Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis and Roy Eldridge, Bopsicle brought a measure of 
fun to its lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford also opened the performance to the public, so a sprinkling of fans 
mixed with the students to hear bassist Jack Prather and company sing, play and 
talk about jazz. The band not only delivered some fine music, but also brought 
in an informative anecdote or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the way the group introduced "Diz, the Wonderful Whiz of Bop," Prather's 
tribute to the late trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie. The bassist asked his 
trumpeter, Ron Stout, for impressions of Gillespie. Stout responded with a 
statement of Gillespie's importance as both player and composer, then told 
about his experience working with his hero. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a few months before Gillespie's death in 1993, and the legendary 
trumpeter played terribly in a rehearsal with the Woody Herman band of which 
Stout was a member ("his chops were like two Ballpark franks," quipped Stout). 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they got to the final number of the performance, Gillespie's 
"Things to Come," Stout said, "I never heard Dizzy play so great in my life. It 
was truly a glimpse of things to come on the trumpet." 
</P>
<P>
 Other numbers were given similar lead-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Bopsicle's vocalist, Stephanie Haynes, explained Billie Holiday's "direct 
(lineage) to Louis Armstrong" before singing Prather's melancholy ballad "Lady 
Day." Prather talked about the differences and similarities between Ben Webster 
and Coleman Hawkins -- "Bean (Hawkins) was more intellectual, but both played 
fiery, meaty saxophone" -- before leading the band in his upbeat number "Ben 
and Bean." 
</P>
<P>
 Bopsicle's most attractive aspect is its material, most of which is written by 
Prather. Covering a variety of styles, the repertoire gives a good overview of 
jazz history while allowing plenty of improvisational space for its principal 
soloists -- Stout and guitarist Mark Waggoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Stout's moody, muted trumpet sounds made respectful references to Davis during 
"For Miles." Waggoner showed the speed of his ideas during the Clark Terry-Duke 
Ellington number "Tap City" (with lyrics by Prather), a performance that made 
the guitar-toting members of the class sit up and take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Kevin Tullius played with reserve while sprinkling his work with a 
bevy of offbeat accents, a ploy that was particularly effective during 
Thelonious Monk's "Rhythm-a-ning." And Prather also showed off his solo skills 
with a bop-driven improvisation that had his fingers dancing over the neck of 
his upright. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Haynes' voice that is central to Bopsicle. Her warm treatment of 
Prather's samba-paced ballad "Rio Largo" fairly glowed with intimacy, and her 
scat-like delivery on "In Walked Monk" was pointed and assured. Prather sings 
as well, and the two often performed his lyrics in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prather's lyrics are hip in the style of Dave Frishberg and decorated with 
internal rhymes that give them a cadence of their own. His commentary on the 
state of pop music, "Little Jazz," was typical, complaining of "sweet boys who 
say they're bad" and "falling asleep to New Age, tunes about trees and grass." 
And the song's punch line was the day's most apparent lesson: "Why not try a 
little jazz?"

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: THE RIGHT NIGHT OWL FOR A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life.

 Staff writer Leonard Reed has of late been spending a lot of time behind the 
wheel of his car. It's been Ventura Life centerpieces by night and columns by 
day, all of which have taken Reed and his Volkswagen from one end of the county 
to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 For this week's cover story, he needed a lot of caffeine as well as petrol to 
get the job done. His task was to find enough to do in the hours between 8 p.m. 
and 5 a.m. in a day-tripping county filled with hikers, bikers, workers, 
schoolers and sunlight soakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you don't send a blue jay out to do an owl's job, and neither did we. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night has always been a comfortable place for me," Reed said. "I get a 
lot of reading done when everyone else is asleep and, for that matter, I don't 
even like to dine before 9 p.m. But most of all, things look peaceful after 
midnight -- often, what is commonplace and banal in the crowded afternoon 
becomes dramatic and engaging after dark." 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have to check Reed's story, "Up All Night," to see precisely what he 
means. Suffice to say here that the only time the night proved disagreeable for 
him was years ago atop a snowy mountain back East, when his hiking group lost 
its way, became trapped and needed rescue. Happily, in "getting lost" for this 
week's cover story, our night owl returned with a smile and a detailed 
nocturnal map of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in this issue, you'll see Reed's column, "On the Road," on the 
subject of one man's attempt to sculpt animals into his front yard. The sight, 
on Seaward Avenue in Ventura, is both delightful and haunting. For his column, 
Reed wrote about the daytime version -- the one most people see. But with a nod 
to his main story, Reed wryly noted: "It's worth seeing at night. The animals 
just seem to float there, in the moonlight." Consider this an addendum to the 
all-night map. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's say you are one of those people inclined to wake up in a 
single-digit hour attached to an a.m., only to find yourself stuck in daylight 
savings with a surfeit of sun-drenched time to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 During such moments, thoughts may turn to outdoor sports -- tennis, in 
particular. If so, then you might want to read this week's Fashion column, 
where Kathleen Williams tells us what both traditionalists and the rebels will 
be wearing on the courts, assuming that local arbiters of taste will let them. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if your ideas about leisure-time behavior come from lizards, not 
kangaroos? Then take a look at the Shop Talk column, where Julie Sawyer offers 
helpful tips on purchasing patio furniture. And she charts a course toward the 
best buys on outdoor dining sets and lounge chairs, which, by the way, can make 
an excellent, comfy crash site after one of those all-nighters.

ROCK TALK; VENTURA'S BEACH PARTY A VERY SAFE BET; THE NINTH ANNUAL EVENT, WHICH 
WILL FEATURE THE BOMBERS AND THE CONVERTIBLES, TAKES NO CHANCES.

 The city of Ventura's ninth annual California Beach Party, slated for Saturday 
and Sunday at the Promenade, promises once again to be safer than a glass of 
warm milk at Barney's house. And it'll cost you a cool $5.50 to party with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Bombers, the Convertibles, plus a bunch of out-of-area cover 
bands will provide the soundtrack. Notice that none of the top-drawing local 
bands such as Raging Arb & the Redheads, Lion I's, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the 
Ska Daddyz or Spencer the Gardener are playing. Once again, safety at the 
expense of fun is the underlying premise for this annual swap meet by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday evening in the Poinsettia City, the real party begins with those 
ubiquitous Ska Daddyz at the Bombay Bar & Grill and Raging Arb & the Redheads a 
few blocks away at Metro Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Viable Alternative Department, there will be an Earth Day celebration 
at Oxnard College on Saturday beginning at noon. No one's grandmother booked 
this gig, either. Lion I's, the Ska Daddyz, Trouser Trouts and an L.A. band 
called Brutal Deluxe will provide the soundtrack. It's free. Kowabunga. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Midnight Hour, not quite a year old, won't live to celebrate its birthday. 
The last "Larrypalooza," wherein a bunch of bands start whenever and play until 
who knows when, will be Saturday about 4 p.m. But call first; there's a reason 
the clock on the wall doesn't have any hands. The local blues community will 
meet for a musical memorial for the late blues guitarist Buddy Smith, who died 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This farewell to Buddy show is a good reason to stay open one last weekend," 
said owner Larry Burdorf. "Basically, the lease expired with an option to 
purchase, and we weren't able to purchase the place. There were too many 
deferred maintenance expenses here -- a leaky roof, inadequate electrical 
system and bad plumbing. Right now, we're looking for other properties in 
Ventura, something that's been remodeled since 1962. I was crazy before I 
started this, so nothing can drive me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 While the other venues in Ventura have had a limited list of performing bands, 
the Midnight had over 50 bands per month -- and once had a dozen bands in the 
same night -- and over 600 acts since the venue opened last May. The Midnight 
Hour may've been the last venue to get pool tables, but they were always been 
the first with putting local band CDs on the jukebox. They also offered ear 
plugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The recently concluded Battle of the Bands at the Metro Bay Club in Ventura 
went on so long that Dick Clark was probably a teen-ager when it began. Or 
maybe it just seemed to be endless, mindless, senseless, but also, a lot of 
fun. After four looooong months of four bands (more or less) every Wednesday 
night, it's all over, and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is the winner of the $3,000 cash 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 The finals in late March featured a pretty heavy duty lineup of Ventura County 
bands including the Ska Daddyz, Aerial, J.D.'s Last Ride and Shellfish. Every 
band was excellent the night of the finals, but it would've taken the three 
remaining Beatles having a damn good night to have topped BBVD, who were 
positively on fire doing their swing, retro dance rock set.

 Blue Monday, the weekly event showcasing the blues and other types of American 
roots music, has been on the road longer than some of those old blues guys. The 
event went from Blue Monday to Boo Monday to BooHoo Monday, but now it's back, 
hoping to teach music fans a new destination with a better beat than Monday 
Night Football. Nicholby's Upstairs Pool Hall & Night Club in downtown Ventura 
is the new venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Monday began April 16, 1990, at Glen Tavern in Santa Paula and lasted a 
whole two Mondays. Next stop was Bombay Bar & Grill in Ventura for a month of 
Mondays. Then it was off to Alexander's in Ventura for 135 consecutive weeks 
until new ownership opted out. Next stop for Blue Monday for most of 1993 was 
the Holiday Inn in Ventura. That didn't really work, either. The Holiday Inn, 
crowd, for most part, either came disguised as empty seats or simply stayed 
away in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholby's, once Xenon West then Mogz then an antiques store, may finally be 
the place that won't give Blue Monday those blues. For one, the place is huge. 
There's a large dance floor and an even larger selection of micro brewery 
beers. There are a number of regulation-size pool tables that don't take 
quarters and in no way interfere with the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to generally like the room and we're excited," said Mike Kauffer, 
who promotes Blue Monday as well as the annual Ojai Bowlful of Blues. Next up 
is John Marx & the Blues Patrol on Monday.

THEATER REVIEW; ENGAGING CHARACTERS IN SMALL-TOWN TEXAS; THE TWO ONE-ACT PLAYS 
TAKE PLACE IN A PLACE LIKE MAYBERRY, BUT WITH LONGNECKS AND ARMADILLOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Using the "backstage" theater as a space for small-scale productions is 
working out well for the Santa Paula Theater Center. Currently playing are a 
pair of one-act works by James McLure that are a delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Both take place in the small town of Maynard, Tex. -- think of Mayberry, only 
with longnecks and armadillos -- about 20 years ago. Though the stories are 
separate and not interdependent, the characters are related: husbands of two of 
the three women in the opening "Laundry and Bourbon" show up in the 
post-intermission "Lone Star." 
</P>
<P>
 They're all recognizable types: small-town, blue-collar people trying to 
survive with no hope of escape from their surroundings. Three female friends 
discuss life (men and children, especially) while drinking bourbon and Coke and 
folding laundry; later, three men confront a major problem that has arisen 
between two of them. "Laundry and Bourbon" is sensitive and heartwarming; "Lone 
Star" is out-and-out, often sidesplittingly, funny. 
</P>
<P>
 The central figures are Elizabeth and Roy, who are, it seems, happily enough 
married. Though he's somewhat of a philanderer, she stoically accepts his 
conduct as the nature of a man. Her best friend, Hattie, is flamboyant and 
chatty, and quite a gossip. The third woman in "Laundry and Bourbon," Amy Lee, 
is a social climber who married an appliance store owner and has joined the 
local country club. Amy Lee's disdain of Hattie is reciprocal. While Elizabeth 
remains nonpartisan on the surface, she probably sympathizes with Hattie. 
</P>
<P>
 Out behind Angel's Bar, Vietnam vet Roy is snockered and letting off some 
steam as his younger brother, Ray, looks on. It develops that Cletis (Amy Lee's 
husband, not that it matters) has done something that is bound to infuriate 
Roy, who already holds him in contempt. Cletis figures this latest incident may 
provoke Roy to manslaughter, and asks Ray to help him out of his predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 Both plays depend more on character than plot, though, and both give the 
actors much to work with. And everyone makes the most of the material and 
opportunity for characterization under the confident direction of Brenda 
Kenworthy ("Laundry") and Linda Livingston ("Lone Star"). 
</P>
<P>
 Hattie is the most flamboyant character in "Laundry and Bourbon," and Sandy 
Katzel portrays her memorably (maybe you'll remember Gilda Radner as the 
somewhat confused Emily Litella). Julie Billingsly is fine as Amy Lee, putting 
on what airs she can, and Stephanie Lowe holds the play's center as Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Out behind the bar, Seth Blackburn verges on dangerous as Roy -- there's a 
gleam in his eye that shows why Cletis fears his wrath. Karl Mickelson is 
appealing as Roy's younger and slower brother; the actor brings heart to the 
part. Larry Wright is onstage somewhat less as Cletis, but manages to convey 
why his character is (marginally) more successful than the others. 
</P>
<P>
 There's some raw language in "Lone Star," and sexual references that some 
might find upsetting, which is why the play isn't considered appropriate for 
children. For those who enjoy earthy humor, the plays are recommended. For 
those who don't, the Theater Center will be presenting Oscar Wilde's "The Ideal 
Husband" next month. Details

NIGHT LIFE: BOSTON NATIVES PUT ACCENT ON BLUESY ROCK; THE MEMBERS OF THE 
BURBANK-BASED HOOKERS LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE AND SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 years ago, Horace Greeley gave Americans a direct order to go 
West. People are still listening and obeying, including the Burbank-based 
Hookers, five new Californians who rock hard, but talk funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all from Boston except the drummer, who's from Brazil," guitarist and 
vocalist Jimmy Giglio said during a recent phone interview. The other band 
members are Justin Lyons (vocals), Michael Lyons (bass, vocals), Claudio 
Mattios (drums) and Chris Jones (guitar, vocals). 
</P>
<P>
 And they will be making their Vampyre Lounge Cafe debut Saturday night in Simi 
Valley. The venue is an all-ages hangout, home to industrial-strength coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out here because the scene is here," Giglio said. "During the 
earthquake, my girlfriend started screaming, and I just grabbed her. We lost a 
couple of windows, and our P.A. fell over, but nothing serious. Other than 
that, California was pretty much the way we thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, after forming the band in California, the first thing the band 
members did was contract that inevitable musical malady, the dreaded creative 
differences. Then it was time to begin looking for new members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for a singer; we were checking out all kinds of singers," 
Giglio said. "One night last October, we were doing this blues gig and Justin 
came up and did a couple of songs. Justin is Michael's younger brother; he's 
only 21 but when he got on stage, there was no longer any question about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they all live in the same house, and most of them speak the same language, 
which at times seems to be different than the one Californians speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "You people have the accents out here, not us," Giglio said. "Different parts 
of Boston have different accents. I'm from South Boston, which has the hardest 
accents. They say ' gee-taaah ,' you know." 
</P>
<P>
 People may laugh at those Boston accents, but nobody laughs when they play 
those gee-taaahs. The Hookers do that roadhouse rock with a bluesy base; these 
are guys who have heard the Stones, Aerosmith and the Black Crowes before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people hear the name Hookers, and they think of fishnets and lipstick, 
but that's not our vibe at all," Giglio said. "We're an R & B big-beat kind of 
rock 'n' roll band with a punk side. But we're still developing. We all have 
different musical influences. I grew up listening to Dixieland because my dad 
was a Dixieland banjo player." 
</P>
<P>
 These Hookers are no strangers to the streets. They'll go anywhere -- even 
Simi Valley, not a place anyone is yet comparing to Hollywood, Seattle or 
Manchester as a musical mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the Battle of the Bands at Cheers about a year-and-a-half ago, I 
guess. We got a few hundred bucks and a Japanese guitar. The guys in the band 
gave me the guitar because I booked the gig, so I traded it with some money for 
a great old Telecaster," Giglio said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Simi has been good to them, the Hookers, Giglio said, are ready 
for any and all area codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll go anywhere -- San Francisco, Santa Barbara, San Diego or Simi Valley. 
A lot of bands stick within a 10-mile radius. Not us. We'll do anything. You 
have gas money, we'll play." 
</P>
<P>
 The band has a new three-song tape they're trying to shop. In the meantime, 
according to Giglio, they're cranking out new songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 25 songs since October, all originals. We do covers; actually, we do 
some cover gigs once in a while. We don't want to end up as some Las Vegas 
working band, but sometimes we'll go to some roadhouse-type bar and do four or 
five sets. We just go to play because that's how you learn," Giglio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna keep playing and see what happens. We don't want much. Just give 
us a CD and a van." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Hookers, Broken Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Vampyre Lounge Cafe, 665 E. Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $3 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: 526-3264

 SCRAMBLING SOAP STARS: Divas of daytime drama will face off in volleyball 
Sunday at the Cal Lutheran University gymnasium. The games, which will pit cast 
members of "The Bold and the Beautiful" against "The Young and the Restless," 
will benefit the Santa Susana Repertory Company. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars of "The Bold and the Beautiful" scheduled to play include team captain 
(and Buena High School graduate) John McCook, Ronn Moss, Katherine Kelly Lang, 
Bobbie Eakes, Schae Harrison, Scott Thompson Baker and Michael Sabatino. Set to 
represent "The Young and the Restless" are captain Peter Bergman, Kristoff St. 
John, Tricia Cast, John Castellanos and Doug Diamont. Following the 
competition, there will be a silent auction of memorabilia signed by the 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 The games begin at 2 p.m. Tickets are $10. For further information, call 
374-8282. 
</P>
<P>
 CLASS ACTS: Victoria Morris, a franchise equity agent with Joseph, Helfond & 
Rix in Hollywood, will hold a half-day workshop at the Santa Paula Theater 
Center on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Aimed at those wishing to pursue a 
professional career in the theater, the workshop will cover such topics as how 
to get an agent, when you need a manager, how to approach a casting director, 
unions and professional associations, and audition techniques. Fee for the 
session is $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Theater Center will host two series of acting classes beginning in 
April. A beginners class, taught by the center's artistic director, David 
Ralphe, will take place on Saturdays, April 30 through June 12, from 10 a.m. to 
12:45 p.m. Linda Livingston will hold a scene study class on Monday evenings, 
May 2 through June 13, from 7 to 10:30 p.m. Fee for each series is $125. 
</P>
<P>
 All events will be held at the center, 125 S. 7th St. in Santa Paula. To 
register for any of them, or for further information, call 525-4645. 
</P>
<P>
 SCRAMBLING SISTERS: Two versions of Dan Goggin's comic musical "Nunsense" will 
open within a weeks' time, though not (by Ventura County standards) too closely 
together. The first, by the newly formed Ventura County Actors Theater, an 
offshoot of the old Cabrillo Music Theatre, opens May 6 in a converted church 
in Oxnard's Heritage Square. If that isn't enough singing and dancing "Nuns," 
the newly formed Soap Box Players will open its own version of the show at the 
Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Moorpark Melodrama's upcoming "Sisters on the Run" 
isn't about nuns at all, but singers. The show was previously advertised under 
the title "Live a Little." 
</P>
<P>
 SHAKESPEARE SPLITS: This year's Ojai Shakespeare Festival divides itself into 
two sessions, with the comedy "Twelfth Night" running May 21 through June 19 at 
Dennison Park, and the tragedy "Othello" Aug. 4 through 14 at Libbey Bowl, both 
in Ojai. In previous years, the festival's two productions have run 
concurrently in Libbey Park.

SIGHTS; VENTURA COLLEGE'S GALLERIES FEATURE ART WITH AN AGENDA; TWO DISTINCTLY 
DIFFERENT ARTISTS SHARE AN INTEREST IN SOCIAL COMMENTARY THAT EXPLORES 
LESS-THAN-IDYLLIC ASPECTS OF L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the final non-student exhibitions of the school year, Ventura College's 
two art galleries are hosting work as potent and challenging as any seen here 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based artists Cynda Valle and Chris Hero have little in common, 
apart from an interest in social commentary that often touches on 
less-than-idyllic aspects of life in Los Angeles. Valle's paintings temper 
their themes with brightly-hued, surrealistic window dressing; Hero's art makes 
a grittier, more blunt statement, expressing muted but palpable rage over 
conditions before and during the Los Angeles riots of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But together these shows handily illustrate why some of the most provocative 
art in the county passes through these hallowed halls. The college's exhibition 
program has proven to be a local haven for art with no blatant commercial 
potential. The art here, as seen with the work of Valle and Hero, often comes 
armed with agendas that extend beyond art for art's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 In her mystical yet gregarious paintings, Valle deploys a cheeky blend of 
magic realism and socio-psychobabble. If at times Valle leans on cheap 
theatricality in lieu of substance, she has enough skill and fresh ideas about 
narrative and composition to make her show generally enticing. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking work is "Ode to Mrs. Burroughs," using as a point of 
departure the accidental shooting death of Beat era icon William Burroughs' 
wife, while also touching on the mythology of William Tell and the story of Eve 
(of Adam and apple fame). In this diptych tucked into a corner, the crease of 
the wall aligns with the subject's bullet wound, bisecting two dimensions -- 
the mortal garden and a nether world where a mermaid sits against a stage-like 
red curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, too much is just right. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes in Valle's work, areas of crisp clarity are engulfed by tangly 
patterns of undergrowth sneaking up from the background. In "Jewelbox," a 
frankly portrayed semi-nude woman -- an object in a jewelbox -- stands in a 
kitchen that is aswirl in floral patterns bleeding over from the wallpaper. 
Floral print threatens to consume her. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle swerves from the subtle, magical realm to an almost comical 
heavy-handedness. You have to wonder if a painterly tongue is in cheek in 
"Motherearth," with a mother and child overlaid with sinister cartoon images of 
decadence and torment, or "Lady Famine," with a well-fed white woman being 
clawed at by phantom-like, emaciated Third World citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death of a Salesman" focuses on a rocket-propelled man with a contented grin, 
zooming up over what we presume to be the moral/cultural wasteland of the Los 
Angeles sprawl. Valle, too, seems to want to rise above the superficiality of 
La-La Land, but can stoop to the showbizzy garishness and slick presentation 
that are sometimes its imports. 
</P>
<P>
 From a more rewarding corner of her aesthetic, we also see "S-S-Snake," in 
which a sleeping figure is coyly viewed in a roomful of flying snakes -- a 
pleasantly, blatantly dream world image. Valle works best on the turf of 
articulate dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing slick or calculating about the work of Chris Hero, whose 
tough, rough-hewn work focuses on such street realities as life during riots, 
and have nothing to do with the make-believe world of Hollywood. His are 
loosely assembled pieces, as if made under pressure, with no time for the 
luxury of polish. 
</P>
<P>
 A glance at Hero's bio is telling. He was a paramedic for the New Orleans 
Police Department and was fired after reporting a case of police brutality. He 
then pursued fine art, and now often renders, in immediate terms, what he sees 
as the strong arm of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 One gripping scene of police brutality in Detroit, "In Other Cities: Malis 
Green," is a large, irregularly shaped mural made of sheets of drawing paper. 
"Riot Landscape" comes replete with an actual brick attached to the artwork's 
plexiglass covering. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dramatically, "Now We Can Make Arrest: L.A. Riot," is a splashily 
excessive multi-paneled work with quasi-religious overtones. In the center 
canvas, armed peacekeepers flank a suspect hung upside down, by the feet. 
Above, angels wield bullhorns and a God-like Daryl Gates speaks before 
celestial microphones. Below are panels depicting Hades in our back yard, with 
stenciled letters reading: "Complete Social-Legal Breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 While making no concessions on the issue of whether art and social comment 
mix, Hero shows that guerrilla art can also be graceful. Underscoring the 
urgency of the subjects and the scrappy renderings is a bold sense of 
draftsmanship and a generally assured artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero knows when to regale us with specifics and when to pull back for the 
general view, when to zoom in close on human suffering and when to get a 
broader perspective on urban unraveling. A romantic aura of desolation graces 
the dark, bleak streets of his "Riot Landscape," full of vulnerable 
architectural cubes and quiet dread. 
</P>
<P>
 Murky in more ways than one, "The Night Sky Show" shows an urban area surveyed 
by the raking searchlights of police helicopters. It's hardly an idyllic 
nocturnal scene, but through Hero's incisive view, it is beautiful in spite of 
its dire subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with admittedly loaded subjects -- and scenes that are closer to home 
than many of us care to acknowledge -- Hero manages to carve out an effective 
path between the confrontational and the artful. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: TIME FOR FESTIVE MUSIC; ZACA CREEK WILL HEADLINE AT CONEJO 
VALLEY DAYS. THE SANTA BARBARA-AREA BAND HAS MADE A NAME FOR ITSELF WITH ITS 
BRAND OF COUNTRY-ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Conejo Valley Days time again, Wednesday through May 1. This year's theme 
is "Boots, Buckles and Bandannas." So don't be surprised if folks start looking 
like extras from Central Casting. After all, one of the week's highlights is 
the annual Women's Western Wear Contest. But it's limited to the first 50 
entrants who register -- so get a move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Other special events include a country-Western dance sponsored by the 
Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, junior and regular rodeos, a Western 
pit barbecue and plenty of country music for dancing and listening pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlining the main stage entertainment will be Zaca Creek and two hot local 
bands, the Rhythm Rangers and Cactus County. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaca Creek is one of few groups from the Santa Barbara area to have made it to 
the big time. The others have all been rock bands. But Zaca Creek is probably 
the only Santa Barbara-area country band to hit the national charts. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Foss brothers make up the band. They have been playing country-rock 
together since the mid-'60s when Scot Foss, their lead guitarist, was about 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were born in Santa Barbara and grew up in Santa Ynez," he said during our 
recent phone visit. "My grandfather was one of the very first guys to surf the 
Rincon. Dad learned from him. And it's gone right down through the family." 
</P>
<P>
 But the interest in surfing didn't extend to surf music. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've always played country-rock and use lots of vocal harmonies," Foss 
said. "Our earlier influences included artist/writers James Taylor, John Cougar 
Mellencamp and Merle Haggard. And now our music is being accepted by the 
country music radio formats." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the 1990 release of their first album, "Zaca Creek" on the CBS 
label, the band's second CD, "Broken Heartland," debuted on Giant records. It 
produced three singles that charted Top 50 nationally, including two of their 
original tunes, "Fly Me South," an up-tempo country-blues song and "Two Wheel 
Pony," a fast two-step. You can still catch music videos of these two songs on 
Country Music Television and local cable outlets. Meanwhile, the guys are 
writing material for their third album and gearing up for tour dates. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can catch their act at Fan Fest, where they will perform and have a 
Zaca Creek booth all four days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bubba can Scoot, Bubba can Slide, Bubba can Two-Step and Bubba can Glide. 
Everybody stand back and give me some room. 'Cuz if Bubba can dance, I can too. 
-- From Shenandoah's hit song "Bubba Can Dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it looks like dance instructor Rick Henderson and 3,000 of his closest 
friends are taking the words to Shenandoah's new song seriously. At 3:30 p.m. 
Sunday you'll find them at the California Beach Party in Ventura where they 
hope to break the Guinness Book of Records for the most people line dancing in 
one location at the same time. Just look along the beachfront bike path across 
the street from the Ventura County Fairgrounds near the Classic Car Show. 
Henderson will be there from 2 to 5 p.m. to teach newcomers some basic steps so 
all can participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder Country radio on-air personalities Bob Allen and Billy Gibson will be 
pushin' their tushes with the folks. And between 12:30 and 4:30 p.m. those 
hoppin', harmony-singing guys of Platte River Crossing will crank out the 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The line dancers may not make the 6 o'clock news for breaking any records, but 
over the last few months Ventura County has been well-represented on the glitz 
map by folks from the local country scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Handley's brush with stardom convinced him to finally join the Ventura 
County chapter of the musician's union. Viewers of the CBS television show, 
"Hearts Afire," starring John Ritter (son of country legend, Tex Ritter), might 
have seen Handley and his band featured as -- what else? -- the country band 
playing behind chicken wire in a honky tonk scene. But you can catch them most 
weekends at Rube's Valley BBQ in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons of the Borderline in Thousands Oaks may have recognized dance 
instructors Jamie and Gail Arias, who were featured in a nationally televised 
jewelry commercial for Sears. And Thousand Oaks resident, Miss Ila, who teaches 
at Santa Barbara's Red Dog Saloon, often recruits local talent at the 
Borderline to appear with her in satellite country dance television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark-based dance instructors Ed Failing and Sally Bourgerie have two 
nationally hot-selling videos featuring the popular band, Larry Dean & the 
Shooters, who often perform at Cousin's in Simi Valley. Last month Ed & Sally 
(as they like to be known professionally) began teaching from 7 to 8 p.m. every 
Thursday at The Country Club in Reseda. The place claims to be the Valley's 
largest country dance club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ban-Dar's co-owner, Jonie Mosby Mitchell, scored a double-header in 
January. The 54-year-old former country singer and her toddler son, Morgan, 
were featured in a People magazine article and a segment of NBC television's 
"Dateline," about older women giving birth with the aid of in vitro 
fertilization. 
</P>
<P>
 And most recently, television's "Love Connection" returned to the Crazy Bull 
in Camarillo to recruit more participants for the matchmaking show. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cow-country folks must be doing something right to snag their 15 minutes 
in the spotlight.

 A scrappy underdog beats the odds and achieves undreamed-of success. 
</P>
<P>
 If that basic plot is at the core of just about every sports movie ever made, 
a slight variation often fuels their sequels. The team, spoiled by success, 
starts to get cocky, distracted by the temptations of fame, and loses sight of 
the things that made it a winner in the first place -- only to regain its 
balance in time for the rousing big-game finale. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in a nutshell, is at the heart of the two top-grossing movies now 
playing: "D2 The Mighty Ducks" and "Major League II." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, to be young again, when the banal cliches of such Hollywood product seemed 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids in the audience at a recent screening of "Major League II" were 
either oblivious to the predictable plot turns or were willing to overlook them 
in exchange for an hour and 41 minutes of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction among youngsters at the Tustin Marketplace was uniformly positive, 
although it stopped well short of wildly enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Aaron Faiola, an 11-year-old from Irvine, "It was funny." But even as he 
said it, he shrugged his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron, admittedly more of a hockey fan than a baseball fan, added that he 
liked "Major League II" better than "D2," which didn't have enough jokes for 
his taste.

<P>
 "I didn't like it," he explained. "This was better." 
</P>
<P>
 Zac Tull of Anaheim, 7, came down on the other side of the "D2"/"Major League 
2" debate. The hockey film, he said, was funnier, and its ending was more 
satisfying: "They went against people who were a lot bigger and still won." 
</P>
<P>
 Zac did enjoy "Major League II" though, he said, adding that Rick (Wild Thing) 
Vaughn was his favorite character. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, played by Charlie Sheen, is the reckless young Harley-riding pitcher 
who carried the team with his fastball in the first film. This time around he's 
gone straight, trading in his leather vest for a suit and tie, and losing his 
drive (and his fastball) in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Others returning from the first film (released in 1989) include Pedro Cerrano 
(Dennis Haysbert), who has traded in voodoo for Buddhism and, um, lost his 
drive in the process, and Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes in the first film, 
Omar Epps this time), who has gone Hollywood in the off-season, and lost . . . 
oh, you know the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Other returnees include Tom Berenger as Jake, the catcher who turns to 
managing this time when his bad knees finally end his career. Bob Uecker is the 
team's radio announcer, in the film's funniest turn.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; TIDE IS RIGHT FOR RETURN OF SURF CLASSICS; 
DIRECTOR HAL JEPSEN, WHO'S FILMED SOME OF THE COUNTY'S MOST POPULAR SPOTS, 
BRINGS HIS LONG BOARD MOVIES TO VENTURA CONCERT THEATER.

 Hal Jepsen calls himself the second man of surf films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce Brown ('Endless Summer') is number one," Jepsen said. "I consider 
myself Number 2." 
</P>
<P>
 You can see Brown's work when "Endless Summer II" is released early this 
summer, 30 years after the original. But Jepsen will be at the Ventura Concert 
Theater on Friday with a bundle of long board movies, backed up by a live band 
playing surf music on vintage guitars and amps. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 25 years Jepsen has been making surf movies, he's filmed some of 
Ventura County's most popular spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some unbelievable stuff from the Santa Clara River in 'A Sea for 
Yourself.' I was at McGrath (State Beach) filming toward the northwest with the 
fairgrounds and the green hills in the background on a day on when it was so 
clear you could see every detail. It was really one of those magic days. Waves 
5 to 8 feet. It was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 The show will last an hour and a half, but because there are two screens that 
will show different films simultaneously, Jepsen is bringing three hours of 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hal went from early long boarding and he has some really good footage from 
the '60s," said Paul Nielsen, owner of Waveline Ventura, a local surf shop that 
has Jepsen movies on videotape. But Nielsen thinks Jepsen's biggest 
contribution has been the movies featuring the transition from long to short 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "His movie 'Cosmic Children' came out when I was just graduating from high 
school," Nielsen said. "I'm 41 now, and it is still probably the best movie on 
the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's places in 'Cosmic Children' with great Ventura County stuff," Nielsen 
said. "In fact, I have about five of his videos in the store and I think they 
all have scenes from Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 The show at the Ventura Concert Theater begins at 8 p.m. Tickets cost $6 and 
are available through TicketMaster or at the box office, 26 S. Chestnut St.

 Faithful readers of this column will doubtless remember camera collector 
extraordinaire Wes Lambert of Camarillo who boasts the largest collection of 
hand-crank motion pictures in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Lambert has several of his cameras on display at the Stagecoach Inn 
Museum, 51 S. Ventu Park Road, Newbury Park.

</P>
<P>
 "Ruby in Paradise," winner of last year's Sundance Film Festival, goes on 
screen Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is about a young woman from Tennessee on her own for the first time 
in a small Florida beach town. Critics called Ashley Judd's performance as Ruby 
sensitive and winsome and described the film as the sort of humanistic approach 
typical of directors Jean Renoir or Roberto Rossellini.

ON THE ROAD: PRUNING BRINGS PLANTS INTO ANIMAL KINGDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not a day goes by that somebody doesn't pull over and stop in front of 
Esequiel Ruvalcaba's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the people park and sit. Sometimes they get out and knock on the 
front door to ask whether they can take pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 A carload of six from Miami stopped recently and asked if they could hang out 
in Ruvalcaba's front yard, just to look. They left three hours later, after 
much picture-taking and group portraits in various corners of the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most activity comes from people who never quite stop. Most simply slow 
down -- it's a reflex, a natural response in the face of seeing what Ruvalcaba 
hath wrought before his otherwise plain house on Seaward Avenue just north of 
Thompson Boulevard. One woman was so transfixed that her car rolled across the 
yellow line, narrowly missing oncoming cars. Ruvalcaba's screams helped her 
snap out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just enjoy this," says Ruvalcaba, gesturing to his fecund menagerie of 
12 huge animals carved from the foliage of mature eugenia trees. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the brontosaurus, a good six feet across and floating six feet off 
the ground. It adjoins an species-unspecific animal with a wide, purse-lipped 
mouth, whose lower jaw blows in the breeze at a faster rate than the head, 
leaving the impression that mastication is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we call him 'Big Mouth,' " Ruvalcaba says. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Mouth and the dinosaur are joined, in no particular order, by a large 
bull, a camel, a savage-looking bird, a pair of ducks (heading out over the 
driveway toward traffic), a monkey (with arms held toward the sky), an eagle, a 
two-headed monster of a bird and a peacock. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, these creatures form an installation that hangs in suspension above 
the property, as though the lawn were the base of some psychedelic aquarium. 
Things don't usually look this way in this neighborhood of tiny, trim yards on 
Seaward Avenue. But then Ruvalcaba's no ordinary Venturan. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in Guadalajara, Mexico, moved to Ventura in 1950, soon to become 
the chef at Loop's on Main Street, where he'd remain for 20 years. He then 
signed on to a deep-sea drilling rig, cooking beef stews around the world and 
visiting 78 countries. It was a gig lasting 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Esequiel Ruvalcaba decided: enough. He'd start his own business. He was 
well on the way to paying off his Seaward home, which he'd moved into in 1961, 
and it just seemed time to go to work for himself. So he started Zeke's 
Gardening Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeke as in Esequiel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call me Zeke," he insists. "Everybody calls me Zeke. In fact, nobody really 
can say my first name. I like Zeke." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeke is 60, distinguished-looking in white shirt and pin-stripe pants and 
silver, brushed-back hair. He also is hard as nails. Save treatment for a 
three-inch cut on his forearm years ago, he's never been to a doctor, which he 
says would bring bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things Zeke did as a businessman was to cut his hours back to 
a four-day week. 
</P>
<P>
 That, he says, gave him time to "explore" his trees. One thing Zeke missed 
about Guadalajara were the trees in public parks. Many of those trees were 
sculpted into animals, people, living things. 
</P>
<P>
 He sought to re-create them in his yard. But Zeke never wanted to force 
anything. In fact, he abhors the use by some tree sculptors of internal wiring 
to support their forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the way," Zeke says. "You move through the tree, follow its 
branches. You see what is possible. The branches tell you. I don't know what 
I'm doing when I start out. The monkey was, I thought, going to be a bear." 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution of the form -- that is, the time it takes for Zeke to discover 
through intermittent pruning that a tree will become a camel or a duck or, if 
the branches just plain fail the animal kingdom as we know it, a two-headed 
bird -- averages two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention the word artist and Zeke looks perplexed. He tells you that he never 
attended school. With some foot-shuffling, he laughs and allows that the forms 
he creates sometimes even surprise him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sit still," he says. "I never watch TV. Sometimes, I'll cook for my 
wife. But mainly I do this, with the trees. It keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, a car pulls to the shoulder of Seaward, just short of the madly 
chewing Big Mouth. Inside, the driver commences a surreal journey that only a 
man named Zeke Ruvalcaba could have charted.

JAUNTS; IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM THE CANYON TO THE SEA; THE EASY EIGHT-MILE WALK 
THAT STARTS IN NEWBURY PARK IS BEING STAGED TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE OUTDOOR 
ADVISORY COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hikers, picture this: an eight-mile hike entirely downhill , with a tri-tip 
spread waiting at the beach where the jaunt ends. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is your kind of exercise, get out your hiking shoes and your 
checkbook. The Outdoor Advisory Council, the volunteer arm of the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District, is sponsoring a group trek Saturday down Sycamore 
Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no freebie. It's a fund-raiser for the council, so it will cost you 
$15. That pays for lunch -- including a vegetarian offering -- and a bus ride 
back to the start of the hike at Rancho Sierra Vista Park in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It all begins at 9 a.m. in the parking lot at Rancho Sierra Vista, also the 
site of the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center. Prepare for a lot of 
company on this outing; organizers expect about 140 people. They've also lined 
up 12 naturalists to accompany hikers, providing information about plants, 
animals, geology and the Chumash Indian culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike starts at an elevation of about 800 feet, with wide-open mountain 
vistas in view. Walkers will quickly drop to the canyon floor in a series of 
steep switchbacks. Within 1 1/2 miles, the elevation is about 400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The route is over a paved road that takes hikers through groves of sycamore 
and oak trees and alongside grassy green meadows. The pavement ends after three 
miles near the old Danielson Ranch, now a group campsite. Restrooms are 
available here, but no water. 
</P>
<P>
 From here, the route continues gradually downhill over a well-maintained dirt 
road. You'll cross several creek beds -- dry as of last week, except for one 
wet, muddy spot. The vegetation is lush, growing tall on either side of the 
trail in spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail ends at the Sycamore Canyon Campground, south of Point Mugu on 
Pacific Coast Highway. Across the highway is the beach, where lunch will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bus back to Rancho Sierra Vista will leave Sycamore Cove about 2 
p.m., followed by the second about 4 p.m. A van with seating for small children 
will also shuttle families. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a large group is expected to sign up for the trek, they won't hike in 
one mega-group, according to Kathy Myers, recreation leader. Smaller groups 
will form, with some people hiking faster than others. The trek is expected to 
take three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers need to take some precautions, Myers said. They should wear long pants 
and long-sleeved shirts, bring sunscreen, a hat and at least a quart of water. 
No-no's are radios, pets and bicycles. Except for this group, bicycles are 
permitted on the Sycamore Canyon trail. In fact, it's a popular biking route, 
so keep an eye out for cyclists. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Sycamore to the Sea" hike through Sycamore Canyon in the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, from 9 a.m. to about 4 p.m.

 * WHERE: Hike starts at Rancho Sierra Vista Park on Potrero Road, Newbury 
Park. (Take the Wendy Drive exit off the Ventura Freeway and stay on Wendy 
until it ends. Go right on Potrero Road and left into the park on Pinehill 
Road.) Hike ends at Sycamore Cove on Pacific Coast Highway, south of Point 
Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $15 per person. Fee benefits the Outdoor Advisory Council, which 
will use the proceeds to buy educational supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * CALL: Preregistration is required. For information or to sign up, call 
494-8301. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Organizers are encouraging car-pooling to the start of the hike. This 
is an outing for all ages.

FOR THE KIDS; DOLLS PROVIDE A SLICE OF CULTURAL HISTORY; VALENTINA SOLO, 81, OF 
RUSSIA HAS BEEN MAKING THE MANNEQUINS MOST OF HER LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The dolls made by Valentina Solo are hardly the sort you would find in a 
store. Sure, she has stitched a Disney-like Sleeping Beauty doll and cherubic 
dolls from other countries, but how about the evil-eyed Ivan the Terrible doll? 
</P>
<P>
 Her doll collection, now on display at the Conejo Valley Art Museum, is a 
slice of cultural history. She has Marie Antoinette outfitted in a silk gown of 
the day, along with two Elvis dolls -- one as a svelte teen idol and a later, 
pudgier version. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 81-year-old Solo's own history is as interesting as her dolls. She 
grew up in Russia, made a daring escape from the country during desperate times 
when food was scarce, and eventually made a career out of her doll-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Solo, who lives in North Hollywood, is visiting her brother in Russia while 
her dolls are on display until May 15. Her daughter, Tanya George, described 
her mother as a can-do woman of incredible determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a tough lady," said George, of Woodland Hills. "She came to America 
and thought this is paradise -- and she had three jobs and three children." 
</P>
<P>
 Solo's artistic talent shone as a child in Russia. She made a doll for her 
sister out of scraps, meticulously painting the face. Soon she made dolls for 
neighbors in exchange for bits of rice and bread for her family. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 19, she fled Russia with a girlfriend, walking five days in the 
mountains until they reached Iran, George said. There she made a successful 
living selling her dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 She married her Russian husband in Iran and they moved to the United States 
with their three children in 1958. (A daughter, Natalie Oliver, lives in 
Thousand Oaks.) 
</P>
<P>
 She took a factory job, and within a year she had started a school in East Los 
Angeles where she taught Russian. After she closed the school, she went to work 
expanding her doll collection, which now exceeds 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Each doll takes one to three months to make, George said. They stand three to 
four feet tall and are wired throughout -- even the fingers and hands -- so 
that they can be bent into any position. 
</P>
<P>
 In a museum bulletin about the exhibit, Solo is quoted: "When I am making 
dolls, I do not think of it as doll-making, but making people." 
</P>
<P>
 Solo has carefully researched the clothing and costumes of the dolls. Many are 
lavishly adorned with beadwork, jewelry, plumes and colorful fabric. The detail 
is impressive -- right down to the hair sewn on Elvis' chest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the families who do art together, Oxnard's Carnegie Art Museum is offering 
another family workshop sponsored by Mervyn's on Saturday. Local artist Kim 
Kaiser will be leading this one, titled "Color Mystic," which ties in with the 
current exhibit, "The Mystical in Art." 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop runs from 10:30 a.m. to noon at the museum, 424 S. C St. The cost 
is $3 for non-members and $2 for members. Children under 10 must be accompanied 
by an older family member or friend. For information, call 385-8179. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has another freebie for families on Sunday. Admission is free from 
1:30 to 4:30 p.m. Sculptor Len Evans will demonstrate his recycled and metal 
artwork. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Valentina Solo's Dolls of the World collection. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Conejo Valley Art Museum, 193-N N. Moorpark Road (in Janss Mall near 
Sears), Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Museum hours are noon to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. Exhibit 
runs through May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For parents of young children, this is a no-touch exhibit.

SHOPTALK; GOOD BUYS ABOUND IN OUTDOOR FURNITURE; THERE'S A BIG SELECTION OF 
ITEMS FOR BACK-YARD LIVING AND ENTERTAINING, AND MUCH OF IT IS MODESTLY PRICED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 We Southern Californians love to do everything outside. Work. Play. Read. Eat. 
Entertain. So now that spring has sprung, it's time to ready your back yard or 
patio for use. With a little planning, you can create an environment you and 
your family will love. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news about outdoor furnishings is that you don't have to spend a lot 
of money. Target, K mart and secondhand shops all have great stuff available. 
If you insist on only the finest, that's available, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you shop, be sure to consider the space you have and how you want to 
use it. If family barbecues are what come to mind, then a table and chairs 
should be your first purchase. If afternoon naps are what you crave, then a 
chaise lounge might be the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 At Target, we saw a three-piece cafe patio set ($99.88) perfect for a morning 
cup of joe. The table had a tempered glass top and a forest green aluminum 
frame. The two chairs are simple, armless and have floral seat cushions. This 
is a good set for a small area. Also at Target, for just under $300, an 
American Cedar patio set caught our eye. An oval table, two armchairs and two 
benches are included. A matching "market umbrella" costs an additional $89.88. 
This set belongs in a big back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out secondhand stores and thrift shops if you are on a tight budget. 
We've seen lots of old wrought iron and aluminum sets for very little money. 
Most of the used outdoor furniture just needs a touch of paint or new cushions 
to be useful again. Our favorite outdoor cafe has an eclectic group of chairs 
and tables -- all from thrift shops. They look great because they're surrounded 
by a lush garden. 
</P>
<P>
 If you already have a table and chairs, but are planning big parties, extra 
chairs can be found for very little money. At Target, our favorite stacking 
chairs were the low-back armchairs by Grosfillex for $9.88. Rubbermaid also had 
a "Villa" classic armchair for $14.88. K mart had stacking chairs for as little 
as $5.99. Most of these chairs are made of resin and are a good choice for 
extra seating. Resin is lightweight and easy to care for. And if the chairs 
stack, they'll be easy to store when you don't need them.

 For serious sunbathers, Target has a "resort grade" strap chaise lounge for 
$79.88. If you're a member of the Price Club, you can buy the "commercial 
chaise" for $49.99. K mart has a four-position chaise for $59.99, and a 
multiposition recliner for $25.99. Both were in resin by "Festival." Be sure to 
buy plenty of sun block!

 We loved browsing through Zender's Superstore in Thousand Oaks. This store has 
all the top designer outdoor furniture -- most of it priced 30% below list. 
It's a great place just to get ideas or maybe make a splurge on one of their 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
 We fell madly in love with a set called "Ramsgate" by Woodard. The 48-inch 
table and four chairs were priced at $1,080 from the list price of $1,545. Hey, 
we'll put it in the dining room.

EARTHWATCH: COMPOST AND CONTESTS AT EARTH DAY FESTIVAL; EVENT IN OXNARD WILL 
HAVE MANY DISPLAYS OF ITEMS AND IDEAS FRIENDLY TO THE ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This weekend, at the Earth Day Festival in Oxnard, Jessica Craven will be 
dispensing pots full of compost. "It's my own special blend," she said while 
preparing the stuff at Oxnard College, the site of an all-day environmental 
rock 'n' roll, show-and-tell event Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven is an Oxnard city employee with the mysterious title of solid waste 
intern. Her concoction, which will be offered free in a flower pot with an 
accompanying seed packet, will be featured at the Oxnard Beautiful booth. A 
score of such displays and environmentally friendly food booths, along with 
four bands and three dance groups, will provide Ventura County residents a fun 
setting to check out the latest eco-trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on what kind of kids you have, certain booths and displays may be of 
special interest. For a dollar, the Audubon Society can keep them busy building 
a birdhouse. Nearby, youthful imaginations might be engaged by the "Sewer 
Sucker," a huge device being exhibited at the festival by the folks from the 
city's waste water treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven, my official informant on such matters in Oxnard, confessed to having 
named the machine, which performs a sort of subterranean angioplasty. Normally 
it's called "System Vactor." Star Trek comes to waste management. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Interpretive Outreach Program, the city of Ventura will operate 
a booth stocked with reptiles to demonstrate the place of creatures such as 
gopher snakes and turtle hatchlings in our local ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Humane Society of Ventura County will have a pet adoption booth for those 
who want to take an animal home from the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Solid Waste Management will have a contest booth where you can 
match wits with the manufacturers of powerful household products you see 
advertised on TV. The game is to formulate your own version of cleansers that 
are nontoxic and non-polluting and can be made at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids will probably prefer to contemplate the musical challenges provided by 
the rock bands -- Trouser Trouts, Lion I's, Brutal DLX and Ska Daddyz -- 
scheduled to play at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite booth will be the display by Materials Exchange, operated by the 
Ventura County superintendent of schools. As Earthwatch readers know, I relish 
the very idea of finding novel reuses for things. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, Elaine Daughtery, a science teacher on special assignment to 
the county, has been conducting the Materials Exchange program Saturdays at the 
superintendent's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 There, she collects and redistributes a dazzling variety of stuff. Saved from 
being put in landfills thanks to environmentally minded local businesses, the 
stock consists of everything from odd-lot printing paper to used computers to 
weatherstripping to desks. 
</P>
<P>
 This week she will begin providing -- on loan -- a remarkable environmental 
videotape. Teachers can sign up for it at the booth. The five-minute tape is 
the environmental message of a remarkable 12-year-old girl, Severn Suzuki, 
whose father, David, is a famous Canadian scientist who hosts the television 
show "The Nature of Things," seen on PBS in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Severn Suzuki delivered her message to world leaders at the Earth Summit in 
Rio. The power of her speech, combined with the astounding poise of her 
delivery, merits wide notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents," says Severn, in one part of the tape, "used to sacrifice so kids 
could have a good life. Now you are saying we kids must sacrifice our future so 
you can have a good life today." 
</P>
<P>
 On this Earth Day, or any Earth Day, I cannot think of a better thing to 
recommend for contemplation and inspiration. Details

CENTERPIECE: WAKING UP TO THE DARK; A NOCTURNAL COURSE MEANDERS THROUGH 
FOG-DAMPENED STREETS UNDER THE WARM GLOW OF STREET LAMPS TO DISCOVER THE SOUL 
OF A SLUMBERING POPULACE.

<P>
 Enter the night. The province of possums, bats, night-shift workers and 
insomniacs among us. 
</P>
<P>
 Or those who simply wish to be alive, rather than unconscious, on the other 
side of day: in darkness, in quiet, in peace, in defiance of structure and 
congestion and heat and traffic and checkout lines and TV noise and drive-time 
radio and lunchtime voices that announce, "No. 22, you're order is ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, we'll pass. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a loner thing. No, it's an aesthetic thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The night, in black opposition to every shining thing that defines us during 
the day, mirrors our lives in haunting, vacant relief. Truth is, it can be 
quite beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving about in the night offers a new look at the everyday: the jammed 
junction, in Ventura, of South Mills Road and Main Street, carless and awash in 
warm street-lamp glow cut by the strobing red light overhead. The 24-hour 
supermarket whose produce section, torn asunder by hundreds through the day, 
becomes a Robert Graves installation of shining pyramids of apples, oranges and 
lemons. The view over Simi Valley, at noon opaque and hot and roaring with Taco 
Bell, Nissan and HomeBase traffic but at midnight a twinkling New England 
village nestled between mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, within these contrasts, buried within the distance between the waking 
day and sleeping night, there's an urge to find the fellow traveler. The 
measure of a place is taken in its soul, after all, and the ineffability of a 
soul cannot be known without seeing in both light and in darkness how life 
roots itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cities are small, however, like towns. And the spaces separating them are 
large -- often "empty" but for lush fields of green vegetables and yellow 
flowers and looming brown, serrated, cracked sulfurous mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. We sought, from 8 p.m. on a Wednesday to 5 a.m. on a Thursday, all 
signs of life at night in Ventura County: worker, drifter, reveler, misfit, 
poet, prophet. 
</P>
<P>
 Our course would be random, helter skelter, the only true itinerancy of the 
night. We drove, we stopped, we listened; we ate, gabbed, drove, climbed, 
walked, drove, and drove: 165 miles, from Thousand Oaks to Oxnard to Moorpark 
to Simi Valley to Newbury Park to Camarillo to Oxnard (again) to Ventura. 
However it would turn out, a piece of Ventura County's soul -- rural not urban; 
suburban not urbane; rustic not polished -- would happily be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Herewith our nine-hour chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrace Caffe, Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants are closing earlier and earlier during the week -- most by 9 p.m. 
This one, a bright new bistro seeking to impress, held out the most promise for 
a lively room and the chance to dine relatively late. 
</P>
<P>
 It delivered, though by 9:30 the room was quickly emptying, and servers were 
preparing tables for the next day's trade. In the span of 30 minutes, the place 
went from festive to moribund. It's never fun to be the last one out. This 
reinforced our opinion that if you want to dine fashionably late in Ventura 
County -- say, 10 p.m. -- your venues are few and without fashion: Denny's, 
Marie Callender's, Jack in the Box. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 9:40 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Panda's at Holiday Inn, Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two middle-aged women at the bar are reordering greyhounds (don't ask). Two 
middle-aged men are seated beneath a TV blaring "Murphy Brown"; they drink 
martinis from a near-empty pitcher. The men are loudly discussing auto sales. 
One outlines the apparent calculus of locating a dealership: "You gotta know 
where you're at. You gotta know where the people are coming from. If you don't, 
you don't know where you're at. I'm telling you, it's locale, locale, locale." 
Good night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10:10 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagon Wheel Bowling, Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wagon Wheel is happily trapped in a time warp. Don't let the red neon sign 
BOW (the LING part of the word on the south-facing sign is out) fool you: The 
facility is well-maintained, if out of the homespun 1950s. Check the cafe, 
which boasts a fading sign: "Home cooking like mother use to do before she took 
up soap operas and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the home cooking tonight is Japanese, by the hand of cafe proprietor 
Fumiko Harada, who fed sweet and sour pork over rice ($5.50 per portion) to 45 
bowlers in the Nishei league, organized by second-generation Japanese 
Americans. At this hour the bowlers, fortified by Harada's cuisine, jam the 
center alleys in royal blue shirts bearing the logos Harry's Landscape, Players 
Club, Sumitomo Bank, Westlake Dental, Hartman Handyman. They'll spare and 
strike their way till midnight or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The best place to watch, however, is from within the Wagon Wheel's bar, a 
red-boothed installation beneath a wagon wheel topped by eight red globes. For 
better or worse, you will feel very far away from it all in this glowing red 
emporium that looks ready to receive 80, yet serves only two patrons, seated 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But keep it on the early side. The Wagon Wheel was for years one of the few 
24-hour outposts to turn to. Sadly, it closes at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 11:45 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Harley's Simi Bowl, Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike -- out. Thought we'd have time to bowl a string. Too bad. Closing time 
is in 15 minutes; they're sweeping the alleys clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate, we turn to the one outpost whose namesake holds promise, albeit 
darkly. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 12 Midnight 
</P>
<P>
 The Vampyre Lounge Cafe, Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in a strip mall alongside Domino's pizza (closed), the Vampyre not 
only has people within it but seated on the sidewalk outside it. Alcohol-free 
and designed as a coffeehouse for the young, the Vampyre clearly fills a niche. 
Forty-two souls from their teens to perhaps mid-20s sit on sofas, huddle around 
cafe tables sipping espressos, and otherwise strut and pose and tease and 
cajole. 
</P>
<P>
 The music is eastern-tinged, modern industrial rock, trance-like in its modal 
repetitions; the lighting ample, the espresso excellent. Scene: Two boys tickle 
a girl on the small makeshift stage, from which poetry gets read; they roll 
apart in paroxysms of laughter. A guy in pea coat, with Brylcreemed black hair 
and heavy eye shadow, calls out a reprimand in a bogus English accent. Another 
young fellow, seated at a tiny round table, urgently tells a young girl: 
"Nothing would want to make me stop living." To which she replies, in 
earnestness and football metaphor: "Look, your ego took a real body block." 
</P>
<P>
 Say what you want about kids with multiple earrings through multiple body 
parts and about places in which wall art includes Father-Knows-Best-like 1950s 
images manipulated so that penises grow from ears. This place is alive. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, of course, these young people -- call them East County's 
boulevardiers -- are not going to bed. They are staying up in the night, 
inventing and reinventing their worlds. They will be here till 3 or 3:30 a.m., 
just as they are every night, in heady contrast to the shuttered citizenry 
surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Splash, at The Radisson Hotel, Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurrying here from the Vampyre in an effort to find throbbing nightclub action 
took us past Donut Queen (open), Donut Cafe (open), Taco Bell (open), Kinko's 
(open and bustling with seven people), as well as a five-block sample of Simi 
Valley's daytime "downtown": Conroy's Flowers, Acapulco, Shell Food Mart 
(open), Pet Food Warehouse, Burger King, Family Fun Zone, Blockbuster video, 
Shakey's, Pretzels & Cheese, Simi Valley Lawnmower, Fast Frame, Tire City, 
Sizzler, Schmidt Overhead Doors, Larwin Liquor, Remax, Bank of America, 
Cheers/The Main Event, HomeBase, McDonald's, Granada Oak Furniture Warehouse, 
Tire Man, Baby Treasures, Carpet Coop, Jiffy Lube, Wienerschnitzel, Urgent 
Care, 3-Day Blinds, Vitamin Station, Party for Less, Nissan, Goodyear, Honda, 
Acura, Toyota, Express Lube, Plymouth, Dodge/Eagle, Ford, Chevrolet and Kountry 
Folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Splash is closed. The pink psychedelic hearse parked outside promised 
intrigue, and the sign in the door said closed Sunday and Monday, but on this 
Wednesday, no luck. A peek inside shows Caribbean or Fijian translocation: 
bamboo tiki bar, frescoed mermaids, signs boasting the island life and lots of 
rum, rum, rum, fun, fun, fun. But when, when, when? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as quickly as we turned away in deflation, the huge clear sky held out 
its own cosmic OPEN sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Radisson is situated on a bluff overlooking Simi Valley. We approached the 
bluff on foot. What had been an unrelenting maze of block-after-block 
fluorescent in the valley below was now a charming twinkle in the blackness. 
Mountain ranges across the valley stood in dark relief against a galaxy smear. 
A shooting star from high above suddenly streaked downward and leftward, a 
great white slash across the sky, fading milliseconds before reaching the 
darkened ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Time collapsed. Silence overwhelmed. And a piece of this night's soul was 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley may have rolled up its streets by 9 p.m., but this place was now 
perfect, now beautiful. That the full-tilt Vampyre was somewhere down there, a 
true light among all the overheads, only added to the glow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 12:50 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Freeway South, north of Olsen Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At 60 m.p.h., the car is engulfed in a scent tent of eucalyptus. Menthol and 
peppermint everywhere. As the 23 climbs and falls through gentle hills that are 
sun-scorched in the day, nature breathes at night in a way that casts it as a 
character, another player in the soul of the place, another form of night 
company. Roll those windows down. We're Oxnard-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1:10 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Freeway north, descending the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 West County, East County. If the grade is a topological divider of sorts, so 
is the ocean's influence. Weather, in the form of marine inversion layer -- fog 
so thick it roils like smoke -- has engulfed the Oxnard Plain below, occluding 
from view Oxnard and Ventura. It appears that a black ocean has moved inward 
and made its beach at the yellow lights of the 101 in Camarillo. Shooting stars 
up here, milk-bottle visibility down there. Here we go. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1:37 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 El Bohemio Cafe, La Colonia, Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown is shut. But Foster's Donuts at Oxnard Boulevard and 1st Street is 
open, without customers, as is the nearby Mobil Mart, where a one-legged man 
vacuums out his van. 
</P>
<P>
 But El Bohemio Cafe, at the corner of Hayes Avenue and Cooper Road, throbs. 
Boys, apparently in their teens, hang outside, as do elderly men; some hold 
bottles of beer. Two dressed-to-the-nines men in their 20s escort a young woman 
from their car into the bar. And music pours onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
 It all looks so inviting and festive, but then this isn't the tour boat 
debarking in Cozumel. This corner is said to be the center of Oxnard's drug 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 When some stares our way start to miss that friendly look, we decide it's time 
to move on, regretfully. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2 A.M 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart, Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspend, for a moment, all arguments about what Sam Walton hath truly wrought 
in his mega-chain that threatens the mom-and-pop shop. This 24-hour store 
rearranges sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A salesman spots me, somewhat agog, in chain saws. "We're still waiting to 
receive those Homelites you're looking at, sir," he says. "Is there something 
else I can help you with?" 
</P>
<P>
 A giant blue floor waxer, followed by a man who steers it, whirs by; together 
they're an ice-rink Zamboni for speckled tile floors. We step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 We browse. Nearby is the mountain of jellies. Then juices. Cosmetics. Toys. 
Then auto tires, camping gear, fishing lures, shoes, power tools, White Stag 
parkas. We stop in Garden, pick up some grass seed for those shady spots, and 
finally see customers: a whole family looking over the gas barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, at 2:09 a.m., a voice fills the store, an intercommed 
incantation: "All right, Receiving, let's go to lunch." As unseen workers break 
bread in the middle of their work day and the middle of our night, we take 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the only people we see are young men in white breather-masks with 
power blowers, blowing gum wrappers and litter from the daylight throngs off 
endless cement walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Loop's Restaurant, Montalvo. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee break. Mounted high on the wall is a small TV. Infomercials prevail, 
and as we lace into a pressed-turkey sandwich, an off-screen voice asks a young 
man: "When was the last time you had Ovaltine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Once she's served us, and we've paid up but linger over coffee, the waitress 
asks permission to go outside for a smoke. Soon we will leave, and as we back 
out of the lot, we see our waitress, sitting on a small chair in a quilted 
parka against the cold, alone in the headlights. She nods good night. It is the 
first time that things feel truly lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3:41 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Park, Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The fog has receded enough to see the city far below this magnificent 
promontory. Beneath a moonlit sky, Ventura is reduced to a seaside village of 
yellow street lights and a lamp-lighted pier extending into the black ocean. 
Three cars are parked up here: two, apparently, for romance, their occupants 
writhing about and steaming up windows; and a third, apparently, for a home. In 
the home on wheels, a beat-up old station wagon, a lone man sits upright in the 
passenger seat and watches all who approach; he is blocked from view, however, 
by cardboard that replaces the driver's side window. Good night, sir: It's time 
to leave well enough alone and head safely downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3:55 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 The Avenue (Ventura Avenue), Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell's Donuts is open, a man hard at work at the fryer. The door is ajar, 
lights on inside, at the Hell's Angels Ventura Chapter -- but no one in sight. 
And signs of life percolate in modest senior housing along West Warner Street: 
No fewer than four sets of windows flicker in such a way that the only light on 
inside is that of a TV. Have the TVs been on all night, balm and drug to 
insomniacs? Or are these Ventura's earliest of early birds? Are these the 
windows of the elderly ill, whose sleep is terminally disrupted? No matter. 
These people are in their own spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4:15 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Pier, Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier deck is black and shiny from the wet fog, now lifted. Two young men 
fish. One hooks the pier, the other asks the time from a visitor and looks away 
without saying anything. At the end of the pier, it is dark, the ocean black, 
the sway of the structure jilting. But nothing can prepare the nighthawk for 
the installed sculpture "Wavespout," which blows 10-foot jets of spray up into 
the darkness; the water vanishes, then reappears as it falls to the decking to 
the rhythm of whoosh, splat, whoosh, splat.  
</P>
<P>
 At the site of the sculpture a big hole has been cut into the pier. Down 
below, bright street lights mounted to the girders illuminate not only the 
sculpture's hydraulic workings but eerily light the mussel-encrusted pilings, 
swaying in a dense, ominous pea-green ocean chop. There is something both 
beautiful and hideous here. Both in and out of the natural order of things, 
"Wavespout" is perhaps Ventura County's most exotic sight, if not soulful 
company, in the middle of the night. If it's no Chrysler Building, it is a 
beacon to the place, and there is comfort, as well as soul, in that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5 A.M 
</P>
<P>
 Home. 
</P>
<P>
 A bed appears. Whoosh, splat.

GOINGS ON; ART EXHIBIT RECYCLES ITEMS OUT OF THE PAST; SUSAN TIBBLES OF 
MONTECITO TAKES ODDS AND ENDS AND 'MAKES THEM INTO SOMETHING THEY WEREN'T.'

 A tarnished silver teapot, with an elegantly gloved hand extending from it, 
sits atop a stack of old books, one a 1966 Los Angeles social directory. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-worn, heart-shaped cake pan, with a zipper separating in the middle, is 
encircled in barbed wire. The warning "No Fishing, No Hunting, No Trespassing" 
looms nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world of Montecito artist Susan Tibbles. And welcome to her 
latest exhibit, "Working Girls," on display at Santa Barbara's DesignArc 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 As in previous work, Tibbles used found objects to make the 32 pieces in the 
present exhibit. Hangers, dictionary pages, pencils, old photos, architectural 
designs and plenty more are all incorporated into the art. "I go once or twice 
a week and hit the antique stores and junk shops," Tibbles said. "I like to 
take objects and make them into something they weren't." 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; PSYCHOLOGICAL PUZZLER 'EQUUS' RIDES OFF IN SEARCH OF DIVINITY; 
CENTER STAGE THEATER'S REVIVAL CAPTURES MORE OF THE DARING THAN THE SUCCESS OF 
PETER SHAFFER'S HAUNTING PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 British playwright Peter Shaffer gets a lot of mileage out of anecdotal 
curiosities. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before his mega-hit "Amadeus" (inspired by an unsubstantiated deathbed 
confession attributed to a senile rival composer who claimed to have murdered 
Mozart), Shaffer left hoof prints on Broadway with his psychological puzzler 
"Equus," a drama based on the sketchy legend of a stable boy who blinded his 
horses for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case, Shaffer made no claim to historical authenticity. Instead, he 
constructed and explored the possible mental states that might have resulted in 
the circumstances described in these stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, he ended up writing the same play. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their surface differences, both "Amadeus" and "Equus" manage to find 
their way back to Shaffer's signature obsession -- the suffocating effect of 
so-called normality on the godlike dimensions of the human soul. 
</P>
<P>
 In each play, Shaffer's recurring structural device is the use of a narrator 
hopelessly mired in comfortable mediocrity but self-aware enough to recognize 
that rare, authentic divinity when it manifests itself in others. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that manifestation is in the effortless brilliance of Mozart or the 
tortured hallucinations of the inarticulate teen-ager in "Equus," they share a 
mystical union with a more complete world that lies outside the polite social 
boundaries we accept without question. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, their outsider status evokes the same kind of admiration and envy in 
Shaffer's voyeuristic narrators. Just as his devout composer Salieri heard in 
the mouth of the lewd, ill-mannered Mozart the divine voice to which he himself 
aspired, the psychiatrist Dysart who chronicles "Equus" tells of the mystical 
wellsprings that erupt with unfiltered purity in the stable boy placed in his 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, "Equus" was the more daring and successful of the two plays, 
although its current revival at Santa Barbara's Center Stage Theater captures 
more of the daring than the success. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer's writing still assaults our complacency with its elliptical 
storytelling and haunting, poetic imagery. Dysart (Nicholas Leland) sees all 
too clearly his role as a modern-day high priest of mediocrity -- trying to 
blunt the unique personal pain of each patient into socially acceptable 
numbness. His own recurring nightmare of presiding over ceremonial 
disembowelings in which he's lost his faith is the closest he gets to the voice 
of his own inner divinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Leland's performance as Dysart never convinces us that this man 
is really forced into self-scrutiny by his encounter with young Alan Strang 
(Jason Love). His monologues are too full of swagger and bombast, and what 
should evolve as a systematic corrosion of cherished beliefs comes across as 
pretentious and indulgent instead. 
</P>
<P>
 As the boy, Love effectively evokes sullen defiance in his initial meetings 
with Dysart, but misses the mark in the role's more demanding heights of 
Dionysian frenzy that explain Alan's bizarre mystical association of horses, 
God and sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 It's up to director Greg Lee's staging to convey Alan's psycho-sexual 
mysticism. There's no missing the point, especially in the portrayal of the 
horses by silent, slow-moving body-builder types wearing skeletal metal horse 
heads and little else. If you're a fan of gladiator movies, this is the play 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
 True to the script's confrontational intent, the production includes nudity 
and adult language; Theodore M. Dolas' tasteful lighting and Michael Mortilla's 
eerie musical effects help steer the tone toward cerebral rather than hormonal 
arousal. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable supporting performances include David Morris as Alan's repressed, 
hypocritical father; Jamie Gina Olsen as the uninhibited girl whose flirtation 
unknowingly triggers Alan's crisis of the psyche, and Leslie Gangl as the 
social worker who goads Dysart to "cure" the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 With less emphasis on Dysart's brooding ruminations, the second act's 
discovery and re-enactment of Alan's crisis and loss of innocence moves briskly 
and proves far more engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 It also proves a loss of innocence for the audience as well -- after what 
we've seen here, it will be hard to view the relationship between Wilbur and 
Mr. Ed in quite the same way again. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Equus."

<P>
 * WHEN: Through April 30, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 
p.m.

TIDBITS: WOOD RANCH BARBEQUE LOOKS FOR A LOCATION WHERE IT CAN LAUNCH ITS 
PLANNED EXPANSION. 
</P>

 Wood Ranch Barbeque and Grill of Moorpark could be part of a chain restaurant 
in the very near future. At least that's what Eric Anders, the head of the 
establishment, is hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking frantically to find another location, somewhere between 
Calabasas and Oxnard," he said. "We're looking for a high-traffic area with 
excellent parking and a neighborhood that has some businesses, so we can draw a 
good lunch business as well as dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Anders said the 2-year-old Barbeque and Grill was designed with the creation 
of a Southern California chain in mind. "We expect to open one or two a year," 
he said. "We draw so many people from Agoura to Ventura, it's what our 
customers are asking for." 
</P>
<P>
 The existing restaurant is located at 540 New Los Angeles Ave. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Here's a slightly premature "Welcome Home" for Mabel Chase, co-owner of the 
City Bakery and Cafe in Ventura, who will be back in Ventura County within two 
weeks. Chase, her husband George Keenen (the other co-owner) and their son have 
spent the past year in England. Keenen is expected back in May. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Chase does get here, look for at least one change at City Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has been serving dinners Wednesdays through Fridays since 
January. And now, said chef Reece Keck, the soon-to-return owner is looking to 
add Saturday nights to the lineup. "I could picture extending it even further 
this summer," Keck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keck, the original chef at Ventura's Voila Cafe (now Cafe Zack) has prepared 
the dinner menus -- which change weekly -- since the restaurant began featuring 
them. Each week's fare includes one fish, one poultry, one meat, one pasta, one 
pizza and one vegetarian dish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like that's going to meet everyone's requests," said Keck, "but it 
also gives me a lot to play with." Keck said she decides on specific menu items 
pretty much at the last moment. "It's just kind of whatever my mood is." 
</P>
<P>
 City Bakery is located at 2358-C Main St.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; TERRACE CAFFE AIMS TO SATISFY, NOT EXCITE; FINE-TUNING WILL 
HELP THE NEW EATERY CAPITALIZE ON ITS WELL PREPARED, MODERATELY PRICED BISTRO 
MENU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mammoth Lakes restaurateur Les Sarantinos had it with the cold and the snow 
sometime last year. So he came south and opened Terrace Caffe in Thousand Oaks. 
He's happier with the climes now. 
</P>
<P>
 We can all be happier that he's here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrace is an oddity in these parts: a smartly turned out bistro featuring 
eclectic American cuisine at low to moderate prices. True to the bistro 
tradition, the place is open seven days for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and 
features a small, focused menu for each. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear, as a result, that Sarantinos intends that his new baby become an 
old standby rather than a flash-in-the-pan, a dependable yet stylish nexus for 
the shopping and moviegoing crowd rather than special occasion hoopla house. 
That is good in the sense that the Terrace purposefully limits itself to a 
straightforward, homey cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also means the Terrace does not reach for dramatic culinary heights. 
Indeed, the food in several recent visits hewed more to the simply satisfying 
than memorably exciting -- and one dinner along the way was a plain flop. 
Overall, however, the batting average is high, and so the Terrace earns a solid 
place among those leading Ventura County restaurants that clearly establish a 
considered approach and deliver on it most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with onion soup ($3.50), a dense broth sweetened by the loads of fresh 
onion and topped (lightly, for once) with cheese. Pass on the clam chowder, 
Manhattan-style, which is a pleasant enough stew of fresh vegetables but light 
on clam flavor and bore one -- 1, to digitize it -- clam bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dependable appetizer is the quesadilla ($4.95), conventional in its 
combination of jack and Cheddar cheeses, green chilies and sour cream but done 
so freshly and well that the commonplace becomes distinctive. You won't do 
badly, either, to start with a Caesar salad ($5.95 as a virtual meal or an 
alternate to an included dinner salad), even if its pleasantly pungent dressing 
is prepared ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The single best entree in recent visits was the chicken brochette ($8.95). 
This dish vexes the most able of chefs because its skewered ingredients -- 
marinated white-meat chicken, onion, bell peppers, zucchini -- all cook at 
different rates. But here everything comes out right: tender, flavorful, 
just-cooked chicken and vegetables that manage to remain al dente. Placed 
alongside perfect rice and herbaceous, sauteed zucchini and fresh tomato 
pieces, the dish best captures the Terrace's pared down but sophisticated 
bistro style. It is also a dinner bargain at this price. 
</P>
<P>
 Grilled salmon, a special ($11.95) one night, was a generous belly cut, 
perfectly cooked, and set adrift in a light dill sauce. Marring the 
presentation and jarring the flavor, however, was the kitchen's incongruous 
ladling of brown gravy over the accompanying mashed potatoes. (The server would 
have done well to ask first before doing the generic home-style treatment to 
every dish.) Grilled halibut steak with herbed butter ($11.95) was perfectly 
turned out and presented. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the great flop, an apparent anomaly, was the dish that probably 
begot the original bistro: grilled half chicken ($9.75). The Terrace's menu 
identifies this entree as garlic chicken that is "prepared in limited quantity 
. . . to ensure freshness." What arrived on the plate, however, was the 
opposite: old precooked chicken that had done so much heated-up, hang-around 
time that the meat was dry, stringy, overcooked, flavorless. Had garlic ever 
been present, it was cooked away completely. 
</P>
<P>
 A delightful choice from among a half-dozen or so pastas available is the 
classic, simple cappellini with tomatoes and fresh garlic ($8.25). This is an 
epic portion of firm angel hair pasta fragrant with fresh basil. The dish is 
restorative, light, true to its essential flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts show well. Both pecan pie and apple pie are fresh, intensely focused 
in flavor, and, in a show of intelligent restraint, veer to the sparer side of 
sweetening. Indeed, the apple pie, tart and crunchy in the pile of thin-sliced 
fruit, masquerades as health food with a mile-high granola crunch topping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrace has a small list of California wines chosen as much for their 
bistro-right price points as their worthiness. To wit, the always pleasing 
Kendall Jackson Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay tops out the list at $18. Happily, 
all wines are available by the glass, from $3.25 for a Spanish sparkler to 
$4.95 for the KJ Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 With some fine tuning, Terrace Caffe will easily capitalize on the position it 
has begun to secure in a market that needs a dependable, cheerful, moderately 
priced bistro. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Terrace Caffe. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 105 Brazil St., Thousand Oaks, 379-3811. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Open seven days for breakfast, lunch and dinner from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.; 
10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Major credit cards. Dinner for two, food only: $25 to $40.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PRISON FUNDING VOTED BY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON and ALAN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prodded by Southern California lawmakers, the House voted overwhelmingly 
Wednesday to require the federal government to either repay state and local 
governments for the cost of imprisoning criminals who are illegal immigrants or 
transfer them to federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The reimbursement provision, added to the House's version of the crime bill by 
a vote of 402 to 22, would require the federal government to deliver on a 
promise that has remained unfulfilled for eight years. Before it can become 
law, however, the Senate would also have to give its approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the payments would not become mandatory until after 1998, the chief 
sponsors of the measure said the Clinton Administration is committed to 
spending sizable amounts of money before then to relieve financial burdens on 
California and other states with high numbers of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 California has projected that 18,000 undocumented felons in its prisons will 
cost the state about $375 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an historic step," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), a 
co-sponsor of the measure. "We never got one cent before (for imprisoning 
illegal immigrants), but now we'll get a decent amount and we'll build on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In another action aimed at controlling illegal immigration from Mexico, the 
House authorized expansion of the Border Patrol by 6,000 agents over the next 
five years. The agency now has 4,100 agents. 
</P>
<P>
 That provision, sponsored by Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon), Randy (Duke) 
Cunningham (R-San Diego) and Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), would cost $921 
million and would have to compete with other domestic priorities in the annual 
appropriations process. 
</P>
<P>
 While the House's 417-12 vote of approval showed very strong support for 
expanding the Border Patrol, a Senate crime bill -- which will have to be 
reconciled with the House version -- contains no comparable provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman acknowledged that the Administration would oppose language in the 
prisoner-reimbursement amendment that would make the payments mandatory, 
contending the cost would be too high. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) said the 
Administration gave assurances that some reimbursement would be forthcoming, 
although they did not mention a specific amount. 
</P>
<P>
 If the provision becomes law, the federal government would have four years to 
pay the costs through the annual appropriations process. Starting Oct. 1, 1998, 
however, the provision would require full compensation to states and local 
governments for imprisoning criminals who are illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the measure faces an uncertain fate when it reaches a Senate-House 
conference committee, it has the backing of Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), the 
powerful chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles lawmakers hailed the reimbursement provision as a major advance in 
the long struggle to get the federal government to pay part of the financial 
costs of illegal immigration that fall disproportionately on California, New 
York, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois and a few other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely significant," Beilenson said. "This is the first time that, in 
fact, we'll be requiring, mandating, repayment by the federal government of 
these costs to states." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cost of keeping a prisoner in California is $18,000. The 
administration of Gov. Pete Wilson has projected the cost of housing more than 
18,000 undocumented felons -- or nearly 14% of the state's total prison 
population -- to be $375 million in this fiscal year. In Los Angeles County, 
the cost is estimated at $34 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided that states are entitled 
to reimbursement for the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants, but Congress 
has never appropriated the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the House approved the controversial Racial Justice 
Act by the narrowest of margins when a proposed substitute failed on a 212-212 
tie vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, sponsored by Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), would bar the 
execution of prisoners who demonstrate that the death penalty was imposed 
because of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) argued that the provision would nullify the 
decisions of juries and impose racial quotas for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the proposal denied that it would impose quotas, arguing that it 
would instead tend to eliminate sentencing decisions based on race. Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley, who rarely casts a vote, sided with Edwards and rounded up 
enough other supporters in a last-minute lobbying effort to save the provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the legislation, Death Row inmates could use statistics on racial 
disparity to appeal their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans account for about 40% of the inmates executed since 1977, 
the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund has found. Studies also have shown 
that criminals are far more likely be executed if their victims were white. 
Eighty-four percent of inmates put to death in the last 17 years had committed 
their crimes against whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial discrimination was a significant factor in the Supreme Court's 1972 
ruling that overturned capital punishment statutes. In the years since that 
ruling, however, most states have adopted new death penalty laws intended to 
eliminate disparities in sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate fate of the provision is uncertain because, again, the House bill 
must be reconciled with the Senate anti-crime legislation, which did not touch 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action on the crime bill, the House approved establishment of a 
police corps that would provide college scholarships in return for a four-year 
commitment to serve with a police force, comparable to the Reserve Officers' 
Training Corps. The vote was 250-174.

launching the most striking reorganization of the city's bureaucracy in recent 
memory.

 Nearly 10 months after he was swept into office by an electorate wearied by 
crime and recession, Riordan's first annual financial plan uncovers enough new 
sources of money to continue building toward his central campaign pledge of 
adding 3,000 officers to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.3-billion municipal budget, presented in a formal address to the City 
Council, proposes the first substantial increases in municipal services since 
Los Angeles skidded into economic hard times in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Together, we will create a safer Los Angeles and make Los Angeles friendly 
for business," Riordan said at the conclusion of a 14-minute speech. "Together, 
we will create a leaner, more efficient government and get our own house in 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fiscal year beginning July 1, the mayor said he would like to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase the number of police on duty by about 20%. About 450 officers would 
be added to the Los Angeles Police Department, which will number about 7,737 by 
the time the budget is enacted. The equivalent of 1,072 more officers would hit 
the streets by expanding overtime payments and moving desk officers into 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 * Double the repaving of the city's streets, from 100 miles a year to 200 
miles. More substantial road repairs would also increase significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate the full-time board that oversees the city's public works projects 
in favor of a single administrator and consolidate nine different departments 
into two new super-agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove a 7.5% surcharge on business taxes that was imposed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Halt three years of staff reductions at parks and libraries so that service 
can be maintained at current levels for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than double the city's modest expenditures to wipe out graffiti and 
provide seed money for a public relations campaign to polish the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
 The alluring prospect of more police and other programs without tax increases 
won the mayor's plan immediate praise from most of the City Council, which will 
begin hearings on the plan next month and must approve or reject its 
recommendations by June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has pulled off something I didn't think he could pull off," said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chair of the council's Budget and Finance 
Committee. "The guts of this thing are sound and compelling, although there may 
be some questions around the periphery." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon called the budget very innovative, but said he will 
press the mayor on, among other things, the need to eliminate the full-time 
Board of Public Works. Councilman Nate Holden also said he will back most of 
the package, but will ask that the Department of Aging not be consolidated with 
other social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg questioned the underlying assumption that the 
police force should be expanded at the expense of other city programs. "I don't 
think we should be putting everything in one basket," she said. "We should be 
doing things to find jobs and provide programs for young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the city privately had doubted that the businessman-turned-mayor could 
finance such an ambitious agenda. To pay for the initiatives, Riordan proposes 
an array of measures. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to raise $75 million from the Department of Water and Power by 
selling some of its assets, such as fuel and land. He would reduce by $17 
million contributions to a pension system that serves half of the city's 44,000 
employees. He plans to continue a freeze on hiring in most city departments. In 
an accounting maneuver, he would take $20 million from the harbor and $13 
million from the airport by shuffling expenses into their accounts. And he 
would raise another $28 million by using debt instead of cash to maintain 
landfills and to pay the city's share of the Metro Rail subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Set aside, for the time being, are more dramatic and potentially divisive 
plans to turn trash collection and many other municipal operations over to 
private firms and to sell or lease Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan said he will go ahead with a more modest plan to test 
privatization -- by asking for bids from firms to issue parking tickets on the 
city's Westside. A private firm will be able to generate an additional $9 
million a year by issuing more tickets than city workers, who are often 
redirected into traffic enforcement and other duties, said one Administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 With privatization largely on the back burner, the budget debate is likely to 
focus on three areas: Are the efficiencies gained in consolidating city 
departments worth the potential loss of identity and effectiveness of those 
departments? Can the expanded police force and other new programs be sustained, 
once one-time budget fixes, like the sale of DWP assets, have been exhausted? 
And will airlines object, or even go to court, to block the use of airport 
revenues to pay for city programs? 
</P>
<P>
 Women's groups are expected to mobilize in opposition to a plan that lumps the 
Commission on the Status of Women into a new Community Services Department, 
along with all or part of what are now five discrete departments. An industry 
representative has said airlines will "pursue all avenues available" to prevent 
Riordan from charging city expenses to airport accounts. Environmental groups, 
including Heal the Bay, have already written City Council members to protest 
the proposed disbandment of the Board of Public Works, which they said is 
responsible for reducing sewage pollutants dumped into the ocean. And, just 
four years after the creation of a city Housing Department was hailed as the 
solution to the city's affordable-housing crunch, a coalition of nonprofit 
organizations will be fighting to preserve the agency's independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's Administration has prepared responses for each interest group that 
might raise objections, but the central defense of his plan will be the need to 
improve public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "A safer city is the best welcome mat we can put out for new jobs and a 
stronger economy," Riordan said in his council address. 
</P>
<P>
 In drawing the new budget, Riordan had to contend with a $228-million deficit 
caused mainly by reduced tax revenues, and find $83.4 million to continue his 
police expansion known as "Project Safety Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said the combination of new hiring, overtime payments and 
reorganization outlined in his budget will take the Police Department one-third 
of the way through the expansion he promised last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan would add 2,855 officers to the department over five years, which is 
slightly less ambitious than his campaign pledge of 3,000 new officers over 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even reaching the lower goal will be problematic because of the high number of 
officers retiring or quitting and the difficulty in training masses of new 
recruits. Riordan's plan had anticipated, for example, that the force would be 
at 7,951 officers by July 1, but it will actually be 214 officers short of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's call for reasonable pay raises for police and firefighters drew 
his first applause from the crowd in the council chambers. He has set aside $25 
million for employee raises, which would be enough to give public safety 
employees about 2.5% more in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets the police are patrolling should also be smoother under Riordan's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 By shifting $30 million in funds usually reserved for shuttle buses and other 
transit programs to street repairs, Riordan proposes doubling resurfacing to 
the 200 miles a year recommended by the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance. 
Riordan said the transfer of the money to street repairs will not harm any 
existing transit programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the city's 6,500-mile street system has become badly rutted because of 
deferred maintenance. An aide said the mayor wants to spend so much on road 
repairs because "it's a part of improving the quality of life in the city" and 
money was available in the transit fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In other program initiatives, Riordan would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Double to $2 million the funding for Operation Clean Sweep, an anti-graffiti 
program that hires community organizations to paint and scrub out urban scrawl. 
A related program would increase the number of welfare recipients cleaning 
graffiti, sweeping alleys and pulling weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Double to $250,000 the funding for the Human Relations Commission, to 
increase classes and mediation sessions to help reduce religious, racial and 
cultural disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give $2 million in seed money to the New Los Angeles Marketing Partnership, 
a fledgling coalition of government, business and tourism organizations that 
hopes to improve the region's image. Another $2 million would be spent on 
business retention and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's most controversial proposals are likely to be his initiatives that 
streamline city operations. 
</P>
<P>
 He would form a new Citywide Development Agency -- combining the current 
Community Redevelopment Agency, Housing Department and parts of the Community 
Development Department. The move will allow for a more focused, comprehensive 
strategy to promote development and business retention, Riordan argued. 
</P>
<P>
 The second consolidation would lump together a half dozen small operations 
into a Community Services Department. The Department would combine the 
Commission on the Status of Women, the Human Relations Commission, the 
Department of Aging, the Department of Social Services, the city's Child Care 
Coordinator and the remainder of the Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Riordan would eliminate the five-member Board of Public Works that 
oversees the operation of sewers, streets and refuse collection. The mayor said 
a single department head can be held more accountable than five appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he spent much of his first 10 months in office searching for money to 
pay for such improvements, Riordan made only passing reference to how he found 
the money to fill the budget deficit and pay for new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a quarter of the money will come from the semi-independent harbor, 
airport and water and power departments. For the first time, for instance, the 
mayor proposes charging the cost of operating an LAPD substation at LAX to the 
airport fund. And a host of road repairs in the harbor area that normally would 
have come out of general tax revenues will now be charged to the Harbor 
Department, which is supported by rents and fees paid by shipping firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the corporate-speak that now imbues the mayor's office, staffers refer to 
the departments as "profit centers" that should return adequate dividends to 
"the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines have objected to such budgeting maneuvers, saying that fees they pay 
should be used strictly for aviation-related expenses at LAX. And harbor-area 
Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. said Wednesday that he will be checking closely 
to see that his district gets service improvements equivalent to the funds 
being removed from port activities. "If we are going to send $20 million 
Downtown, we want to see those better roads and increase in police," Svorinich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * POTENTIAL OBSTACLES: Attempts to revamp bureaucracy will face opposition. B1 
Financial Plan for Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan presented his proposed 1994-95 budget to the Los Angeles 
City Council on Wednesday. Key proposals in the $4.3-billion plan include: 
</P>
<P>
 POLICE: $83.4 million to hire new officers and provide supplemental overtime 
for existing officers. A net increase of 450 new officers is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 STREETS: $30 million to double the number of streets resurfaced and increase 
street reconstruction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 REORGANIZATION: $13.8 million to be saved by eliminating 196 jobs already 
vacant and another 175 jobs through attrition. An additional $2.3 million will 
be saved by consolidating several departments into a new Community Services 
Department and disbanding the Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at how each dollar in Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's 
proposed $4.3-billion budget for 1994-95 would be spent: 
</P>
<P>
 34.9 cents: Community safety (police, fire and public assistance) 
</P>
<P>
 30.4 cents: Home and community environment (includes collection and disposal 
of sewage and solid waste, planning and building code enforcement) 
</P>
<P>
 11.7 cents: Transportation (streets and highways, traffic control) 
</P>
<P>
 10.9 cents: Human resources, economic assistance and development 
</P>
<P>
 7.5 cents: General administration and support 
</P>
<P>
 4.6 cents: Culture, education and recreation 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing the Force 
</P>
<P>
 How the $83.4 million proposed for police breaks down: 
</P>
<P>
 $53.9 million for supplemental overtime and "buying back" days off. Will 
provide the annual equivalent of 832 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 $22.1 million to hire 780 officers. After attrition, a net increase of 450 
officers is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 $6.8 million to hire 240 civilians for technical, administrative and clerical 
jobs. This will allow a similar number of officers to return to field duty. 
</P>
<P>
 $ 0.6 million in additional overtime for civilian employees.

PUC PLAN WOULD ALLOW CHOICE OF UTILITY FIRMS; ELECTRICITY: PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED 
TO CUT PRICES. ENVIRONMENTALISTS FEAR SETBACK FOR THEIR CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposing the most dramatic overhaul ever of how Californians get electric 
power, the state Public Utilities Commission said Wednesday that it wants to 
let customers of the state's three big investor-owned utilities choose their 
own power source by the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Going further than experts had expected in its campaign to cut electric prices 
-- by breaking the utilities' monopoly on power generation -- the PUC said it 
would introduce choice in 1996 for large industrial customers of Southern 
California Edison Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller industrial users would be added in 1998 and small-business customers 
in 1999. And if the PUC sticks with the plan after a set of public hearings to 
begin June 14, the three utilities' more than 8 million residential users will 
be free to select their power supplier beginning in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 For customers, buying electric power will be like buying long-distance 
telephone service. Customers will choose their power company, and the local 
utility -- which till now has enjoyed monopoly status within its geographic 
turf -- will simply deliver the power to their door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fundamental shift on the national scene," said Jan Hamrin, an energy 
expert and consultant to the National Assn. of Regulatory Utility 
Commissioners. "It will probably set a standard for everyone to focus on." A 
few states have launched experiments in electric deregulation, but none has 
proposed going so far as the PUC plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission hopes that competition among producers will significantly lower 
Californians' electricity bills. But consumer activists objected Wednesday to 
several aspects of the PUC's scheme -- including a plan for ratepayers to pay 
off some big, existing utility investments, largely in nuclear power plants, 
that critics say were the companies' own mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering the costs of such investments -- and the new way that the commission 
proposes to regulate utilities in the future -- could stick consumers with 
higher costs instead of savings, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a system completely stacked in favor of the utilities," said Michel 
P. Florio, senior attorney for Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a San 
Francisco-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists expressed concern that wide-open competition -- with the 
winners being those power producers who can make electricity most cheaply -- 
will erode the state's decades-long commitment to renewable and environmentally 
preferable energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would have no direct affect on power customers in the city of Los 
Angeles, who get electricity from the municipally owned Department of Water and 
Power, or in other cities with municipal utilities, including Glendale, 
Burbank, Pasadena, Anaheim, Riverside and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "But clearly it will have an impact on us," said Michael T. Moore, director of 
public and governmental affairs for the DWP, whose rates now are 15% to 20% 
below those of Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities had opposed deregulation through more than a year of public -- 
if obscure -- debate, but the commission proposal appears to offer them a 
buffer against the worst potential financial damage from deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 They had feared that their shareholders would be left to pay off long-term 
investments in power plants that won't be competitive under the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities also had worried about losing their large industrial customers, 
some of which already have been moving operations out of state in search of 
cheaper electricity. Had the commission allowed only such customers to shop for 
power, small-business and residential ratepayers might have seen dramatic rate 
hikes as they shouldered more of the utilities' overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like a thoughtful, well-conceived plan," said John E. Bryson, 
chairman and chief executive of Southern California Edison and its parent, 
SCEcorp. It both gives customers choice, he said, and provides "fairness to all 
customer groups and to utility investors who supported the development of the 
infrastructure that we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors seemed to signal initial agreement, though utility shares generally 
were strong in stock trading Wednesday. PG&E rose 62.5 cents to $29.625, 
SCEcorp added 12.5 cents to $16.625 and SDG&E gained 50 cents to $22.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC also endorsed the utilities' ideas for how they would earn profits in 
the regulated portion of their business that will remain basically monopolistic 
-- the delivery of electricity to homes and businesses, from whatever source. 
</P>
<P>
 All three utilities want to switch away from the traditional ratemaking 
process, which allows them to charge ratepayers the cost of their services plus 
a regulated profit. 
</P>
<P>
 They prefer a system known as performance-based ratemaking, which ties their 
earnings not to how much power they sell, but to their efficiency. If they cut 
operating costs below an annual goal set by the commission, the utilities want 
to be able to split the difference between savings to ratepayers and profit to 
their shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners also expect utilities to find new markets outside their 
traditional service territories, just as utilities from other parts of the 
country are expected to enter the electricity business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon said Wednesday that he would expect a 
regional spot market in electricity to develop, with prices updated every hour 
or half hour, as now exists in England and Wales. That would let utilities sell 
their excess power into a national transmission system for use wherever there 
was customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmentalists expressed concern about damage to the state's 
policy of encouraging diverse sources of energy, which dates to the first 
Middle East oil crisis in 1973. The oil shock hit California harder than any 
state in the nation. The Legislature and regulators quickly moved to encourage 
non-fossil fuels, such as wind, solar and geothermal power. 
</P>
<P>
 As the commission deliberated, Conlon argued for a rate surcharge in the new 
system to continue such support. But Wednesday's proposal leaves customers only 
the option of specifying -- perhaps by marking a box on their bill -- that they 
want their power purchased from one of these sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, such energy sources will be left to compete with all the others -- 
including a new class of dramatically efficient natural gas turbines -- and 
environmentalists say some will be hard-pressed to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent power producers also were furious over a PUC decision -- also 
announced Wednesday -- to hold off resolution of a bitter dispute over 
renewable energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities have protested an auction that would have meant more than $1 
billion worth of power contracts for independent producers. The commissioners 
said they would hold off adjudicating the dispute until after hearings are held 
on the deregulation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the commission's first step into a competitive future, they've tripped," 
said an angry Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of Sacramento-based 
Independent Energy Producers. He objected that further delays leave these 
companies with an uncertain financial future and expressed concern that the 
commission may not live up to the rules of the auction, which were set up years 
ago.

QUAKE REVEALS WIDESPREAD BUILDING DEFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By tearing open walls and roofs, the Northridge earthquake has exposed 
construction defects in a variety of structures, leading some experts to blame 
poor workmanship and lapses in code enforcement for much of the devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months since the earthquake, building inspectors, engineers and 
others have found growing evidence of faulty construction -- ranging from 
haphazard nailing to missing grout in a brick wall that collapsed inside a San 
Fernando Valley fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 Each flaw by itself -- such as the controversial use of box nails instead of 
thicker common nails in wood-frame buildings -- may seem insignificant, even 
esoteric. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts say the cumulative effect of such errors weakened structural 
integrity and contributed substantially to the billions of dollars in damage 
sustained in the magnitude 6.8 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least one-third or more" of the quake damage "could be directly attributed 
to shoddy construction," said structural engineer Nabih Youssef, who is 
chairman of Mayor Richard Riordan's Blue-Ribbon Panel on Seismic Hazard 
Reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damage and major failure would have been prevented if we had better quality 
control," Youssef said. 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement and building performance problems have been noted after 
earlier disasters, most recently in 1992 after Hurricane Andrew swept through 
South Florida, where a grand jury blamed poor construction for much of the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, authorities have yet to determine the exact extent of such 
lapses. But experts agree that some of the sloppiest work can be found in 
wood-frame apartment buildings, condominiums and single-family tract homes, 
which were the subject of a recent USC study on quake-resistant construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by the National Science Foundation, the study found that on the 
average, at least one-third of the seismic safety items checked by researchers 
were either missing or flawed in 40% of wood-frame structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The documented defects included missing "shear wall hold-downs" and anchor 
bolts, the metal devices designed to hold walls to the foundation and prevent 
them from pulling out or sliding; improperly sized and placed nails meant to 
reinforce wood framing, and missing "wall-to-wall straps," the ties designed to 
hold each story together and transfer earthquake forces to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the yearlong project published in August, architecture graduate 
students examined 300 units in about 70 new housing developments, mainly in 
Southern California. The study also involved a mail survey asking architects 
and engineers how closely contractors had followed their designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is alarming that key items to resist seismic load are among those which 
are most frequently missing or flawed," wrote architecture professor G. G. 
Schierle, who supervised the study. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Schierle said he and his students returned to many sites, 
which he would not identify, after the Northridge quake and found "that a lot 
of damage can be traced back to these faulty constructions." 
</P>
<P>
 David Hoadley, president of the American Construction Inspectors Assn., said 
that he and other private inspectors who helped Los Angeles building officials 
after the earthquake noted similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say overall, as a general rule, the major structural damage occurred 
because they weren't constructed properly," Hoadley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Links between alleged construction flaws and earthquake damage are already 
being drawn in the courts, although experts say they expect more suits to be 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first-known lawsuits stemming directly from the earthquake, the 
families of victims of the Northridge Meadows collapse are blaming the deaths 
on the way the 22-year-old apartment complex was built. Sixteen people were 
crushed to death or suffocated when the three-story building's second floor 
plunged onto the first. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for six of the victims' families, Joel Castro, alleged that his 
experts have identified many building flaws, including nails, joist hangers, 
metal supporting pipes and other key components that were smaller and weaker 
than those specified in the plans. In some instances, Castro said, those items 
were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 But expert reviews are still under way and even if building defects are 
confirmed, it will be difficult to prove that they, rather than the 
earthquake's ground motion, caused the collapse, said Robert M. Freedman, an 
attorney for building owners Shashikant and Renuka Jogani. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also be difficult to prove exactly what the apartment complex's 
building plans called for, Freedman said, because the official, city-approved 
set of blueprints has yet to be found. Castro's set, he contended, is not 
city-stamped and may not represent the final plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, however, said his set of plans came from the apartment complex's 
builder and original owner, and are not labeled as preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented with evidence of earthquake damage, a Pasadena Superior Court jury 
last week awarded nearly $6.35 million to 15 condominium owners whose attorney 
cited the problems as proof that the five-year-old complex had been poorly 
built. The 2-year-old case, filed on behalf of the 515 S. Orange Grove Owners 
Assn., blamed faulty construction for leaky windows, doors and roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake, fire sprinklers were rattled so violently that they sliced 
through the ceiling, helping to corroborate claims that the condos were not 
structurally sound, said Lee Barker, the plaintiffs' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Bruce Gridley, who defended condominium builders Victor and 
Evangeline Illig, said Barker exaggerated the damage and successfully played 
upon the jurors' general dread of temblors. "It was the fear, I think, that 
prompted the jury to do what they did," said Gridley, who was considering an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys pressing similar suits hope to turn quake damage to their 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary W. Verboon, representing the Newhall-Hidden Valley subdivision in the 
Santa Clarita Valley in a suit over alleged grading deficiencies, said in an 
interview that the quake caused damage to chimneys, tile roofs and interior 
walls that led to the discovery of defective construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the builder, Urban West Communities, noted that the tract is "not 
too far" from a spot in the Santa Susana Mountains that scientists say grew 15 
inches from the force of the quake. "I certainly think the construction there 
performed well," Gregory L. Dillion said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calabasas, condominium owners in the Steeplechase development have alleged 
for more than two years that flimsy construction was contributing to persistent 
leaks from roofs, windows and doors. After the quake, city inspectors 
red-tagged 29 of the 4-year-old project's 240 units, including four buildings. 
City building officials later identified missing and improperly installed shear 
walls, the reinforced panels designed to resist an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Such construction problems are commonplace, said attorney Alexander Robertson, 
who is representing the Steeplechase Homeowners' Assn. against the builder, 
Oxford Development. "In mass-produced projects, meaning tract homes and condo 
projects, the vast majority are fraught with construction defects ranging from 
the nuisance level to sometimes life-threatening safety issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Morrow, who is representing the builder, did not return phone calls 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has exposed construction defects in a variety of structures, 
although experts say they are most prevalent in wood-frame residential 
buildings that are often quickly and cheaply built. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northridge, Fire Station 70 sustained an estimated $300,000 to $400,000 in 
quake damage ranging from the collapsed brick wall inside the dormitory to a 
buckled shear wall that rendered the main garage door inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials were particularly concerned by the failure of the brick 
wall -- part of which came down on a firefighter's bed -- because their 
post-quake inspections revealed that portions lacked any grout. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a glaring defect that should have been obvious to inspectors, said City 
Architect Bill Holland, and one that prompted an investigation of the 
14-year-old firehouse for similar oversights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having the grout there was like having a window frame with no glass in 
it," Holland said. The fire station, closed since the quake, is scheduled to 
reopen this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Anaheim officials are trying to determine whether design or 
construction flaws are to blame for the collapse of the Sony Jumbotron 
scoreboard at the city-owned Anaheim Stadium. The multi-ton scoreboard, about 
50 miles from the earthquake's epicenter, collapsed onto hundreds of seats 
after supporting steel beams snapped in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor workmanship -- and inspections -- appear to be contributing factors in 
the cracking of beams and welds in some steel frame buildings, said Youssef, 
the head of Los Angeles' seismic safety panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every joint that was opened, (engineers) found the same imperfection of 
the weld," Youssef said. "Inspectors should have detected it and they didn't. 
Some of it was there from Day One." 
</P>
<P>
 Code lapses of one type have been so widespread that the Los Angeles City 
Department of Building and Safety issued an advisory nearly two years ago 
instructing building designers to compensate for the problem in their 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 The department had found that in many buildings, slimmer-shanked box nails 
were being used instead of stronger common nails specified in plans. Builders 
had used the weaker nails because they are easier to use in nail guns, saving 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The city memo in 1992 told architects to assume builders would use the weaker 
nails, then to over-design the nailing requirements by 20% in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Department spokesman Nick Delli Quadri said it is difficult for inspectors to 
tell a box nail from a common nail once it has been set, so officials decided 
to change the design requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Delli Quadri and other building officials contacted by The Times said their 
departments are chronically understaffed. Last year, the city of Los Angeles 
cut 100 building inspectors, or about 20% of its force. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not uncommon during the 1980s building boom, he and building officials 
from other jurisdictions said, for inspectors around the state to cram a dozen 
or more site visits into an eight-hour day, with time allotted for lunch breaks 
and writing reports. That means inspectors typically spend no more than 15 or 
30 minutes on each project with an increasingly long list of regulations to 
enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are simply spread too thin," said Andrew Adelman, the top building 
official for San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 In wood-frame construction, inspectors commonly visit the site at five key 
points: pouring the foundation, framing, installation of the electrical and 
plumbing systems, the roof and the final walk-through. But officials said the 
public should not assume that those visits guarantee a flawless building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is this," said Tom Remillard, superintendent of building for 
Los Angeles County. "We as code enforcement officials rely on the professional 
expertise of the builders licensed to do the job, and we are there to spot 
check their work because we don't have continuous inspection for all types of 
construction." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hurricane Andrew left $18 billion in insured losses, a Dade County grand 
jury called for a sweeping overhaul of code enforcement practices, blaming much 
of the destruction on shoddy construction and local government's failure to 
adequately police builders. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by that costly disaster -- as well as the Mexico City earthquake in 
1985, the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and South Carolina's Hurricane Hugo in 
1989 -- the property insurance industry plans to start rating local building 
departments next year, as it already does with fire departments. A poor grade, 
to be determined by detailed questionnaires, would result in higher insurance 
premiums for residents and in turn, insurers hope, put pressure on local 
officials to improve code enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program will evaluate whether the code that has been adopted is in fact 
being enforced," said Eugene Lecomte, president of the Boston-based Insurance 
Institute for Property Loss Reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Youssef is proposing creation of a specialized team of city 
inspectors that would receive training in seismic-resistant construction to 
better understand the importance of key connections and how an earthquake's 
forces travel through a building. 
</P>
<P>
 And city building officials and state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) are 
advancing similar proposals that would compel engineers and architects to visit 
construction sites to ensure their plans are carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts widely agree that many errors occur in the field because contractors 
often need help interpreting building plans, but owners are reluctant to pay 
for their designers to be available on the site. The presence of the designer 
would also add another level of oversight, USC architect Schierle suggested in 
his study. 
</P>
<P>
 "To ignore the problems with construction quality control and blame future 
losses as 'acts of God,' despite the fact that we have the means to mitigate 
them, is irresponsible," he wrote.

AFRICA'S FORMER PARIAH IS NOW A POTENT FUTURE FORCE; ECONOMICS: A POWERHOUSE IS 
EXPECTED AFTER SOUTH AFRICANS VOTE. THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE FILLED WITH HOPE, FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Newspapers in Nigeria breathlessly reported a few years ago that the South 
African army planned to bomb Africa's most populous country because of 
Nigeria's tough stand against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, South Africa never planned such an attack. But Nigerians, like most 
people in Africa, figured the evil, white-controlled regime in Pretoria was 
capable of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Nigerian newspapers are worried about South Africa again. But this time 
the Nigerians are warning that their three decades as the most influential 
country in sub-Saharan Africa are about to end, with democracy arriving in 
South Africa and Nigeria still struggling under military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even South Africa is going to get democracy before us," lamented the Guardian 
newspaper in a recent editorial in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 After the elections next week, South Africa will finally shed its pariah 
status among the 40 other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and, just as 
quickly, it will become the continent's economic powerhouse, political model 
and, perhaps, leader as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But many African leaders are now asking whether South Africa will become the 
locomotive that leads Africa out of its economic and political valley, or will 
it lure Africa's brightest people, creating a brain drain on the continent? 
Will a black-governed South Africa remember that Africa stood behind it through 
years of liberation struggle? Or will it, instead, use its clout to dominate 
and run roughshod over the continent? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many people in Africa who are clearly very nervous," said Eugene 
Nyati, director of the Center for African Studies in Johannesburg, a business 
consultant group. "We are bigger. We are stronger. And once you are powerful, 
it doesn't matter if you are a white or black government. You sometimes have a 
tendency to take advantage of weaker people." 
</P>
<P>
 Rakiya Omaar, a Somali and co-director of African Rights in London, said the 
continent is anticipating South Africa's new government "with a combination of 
hope, pride and trepidation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every African and every black person has felt that South Africa's struggle 
was their own," she said. "They feel they also have suffered for South African 
liberation. And they hope that will not be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Africa may, in fact, be in for a shock when, as is expected, the African 
National Congress and its leader, Nelson Mandela, come to power. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the new government will be preoccupied with domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be under pressure to build houses for tens of thousands of 
shack-dwellers, bring electricity to the impoverished townships, increase 
opportunities for blacks in business and raise the level of black education to 
current white levels. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, African countries hoping for development assistance from South 
Africa, something once gladly provided by white governments seeking to win 
friends on the continent, will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "African countries would love to do business with South Africa," Nyati said. 
"But, quite frankly, there isn't much they can sell us. Even with countries 
like Nigeria, there is nothing we can buy from them. Even petroleum, we can get 
from Angola." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 4% of South Africa's foreign trade occurs in Africa now, compared to 34% 
with Europe and 10% with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa will also be preoccupied with dismantling the apartheid system. 
</P>
<P>
 "To think that we can deal with all our own problems and have time and money 
left over for Burundi is crazy," said one official with close links to the 
ANC's foreign affairs department. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be some moral and political debts to pay in Africa as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, African countries could agree on little besides their opposition to 
apartheid. They banded together, filling the halls of the United Nations with 
their demands for sanctions and for the release of Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC president, who has made personal visits to thank many African 
countries since his release in 1990, has promised "sensitivity and 
self-restraint in our dealings with the rest of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the talk on the campaign trail in South Africa has already rankled some 
African leaders. Even some ANC leaders are saying that other countries in 
Africa, with their self-inflicted wounds, are complete failures and bad 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things may sour quickly if people with short memories and no sense of loyalty 
or identification with Africa are allowed a very big role within the ANC," said 
Omaar of African Rights. "I hope their foreign policy will be dominated by 
people, like Mandela, who remember the assistance and brotherhood that we 
extended." 
</P>
<P>
 But any economic cooperation between South Africa and the rest of the 
continent will have to be, in the words of black and white business leaders 
here, "mutually beneficial." In other words, there will be no handouts and no 
trade pacts that do not provide clear economic benefits for South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have always said we will be the locomotive that drives the African 
economy," said Greg Mills, director of studies at the South African Institute 
of International Affairs. "But there will have to be a harmony of interests. 
And, in many countries, that seems a fairly scant prospect." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the new South African government will want to forge diplomatic and 
economic ties with the rest of Africa, especially among its neighbors. South 
Africa will be an important partner in the battle against a host of problems in 
the region, including the smuggling of drugs, cattle and arms. It will be able 
to share its considerable expertise in wildlife conservation to help Zimbabwe 
and Kenya salvage their wildlife-based tourist industries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new government will be more judicious in its foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days of apartheid, the white government in Pretoria threw up embassies 
in every country that would have them, from Ukraine to Taiwan to Malawi; 
Pretoria was always ready to win new converts to its cause. That may soon 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "African countries are bending over backward to get us to set up embassies," 
an ANC foreign affairs specialist said. "Basically, every African country would 
love to have an embassy. But we are not about to waste our foreign currency on 
having an embassy in Somalia. What for?" 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's new foreign policy may also affect not just nations but also 
some key political groups. Opposition to apartheid, for example, has for years 
been the raison d'etre of the Organization of African Unity. But the OAU has 
been incapable of dealing with the myriad other problems of Africa, from 
military takeovers to ethnic strife. And ANC leaders say privately they are not 
sure they even want to join the OAU. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us to become a member, but we are going to have to pick and 
choose," one ANC official said. "Some of these organizations, the members don't 
even pay their dues. They are hoping South Africa will carry all those 
free-riders." 
</P>
<P>
 Even African leaders agree that the OAU has been ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Africans, myself included, have been impatient for South Africa to 
become independent because its plight has for so long been an excuse for other 
African leaders to deflect attention from the continent's other problems," 
Omaar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Africa was, morally, a black and white issue," she added. "But 
criticizing (former President Ibrahim) Babangida in Nigeria or (Hastings 
Kamuzu) Banda in Malawi was considered interference. We don't want African 
leaders and institutions to have any more excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's economic influence is already becoming apparent across Africa. 
South African goods are on the shelves of most African capitals, and South 
African Airways is flying to more places in Africa than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, authorities in Kenya and Zimbabwe, two of the continent's more 
industrialized countries, are battling one unwelcome import: Thousands of cars 
stolen in South Africa are turning up on the streets of Nairobi and Harare, as 
well as other African capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the free and economically prosperous United States once lured 
Europeans, so too South Africa is luring Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the engineers from Zambia, an impoverished country that suffered 
numerous bloody attacks from South African security forces while it housed the 
ANC's exile headquarters, are now working on mines in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors in Zimbabwe, which borders South Africa, are also heading south soon 
after graduation for the more lucrative medical practices here. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are seeing South Africa as a place where you can go and do business 
the way you once could do business in Kenya," a Western diplomat in Nairobi 
said. "With the economy decimated by the Kenyan government, everyone is looking 
south." 
</P>
<P>
 But immigrants may not find the welcome mat out. South Africa has an 
unemployment problem of its own, with an estimated 46% of blacks out of work. 
The country appears to be heading out of its lengthy recession, but that does 
not mean it will open the doors to immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black South Africans may feel they have waited long enough, without having to 
share it with the rest of Africa," one African political analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts believe that Africa needs a strong and stable South Africa -- 
and a respected world leader such as Mandela -- to improve the continent's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 'If South Africa tears itself apart, I think Africa will be put on the shelf 
to grow cobwebs and dust," said Mills of the International Affairs Institute in 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "if South Africa can successfully manage its transition, it 
will generate a lot of hope for other African nations and the world's goodwill 
will spread across the region."

NEW TB CASES IN O.C. SCHOOLS FORCE SKIN TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the discovery of a student with active tuberculosis at Orange Coast 
College and another with symptoms at Santa Ana's Sierra Intermediate School, 
county health officials announced plans Wednesday to test more than 300 
students and faculty members likely exposed to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jody Meador, the county's interim TB controller, said that beginning 
Tuesday all students and staff members who have come in contact with the two 
potential carriers will be offered skin tests next Tuesday and Wednesday that 
should quickly reveal whether they have been exposed, and whether follow-up 
testing is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The two students who are potential carriers of the disease are no longer 
attending classes, and are receiving treatment from the public health 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said that contrary to what happened in last year's TB 
outbreak at of La Quinta High School in Westminster, they were promptly alerted 
to the two newest cases by private physicians. This quick response, they said, 
greatly diminishes the likelihood of another large outbreak of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Quinta, an infected student's condition was not properly diagnosed or 
treated, and her case not promptly reported to health authorities, so her 
classmates were exposed to the disease for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta released 
a report of its investigation of last year's outbreak at La Quinta, where 12 
students were infected with a drug-resistant form of the disease linked to a 
single carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators concluded that spread of the disease could have been prevented 
by earlier diagnosis, reporting, and monitoring of the original case. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the cases at Orange Coast College and Sierra Intermediate, 
Meador said, "Two private physicians . . . did an appropriate and expeditious 
work-up and referred them immediately (to the county Health Care Agency) for 
definitive diagnosis and treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the physicians transferred to the county the care of a 12-year-old girl 
who attends Sierra Intermediate. Meador said the girl was hospitalized several 
days last week with lung problems that, according to X-rays and other 
diagnostic tests, seemed to be caused by active tuberculosis. She said the 
county is doing a sputum culture to confirm the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials learned from another physician last month that a 
21-year-old female student at Orange Coast College had a preliminary diagnosis 
of TB. Her infection was later confirmed by laboratory tests, Meador said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carnett, the college's director of community relations, said the school 
was notified last Thursday about the infected student and instructed her not to 
return to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Weismuller, the county's director for disease control, said the Orange 
Coast student was born in Southeast Asia, and had a positive TB skin test when 
she entered the United States. This indicates that the young woman was exposed 
to the TB bacteria outside the United States, most likely in Southeast Asia, 
where tuberculosis is prevalent, Weismuller said. She noted that tuberculosis 
can be latent for years before developing into active disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent resurgence of tuberculosis in Orange County and nationally, 
Weismuller said, has been traced in part to immigrants who were originally 
exposed to the disease in poorer countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The student who spread the disease at La Quinta High was also a native of 
Southeast Asia, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth time county health officials have called for precautionary 
TB screening at schools since the La Quinta tuberculosis outbreak was 
publicized last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 150 students at Golden West College were tested after they were 
exposed to an infected student from La Quinta who had attended summer school. 
In January, 225 La Habra High School students were tested, followed in February 
with the testing of 60 preschoolers at Cuddle Care Center in Fullerton and in 
March by the testing of 146 students at La Quinta when an infected student 
there suffered a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
 During all this testing, only two active cases of tuberculosis were 
discovered, Weismuller said, and both were preschoolers who had contracted the 
disease from a teaching assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children under the age of 5 who are exposed to TB very rapidly develop active 
disease but are not communicable," Weismuller said. "Older children who are 
infected don't as often progress to active disease immediately, so we have an 
opportunity to give them preventive medication." 
</P>
<P>
 Meador said the two latest students thought to be infected with the disease 
"are getting good clinical results to medication. They will be kept out (of 
school) until it is determined by bacteriological studies that they are no 
longer communicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, steps have been taken to notify students in both schools, as well 
as the parents of the intermediate school students, about the possible exposure 
and to arrange large-scale testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Thomas, spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District, said 
parents of all 1,200 students at Sierra Intermediate will receive explanatory 
letters in the mail today. Parents of the 170 students targeted for testing, 
she said, will also be asked to sign a consent form. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests will be administered on campus Tuesday and Wednesday, Thomas said, 
with the results to be determined by week's end. In addition to the 170 
students, she said, about 10 faculty members will be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said all parents have been invited to the school today at 7 p.m. to 
meet with school and county health officials who can answer questions. She said 
the school principal also met Wednesday with the affected students in hope of 
putting them at ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine McDonough, director of student health services at Orange Coast 
College, said there are plans to test 146 Orange Coast students in four classes 
attended by the student with contagious tuberculosis. Also, three faculty 
members and two course assistants who may have been exposed will be tested, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonough said she has met with the students to encourage them to show up for 
the tests.

CLINTON PROPOSES WIDER USE OF AIR POWER IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Wednesday proposed far broader use of allied air power in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and put Bosnian Serbs on notice that the United States is 
prepared to lead Western military forces to punish their "brutal" behavior and 
thwart their territorial ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton in effect is attempting to commit the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization to deepening its involvement in the Balkan civil war as a force in 
support of the tormented Bosnian Muslims and to deny Bosnian Serbs victory in 
areas they consider crucial to the goal of creating a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was far from clear whether he can persuade Moscow, European allies, 
Congress and even his own Defense Department to accept this escalation of the 
Western role in the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials in Brussels tentatively agreed Wednesday to the expanded use of 
air power in Bosnia, but they cautioned that the alliance would want greater 
flexibility in how force is employed and unambiguous command of NATO aircraft 
in the theater, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that initial favorable reaction, officials in Brussels said difficult 
military questions must be addressed before alliance leaders will formally 
endorse the Clinton proposal. Among the issues to be resolved are the safety of 
peacekeepers on the ground and expanded definitions of potential targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton coupled his threats to punish Bosnian Serb forces for their latest 
attacks on civilians in the Muslim enclave of Gorazde with promises of renewed 
international diplomatic efforts to bring the Serbs to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me be clear about our objective," the President said at a late afternoon 
news conference at the White House. "Working with our allies, the Russians and 
others, we must help the warring parties in Bosnia to reach a negotiated 
settlement. To do that, we must make the Serbs pay a higher price for continued 
violence so it will be in their own interest more clearly to return to the 
negotiating table." 
</P>
<P>
 He characterized the Bosnian Serbs as the primary aggressors in the 2-year-old 
Balkan conflict and called their attacks on a hospital, the U.N. headquarters 
and other defenseless targets in Gorazde "terribly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, responding to Clinton's proposal, said 
that more NATO air power used in defense of Muslim enclaves will only prolong 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are having more and more threats," Karadzic said in an interview 
broadcast on the Cable News Network. "We are having more and more sanctions. 
And the Muslim side (is) nothing but encouraged to go on with the war. They do 
not have any motivation to stop the war." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that NATO and the United Nations are prosecuting a war against the 
Serbian people. "We can't stop war only by pressuring the Serbian side," he 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Clinton turned up the volume of rhetoric against the Bosnian Serbs, he 
acknowledged what his military advisers have been telling him for months -- 
that air power alone will not end the war in Bosnia or even drive the rebel 
Serbs to the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he had presented his plan earlier Wednesday to Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin, whom Clinton described as "quite sympathetic" to applying 
greater pressure on the Serbs. But the Russian leader warned Clinton that 
outside force cannot settle the Balkan problem and that he will not commit 
Russian support to the new plan until he has seen it in writing.

 Clinton said he had also described the proposal to French President Francois 
Mitterrand and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien; he characterized them as 
generally supportive. He said he was still attempting to reach British Prime 
Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton left vague the tactical dimensions of the plan, saying he wanted to 
discuss it in private with allied leaders before describing it in detail to the 
public. But in broad terms, he is proposing to expand the weapons-exclusion 
zone declared around Sarajevo in February to the five other safe areas for 
Muslims in Bosnia -- Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa, Tuzla and Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the U.S. proposal, shelling of those towns or any movement of weapons 
within a specified radius of the city center would bring quick retaliatory air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, speaking to reporters during a visit to 
South Korea, said today that the Clinton plan would allow NATO planes to bomb 
Bosnian Serb ammunition dumps, supply depots and command posts inside the 
exclusion zones -- not just artillery, as is the case in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said Wednesday that he supports an expansion of the U.N. 
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, which numbers roughly 15,000 troops from 12 
countries. The United Nations has authorized 3,500 more peacekeepers for 
Bosnia; the commander on the ground, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, wants 6,500 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision to push for extended NATO air strikes drew immediate fire 
from Republicans on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a senior Republican member of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, echoed the Pentagon's reservations about the 
effectiveness of air power alone and said the only way to stop the Bosnian 
Serbs is to arm the Bosnian Muslims or deploy NATO ground troops in large 
numbers in Sarajevo and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Making it clear to reporters that he favored the former option, Lugar said the 
United States should unilaterally lift the U.N.-imposed arms embargo on the 
Muslims if America's allies refuse to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawmakers said they feared that expanding NATO's air role would only 
draw the United States more deeply into the war in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the President succeeds in securing NATO agreement for this more extensive 
use of air power, I fear that we will become further enmeshed in incremental 
escalation until such point where we face a choice between deploying American 
ground troops or withdrawing in abject defeat," said Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

PARENTS SAY VOTE ON SCHOOL CALENDAR DOESN'T ADD UP; EDUCATION: THEY FIND 
BALLOTING IN EXERCISE OF LOCAL POWER WEIGHTED IN FAVOR OF TEACHERS. PRINCIPAL 
SAYS IT'S FAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The leaders of Euclid Avenue Elementary School -- exercising their newly given 
power from the Los Angeles Unified School District to make their own decisions 
-- have redefined the meaning of a democratic vote. And parents are fuming 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 When the time came in March to decide on a school calendar for next year, 
parents turned out strong and believed their overwhelming vote would be enough 
to win a traditional summer vacation schedule. But they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ballots were collected, the school's leadership council established 
the "ratio of equality" system: Each teacher and staff member counted for 6.32 
votes, each parent for one. 
</P>
<P>
 The final tally showed that 386 parent votes for the traditional calendar lost 
out to 65 staff votes in favor of year-round school, touching off a heated 
campus debate over the definition of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when a sweeping restructuring effort in Los Angeles is taking power 
away from district administrators and giving it to schools, the episode at 
Euclid stands as a case study on how a school community -- principal, teachers 
and parents -- can hit bumps on the road to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the kinds of growing pains that every school, not just Euclid, are 
going to be going through," said Angie Stockwell, the regional administrator 
for Euclid whose job will soon be phased out in the name of reform. "Schools 
are going to have the absolute right to make decisions for themselves. They are 
not going to have mamma or papa do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, this Boyle Heights campus is at odds. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal insists the ratio system is fair. Most teachers and staff 
members are pleased they won the election, although a handful believe the vote 
counting process was unjust. And many parents feel powerless and angry, calling 
anything but a democratic vote hypocrisy at a time when the Board of Education 
is touting parent involvement as being essential to school reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do they think we are stupid?" asked Mary Montez, who went to Euclid and has a 
grandchild there. "They are used to parents acting in a certain way, not 
getting angry at things, but do they think they can fool us like this? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our community, these are our children, and this is the ultimate 
insult." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents, stunned by the results, have hastily organized to fight for 
permission to conduct a new vote. A group intends to distribute copies of its 
letter to Principal Esther Castruita in front of the school this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a school that purports to teach democracy -- one person, one vote -- what 
lesson does this send to our children?" the letter says. "For a district that 
promotes parent involvement, what lesson does it teach us? That parents don't 
count. And neither do our children." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of teachers also oppose the ratio system. "I teach my children that 
America tries to bring democracy to other countries," third- and fourth-grade 
teacher Henrietta Willis said. "But here at Euclid, I have to tell them my vote 
is worth 6 points more than their parents'. . . . This is not the American 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 To their surprise, parents are finding out that the democratic system is not 
universally accepted as a fair way of conducting business in the reform-minded 
Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the idealized world of the district's LEARN reform plan, the principal will 
be the ultimate decision-maker on campus but will have to work in collaboration 
with teachers, staff members and parents. Consensus building is the rule -- but 
figuring out just what that means is left to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At Euclid, Castruita first convened an evening community meeting and told 
parents and staff members that falling enrollment at the overcrowded school 
would let them abandon year-round classes and adopt a traditional calendar. A 
vote would be taken, she announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita was following the practice used last year when elections were held 
throughout the district and two-thirds of all schools returned to a traditional 
calendar. Under last year's guidelines, the majority ruled in one-person, 
one-vote elections. About 200 schools, including Euclid -- most in the inner 
city and east San Fernando Valley -- did not vote last year because crowding 
made year-round classes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita sent ballots to Euclid parents and teachers by March 21. But three 
days later, Memorandum No. 19 arrived from district headquarters. In the name 
of school empowerment, the bureaucrats were not going to order principals to 
conduct calendar elections this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the memo commanded that "a locally determined process for reaching 
consensus among stake-holders, which includes sign-offs" from teachers, all 
other staff and parents, must be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita locked the uncounted ballots in the school safe and called her 
leadership council together to discuss the memo. The council -- another 
creation of reform -- includes nine teachers, one other staff member, the 
principal and five parents. 
</P>
<P>
 During three council meetings, teachers and staff members said they should 
have an equal voice in school affairs and should not be outnumbered by parental 
votes. Castruita said she could not recall who thought up the ratio of the 
equality system. But she said that despite some misgivings, the consensus of 
the council seemed to support the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters were sent home to parents explaining how the traditional calendar 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "A ratio means that every vote is equal," said Emilia Tinoco, the teacher 
union representative at Euclid. "I understand what the parents are saying, but 
you have to understand that from the point of view of staff, it was not fair 
the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, as word of the outcome spread, parents are trying to figure 
out where it all went wrong for them. But the process for some is a frightening 
one that they fear could lead to reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fear that keeps our mouths shut," parent Lucy Kurokawa said. "What if my 
child gets in trouble that brings them into the principal's office. Then, 
because I opened my mouth, I worry that it will affect the outcome of my 
child's problem. Parents don't like to admit it, but that's what comes out when 
we talk to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita said she welcomes the opinion of any concerned parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson to be learned here is for all of us to get involved. This is a 
learning process for all of us," she said.

EFFECT OF NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL FRAUD DETAILED; THEFT: CLASS SIZES GREW, DOZENS 
OF TEACHERS WERE LAID OFF BECAUSE OF STEPHEN WAGNER'S CRIME, GRAND JURY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Class sizes were increased and dozens of teachers and other employees were 
laid off as a result of the budget shortfall caused by school official Stephen 
Wagner's embezzlement of $4 million from the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District, according to an Orange County Grand Jury report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the school district was forced to reduce the number 
of classroom aides by 50% and lay off 59 teachers and 150 other employees as a 
result of the embezzlement. School board member Jim deBoom said physical 
education programs were also eliminated at some elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of Wagner's illegal conduct, the district, its staff and students 
have suffered significant damages. By way of example, the district was forced 
to increase its class size from 28.5 students per teacher to 31 students per 
teacher," the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report marks the first time that authorities have 
comprehensively described how the $4-million theft affected the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, 41, rose from bookkeeper to director of business support services for 
the school district, a position that allowed him total access to and control of 
funds. He admitted stealing about $4 million from the school district from 1986 
to 1992, using the money to finance a lavish lifestyle that included a house by 
the Back Bay, luxury cars, a gold-plated grand piano and a tuxedo with diamond 
studs. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, Wagner pleaded guilty to embezzlement and tax-evasion 
charges in Orange County Superior Court and was sentenced to six years in state 
prison. Last month, a U.S. District Court judge sentenced him to 57 months in 
federal prison after Wagner pleaded guilty to federal charges of mail and wire 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of a plea bargain between Wagner and federal prosecutors, his 
federal sentence will run concurrently with the state sentence. Both the state 
and federal judges who sentenced Wagner ordered him to pay restitution to the 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner's assets were seized after his arrest and liquidated by a bankruptcy 
judge. The school district received about $1.7 million from the sales, leaving 
about $2.3 million that Wagner still has to pay the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have attempted to recover as much of the stolen funds as possible. We have 
also worked with the budget in such a way that we have been able to restore 
funding in some areas that were slashed. This has forced us to become very 
careful budget planners," said Supt. Mac Bernd, who took over last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul S. Meyer, Wagner's attorney, said Wednesday that Wagner was tempted to 
steal because of a "deep-seated psychological deficit that required him to be 
seen as a successful person." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd took issue with the report's conclusion that the layoffs and increased 
class sizes were entirely due to the embezzlement and the $281,557 spent by the 
district for audits and legal costs to pursue the matter, as mentioned in the 
grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 While those costs contributed significantly to the problem, he said, "not all 
of the layoffs were related to the embezzlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report lauded the school district for the steps it took after 
Wagner's arrest to discourage future thefts. In addition to instituting a more 
thorough auditing system, the district formed a citizens' oversight committee. 
</P>
<P>
 However, grand jury spokesman Jim Cooper also criticized district officials 
for not exercising "more vigilance in the first place to prevent the theft of 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 "The controls were in place then, but they were never used," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer, who said that Wagner is remorseful over the thefts, also wondered how 
"a district populated by some of the most sophisticated people in the county 
could allow these losses to mount year after year without some kind of audit." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd said the new safeguards instituted by the district will prevent others 
from stealing large sums without being caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has made a remarkable effort to get some of the problems 
addressed that were cited by the grand jury. I don't think we can ever build a 
perfect system, but we've made a great effort," Bernd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report detailed the manner in which Wagner was able to steal 
with impunity over the years. He was finally caught after another district 
employee wrote a letter to the grand jury in February, 1992, asking it to look 
into Wagner's possible criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the grand jury report, Wagner stole from district savings and 
checking accounts, diverting funds to his personal accounts. Wagner was able to 
do that, school board member deBoom said, because "he was the guy writing the 
checks, signing the checks and balancing the checkbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members still believe that Wagner was able to hide some stolen 
money in an offshore bank. But Meyer disputed that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "His overriding concern from the first time I met with him was to minimize the 
loss to the district. He ordered me to cooperate with officials and seek as 
much restitution as possible," said Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Meyer, Wagner insists that some expensive gems that he purchased 
with the stolen money are still stored in Canadian vaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even right now he believes there are accounts in Canada that contain gems 
that could contribute substantial restitution. . . . He's baffled by the 
authorities' reluctance to locate those gems, and, frankly, so am I," said 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner worked for the district for 21 years, and fellow employees were amazed 
that he could afford the lifestyle he flaunted so openly on his $79,848 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us wondered about that. The response from him was that he had 
outside investments in precious stones and metals and was a wizard in 
investments," deBoom said.

HAYDEN SUPPORTS CAMPAIGN REFORM INITIATIVE FOR 1996; POLITICS: COMMON CAUSE 
REFRAINS FROM BACKING THE DRIVE, SAYING THE SENATOR MAY USE IT AS A VEHICLE IN 
HIS GUBERNATORIAL RACE. THE PLAN WOULD LIMIT DONATIONS AND IMPOSE OTHER 
RESTRICTIONS.

<P>
 Saying it echoes a theme of his gubernatorial campaign, state Sen. Tom Hayden 
is throwing his support behind an effort to qualify a political reform 
initiative for the statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But his backing of the fledgling movement may prevent the state's premier 
reform advocacy group, California Common Cause, from supporting the drive for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 Like two propositions voters approved five years ago -- but which were struck 
down by the courts -- the proposed 1996 ballot measure would place dollar 
limits on campaign contributions. It would also cap campaign expenditures, ban 
the transfer of funds from one politician to another, outlaw non-election year 
fund raising and provide public financing for campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Holton, executive director of California Common Cause, said the 
initiative drive presents a quandary for her organization, which has decided to 
refrain from backing it for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has many elements we like, but we are waiting to see if Hayden is going to 
be using it as a campaign vehicle," Holton said, noting that Common Cause 
steers away from endorsing candidates. "If so, we're going to remain silent." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's chief proponent, Karl Ory of Chico, says it is the product of 
a coalition. He and Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said the initiative sprouted from a 
series of meetings last year with government reform advocates trying to draw up 
such a ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a supplementary effort to my campaign for reform," said Hayden, who 
confirmed that he has pledged "thousands and thousands" to help the initiative 
drive. "I suggested the idea. I support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden has made campaign financing reform a pillar of his quest for the 
Democratic nomination for governor, but he does not want to emerge as the main 
backer of the petition-gathering movement, he said. "I don't want it to be a 
Hayden initiative," he said. "I want it to be a reform initiative, with people 
standing shoulder to shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Proposition 128, the "Big Green" environmental initiative, 
failed at the polls after business-backed opponents attacked it as "the Hayden 
initiative," capitalizing on the public's reservations about the liberal 
Democrat. Then an assemblyman, Hayden was a sponsor of Big Green, and was 
thought by some to be politically damaged by its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ory, formerly a mayor of Chico and also a co-author of Big Green, said he will 
also solicit backing from other gubernatorial candidates. To get the 
proposition on the ballot, Ory needs to gather about 500,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The polls have shown that the large majority of the state supports some kind 
of campaign finance reform," Ory said, adding that voters passed Proposition 68 
and the less stringent Proposition 73 in 1989 only to see them both get caught 
in a web of court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, spokesman for Democratic candidate John Garamendi, the state's 
insurance commissioner, said Garamendi has been "a strong proponent of campaign 
finance reform" and probably would be open to examining the proposed measure. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for state Treasurer Kathleen Brown's campaign had no comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has not seen the proposed measure but is a longtime supporter 
of setting some sort of limits on political contributions, said Dan Schnur, his 
campaign spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he hopes the drive will force discussion of campaign reform 
proposals before the June primary. And to the new governor and Legislature 
being seated next January, "it tells them if they don't act in 1995, they face 
this in 1996," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, however, the Legislature has had a difficult time passing 
substantial laws to reduce the role of money in the political process. In fact, 
in last year's political corruption trial of former state Sen. Paul B. 
Carpenter, testimony emerged that Carpenter garnered support for a campaign 
finance reform measure by offering lawmakers tips on how to get around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, an Assembly committee killed a measure by Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) that would have placed limits on political 
contributions and otherwise overhauled California's campaign financing system.

WOMAN AT CORE OF MYSTERY BURIED; MEDICINE: GLORIA RAMIREZ IS LAID TO REST TWO 
MONTHS AFTER HER DEATH AT A RIVERSIDE HOSPITAL, WHERE FUMES FELLED PERSONNEL. 
HER CLERGYMAN SCOLDS THE COUNTY FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE CASE.

<P>
 Gloria Ramirez, who lived in relative obscurity but in death became the focus 
of a sensational medical mystery that catapulted her to the front page and the 
top of the evening news, was finally laid to rest Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The comforting prayers, the cathartic tears and the symbolic release of 
balloons into the gray morning sky came two months after her death. Since Feb. 
19, her family's grief has been interwoven with anger and frustration. For 
weeks, they have been unable to gain information about the cause of death of 
the 31-year-old mother of two. For weeks, they listened to explanations that 
blamed Ramirez for the mystery fumes that felled six emergency room attendants 
who tended to her the night she died at Riverside General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the funeral Wednesday and a memorial Tuesday night, the time had 
finally come for family and friends to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Brian Taylor read from Paul's letter to the Corinthians to those 
gathered for the memorial Tuesday. He read from the 23rd Psalm and reflected on 
John's Gospel. He talked of how Gloria Ramirez was a friend to all, quick to 
smile, a carefree joker who brought comfort and joy to others. 
</P>
<P>
 And, even though medical authorities have not concluded how Ramirez died or 
whether she was the source of the mystery fumes, Taylor referred to "that 
bizarre, tragic incident in the hospital emergency room that took her life." 
The hospital, he maintained, "is likely to blame for the toxic fumes that took 
her life." 
</P>
<P>
 He scolded the county for not sharing results of its investigation into her 
death with the family and for the handling of her body -- which Riverside 
County officials did not release for burial until last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have called Ramirez's death the most baffling in local 
history and have said they will disclose their findings by the end of the 
month. A county spokesman has said the hospital is not believed to be the 
source of the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who had been found to have cervical cancer six weeks earlier, was 
rushed to the hospital Feb. 19 complaining of breathing difficulties and 
nausea. As one doctor tried unsuccessfully to keep her alive as her body went 
into cardiac distress, six other emergency room attendants grew dizzy or 
collapsed after several complained that blood drawn from Ramirez into a syringe 
smelled foul. 
</P>
<P>
 For an extraordinary autopsy a week later, pathologists wore protective suits 
and worked in a specially built room. Until last week, county officials had 
said her casket could not be opened unless similar precautions were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria has not been treated right, her death was unjust and the treatment of 
her body has been unjust," Taylor said at the memorial service. "The people 
responsible need to be held accountable for that." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the minister returned the service to more traditional lines. "We 
can finally give Gloria the dignity of a proper funeral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's two children from a previous marriage, 12-year-old Evelyn Arciniega 
and 9-year-old Angel Arciniega Jr., approached the podium with Ramirez's 
sister, Maggie Ramirez-Garcia, who read a poem written by Evelyn. "Roses are 
red, violets are blue. . . . The next time I find a red rose, it will be just 
for you," she recited. "When the stars shine, it will remind me of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sprays of flowers flanked the ivory-colored casket; a small crucifix was 
placed atop it and a portrait of Ramirez positioned to the left of it. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people, most of them relatives, attended Tuesday night's service. 
The family asked television news crews to keep their cameras outside. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a 10-minute graveside service at Olive Wood Cemetery in 
Riverside completed what Taylor said was a necessary closure in the family's 
grieving process. As Taylor sang "Amazing Grace," as many as 10 television news 
crews and other reporters and photographers kept their distance at the family's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a song that Gloria would hum around the house a lot," he said later.

 Hundreds of schools throughout the state have had to postpone the second round 
of California's controversial standardized tests because of delays in 
delivering the exam materials, causing scheduling conflicts and administrative 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Southern California school districts, including Los Angeles Unified, that 
were supposed to give the California Learning Assessment System tests during 
the last few weeks have been forced to put plans on hold because materials did 
not arrive in time. Most have now received their packages -- a week or more 
later than expected -- but some were still waiting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, it's thrown our whole testing schedule into chaos," said Peter J. 
Boothroyd, assistant superintendent of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District. 
"How we're going to undo that mess will be determined by what day they arrive. 
If the tests arrive tomorrow we'll be OK, but we don't know. . . . We're just 
sitting on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are unsure how extensive the delivery problem has been. 
Minnesota-based Questar Data Systems, the company hired to package and deliver 
the tests for the state, is preparing a report detailing how widespread the 
delays were and how much extra it will cost, state Department of Education 
spokeswoman Susie Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange attributed the delay to "just a series of problems . . . with moving 
millions of sheets of paper" and said Questar was not entirely responsible for 
the delay. Despite the problems, she said, all eligible students will be able 
to take the tests this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its second year, CLAS will test well over 1 million fourth-, fifth-, 
eighth- and 10th-graders at a cost of $26 million. Several private companies in 
California and out of state handle parts of the processing under state 
contract, and testing dates are staggered based on school schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tests have only been delayed about a week in most cases, the 
situation has launched further criticism of CLAS, which in recent weeks has 
been attacked because of problems in scoring last year's tests and by 
conservative groups that are outraged over its content. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most schools, it's just an inconvenience," Lange said of the delays. "I'm 
not minimizing that, but there were no costs incurred for them. It's just a 
matter of rescheduling." 
</P>
<P>
 But local school officials are worried that CLAS will now conflict with other 
standardized tests planned for later in the spring or other scheduled events 
such as field trips, open houses or staff development days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put out to schools in August the testing calendar for the coming year and 
they try to schedule other things around that," Los Angeles school district 
testing coordinator Linda B. Lownes said. "Now this piles a lot of tests on top 
of each other and schools will be trying to give the CLAS tests at times they 
have . . . other things planned." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Los Angeles schools were scheduled to administer the tests this 
month, Lownes said. Calling the situation "very, very disruptive," she said the 
district has postponed CLAS three times and now plans to give CLAS between May 
4 and June 3 -- the same period previously set aside for the California Test of 
Basic Skills, which is also given to all students. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators also said they are frustrated that arrangements they made for 
CLAS testing are now for naught, and that there is less time to sort through 
the material and train teachers to give the new segments of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 And although principals typically warn students, teachers and parents of 
testing days to encourage attendance, a good night's sleep and a healthful 
breakfast, some administrators said now they now will be forced to spring the 
tests on children with no notice. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state's plan, each school district was to give the tests 
between its 135th and 155th day of instruction, with some starting in March and 
others testing through the first weeks of June, but most scheduled for April 
and May. Schools planning to test next week or afterward should not have any 
delays, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questar was supposed to collate and deliver the exam packages on a rolling 
schedule that matched each school's calendar and testing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The disruptions began last month. Administrators who were awaiting arrival of 
the tests instead received a series of memos from Questar announcing the 
delays. None explained the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS will test students in reading, writing, math, science and history and 
measure performance against tough statewide standards. Results of the 1993 
tests released in March painted a grim portrait of California students, with 
one-third demonstrating little or no understanding of basic math concepts.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: GARAMENDI'S WORK ETHIC: HE WEARS IT WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an especially grand day to be in the wine country. The hills are lush 
green. The sky is bright blue and the temperature is in the 70s. The vines are 
starting to put out shoots, which soon will flower and produce grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a weekday during the off-season for tourists, it is a tranquil place 
reserved primarily for the vintners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi is here. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi -- the underdog candidate for governor, who lags behind Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown in polls and fund raising just seven weeks before the Democratic 
primary -- is in the sun outside a cellar, in jeans and boots. He's "topping 
off barrels" of chardonnay at the isolated Iron Horse winery, so far off the 
beaten path in Sonoma County that it can be found only by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi dips a brush in water and swabs the top of a 20-case oak barrel. 
Then he removes the plug and stirs the '93 vintage that has been fermenting 
since September. Finally, he tops off the barrel by pouring more chardonnay 
from a pitcher, replacing wine lost by evaporation. He does this all morning, 
working alongside a field worker named Jose, in a job that pays $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 This is how Garamendi campaigns for governor. "Working for California," he 
calls it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday at the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, he donned a waiter's 
jacket with bow tie and worked the breakfast for Democratic convention 
delegates, serving food and clearing tables. A few days before that, he was on 
the docks at Port Hueneme, unloading crates of bananas off a cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, he has worked as a jailer, a lumber stacker, a teacher, a 
nurse's aide, a carpenter, a gas station attendant, a dairyman. . . . Once he 
helped a cow deliver her calf by yanking out the baby with a winch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's unorthodox goal is to work a half day in each of California's 58 
counties before the June 7 election. It's reminiscent of Richard Nixon's 
failed, time-consuming 1960 strategy of campaigning for president in each 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi says that by working alongside ordinary people, he learns about 
their problems and this will help him be a better governor. "You gain insight 
and understanding that is not terribly common in the world of politics," he 
asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also "an enormously important political tool," Garamendi insists, because 
he wins supporters among those he meets and attracts local news coverage. But 
at the Iron Horse winery, co-owner/manager Laurence Sterling and his family 
already had been Garamendi supporters for many years. And only one other 
journalist showed up, a photographer for the local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, wishes his candidate had never 
dreamed up the "work day" gimmick. The veteran consultant opposed it from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "My standard line is he'd meet more people in one hour wearing a sandwich 
board on a street corner in Los Angeles than he'll meet in one entire day in 
most of those counties," Sragow says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 'work days' are wonderful . . . but when you have to raise the 
amounts of money you need to run for governor, you have to spend time as a 
candidate with people who can write checks for $1,000 or more. You spend time 
in the 'B' cities -- Beverly Hills, Bel-Air, Brentwood . . . 'Work days' are 
not efficient, and they handicap the candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi grins and tolerates this seeming insubordination. "After all, I'm 
the candidate, and I get to run the campaign the way I want to," he says. "I 
refuse to sit in an office all day and dial for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got great pollsters," the candidate continues, "but they can't tell me 
about the woman I met whose husband is dying of lung cancer and she needs him 
to live for another 31 days so he can be eligible for Medicare and pay the 
bill, or about the guy in the lumber mill who is losing his job because the 
governor walked away from the negotiating table on the Sierra accord, or the 
young mother who folds laundry in a nursing home and is going to quit her job 
and go on welfare so she can afford to take classes at a community college." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth also is that Garamendi, who grew up on a Sierra cattle ranch and 
became a Cal Bear football star, enjoys these "work days." For a politician, 
he's a rarity. He actually knows how to do hard labor -- weld, hammer, saw -- 
and, at age 49, still is in shape to do it. For him, this is relaxation and 
escape. And it gives him an excuse -- practically anyplace he chooses -- to 
wear his campaign uniform: boots, jeans and work shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a novel, noble strategy for a gubernatorial candidate. And if it's a 
failed strategy, there are worse ways to lose than topping off barrels of 
chardonnay on a nice spring day.

WOMAN TESTIFIES ON FEAR RAISED BY MEMORY OF ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Irvine woman who says she "recovered" buried memories of childhood sexual 
abuse by her father said Wednesday that she was confused and terrified by the 
recollections and desperately hoped they were not true. 
</P>
<P>
 But the memories -- fuzzy and incomplete at first -- kept coming, and Holly 
Ramona said she ultimately became convinced that her father, a Napa Valley 
winery executive, had raped her when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to believe them," Ramona, 23, told a Napa County Superior Court 
jury. "I didn't think in my mind that my father, who was supposed to love me, 
could do this to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But "I wouldn't be here if there was a question in my mind," she said. "My 
father molested me." 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony was the emotional peak of a landmark malpractice case involving 
"recovered memory" therapy, a controversial practice that has divided the 
mental health profession and become a juicy talk show staple since it surfaced 
in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona's father says that his daughter's therapist and a consulting 
psychiatrist took a depressed girl seeking help with an eating disorder and 
planted false memories of abuse in her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona, 50, lost his family, his reputation and his $400,000-a-year job 
at Robert Mondavi Winery after his daughter accused him in 1990. He is seeking 
$8 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit has attracted nationwide attention because it marks the first time 
a court has allowed a non-patient to sue a therapist for malpractice. 
Psychologists fear that a victory by Gary Ramona would trigger a flood of 
similar suits and interfere with their relationships with patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday marked Holly Ramona's first appearance in the month-old trial, and 
her testimony kept the packed chambers riveted for hours. Poised despite the 
presence of her father directly across the room, she calmly described how she 
had always feared her father, but had no memories of sexual abuse until she 
left home to attend college at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering charges at issue in the lawsuit, Holly Ramona testified that neither 
her former therapist, Marche Isabella, nor psychiatrist Richard Rose helped her 
manufacture any memories. Western Medical Center of Anaheim, where she was 
treated, is the third defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her testimony, the memories were triggered by an episode during 
her college Christmas break in 1989. While sitting in the family room of the 
Ramonas' Napa Valley home, she said, her father gave her a "long, steady gaze" 
that seemed inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a look a father would normally give his daughter," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, she said, during a drive to Palm Springs with her mother and 
grandmother, the first of many fragmented memories surfaced: an image of her 
father's hand on her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, more memories crept out. In one, Holly Ramona said, her 
father was on top of her, recalling that "he was heavy, I could feel his skin 
and smell him." In another, she was in her childhood bunk bed and her father 
was sitting beside her, stroking the inside of her thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 In another, "I was on a bed, there was a lot of light and a white sheet. My 
father was on top of me. His penis was inside me." 
</P>
<P>
 During their four weeks of testimony, Gary Ramona's expert witnesses sought to 
convince jurors that the therapists who treated his daughter were careless and 
irresponsible and preyed on her suggestibility. They also contended that Rose 
used a session with the hypnotic drug sodium amytal to prove to the college 
woman that her mental images were real. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona rebutted those suggestions Wednesday, insisting that there was no 
attempt to influence her. Indeed, when she wanted to confront her father soon 
after her first memory surfaced, Isabella recommended "that I hold off," she 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most poignant moment came under cross-examination, when Gary 
Ramona's attorney, Richard Harrington, asked Holly Ramona to recall a Father's 
Day card she had sent her father from college. The card closed with "You're 
great, Love, Holly" and Harrington asked the witness to reconcile those words 
with her testimony that merely hugging her father had made her uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times now when I would give anything to have a hug from my father, 
a normal father-daughter hug," Holly Ramona said, her voice cracking with 
emotion. "But I was afraid (then) that he would take it the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Spotting her tears, the judge ordered a break, and Gary Ramona -- his normally 
blank face a contortion -- rushed from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Holly Ramona's two sisters is expected to testify next.

PANEL MOVES TO CURB ACCESS TO VOTER RECORDS; PRIVACY: BILL APPROVED BY A STATE 
SENATE COMMITTEE WOULD SHIELD REGISTRATION INFORMATION. BACKERS SAY SUCH DATA 
PUTS PEOPLE AT RISK OF STALKERS AND OTHER CRIMINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Heeding appeals to protect entertainers from stalkers and other criminals, the 
Senate Elections Committee voted Wednesday to restrict public access to voter 
registration records. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by acting Secretary of State Tony Miller and supported by the Screen 
Actors Guild, the bill was approved on a 4-0 vote and sent to the 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should not be required to divulge home addresses, occupation 
designations and telephone numbers to the world in order to exercise their 
rights as citizens," said Miller, a Democratic candidate for secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easy access to home addresses puts people at risk," Miller said. "One should 
not have to take that risk in order to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the Legislature put records of the Department of Motor Vehicles off 
limits after the slaying of actress Rebecca Schaeffer at her apartment by an 
obsessed fan who had legally obtained information about her from the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
 Although criminals no longer can get personal information from the DMV, "they 
can still obtain it by walking into any registrar of voters office and asking 
to see the files," said actor Richard Masur, a vice president of the Screen 
Actors Guild. He told the legislators that the bill would bring "greater 
personal safety to our members and your constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is an unfortunate product of our time," said Sen. Milton Marks 
(D-San Francisco), the author. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would restrict public access to information contained on voter 
registration cards, including addresses, telephone numbers, precinct numbers 
and occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempted from the restriction would be individuals with a legitimate need, 
including campaign consultants, scholars, journalists, political researchers 
and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was opposed by the California Newspaper Publishers Assn., whose 
representative, Thomas Newton, said it would impose an unnecessary impediment 
to citizen participation in the election process, which he described as a 
fundamental element of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Newton said, citizens promoting a local school bond no longer 
could obtain names of registered voters whom they could contact for support. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said an existing safeguard is adequate because it enables a voter to 
obtain a court order to keep registration information confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Current laws also allow addresses and other information about judges, peace 
officers and prosecutors to be kept off voter lists. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Miller testified that anecdotal evidence suggests that 
some people refuse to register because they fear they might become victims of 
stalkers or other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But veteran Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside), who voted for the bill, told 
Miller that in his 35 years in public office, "I've never run into a person who 
has said that to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he had no statistics to support his contention, but "many people 
do have a legitimate concern" for their safety. Outside the hearing, Miller 
said he based his belief on conversations with activists who register voters.

LAST-DITCH PLEA AGAINST U.S. TEEN'S FLOGGING FILED; ASIA: MICHAEL FAY SIGNED 
'INTENSELY PERSONAL' APPEAL. BUT HE HAS LOST HOPE FOR CLEMENCY, HIS FATHER 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for an American teen-ager facing a sentence of flogging made a 
last-resort appeal for clemency Wednesday, but his father said the youth has 
given up hope and is now preparing himself mentally for the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-page appeal from Michael P. Fay, 18, of Dayton, Ohio, was sent by his 
lawyers to President Ong Teng Cheong for consideration. While the document was 
not released, defense lawyer Dominic Nagulendran said it was an "intensely 
personal" petition for clemency, which was signed by Fay in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay was visited at the Queenstown Remand Prison on Tuesday by his mother, 
stepfather and girlfriend. They were allowed to meet in a visitors' room 
divided by a plexiglass shield. Fay said he was being given medication, which 
his parents believed to be the anti-depressant drug Prozac and the sedative 
Valium. 
</P>
<P>
 According to diplomats and government officials, the president will probably 
refer the clemency question to the full Cabinet, which meets today, for 
consideration. It is unclear how soon a decision will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 But Singaporean officials have indicated that the government will not 
intervene in the judicial process. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's appeal against his sentence of six strokes of a rattan cane, four 
months' imprisonment and a fine of $2,230 for spray-painting cars and other 
acts of mischief was turned down March 31 by the country's chief justice, who 
said Fay had engaged in a "calculated course of criminal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton called on Singaporean authorities for a third time to spare 
Fay from caning, saying the jail sentence imposed with the caning is "quite 
severe." Clinton also said doubts had been raised about Fay's confession to the 
vandalism and that it may have been coerced by the Singaporean police. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton's remarks underlined, what began as a minor case of teen-age 
vandalism in this tightly ruled city-state has quickly mushroomed into an 
international cause celebre , the subject of countless talk shows, editorials 
and angry letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Americans, worried about their own neighborhoods, have applauded 
Singapore for taking a harsh line on crime, while others have condemned the 
government for a punishment they say amounts to torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, patriarch of this nation of 3 million 
people, said the U.S. government and media have seized on the caning to 
ridicule Singapore, but he added that the furor reflects the United States' own 
weak approach toward crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country dares not restrain or punish the individuals, forgiving them for 
whatever they've done," he said. "That's why the whole country is in chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 In a clear sign that Singapore had no intention of showing clemency, Lee told 
reporters this week: "The punishment is not fatal. It is not painless. It does 
what it is supposed to do, to remind the wrongdoer that he should never do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's father, George, said in a telephone interview from the Dayton, Ohio, 
suburb of Kettering: "My son is doomed at the moment. The Singaporeans are 
going to carry this out regardless of how much pleading there is." 
</P>
<P>
 George Fay, who spoke with his ex-wife after the prison visit, said Michael 
"is resigned to the fact that these guys will not give him clemency. He knows 
there is no hope. He is preparing himself for being caned." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's mother said she still has a glimmer of hope and plans to present Ong 
with petitions containing thousands of names in support of the clemency plea. 
</P>
<P>
 The worldwide controversy centers on the caning, a holdover from the days of 
British colonial rule in which a moistened four-foot rattan cane is used by a 
prison official trained in martial arts to flog a prisoner on the bare 
buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
 While the prisoner is restrained in a wooden trestle and protected against 
spine and kidney injuries with padding, the caning can send a prisoner into 
shock and cause permanent scarring. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay would be the first American ever flogged in Singapore. According to 
research conducted by the State Department, the vandalism law, enacted in the 
1960s to deal with the problem of political graffiti being sprayed on public 
buildings, has never before been used to punish anyone for vandalizing private 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's father is also continuing to raise the issue of whether his son was 
forced to confess to the spray-painting of cars by police mistreatment during 
nine days of detention last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singaporean government said it has investigated the charges of police 
mistreatment and that it could find no evidence to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, nine youths were arrested on charges of spray-painting cars and 
throwing eggs.

WASHINGTON EASES AGGRESSIVE POSTURE TOWARD N. KOREA; DIPLOMACY: AT URGING OF 
LEADERS IN SEOUL, U.S. LIFTS THREAT TO RESUME WAR GAMES. TENSIONS ROSE AFTER 
NORTH DECLARED NUCLEAR SITES OFF LIMITS TO INSPECTORS.

 The United States softened its stance Wednesday in its nuclear proliferation 
dispute with North Korea, diluting a threat to resume war games with South 
Korea if Pyongyang does not allow international inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came at the urging of South Korean leaders in a series of meetings 
with visiting Defense Secretary William J. Perry. Seoul fears that too 
aggressive a posture by Washington might goad North Korea into war. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as two weeks ago, U.S. officials were hinting that they were about to 
announce a rescheduling of the military exercises, known as Team Spirit, 
because Pyongyang had not lived up to a pledge to let nuclear inspectors in. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Perry and South Korean Defense Minister Rhee Byoung Tae 
issued a statement that effectively postpones any decision on whether to 
reschedule Team Spirit exercises until next November. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told a closing news conference today that the United States will "not 
initiate a war" and "will not provoke a war by any rash action on the 
peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 And a senior U.S. official indicated that Washington is planning to soon 
propose the resumption of the middle-level talks that the United States began 
with North Korean officials in New York but suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, senior U.S. officials had been contending that no such talks 
would be held until North Korea fully complied with a U.N. Security Council 
demand that it open its nuclear facilities to international inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said Wednesday that, although Washington will still insist 
that North Korea comply with the inspection demands, it will not set any 
conditions for resumption of the middle-level talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also said Washington now is ready to postpone any further push for 
imposition of U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea until it has allowed 
enough time for the diplomatic effort to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to pursue diplomacy firmly and patiently until or unless there is 
no hope for diplomacy anymore," he said. "And if that happens, we will go to 
the U.N. and seek imposition of sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 The softer approach was designed partly to take advantage of last week's 
apparent softening of rhetoric by North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, which both 
U.S. and South Korean officials consider encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports, Kim said Pyongyang does not want to acquire nuclear 
weapons and no longer will bar inspectors from its plants. While some officials 
are skeptical, they want to provide time for Kim to follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo told reporters that with 
Wednesday's conciliatory gestures, the United States and South Korea believe 
that they have done all they can to bring a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We on our part have done our best for an international solution," he said. 
What happens next, he said, "depends entirely on North Korea. It is time now 
for Pyongyang to act. The ball is in its court." 
</P>
<P>
 The more conciliatory stance on the diplomatic front is only part of the 
strategy that the Clinton Administration is following. It is also bolstering 
the ability of U.S. and South Korean forces to combat a North Korean attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of 48 Patriot air-defense missile-launchers that Perry has ordered 
sent to South Korea arrived here earlier this week. They will be deployed by 
mid-May, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is also making plans to stockpile more munitions and spare 
parts for allied fighter jets stationed here and to send dozens of Apache 
attack helicopters to replace the aging Cobras now on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Wednesday, U.S. officials said South Korea has agreed to buy a long 
list of devices to modernize or upgrade its forces and equipment, from 
night-vision goggles to precision-guided antitank missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The to-and-fro regarding the Team Spirit exercises is largely symbolic. 
Although the issue is important politically to North Korea, U.S. officials say 
canceling them has little bearing on U.S. and South Korean military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that, if the exercises are held in November or December, they 
will probably be somewhat smaller than the massive war games that had been 
scheduled for March.

SOME TELL CLINTON TO KEEP HIS PERSONAL DETAILS BRIEF; THE ANALYSTS SAY HE MAY 
HAVE SUCCEEDED TOO WELL IN HUMANIZING HIMSELF, PERHAPS FORFEITING RESPECT. 
</P>

 In an age when politicians can't afford to appear to be remote authority 
figures, President Clinton has humanized his image by sharing details of his 
compulsive eating and his less-than-perfect golf, his early family troubles and 
past marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Americans heard him joke about his chubby legs and confide that he 
prefers briefs to boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's human side is part of his charm, polls show. But some analysts 
believe that Americans' familiarity with their camera-friendly President could 
be breeding, if not contempt, at least a shortage of the awe that presidents 
need to summon their countrymen to sacrifice. Some warn that the average-man 
image that allows him to connect with Americans could be too convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, you know so much about the trivial details of his life that 
you have trouble seeing him as the leader of the country," says Kathleen Hall 
Jamieson, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all presidents wrestle with how close to allow the public, Clinton 
and his campaign team decided that he would break new ground with his 
accessibility and informality. One early signal came when he donned dark 
glasses and played the saxophone on "The Arsenio Hall Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the election, Clinton has reached out further by playing talk-show host 
on TV "town hall" meetings with such skill that Marlin Fitzwater, press 
secretary to President George Bush, calls him "the greatest TV President in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 But this heavy exposure has produced an outpouring of personal details that 
some analysts see as unflattering to the office. 
</P>
<P>
 At a truck plant in Shreveport, La., in February, Clinton joked about how as a 
young man he had carpeted the bed of his old El Camino with Astroturf -- not 
for romancing dates, he insisted later, but to protect his luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamieson suggested that Clinton should try to establish the kind of "zone of 
privacy" spoken of so longingly by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. When 
asked about his underwear preferences on an MTV town hall, Jamieson said, "he 
should have deflected the question." 
</P>
<P>
 Other presidents, including Ronald Reagan, have been better at balancing 
public intimacy and privacy. Reagan, Jamieson recalled, once gave a national 
radio audience such a feeling by telling his wife, Nancy, "I love you" as 
millions listened. Yet Reagan, Jamieson said, never seemed to get asked the 
personal questions that have come Clinton's way. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the public's familiarity with Clinton came this week, when an 
official of the Ameritech telecommunications company -- a complete stranger -- 
offered Clinton a pair of nylon running pants after a health care rally in 
Milwaukee. According to Clinton's later account, the official, Bronson Haase, 
said: "I want you to have this jogging suit because I keep seeing you in 
running shorts and I think it would be better if you had long pants." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzwater said: "I don't think any former President in memory would get a 
comment like that." 
</P>
<P>
 President Jimmy Carter came to Washington after the tribulations of Watergate, 
vowing that he would dispense with the trappings of an imperial presidency. But 
two years into his term, the embattled Carter decided that the presidential 
aura might help restore lost respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The band resumed playing "Hail to the Chief" when he entered the room. He 
traded his populist beige sedan for the traditional black Cadillac limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter "said he was just an average guy, but when he got into trouble people 
started to say, 'Maybe he is,' " said Bert Rockman, presidential scholar at the 
University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 White House political consultant Paul Begala says the current President has 
less need of the trappings of power because of Clinton's remarkable personal 
skills. When Clinton's TelePrompTer failed during an address to Congress last 
year, Clinton was able to begin the speech without the text. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his ability that makes him larger than life," Begala says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alan Secrest, a Democratic pollster, said Clinton needs to protect the 
presidential aura so it can help shield him from two vulnerabilities: Charges 
that the Administration is weak on foreign policy and that he is weak in 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an Administration that needs to be especially attentive to these 
perceptions," Secrest said. "They can take a toll." 
</P>
<P>
 William Kristol, former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, said: "If 
we have a serious foreign policy crisis, his lack of gravitas will hit home. 
Americans will look at this national talk-show host . . . they'll wish he was 
more than one of the guys."

WITH FREE PARKING IN PERIL, SENATE SHIFTS OUT OF NEUTRAL; MEMBER'S CALL TO GIVE 
UP RESERVED AIRPORT LOTS FAILS AS LAWMAKERS RISE IN PASSIONATE DEFENSE OF THE 
PERK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For years, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has risked pariah status in the Senate 
by quietly trying to end the decades-old practice of giving members of Congress 
free, reserved parking privileges at airports near the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, he brought the issue to the Senate floor and endured slings and 
arrows of protest from some of his colleagues. In the end, his 
sense-of-the-Senate resolution failed, by a margin of 54 to 43, and even some 
lawmakers who voted with him breathed a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 As McCain saw it, the special parking lots at nearby National and Dulles 
airports are "a perfect example of how out of touch the Congress often is with 
the overwhelming majority of Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the Senate ended its free health care, free gym privileges and 
bargain-priced haircuts, McCain argued, it should give up access to the 124 
parking spaces at National and 51 places at Dulles that are reserved for 
members of Congress, the nine Supreme Court justices and scores of diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, however, erupted in passionate defense of the parking perk. Sen. 
John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), for example, described McCain's proposal as part of a 
"corrosive cynicism" that disparaged lawmakers' efforts and actually was "bad 
for the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Senators work 100-hour weeks, Danforth suggested, and often have to dash from 
the Capitol to the airport to catch a plane to return home for more weekend 
work with constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does not represent some rip-off of the American people," added Sen. 
Carol Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.). "A parking space allows me to do my job. . . . 
When is this Congress-bashing going to stop?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who chairs a Senate appropriations subcommittee on 
appropriations for the legislative branch, argued that ending the parking 
privilege would wind up costing the government more money than it would save by 
renting out the spaces to the public. Lawmakers are entitled to government 
reimbursement for the cost of parking in public lots or for the cost of 
transportation to and from airports for trips they make on official business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a cosmetic change," Reid contended, while acknowledging that it would 
take "intestinal fortitude" or just plain guts to vote against McCain. 
</P>
<P>
 California's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, 
voted with McCain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible to explain . . . why elected officials deserve or warrant 
the special perk of being able to pull into a special parking lot at Dulles or 
National airport and get free parking at any hour of the day," Feinstein said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, 21 of the 25 senators who are running for reelection this year 
voted to end the perk. The decisive votes, as it happened, were cast by the 
eight lawmakers who are leaving the Senate and will not face the voters this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Danforth, one of the three Republicans and five Democrats who won't return 
next year, put it succinctly: "I don't have much to lose -- my political days 
are over."

DOCTORS, AID WORKERS DECRY GORAZDE 'MASSACRE'; BOSNIA: FIFTEEN CHILDREN ARE 
AMONG VICTIMS OF FIERCE SERBIAN ASSAULT. HOSPITAL AND REFUGEE CENTER ARE 
SHELLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen blasted through crowds of refugees in Gorazde on 
Wednesday, destroying a front-line hospital packed with wounded and leaving 
despondent doctors and aid workers in the U.N. "safe haven" dumbstruck by the 
world's failure to act. 
</P>
<P>
 As NATO officials pondered what the West should do in the Balkans, the Serb 
nationalist rebels pressed their campaign of terror aimed at driving the 65,000 
inhabitants out of the last sizable Muslim enclave in eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 44 people, including 15 children, were killed in the worst day of 
carnage since the rebel offensive began three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a war. This is a massacre," Alija Begovic, director of the 
shell-shattered hospital, told journalists here via ham radio as shells 
detonated in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten people were killed by a single tank shell that tore through an apartment 
building, and a Red Cross worker lost both arms in a direct attack on a refugee 
center, the last handful of foreign aid workers reported from the anguished 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The unbridled artillery assault scuttled the latest cease-fire initiative by 
U.N. officials, who now admit they are powerless to stop the bloodletting or 
force the Bosnian Serbs to negotiate a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what leverage the mission has to compel the Serbs to end the 
indiscriminate killing in the U.N.-protected zone, U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob 
Annink replied: "None." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. civilian official had met with Bosnian Serb leaders in the rebel 
stronghold of Pale a day earlier to be told the rebels' conditions for easing 
the slaughter in Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Momcilo Krajisnik, the leader of the rebels' self-styled parliament, forced 
the U.N. mission to agree to ensure there would be no reprisals against Bosnian 
Serb gunmen by Bosnian government troops if the assault was halted and the 
rebels were allowed to retain virtually all the land they have recently seized 
in the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Ukrainian infantry troops were to be allowed to deploy to the 
government-held center of the besieged enclave -- but they would have to travel 
under Serbian escort and would only be allowed to assist in feeding 30,000 
displaced Muslims the rebels have forced into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement sharply reduced the 1,000 peacekeepers the U.N. mission had 
ordered for the enclave, as well as conceding the issue of free movement for 
U.N. military and aid personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord was to have been presented to the Bosnian government. But U.N. 
officials appear to have been too chagrined by its inequities to even present 
it to the Sarajevo leadership, who surely would reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said he had not been approached by U.N. 
officials since they accepted the measures; he said his government considered 
it unacceptable for the United Nations to have a role in the Bosnian Serbs' 
push for Gorazde's surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 At the highest levels of the 15,000-strong U.N. mission in Bosnia, a sense of 
resignation has set in that nothing can save Gorazde. One senior military 
official, asked if North Atlantic Treaty Organization endorsement of wider 
latitude for calling in air strikes would be effective, said of Gorazde: "It's 
gone. There's nothing we can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The capitulation of the U.N. Protection Force, which is supposed to guard 
Gorazde and five other U.N.-declared havens, stirred angry words from horrified 
Western relief workers trapped in the mostly Muslim city. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Doctors Without Borders and the International Committee of the Red 
Cross joined in an impassioned plea to the world to "put an end to the 
humanitarian tragedy of Gorazde" and said they were ceasing communications for 
24 hours in protest against Western indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 Four staff workers of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 
Gorazde also relayed images of horror from the siege, saying shelling and 
sniper fire were so intense it was impossible to retrieve the dead and wounded 
from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conditions for refugees and residents in the town are appalling. They have no 
food and have to risk their lives to get water," said Mary McLaughlin, an Irish 
doctor trapped in the city. "We feel so helpless in the face of this great 
tragedy for the people of Gorazde." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the lack of government endorsement for the Gorazde cease-fire terms 
dictated by the Bosnian Serbs, the U.N. mission struggled with internal 
obstacles as it sought to put together a convoy to send to Gorazde in the event 
rebel Serbs hold fire long enough for the United Nations to deploy. 
</P>
<P>
 French officers prevented departure of the soldiers and armor at midday in 
anger over the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of a British contingent, which had been 
prepared to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force, numbering about 140 with logistics and medical support teams, 
planned to set off for Gorazde today.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PARTY'S ALMOST OVER FOR JAPAN'S FORMER RULERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 It looked for a while as if the Liberal Democratic Party, whose 38-year grasp 
on political power here was broken last summer, might be staging a comeback: 
Its opponents -- the ruling eight-party coalition -- were sabotaging political 
reforms and forcing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to compromise with LDP 
demands that turned a new election system to their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 One quarrel after another erupted within the coalition. One announcement after 
another that Hosokawa made was soon rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the mass media that had built Hosokawa's popularity ratings to record 
highs suddenly began questioning the inability of the telegenic, aristocratic 
former governor to explain a $950,000 loan he received from a gangster-linked 
parcel delivery firm 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing the opportunity, the LDP asserted that the loan was, in fact, an 
illegal political donation; the party launched a boycott of parliamentary 
deliberations on the budget, already delayed by political reform, to demand 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what mistakes he (Hosokawa) made, the public still liked him," one 
LDP member complained. "We concluded that if we couldn't get rid of him, we 
wouldn't have a chance to regain power in the next election." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 8, the LDP got its wish: Hosokawa announced that he would resign to 
break the budget logjam and accept moral responsibility for still undisclosed 
financial dealings that he said might involve violations of law. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Hosokawa's badly split coalition stands but one step away from 
naming a new prime minister. And the Liberal Democrats have seized defeat from 
the jaws of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 While the old rulers might yet patch together an LDP-led coalition with 
expectations of going back to "business as usual," the party's chances to 
regain control by itself appear more remote than ever. Divisions within its 
ranks have become at least as serious as those within the ruling coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the LDP avoided what, according to political commentator Minoru 
Morita, would have been "a fatal blow" as former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe completed a humiliating about-face by announcing that he would neither 
leave the LDP nor form a new party to join the coalition, as he had declared he 
would a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But his threatened rebellion exposed Watanabe, leader of the party's 
third-largest faction, as a turncoat-in-waiting. It also revealed that the 
thirst for power was gravitating away from the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Watanabe, 12 lawmakers bolted the LDP in the 12 days of furor 
since Hosokawa resigned, shaving its holdings in the lower house to 207, or 49 
shy of a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the ruling coalition's de facto choice for its next leader, 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, may win election for prime minister in the lower 
house by a wider margin than the seven-vote majority Hosokawa got last Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 So serious were the threats of more defections that the LDP appeared to be in 
the process of dissolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is to make sure you get out before you find yourself the 
last leader left in the LDP," one senior party leader said -- only 
half-jokingly. (The last leader would assume the burden of the party's debts 
and the problem of disposing of its large staff -- in effect, take charge of 
bankruptcy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still blessed with an ample supply of candidates, the LDP -- unlike any of the 
coalition parties by themselves -- is expected to find no trouble running 
candidates in all of the 300 single-seat districts in the next election, which 
is expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But continuing defections would seriously reduce the number of LDP winners, 
just as defections last summer did in the July election that deprived the party 
of its majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The LDP was also unable to use the turmoil it sparked to build a new image. 
Although emotionally divided, the coalition is still seen by the public as the 
vehicle for change; the LDP is seen as a party of money politics and back-room 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite driving out Hosokawa, LDP President Yohei Kono made no attempt to form 
an LDP-led coalition -- this even though help from any one of three opposition 
parties would have done the trick. Nor did he offer any new vision for what an 
LDP coalition could do to solve a host of problems Japan faces, including its 
worst post-World War II recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Both pro- and anti-reform party leaders criticized Kono for deficient 
leadership. In response, he promised -- without specifying when -- to name new 
party executives and reform decision-making to dilute the influence of elders 
and bosses of factions. 
</P>
<P>
 A Yomiuri newspaper poll released Wednesday showed 37% of voters picked Hata 
as their No. 1 preference for the next prime minister; a mere 4% named Kono. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dangerous to the LDP's future is a growing conviction among Japan's 
power-oriented interest groups that the LDP will not again be "the 
administration party." In the past, nationwide relationships -- extending down 
to the ward and county level -- had lured voters in search of favors to the 
party.  
</P>
<P>
 Education Minister Ryoko Akamatsu said the coalition had ended the power of 
LDP lobbyist-experts to influence the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Koji Kakizawa, a former parliamentary vice foreign minister, was reported to 
have walked out of the party because he wants to run for governor of Tokyo and 
is sure that no LDP member can win that post. And one formerly influential LDP 
urban lawmaker was reported to be despondent because, since last summer, he has 
found himself with nothing to do. Small shopkeepers who had come to him for 
help with taxes or favors they needed from the bureaucracy have stopped 
visiting.

ISRAEL-PLO TALKS SNARLED BY JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that they had concluded 
agreements on the transfer of civil administration to Palestinian self-rule but 
were still trying to unravel a dispute over how much legal jurisdiction Israel 
will retain in new Palestinian territories. 
</P>
<P>
 After Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, the chief Israeli negotiator, returned from an 
overnight consultation in Jerusalem, negotiators said they hoped they would be 
able to break the deadlock over whose laws will apply to non-Palestinians when 
Palestinians take over in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over legal jurisdiction is one of only a very few remaining out of 
two dozen security issues debated, delegates said. But it is considered so 
fundamental that it is likely to hold up any final agreement before today's 
scheduled weekend recess in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians also feared it could delay any final agreement during the 
scheduled Middle East visit next week of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
who will travel to the region on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we finish the jurisdiction issue, we will not be through," chief 
Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said. "Jurisdiction remains a major issue 
because it affects everything else. Other topics can be delayed, this topic 
cannot." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Israel demanded authority over Israelis and all foreigners in the 
Palestinian autonomous zones, in addition to review over cases involving 
Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said Palestinians believe that full legal jurisdiction was granted them 
in the Declaration of Principles signed Sept. 13 by Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we say there is Palestinian jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho, it means 
that Palestinian law is the one dominating," Shaath said. "As far as criminal 
law goes all over the world, jurisdiction is for the country involved, meaning 
if a person commits a crime in London, whether he is Belgian or French, he has 
to be judged in British courts."

SINGAPORE'S CANING SENTENCE DIVIDES AMERICANS, POLL FINDS 
</P>

 As American teen-ager Michael P. Fay pursues his final appeals to avoid a 
sentence of caning for vandalism in Singapore, Americans are divided evenly 
over whether he should suffer the punishment, The Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, 49% said they approve of the sentence, which President Clinton 
has protested, while 48% disapprove of Singapore carrying it out. 
</P>
<P>
 But poll respondents were much less willing to imagine using such punishment 
in America. Just 36% said they would approve of caning "for teen-age vandals 
here in the United States." Three in five said they would disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of whether Singapore should carry out the sentence, sharp 
racial and gender differences emerged. Men approved the decision to cane Fay 
61% to 36%, while women disapproved 58% to 39%. Whites narrowly favored the 
sentence by 52% to 45%, while 55% of blacks and 58% of Latinos opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, a majority of men and women, whites, blacks and Latinos all 
opposed using the punishment here, although the level of opposition was greater 
among women and Latinos. RONALD BROWNSTEIN

KEY HOUSE LAWMAKER OPPOSES CLINTON'S DRUG PANEL PROPOSAL; CONGRESS: MOVE BY 
DINGELL IS SEEN AS CONCESSION TO GET HEALTH CARE BILL THROUGH HIS ENERGY AND 
COMMERCE COMMITTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell's prospects for 
producing a health care bill from his panel brightened Wednesday after he made 
key concessions to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to freshman Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego), the Michigan Democrat 
promised that he would work to eliminate the Advisory Council on Breakthrough 
Drugs proposed in President Clinton's health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell's panel is considered the most difficult battleground for health care 
reform in the House, and he is having to use every bit of his much-vaunted 
legislative horse-trading abilities to cobble together a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 With several Democrats already indicating that they will defect and no 
Republicans expected to support the legislation, Dingell cannot afford to lose 
even one of the remaining Democratic votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's proposed council would be charged with examining "the 
reasonableness" of the prices of new drugs as they come on the market. The 
pharmaceutical industry has been a major target of criticism from the 
Administration, which has accused drug firms of making exorbitant profits on 
their discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk, whose district includes more than 100 pharmaceutical firms employing 
15,000 workers, wrote in a letter to Dingell that the advisory council's "mere 
inclusion in the President's Health Security Act has already influenced the 
investment community and forced many small biotechnology companies to cut back 
on research and development efforts. . . . Venture capital has dried up, and 
those companies that are not cutting back are transferring their production 
overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Those firms, she added in an interview, "are the ones doing the research on 
AIDS and Alzheimer's and cancer. It's also an industry of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In his reply, Dingell wrote: "I do not desire to single out new or 
'breakthrough' drugs for Draconian price regulation. I agree with you that the 
advisory council is not a good idea and that it should not be included as part 
of any comprehensive health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk is one of at least six committee members whose votes Dingell must nail 
down before he can officially begin drafting a bill. She said she still has 
concerns about other provisions of the bill -- most notably its requirement 
that small businesses either pay for 80% of their workers' health care benefits 
or pay a 1% tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added that with Dingell's agreement to eliminate the drug board, "it's 
really going in the right direction, and this today has given me a lot of 
comfort that they are listening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate letter, Dingell also promised Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky 
(D-Pa.), another undecided member, that he would give close scrutiny to 
Clinton's proposal to allow the Health and Human Services secretary to 
"blacklist" from the Medicare program drugs deemed to be overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell said he hoped to replace that provision with "appropriate legislative 
language" aimed at giving the secretary the ability to "make sound decisions 
about coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare but will not create the 
impression that any new drug, no matter how important or how effective, will 
automatically be 'rejected' based on its cost alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Administration may have underestimated by up to 20% the amount 
that consumers would pay in annual insurance premiums under the President's 
health care reform plan, according to an independent analysis by a committee of 
the American Academy of Actuaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, to be released today, suggested that the White House has 
underestimated the cost of covering 38 million uninsured Americans, as well as 
overall health care expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 If the analysis is correct, one academy actuary said Wednesday, the true cost 
of premiums could add as much as $125 billion to the federal budget between 
1996 and 2000 if Clinton's plan is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to emphasize the uncertainty and the fact that if higher premiums are 
required, the effect on the budget could be pretty dramatic," said Phyllis A. 
Doran, a Philadelphia-based actuary with Milliman & Robertson, a business 
consulting group. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's Health Security Act, employers would be required to provide 
workers with insurance. Companies with fewer than 5,000 employees would join 
regional insurance-buying alliances, which would be required to offer members 
at least three different types of health plans, including a traditional 
fee-for-service plan. 
</P>
<P>
 While every American would be guaranteed a standard lifetime package of 
benefits, individuals would be permitted to choose a specific plan. The plans 
would range in cost because of varying out-of-pocket requirements and the range 
in choices of providers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Administration, the average standard benefits package would 
cost $1,932 for an individual, $3,865 for childless couples, $3,893 for 
single-parent families and $4,360 for two-parent families. 
</P>
<P>
 The actuarial study assumes stringent caps on insurance premium increases -- 
as Clinton has proposed. Without such caps, Doran said, the premium costs could 
be 54% higher. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Administration's lower numbers may stem from having 
underestimated payment levels for hospitals and doctors under the 
fee-for-service option. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Security Act does not specify a fee-for-service payment schedule; 
instead, it would leave it to each alliance to negotiate such rates with 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11,700-member academy is the public-policy voice of the actuarial 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the White House brought in eight outside actuaries to review the 
methodology and assumptions used in developing its 1,342-page proposal. That 
group eventually pronounced the Administration's calculations of the 
private-sector premiums "sound and reasonable."

 In a move to quell growing suspicions, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
named an independent commission Wednesday to investigate last month's 
assassination of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country wants to know the truth. At the same time, it is necessary to 
avoid a climate of suspicions from some against others," he said in a brief 
announcement at the presidential residence, Los Pinos.

GEORGIA COUNTY NOW WELCOMES, BUT STILL CONDEMNS, GAYS; PROCLAMATION: FEAR OF 
LOSING OLYMPIC REVENUE LEADS OFFICIALS TO ISSUE STATEMENT OF TOLERANCE, YET 
THEY WON'T RECANT EARLIER DENUNCIATION.

<P>
 In a quest for a little 1996 Olympic gold, a Georgia county whose officials 
last year passed a resolution condemning homosexuality decided Wednesday that 
gays aren't so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobb County commissioners did not rescind the earlier resolution -- that will 
"never" happen, the commission chairman vowed -- but a proclamation issued 
Wednesday welcomes everyone to the county regardless of sexual orientation and 
assures gays that they will not be discriminated against. 
</P>
<P>
 The proclamation was approved in an effort to keep the organization that is 
planning the 1996 Olympic Games from yanking the preliminaries for a volleyball 
competition and several Olympic training sites out of the conservative county, 
which is just north of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 There were indications the proclamation may not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted to see some progress being made" on the issue, said Billy 
Payne, president and chief executive officer of the Atlanta Committee for the 
Olympic Games. He added, however, that the committee would continue to study 
whether the events could be moved without causing too much inconvenience to the 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're studying all of the ramifications," he said, adding: "I hope that 
reasonable folks are going to reach reasonable conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 County commissioners caused a firestorm of protest last July when they passed 
a resolution condemning the "homosexual lifestyle" and cut off all county 
funding to the arts in response to local production of a play, "Lips Together, 
Teeth Apart," that contains references to homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 To pressure the county to rescind the resolution, gay activists began 
targeting Olympic organizers. After at first steadfastly refusing to become 
enmeshed in local controversies, Olympic officials -- along with local business 
people who fear losing the financial windfall Olympic venues will bring -- 
recently began urging Cobb County officials to address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The county convention center expects to receive $500,000 in rent payments for 
hosting the volleyball preliminaries. The Olympics could pump $5 billion into 
the state's economy, one study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the resolution during a press conference Wednesday, Commission 
Chairman Bill Byrnes said: "If someone is gay, they will be welcome in Cobb 
County in 1996, as they are today. It's when they stand up and say they want to 
be treated differently because they're gay that I will oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that the 1993 resolution "will continue to stand. All of 
the threats will be of no avail in Cobb County." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay activists questioned how the county could welcome gays at the same time it 
condemns them, and promised to continue to protest. If the 1993 resolution is 
not rescinded, gays threaten an escalating campaign of protest and civil 
disobedience culminating in a massive demonstration during the Olympics that 
would embarrass both the county and the Olympic organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that his first priority was the welfare of the athletes and the staging 
of successful Games, Payne expressed weariness at efforts to pull the Olympics 
into local controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other issues threatening to tarnish the Games is a continuing battle 
over the Georgia state flag, which incorporates the Confederate battle emblem 
from the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't solve everybody's problems," Payne said. "We prefer to just do our 
job of putting on the Games."

FLORIDA COLLEGE SLAYER RECEIVES DEATH SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relatives of five slain college students sobbed and shouted Wednesday when a 
judge condemned Danny Harold Rolling to death for a grisly crime spree that 
terrorized this college town in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Paules, the mother of one victim, yelled, "Yes!" as the first sentence 
was read.As Rolling was led out of the courtroom, Mario Taboada, the brother of 
another victim, stood and shouted: "Justice is beyond these walls. We have the 
last say. We will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling, who decapitated one of his victims and left her head on a bookshelf, 
pleaded guilty Feb. 15 to five counts of first-degree murder, three counts of 
sexual battery and three counts of armed burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not speak at the hearing, nodding his head slightly as Circuit Judge 
Stan R. Morris accepted a jury's recommendation that Rolling be put to death 
for two of the mutilation murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that some good can be derived from this small gesture of pleading 
guilty to these terrible crimes against my fellow man," Rolling said in a 
statement issued through his fiancee. "It is the very least that I could do. I 
pray, 'God bless Gainesville, and Lord heal its people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Morris was not bound by the jury's recommendation, and the death sentence is 
subject to automatic appeal. The judge also sentenced Rolling to three 
consecutive life terms for the rapes and burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the offenses were committed in a manner that was especially heinous, 
atrocious and cruel," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling, 39, already is serving three consecutive life terms plus 170 years 
for a series of Tampa burglaries days after the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were killed in their off-campus apartments in August, 1990, just 
before the fall semester. They attended the University of Florida and Santa Fe 
Community College.

NIXON'S CONDITION REMAINS 'GUARDED'; PRAYERS OFFERED; PRESIDENCY: CLINTON, 
YELTSIN SEND HOPES FOR RECOVERY AS HUNDREDS SIGN BOOK AT YORBA LINDA LIBRARY. 
EX-PRESIDENT IS IN 'CRITICAL HOURS' AFTER STROKE. 
</P>

 As world leaders and ordinary citizens sent prayers and good wishes, former 
President Richard Nixon remained in critical condition Wednesday, partially 
paralyzed and unable to speak, in an intensive care unit at New York 
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 His physicians continued to describe his condition as "guarded" as they sought 
to contain the complications of the stroke he suffered Monday evening at his 
New Jersey home. "His condition has not changed," said a Nixon press aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81-year-old Nixon was in the midst of what specialists termed the 
"critical hours" after suffering from swelling of the brain -- a dangerous 
stroke sequel. His daughters, Julie Eisenhower and Tricia Cox, were at his 
side. His wife, Pat, died last year. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said he and Hillary Rodham Clinton were praying for Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to join all the American people as Hillary and I pray for the health 
and the recovery of President Nixon," Clinton said. "I want to again say how 
much I have appreciated the wise counsel he has given me on the question of 
Russia and many other issues since I have been President." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin sent a telegram to Nixon wishing him a 
quick recovery. "I hope you recover and return to the rough and tumble of 
political life," Yeltsin said, praising Nixon for working to normalize 
Russian-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, who had campaigned actively for a quick, massive infusion of Western 
aid to newly independent Russia, visited Moscow in March. But a furious Yeltsin 
canceled a meeting with the former President after Nixon met with opposition 
figures, including one of Yeltsin's chief rivals, ousted Vice President 
Alexander V. Rutskoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, however, Yeltsin extended an olive branch and allowed Nixon to meet 
with other members of Russia's Parliament, even though he did not see him. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nixon's office near his home in New Jersey, staff members were busy 
fielding telephone calls from well-wishers Wednesday. "We've gotten too many 
telephone calls to count," said Liz Johnson, a press aide in Nixon's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., 
reported hundreds of calls. In the library's lobby, visitors filled pages of a 
"get well book." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens more have inquired about -- in many cases, purchased -- autographs of 
the former President that are sold in the gift shop for $100 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Johnson of Yreka said Wednesday he "made a special effort to come here 
today." Alluding to Watergate, he described himself as "a very strong but 
disappointed supporter of the former President." 
</P>
<P>
 Another library visitor, Christine McDonnell, 30, a nurse from Fullerton, said 
she believed the death of Pat Nixon last year took a heavy toll on Nixon's 
health. "I read some of his letters to Pat. He said how much she meant to him," 
McDonnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald Burroughs, 80, of North Carolina signed the get-well book: "You're 
the greatest, but your unsung virtues are greater yet." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sorry he's ill, but he's tough. We are keeping our fingers crossed 
and saying our prayers," said Vivian Brown, a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Cartwright, the library's assistant director, said: "There's been a 
great outpouring of affection. The phones have been maxed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was taken by ambulance to New York Hospital Monday evening after 
suffering a stroke as he prepared for dinner at his home in Park Ridge, N.J. He 
had been undergoing treatment for an irregular heartbeat and had been taking 
Coumadin, an anti-coagulant, in an effort to prevent blood clots, which can 
result from cardiac rhythm disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians at the hospital at first believed Nixon's stroke had been contained 
after he received injections of a second anti-coagulant. A CT scan revealed the 
stroke was caused by a blood clot and not by bleeding in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 But late Tuesday, neurologists suspected brain swelling, and their diagnosis 
was confirmed by a second CT scan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fred Plum, chief neurologist at the hospital, said Tuesday that Nixon 
would continue to receive anti-coagulants in addition to the drugs designed to 
reduce the brain swelling. "The next 72 hours are a critical period," Plum 
said.

SPECIAL TASK FORCE TO TARGET TAX CHEATS; PROBE: INTER-AGENCY FEDERAL EFFORT 
WILL SEARCH FOR WAYS TO HALT REFUND FRAUD. RETURNS FILED BY COMPUTER WILL GET 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Embarrassed by disclosures of widespread losses from tax refund fraud, the 
Clinton Administration on Wednesday announced creation of a special federal 
task force to detect and punish tax cheats. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates this week by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) put losses to the Treasury 
from tax refund fraud at $9 billion. Archer, the House Ways and Means 
Committee's ranking minority member, has joined other congressional leaders in 
chastising the Internal Revenue Service for its failure to address the problem 
and in demanding action. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowing to congressional pressure, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said at a 
Senate hearing Wednesday that a special inter-agency effort -- involving the 
Treasury Department, the Justice Department and the Office of Management and 
Budget -- will study the tax fraud problem and recommend ways to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will be particularly interested in recommendations from outside 
consultants on ways to detect fraud among the estimated 14 million returns 
filed by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only does the IRS have to go after those who fail to report their income, 
now they have the added responsibility of quickly verifying information on 
electronic returns claiming refunds," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of tax fraud -- particularly stemming from abuse of the earned 
income tax credit -- has been exacerbated by the ease and speed of electronic 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 While the IRS needs six or seven weeks to process refunds from paper returns, 
it only requires two or three weeks to send refunds based on electronic 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 About 55,000 firms or individuals across the nation are now authorized to 
transmit tax information to the IRS by computer. The agency says the speed of 
the technology gives it less time to verify taxpayer information and determine 
whether claims for refunds are correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee responsible for Treasury 
Department funding that he and IRS Commissioner Margaret M. Richardson "are 
committed to attacking the fraud problem as aggressively as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Treasury Department also will ask Congress for extra funds this 
fiscal year to help the IRS improve enforcement of the tax laws. The department 
wants $72 million "specially earmarked to go after tax fraud schemes, including 
electronic-refund fraud," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The earned income tax credit is designed to put more cash in the hands of 
low-income wage-earners. It can benefit workers with children who earn up to 
$23,500 annually, either by reducing their tax liability or providing a direct 
cash refund. 
</P>
<P>
 Abuse of the earned income tax credit is particularly troublesome for the 
Administration, which considers it one of the most effective anti-poverty 
programs in the nation -- when used properly. The tax bill passed by Congress 
last year will expand the credit substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald K. Noble, the assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement whom 
President Clinton is elevating to undersecretary for enforcement, will head the 
special task force. His deputies will be Leslie B. Samuels, assistant secretary 
for tax policy, and Jean E. Hanson, the Treasury Department's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS, which is part of the Treasury Department, will supply personnel and 
documents to the task force. But the direction of the investigation and the 
development of policies to reduce fraud will be determined by the Treasury 
Department leadership, rather than the top ranks of the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 In complaining that the IRS' fraud prevention and detection systems "are 
seriously flawed," the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee said in a 
letter to Bentsen last month that the IRS has treated the problem as an 
internal matter, while denying it faces a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several times over the past eight years, we have been told that everything is 
under control and that exposing the problem will only make the situation 
worse," the letter said. "Knowing what we know now and knowing that IRS has 
failed to keep this committee and your department fully apprised, we ask that 
you take charge." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was signed by Reps. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the 
panel, Archer, J.J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman of its oversight subcommittee and 
Amo Houghten (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican on the subcommittee.

STATE POPULATION OF 47.9 MILLION FORECAST BY 2020 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California will have 47.9 million people by 2020, growing 52% in the next 26 
years, the U.S. Census Bureau predicted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the nation's most populous state with 31.4 million people in 1993, 
California will lead the nation in population growth with 16.5 million new 
residents, forecasters said.That would raise California's share of the nation's 
population from 12.2% in 1993 to 14.7% by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 The projections also show the percentage of non-Hispanic white Californians 
declining, while the percentage of blacks, Asians and Hispanics would climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Hispanics -- a Census Bureau category that covers Latinos but can include 
people of any race -- will become the most numerous, making up 36.5% of the 
population by 2020, up from 27.3% in 1993. Non-Hispanic whites would be 34% of 
the population, down from 52% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau said about 10 million new state residents will be immigrants from 
other countries between 1990 and 2020, tops in the nation. That number could 
change if government policies are altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, 4 million Californians will move out of the state by the year 2020, 
continuing a trend that began as the job market soured and residents fled 
social problems. They will also represent the largest state out-migration.

ASSEMBLY PANEL OKS REVIVAL OF QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Assembly committee on Wednesday reversed itself and approved legislation to 
revive a state-operated earthquake insurance program to help homeowners repair 
damage caused by major temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-3 vote -- the minimum required for approval in the Housing and Community 
Development Committee -- sent the bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Rusty Areias 
(D-San Jose), to the Insurance Committee for further screening. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no debate. The same committee rejected the measure by a one-vote 
margin last week, but Areias received permission to seek reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The former state earthquake insurance program was repealed last year after 
critics claimed it was bordering on insolvency and giving the public a false 
sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program had been in existence Jan. 17 when the Northridge quake 
occurred, Areias estimated, it would have contained about $350 million, enough 
money to give each of the estimated 60,000 to 70,000 Los Angeles-area 
homeowners who had damage a check for about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program is designed to provide homeowners with up to $15,000 to repair 
homes damaged by earthquakes. It would cost homeowners a mandatory $25 to $75 a 
year, depending on where they live and the type of home construction.

U.S. OFFICIALS BLAST COLOMBIA DRUG POLICY; NARCOTICS: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LASHES 
OUT AT BOGOTA'S LENIENT HANDLING OF TRAFFICKERS. AT RISK IS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
COOPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's aggravation over the Colombian government's 
handling of drug prosecutions erupted into public view Wednesday as U.S. 
officials sharply criticized the Latin American nation's top prosecutor in 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Ann Harris, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, charged 
that Gustavo de Greiff, Colombian prosecutor general, has adopted "outrageous 
positions" on legalizing drug trafficking and drug use; these positions 
threaten to undermine U.S. law enforcement cooperation with Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony reflecting the anger that has been expressed privately by some 
officials, Harris told a Senate subcommittee that De Greiff also has negotiated 
lenient plea bargains for major cocaine traffickers and has allowed them to 
avoid forfeiting drug profits, even in cases where U.S. authorities have helped 
provide evidence of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 De Greiff, in turn, has charged that international drug-control efforts have 
failed because countries like the United States have been unable to curtail the 
demand for cocaine, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said De Greiff is "not accountable" to Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
Trujillo, who often disagrees with him, because the prosecutor general is part 
of the independent judicial branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations, agreed with 
Harris, saying he was "deeply disturbed" by De Greiff's statements and actions. 
Kerry said lenient plea-agreements negotiated with leaders of the notorious 
Cali drug cartel "threaten fundamental U.S. interests and in the long run would 
threaten Colombia's security as well. We must not offer drug kingpins safe 
harbor anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department official said Harris decided to go public with criticism 
expressed in private diplomatic communications because "we were getting no 
results." The future course of U.S.-Colombian cooperation in drug cases is 
uncertain, he said, adding that "we're down to a trickle now on sharing 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to supporting Colombia in its struggle to bring the drug 
kingpins to justice," Harris said in concluding remarks. "But we must question 
Dr. De Greiff's resolve and his intention to use U.S.-provided evidence 
aggressively to prosecute these major traffickers who have caused unthinkable 
and irreparable harm to the citizens of the United States and Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey and other witnesses underscored the importance 
of a strong anti-narcotics effort by Colombia and other Western Hemisphere 
countries. "Latin American narcotics traffickers, particularly the Cali drug 
groups, control the hugely profitable worldwide cocaine trade and are the sole 
suppliers of cocaine to the U.S. market," Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the political corruption that drug profits often lead to, Woolsey 
testified that "drug kingpins in South America have gone beyond local 
corruption to influence not only a broad array of government officials but 
elections and decision-making at the national level." 
</P>
<P>
 He said lawyers working for Cali cartel leaders "helped to shape last year's 
legislative reform of the legal system -- a reform whose very provisions the 
kingpins now are using in an attempt to gain easy plea-bargaining agreements."

NEW TWIST IN TICKET DISPUTE; ROSE BOWL: BUSINESSMAN WITH UCLA CONNECTIONS WAS 
ALLOWED TO BUY 4,000 TICKETS TO JAN. 1 GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The aftermath of the Rose Bowl ticket controversy took a strange twist 
Wednesday, when it was learned that a longtime UCLA official, booster and 
friend of Coach Terry Donahue was allowed to purchase 4,000 tickets for this 
year's game. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation that Angelo M. Mazzone III, a UCLA graduate, former Bruin 
associate athletic director and current Westside businessman, received the 
large allotment came in the wake of Tuesday's announcement by State of 
Wisconsin officials that they were filing lawsuits against three travel firms 
that allegedly reneged of promises of Rose Bowl tickets for Badger fans. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Rose Bowl, in which Wisconsin beat UCLA, 21-16, became one of the 
most sought-after tickets in the history of the game. The Badgers hadn't been 
to the Rose Bowl since 1963, and their appearance here generated ticket demand 
that caught even the most veteran ticket brokers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wisconsin attorney general's office estimated, in the statement Tuesday, 
that as many as 1,000 Badger fans were deprived of tickets for the game that 
they had been promised. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement from the State of Wisconsin listed concerns about, among other 
things, the fact that UCLA had allowed one person to purchase a block of 4,000 
tickets. No name was mentioned in that statement, and when Joseph D. Mandel, 
vice chancellor of legal affairs at UCLA, was asked about it Wednesday, he 
declined to name the ticket purchaser. Later, Mandel called The Times and said 
that Mazzone was willing to have his name released publicly as the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Dalis, athletic director at UCLA, said Wednesday night that Donahue had 
no knowledge of Mazzone's ticket purchase "until I told him Wednesday 
afternoon." Dalis, admitting the two were longtime friends, said, "No, Terry 
Donahue was not involved in any of the ticket distribution of UCLA's Rose Bowl 
allocation." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalis described the sequence of events that led to Mazzone's purchase: 
</P>
<P>
 "Angelo mentioned to us just prior to the USC game (which UCLA needed to win 
to make the Rose Bowl) that he'd be interested in buying some Rose Bowl tickets 
if we went," Dalis said. "I told him that I couldn't make any commitment at 
that time, because I didn't know what the rest of our needs would be." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA beat USC at the Coliseum, 27-21, on Nov. 20. On Dec. 1, according to 
Dalis, UCLA officials, including himself, were told in a meeting with 
Tournament of Roses officials that the Rose Bowl people did not want a repeat 
of the previous year's situation, when the University of Washington played 
Michigan and Washington ended up eating approximately $240,000 in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went back, added up all our prospects for ticket sales and realized that 
we were well short of selling our 41,000 allotment," Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, on Dec. 2, three days before Wisconsin clinched the other spot in the Rose 
Bowl by beating Michigan State in Tokyo, UCLA officials contacted Mazzone and 
made the commitment for his large request. 
</P>
<P>
 On about Dec. 30, according to Dalis, Mazzone made a $100,000 contribution to 
the school's athletic scholarship fund. Dalis said that was part of the 
discussion when the large ticket purchase was originally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Mazzone anticipated the huge demand and hot market for Rose Bowl 
tickets or was merely helping out his alma mater with a large ticket purchase 
-- something Dalis said he has done many times in the past -- could not be 
established. Mazzone did not return frequent calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The large block purchase, coupled with the controversy over angry Wisconsin 
fans, triggered economic speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone paid face value of $46 for each of the 4,000 tickets, school officials 
said. So his total outlay was $184,000 for the tickets, plus the $100,000 
endowment contribution to athletic scholarships at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Area ticket brokers contacted by The Times said they paid $85 a ticket for 
poor seats, and more than $1,000 for choice seats, in the days leading up to 
the game. Had Mazzone sold 2,000 of his lesser tickets for a profit of $100 
each, and the other 2,000 of his better tickets for a profit of $200 each, he 
would have generated $600,000, or a net profit after purchase price and 
contribution of $316,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone, 44, of Bel-Air, owns Qualified Benefits, a Woodland Hills real estate 
development company that also administers pension plans. Dalis said that, to 
the best of his knowledge, Mazzone is also involved in a travel business that 
puts together tour packages. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials, who said it is common practice for schools to sell tickets to 
boosters, dismissed any notion of wrongdoing, either legal or ethical. Ticket 
scalping is not illegal in California, except on the premises of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of UCLA people sold tickets to someone else," said Dalis. "We 
often sell tickets to corporations who might sell tickets to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone has known Donahue for more than 20 years and previously published 
stories on his relationship with Donahue said that he has assisted the UCLA 
coach in financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference earlier this week, Wisconsin Atty. General Jim Doyle 
urged Rose Bowl officials to change the way they distribute tickets, saying the 
current system leads to scalping. 
</P>
<P>
 He mentioned the sale of the tickets to a single buyer (Mazzone) as an 
egregious example of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the problem of what happened in California stems directly from the 
ticket distribution system that is utilized . . . a system that leads to ticket 
scalping in California," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>

story.

FUTILITY INFIELDER; PLAYING ON THREE OF BASEBALL'S MOST INEPT TEAMS FORCED 
JOHNNY BERADINO TO ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The St. Louis Browns lost 111 games in 1939 and 102 in 1951. In 1952, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates lost 112. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Beradino played for all three of those miserable teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the worst teams there ever were," Beradino said at lunch recently, 
chuckling at the thought. "And the cheapest." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Pirates had finished 54 1/2 games behind the National League 
champion Brooklyn Dodgers, Beradino retired from baseball, returned to 
California and took up acting full time. Casting calls seemed more palatable 
than another season of playing utility infield in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Beradino was almost 36. His back had never healed after he had fallen 
off a Navy Jeep at Pearl Harbor and, truth be known, he had been acting longer 
than he had been playing ball. He was in a few "Our Gang" comedies as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino suspected that wages for acting couldn't be more paltry than what the 
doormats of baseball were paying him. 
</P>
<P>
 How cheap were they? Well, Beradino was an infielder for the Browns from 1939 
to 1947, with more than three years out for military service in World War II, 
and the least he expected in 1944, when the Browns won their only pennant, was 
a token partial share from the World Series. During the war, it was a common 
practice for World Series teams to reward their absent service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the Browns were beaten by their intracity rivals, the 
Cardinals, in a six-game Series, a small package arrived for Beradino at Pearl 
Harbor. Inside was a deck of playing cards with the Browns' logo. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was it," Beradino said. "My Series bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns paid their batboy, Bobby Scanlon, $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino made his own good deal, though, after the 1947 season. The Browns had 
traded him to the Washington Senators for second baseman Gerry Priddy. Beradino 
told the Senators he wasn't going to report because he was quitting to become 
an actor. A few days later, Bill Veeck, who owned the Cleveland Indians and 
needed a spare infielder, tried to talk Beradino out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Veeck, who later became one of Beradino's best baseball friends, agreed to 
double his salary and pay the premiums on a $1-million insurance policy in case 
a bad hop messed up Beradino's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino wanted a little more. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every 100,000 fans over 2 million, give me a $1,000 bonus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny, that's crazy," Veeck said. "We'll never draw 2 million." 
</P>
<P>
 They struck the deal, though, and Veeck bought Beradino from the cash-strapped 
Browns for $65,000. Then the Indians, after a three-way pennant battle with the 
Red Sox and the Yankees, beat Boston in a playoff game and also won the World 
Series, drawing 2.6 million. Beradino's bonus was $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed all of it. Waiting for Hollywood to call, Beradino hocked his Series 
ring and his golf clubs to ease a cash crisis. In downtown Los Angeles, a 
pawnbroker noted that Beradino's name was engraved on the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, I'd give $60 for a ring of this type," he told Beradino. "But I 
think you'll be back to get this. Make it $80." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino now wears the ring on his right pinky. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, he auditioned for the part of an internist in a new afternoon soap 
opera on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get it, I don't like the idea of being tied up," he said to his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry about that," the agent said. "Do the pilot, and take the money 
and run." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Beradino realized that he had signed a five-year contract. The 
pilot had legs, though, and the 76-year-old Beradino is now in his 31st year on 
"General Hospital." He has dropped the second R from his real name, Berardino, 
and his character, Dr. Steve Hardy, is now the chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days when the show was done live, Beradino once asked if his friend, 
Yogi Berra, could do a cameo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll use him, but not in a speaking part," Beradino was told. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, the squat Berra waddled past the cameras. He might have 
been dressed in white, but he was still Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's that?" said an actress playing a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Dr. Berra, the new staff psychiatrist," the other nurse said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beradino worked both sides of the street, prejudice was a two-edged 
sword. In a time when anything longer than a brush cut was considered radical, 
his hair showed slightly under his baseball cap. The bench jockeys were 
merciless. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, directors looked askance at Beradino, a boy of summer, a 
thespian wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "They frowned on athletes acting," Beradino said. "They never took an athlete 
seriously. They thought we were inept, that we couldn't have any creative 
talents in us." 
</P>
<P>
 That was quite an act those Browns put on in '39, imitating a ballclub while 
losing 111 times and finishing 64 1/2 games behind the Yankees. Beradino, whose 
lifetime average was .249, batted .256 in his first season, driving in 58 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a strict major league rule against fraternization then, but the 
Yankees liked Beradino, and when they went to St. Louis for a series, the 
rookie was invited to the Chase Hotel for a long-running party the night before 
the first game. Lefty Gomez was one of the ringleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the suite, Beradino was greeted by a washtub of iced beer in the 
middle of the room, and a well stocked liquor bar on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The party went on forever," Beradino said. "After a while, I thought to 
myself that no matter what my teammates were doing that night, they couldn't be 
in as much trouble as the Yankees were. The series opener was the next 
afternoon, and I said to myself that now we'd probably beat these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a rookie, what did I know? The score was something like 14-2, Yankees. 
And that's the way it went all year long." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino drove in 85 runs in 1940, and the next season, as a third-year man 
playing shortstop, he seemed on the verge of a breakthrough, batting .271 with 
89 RBIs. In 469 trips to the plate, he struck out only 27 times. 
</P>
<P>
 But 1942 was mostly lost to the service and he missed the next three seasons, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hurt my back bad in that Jeep accident," he said. "They had me in a plaster 
cast for eight weeks. It itched like crazy. I cut the damn thing off finally. 
When I went for my discharge a little later, nobody noticed. Nobody asked me 
what had happened to the cast." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino never played regularly after the war. By 1951, Veeck owned the Browns 
and he and Beradino had a reunion in St. Louis, Beradino joining the club as a 
player-coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it as a favor," Beradino said. "It saved Bill a salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Beradino was on the bench, watching, that Aug. 19, when Eddie Gaedel, wearing 
uniform No. 1/8 and standing 3 feet 7, walked as a pinch-hitter against the 
Detroit Tigers. The American League in effect threw Veeck's one-shot midget out 
of baseball the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardly anybody knew what was up," Beradino said. "We couldn't figure out what 
was happening when they brought that little guy out of the clubhouse to start 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a big crowd that day, a notable exception that season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get over the Dodgers drawing 80,000 (a game) when they first moved 
to L.A. and played in the Coliseum," Beradino said. "I thought back that we 
didn't draw much more than that all year in '51." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters in St. Louis at the time all knew how easy it was to sneak into the 
empty box seats from the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," Beradino said. "Veeck couldn't afford too many ushers." 
</P>
<P>
 Some good fairies in Baltimore waved their magic wands over the Browns in 
1954, turning them into the Orioles, and a franchise that never paid an annual 
salary higher than $25,000 was no more.

JIM MURRAY: WHERE'S THE FIGHT IN WORDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They should release this fight film as a silent movie. It's the quietest 
heavyweight championship since they fought on barges. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is the fighters -- Evander Holyfield and Michael Moorer. They act 
more as if they're running for office than a title. They do everything but kiss 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what we've come to expect in pre-fight buildups. Muhammad Ali, a 
student of the Gorgeous George-Freddy Blassie pro-wrestler hype, in which you 
call your opponent everything short of the guy who shot Jesse James. Blassie 
used to call his adversaries "pencil-necked geeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Ali would call a George Chuvalo "a washerwoman." He would sneer at Floyd 
Patterson as "a guy who should apologize if he even dreamed of beating me." 
Mike Tyson would snarl that his opponent should wear a skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer and Patterson, on the other hand, project more friendliness than a guy 
selling vacuum cleaners. They profess to have only the highest respect for each 
other. You'd never guess they were going to fight each other at Caesars Palace 
on Friday night. Going to the craps table together, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 What this fight needs is an injection of incivility. These guys need to study 
films of old Ali news conferences or even Sonny Liston interviews: "If he run, 
I cripple him. If he come to me, I kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough of this "I know he's a great fighter. I just hope I can be as great a 
champion as he is, if I win." A mutual admiration society. A friendly exchange 
of views. Bah, humbug! 
</P>
<P>
 What we need is a little bared-teeth schoolyard invective. A little of what 
the fighters call "dissing." Something to make the public think its going to 
see a grudge match not a love-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than this runaway politesse, I would rather have from the two fighters 
something of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield: "What makes this guy think he belongs in the ring with me? Let me 
tell you something, he shouldn't be a fighter, he should be a janitor. He 
should be carrying a mop and pail into the ring, not gloves." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer: "A janitor? What about Holyfield? The only reason he's champ is that 
Mike Tyson's in prison and Riddick Bowe couldn't pass a McDonald's or a Pizza 
Hut. The phrase 'fast food' was invented by a guy watching Bowe eat a 20-egg 
breakfast with pancakes one morning. Holyfield didn't beat him; the great chefs 
of Europe and the fry cooks of Maryland did." 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield: Let me tell you about Moorer. Under his chin resides one of the 
greatest collections of Spode china this side of the British Isles. When he 
gets hit on the jaw, there's a sound like a tray full of cups and saucers being 
dropped. He has to be careful not to knock himself out shaving. Talk about a 
glass jaw, you can see yourself in his." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer: "I don't know why Holyfield's concerned about anybody's jaw. He can't 
hit hard enough to break a raw egg. I mean, here's a guy who fought Larry 
Holmes and George Foreman and, between them, their ages totaled 84 years and 
Holyfield couldn't even make them blink. They were in more danger getting 
bumped into in a subway than they were getting hit by Holyfield. I expect a 
tougher fight from the heavy bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield: "He ought to expect a tough fight from the heavy bag. The way he 
moves he'd have trouble getting out of the way of a glacier. This guy has been 
on more floors than a mop. He should sell ads on the soles of his shoes. He 
goes down in a high wind. I may not have to hit him, just blow on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer: "Holyfield says he can 'take it.' Well, why not? That's all he ever 
does in the ring. Who's he ever fought? His record reads like a motel registry 
in Dubuque. I've seen more famous names in a Warsaw phone book." 
</P>
<P>
 That, ideally, is what you wish pugs would say on the eve of fisticuffs. I 
mean, these guys are going to try to kill or maim each other. Shouldn't they at 
least try to work up a little detestation? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Joe Louis used to leave his opponents a measure of respect. "Another lucky 
night," Joe would croon soothingly just after he had left a guy bloodied and 
beaten on the floor after two minutes of fighting in the first round. Rocky 
Marciano used to look across the ring sorrowfully at some guy whose rib cage he 
was going to cave in. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Ali taught us the proper protocol in matters of this kind. Make your 
opponent so furious that he'd fight a stupid, reckless fight, completely 
outsmart himself. Or getting him to doubt himself or to think that you were 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas! These protagonists do none of these things. Listen now to the champion, 
Evander Holyfield, on the eve of the weigh-in. Someone asks him if he respects 
Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect anyone who climbs into a ring," says Evander evenly. "I have a lot 
of respect for anyone who is No. 1 contender. I was once No. 1, and I was glad 
of the opportunity to fight for the title and I can feel what he's feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 (This answer should have been: "Respect? For this bum? Let him fight somebody 
first, and earn that respect!") 
</P>
<P>
 Someone wants to know if Holyfield feels that the pressure is getting to 
Moorer. Holyfield shakes his head. "Not at all," he says. "There's a lot of 
talk about fear but let me tell you, I still got to go in the ring, I got to do 
my thing otherwise it don't matter what he'd be feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 (Holyfield should have said, "You bet he's feeling pressure! But not the 
pressure he'll be feeling when the bell rings and I land one on that glass chin 
of his!") 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, someone wanted to know of Holyfield, "Aren't you impressed with all 
the KOs on his record?" and Holyfield allowed, "That might be fine for the 
press but it's not impressive to another boxer. It's who you KO. It's not like 
he's KOd quality fighters. I'm not calling nobody a stiff, but when you get 
guys who are great or who are trying to be great, along the way they'll take a 
lot of punishment while another fighter who's going nowhere won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's more like it. Because the simple English translation of that is, 
"Am I impressed because he knocked out a bunch of stiffs? No! He's just knocked 
out a lot of guys who were just looking for the floor anyway and an excuse to 
dive there and were damned if they were going to take a lot of punishment going 
there. When he knocks out Ramzi Hassan, I don't even look up. When he knocks 
out somebody like Riddick Bowe, we'll talk." 
</P>
<P>
 You have to say Holyfield is getting there. He shows promise. Ali could take 
him in hand.

PARK IS SENT TO SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, so it wasn't exactly Fernandomania. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-heralded rookie season of Dodger right-hander Chan Ho Park, the first 
Korean in major league baseball, has been put on hold with Wednesday's 
announcement that Park is being sent to the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who has been compared to former Dodger rookie phenom Fernando 
Valenzuela, has been optioned to the San Antonio Missions, a double-A club in 
the Texas League. The Dodgers have recalled Omar Daal, a left-hander from 
triple-A Albuquerque to replace Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, and Manager Tom Lasorda emphasized the 
move should not be regarded as a demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys are sent down because they are not doing the job," Lasorda said. 
"This wasn't the case with him. We're sending him down for his betterment. . . 
. This guy has an outstanding arm and, believe me, he's going to be an 
outstanding pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it looked in spring training when he made six starts and was 
2-1 with a 2.16 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the regular season started, Park did not play much. He has made only 
two appearances since opening day, both in relief, amassing an 11.25 ERA in 
four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Dodgers getting a lot of innings out of their starters, there hasn't 
been much need for a long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been unfair to have a talent like that just sit here and not be 
able to develop for lack of work," said Ron Perranoski, Dodger pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Park agreed with the Dodgers' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for me to throw more," he said through his interpreter, 
Don Yi. "And I really appreciate that. It's an opportunity for me to learn 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Park says there is much to learn about how to pitch and how to think. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed confident in the spring, but once the season started, he seemed to 
lose his edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Between innings of Park's second appearance, a game in St. Louis, Perranoski 
took him into the clubhouse and told him to be more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in environment won't be easy for Park, according to Baik Sung, a 
writer for the Korea Central Daily who has been following Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Park will miss the ties he had developed with Los Angeles' Korean 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Antonio will be a strange place for him," Sung said. "Here, he had 
friends. There, he will have to stay in a hotel with Don Yi. Here, he could eat 
in Korean restaurants. There, they are going to be hard to find. He does not 
have any experience being so far away." 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be for long, Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have no reservations about calling him (Park) up to the major league 
level if we had a need."

COACH RELENTS AND LIFTS HIS BAN ON SEX FOR SWISS WORLD CUP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Roy Hodgson has relaxed a ban on sex during this summer's World Cup 
soccer tournament after a strong protest from Switzerland's players and their 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Wives now will be allowed to visit the players twice during the monthlong 
tournament, including after Switzerland's June 18 match against the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgson, an affable Englishman, has become a national hero since coaching 
Switzerland to its first World Cup appearance in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But he raised eyebrows and lowered morale by announcing the sex ban in March. 
Headlines such as "No Sex Please, We're Swiss," and "No Sex Please, The 
Manager's British," appeared around the world in a takeoff on the long-running 
London theater comedy "No Sex Please, We're British." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over sex and sport is years old, and commentators remain divided 
over the benefits of abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele, the retired soccer great, said recently that late nights and lack of 
sleep are to blame for poor performance rather than sex.

A DISAPPOINTING END TO THOMAS' CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was not the NBA farewell Isiah Thomas had planned. But his exit -- hobbling 
off the court with a torn Achilles' tendon -- seemed to symbolize the Detroit 
Pistons' dismal 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, one of the league's all-time great guards, was forced to end his 
career in what was his final home game, a 132-104 loss Tuesday night to the 
Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although disappointed, Thomas said: "Me, as an athlete and a basketball 
player, when it's all said and done, I wanted to leave everything on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 But the man who led the Pistons to NBA championships in 1989 and '90, could 
not overcome the mounting injuries this season. After landing badly from a jump 
in the third quarter, Thomas said: "It felt like I got shot with a cannon." 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered a torn right tendon and had surgery Wednesday evening. The injury 
will keep him out of this summer's world championships in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to be able to play at all in that," team physician Benjamin 
Paolucci said. "As a matter of fact, if he were planning on playing next year, 
he would have missed the first part of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Piston guard Joe Dumars: "That's an absolutely terrible way to end it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas left Indiana at 19 to sign with the Pistons, and was the second pick 
overall of the 1981 draft. He became the Pistons' all-time scoring leader in 
1991 and this season surpassed the 18,000-point mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But this season, his 32-year-old body could not hold up. He missed 20 games 
because of injuries, including a hyper-extended knee, a broken rib, a broken 
hand, a strained arch, a calf injury and a cut left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in March, Thomas joined Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson and John 
Stockton as the only NBA players to record 9,000 career assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look back at what I was able to accomplish, what I got out of my body, and 
it far exceeded anything I could have envisioned," Thomas said. "I can 
comfortably say I didn't waste any talent."

AT OJAI, A LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year was 1938 and the sound of playing cards slapping on a table mixed 
with occasional laughter wafted from a dimly lit hotel room in the small town 
of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 At one corner of the table sat 16-year-old Jack Kramer, deeply engrossed in a 
late-night game of poker with some friends. 
</P>
<P>
 They had gathered to while away the evening after competing in the Ojai Valley 
tennis tournament during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew then what an impressive tennis career awaited Kramer. They knew, 
however, that he was winning a lot of their money, and they kept him playing 
late into the night in an attempt to win it back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kramer didn't know the time of his next match had been changed from 10 
a.m. to 8 a.m., and the joke was on him when he lost to Arthur Marx, son of 
Groucho Marx, in the semifinals of the boys' interscholastic division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to take anything away from Arthur Marx," Kramer said. "But I 
would have won that tournament if I hadn't played cards all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Things haven't changed much at the Ojai tournament, which begins in earnest 
today and continues through Sunday. Young players still are encouraged to 
socialize in a relaxed atmosphere -- citizens open their homes to board many of 
the more than 1,600 players. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament includes the Pacific 10 and Big West conference championships, 
independent and community college divisions, as well as interscholastic, junior 
and open divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is probably the most unique event in the world for the diversification of 
people that are there," said Kramer, 72, who returned to Ojai last year to help 
dedicate the tournament to Arthur Ashe. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the 95-year-old tournament provides an early glimpse of future 
tennis stars. More than 25 Ojai champions have gone on to win Wimbledon, 
including Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Geoff Abrams of Newport Harbor High is top-seeded in the boys' 
interscholastic singles division and Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks is 
top-seeded in the girls' 18-and-under singles division. Wayne Black of USC is 
top-seeded in the Pac-10 men's singles division and Laxmi Poruri of Stanford is 
top-seeded in the Pac-10 women's singles division.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK'S MOVE BOOSTS LEFT-HANDED PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some may regard Omar Daal as just the other man in the Chan Ho Park move. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason they sent down Park, a right-handed rookie pitcher, was to 
get him more work. 
</P>
<P>
 But another reason was to promote Daal, a left-hander. That's a commodity the 
Dodgers are sorely missing. With Park on the roster, the Dodgers had only one 
left-hander, Gary Wayne, on the pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne is 0-2 with a 6.75 earned-run average this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Daal, 22, appeared in 47 games for the Dodgers last season and was 2-3 with a 
5.09 ERA. He was 1-0 with Albuquerque with a 9.64 ERA before being recalled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to further shore up their left-handed pitching, the Dodgers also signed 
Joe Klink to a minor league contract with Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Klink, 32, was with the Florida Marlins last season where he was 0-2 with a 
5.02 ERA in 59 appearances, all in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Klink, who was released just before this season, is effective against 
left-handed hitters. He held left-handed batters to a .216 average last season 
and has held them to a .229 average during his five-year career. STEVE SPRINGER

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TURNER LEAVES TEAM AFTER NEPHEW DIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Catcher Chris Turner left the team early Wednesday morning when he was 
notified that his 11-year-old nephew died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Chad Turner of Bowling Green, Ky., occurred Tuesday afternoon. 
Chris Turner was told after Tuesday night's game, and left on the first flight 
Wednesday. He is scheduled to attend the funeral today and rejoin the Angels on 
Friday in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's sudden departure leaves the Angels without a reserve catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 If something happens to catcher Greg Myers, they would have to use designated 
hitter Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Davis caught a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe 14 years ago, when he caught for double-A Shreveport in the 
San Francisco Giants' organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who needed two stitches to repair a cut to his left eye suffered 
Wednesday when he walked into a door, says he welcomes the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis then broke into an expansive grin, and said, "Let's just hope Myers 
plays the whole game. Where's Torey Lovullo when you need him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Angels congregated before batting practice and said a prayer 
for the Turner family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Phil Leftwich, 0-2 with a 7.02 ERA, realizes he quickly better 
improve or he could be going to the minors when Joe Magrane returns to the 
rotation in two weeks. 
</P>

 Cincinnati Red catcher Joe Oliver had his left ankle put in a cast to try to 
reduce the swelling. A test found no fracture or torn ligaments in the ankle, 
which swelled up last week, returned to normal and then swelled up again 
Monday. The Reds put him on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday.

RAMS WANT FRESNO QUARTERBACK BUT MIGHT TAKE COWBOYS' HARPER 
</P>

<P>
 If the Rams are unable to select Fresno State quarterback Trent Dilfer in the 
first round of Sunday's NFL draft, the team will attempt to trade its first 
pick to Dallas for wide receiver Alvin Harper and the 16th choice in round two. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, confirmed Wednesday that he has had 
trade talks with Dallas owner Jerry Jones and that they are close to an 
agreement on Harper, contingent on Dilfer's availability.The Rams pick fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no trade at the present time," Shaw said. "Our No. 1 plan will be to 
take a quarterback, but if one is not there, there are a number of options to 
consider and one might be trading for Alvin Harper." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was the 12th pick in the 1991 draft. The 6-foot-3, 207-pound wide 
receiver from Tennessee has played in the shadow of Michael Irvin while at 
Dallas. He caught 36 passes for 777 yards and five touchdowns last season but 
is probably best known for big catches he has made in postseason competition 
the last two years, including a 45-yard scoring reception in Super Bowl XXVII. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave some thought to immediately accepting Dallas' offer for Harper, 
but the opportunity to pick a potential franchise quarterback persuaded them to 
wait until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a quarterback there, we would take him," Coach Chuck Knox said. 
"There isn't any question about that." T.J. SIMERS

 Dallas Cowboy free-agent linebacker Ken Norton has agreed to a five-year, 
$8-million contract with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>

HOLYFIELD, MOORER WEIGH 214 FOR RARE EQUAL-SIZE MATCHUP 
</P>

<P>
 Evander Holyfield and Michael Moorer, two 6-foot-2 boxers accustomed to 
fighting taller, heavier opponents, each weighed in at 214 pounds Wednesday, 
two days before their heavyweight championship fight at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield's last four opponents have weighed-in at an average of 235 1/2 
pounds and, in his most recent fight, Holyfield weighed in 34 pounds lighter 
than 6-5, 246-pound Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield and Moorer came up from lighter divisions into heavyweight 
prominence, which Holyfield says shows they both can succeed despite a size 
disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both know that it isn't size or height that makes a difference," Holyfield 
said. "When you go into the ring with two people with that mentality, it's 
going to be an explosive fight." TIM KAWAKAMI

SANTA ANITA; VAN BERG AND DESORMEAUX ARE WELL IN FRONT IN HONORS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the Santa Anita meeting is ending with a whimper because of small 
fields and boring races, the 57th season has gone more smoothly than the 56th. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather has been excellent, there was no Autotote snafu on opening day, 
and track management wasn't trying to discourage business in the final weeks to 
avoid paying more taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers, handicappers and others who cover the track vote annually for bests 
of the meeting. Here's how one ballot will look: 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer -- Jack Van Berg. The Hall of Famer is on his way to his first 
training title at Santa Anita, and he has won with every kind of horse, from 
$10,000 claimers to graded stakes performers. A good example of the trainer's 
talent is Known Lover. A flop since coming to the United States for his 
previous connections, the 4-year-old gelding was claimed by Van Berg -- amid 
chuckles -- for $75,000 on March 6. Known Lover improved to run fourth in his 
first start for him, then won a $40,000 allowance race on April 13. No one's 
laughing now. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey -- Kent Desormeaux. Third in the last two meetings here, Desormeaux is 
going to win the title this year. He holds a 16-race lead over Gary Stevens and 
has won with nearly one-fourth of his mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Apprentice -- Sal Gonzalez Jr. The winner in this category last year, he 
continues to be the only apprentice to make an impact. Going into the final six 
days, he was 10th in the standings despite his affinity for wide trips. 
Gonzalez will lose his five-pound weight allowance in 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Development -- Del Mar Dennis. Considered a useful allowance horse when the 
season started, the half-brother to Forty Niner Days showed he could be a force 
in the handicap division with a clever victory in the San Bernardino Handicap 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Achievement -- Viva El Capitan. This 5-year-old gelding deserves some type of 
award for winning nine of 10 at Santa Anita. No horse on this circuit tries 
harder than Viva El Capitan, who will be in action again on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Race -- Santa Anita Derby. The finish was relatively close, it featured three 
legitimate Kentucky Derby contenders -- Brocco, Tabasco Cat and Strodes Creek 
-- and, nobody had any excuses. The race went as expected, everybody gave it 
his best shot and the horse who looked as if he would win did. It was too bad 
Valiant Nature and Soul Of The Matter were late defections, but the Derby was 
still memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Older Horse -- The Wicked North. The best horse in the nation won the San 
Antonio Handicap and was the victim of a borderline call when disqualified in 
the Santa Anita Handicap. If they had run the Big 'Cap 100 times, he would have 
won it 99 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Older Filly/Mare, Sprinter -- Mamselle Bebette. More Van Berg magic. The 
hard-knocking Copelan filly, owned by John Forsythe's Big Train Farm, rattled 
off four stakes victories, winning on grass and dirt. Only Round Table, with 
five in 1957, has won more stakes at a Santa Anita meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 3-Year-Old -- Brocco. The likely second-choice in the Kentucky Derby took a 
while to come back to the races, but when he did, he ran a gutsy second over an 
off-track in the San Felipe, then won the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 3-Year-Old Filly -- Lakeway. Her talent was widely known before she broke into 
the game during the Oak Tree meeting, and she didn't disappoint when brought 
back in the winter. The Seattle Slew miss won a pair of Grade I's and will be 
heavily favored to capture the Kentucky Oaks on May 6. Let's hope she runs 
there instead of trying the boys in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Grass Horse -- Bien Bien. The Manila horse won the San Marcos and San Luis Rey 
and he should win the San Juan Capistrano on Sunday under a taxing 122 pounds. 
The weight assignment for the approximately 1 3/4-mile marathon was a gift and 
he is meeting probably the worst field in the history of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Grass Filly/Mare -- Possibly Perfect. Lightly regarded when she arrived from 
Europe, she won two of her three tries at the meeting for Bobby Frankel. It's 
too bad she did it on days when other events overshadowed her. Possibly Perfect 
won the Santa Ana the day the appeal of the Big 'Cap disqualification was being 
held, and she took the Santa Barbara the day after the Santa Anita Derby when 
Brocco was put on the vet's list. She and Lakeway were the only two-time Grade 
I winners at Santa Anita this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Claimer -- River Rhythm. Trained by Walter Greenman, the 7-year-old Riverman 
gelding has won three high-priced claimers, two coming on turf and one on dirt 
and he had some troubled trips in a couple other starts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco worked five furlongs in 1:03 Wednesday morning at Churchill Downs, the 
drill required to get him off the vet's list in California. He was put on the 
list by Dr. William Bell, who said he was slightly off in his right foreleg 
after the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 With Churchill Downs veterinarian Mitzi Fisher watching, Brocco went the final 
quarter mile in 23 2/5 seconds. "I watched him pull up and I saw nothing 
wrong," said Fisher. "It was an awesome work on this track. He didn't blow 
(after the work)." 
</P>
<P>
 A blood test is also required by California, and Brocco can't work again until 
the results are confirmed. They are expected by the weekend, and trainer Randy 
Winick's colt is scheduled to work a mile on Monday under Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start for trainer Richard Mandella, Majestic Style held on to 
beat Saltgrass by a nose in the $79,575 La Puente Stakes on Wednesday at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mandella's fourth stakes victory since Saturday. He began the hot 
streak with King's Blade then came back with Memo in the Commonwealth Breeders' 
Cup at Keeneland and Corrazona in the Santa Anita Budweiser Breeders' Cup on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens rode Majestic Style, the even-money favorite, who completed the 1 
1/8 miles on turf in 1:48 3/5. Makinanhonestbuck was third, then came Little 
Lit Bud and 2-1 second choice Still Swingin'. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes: 
</P>
<P>
 Corby, the winner of the 1993 San Felipe Stakes and sixth in the Kentucky 
Derby, was destroyed after breaking his right front leg while working Tuesday 
morning. The 4-year-old Dahar colt was owned by Allen Paulson and trained by 
John Sadler and he was working in preparation for a start in Monday's 
closing-day feature, the San Jacinto Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Marconi, a promising 3-year-old trained by Gary Jones, has two possible 
hairline fractures of the pastern bone in his left hind leg, a bone scan 
revealed. Marconi is expected to be sidelined for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcangues, who is scheduled to make his 1994 debut in the John Henry Handicap 
on May 1 at Hollywood Park, worked a mile in 1:38 1/5 Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Majestic Style is owned by John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm and was previously 
trained by Gary Jones. Jones and Mabee recently severed their long association.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: NEAL FEARS THROWING CAUTION TO THE WIND 
</P>

<P>
 Welcome to Rob Neal's world. It is a world of potential, a world of pressure. 
And he hopes to bring an end to a world of hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, a former Westlake High outfielder who didn't think he was good enough 
for big-time college baseball, is a Division II player and a top professional 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts love his potential. Neal should be elated. 
</P>
<P>
 But pressure to perform for scouts despite a nagging shoulder injury has 
threatened to spoil his junior season at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 His sophomore season was remarkable. He batted .361, hit 10 home runs and 
drove in 67 runs. He had 84 hits and 136 total bases. All except the batting 
average were team highs. He was named as first-team All-West Region and 
second-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering this season, Baseball America magazine ranked him the No. 1 pro 
prospect in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 He did one other thing last season. He separated his right shoulder in a 
collision eight games into the season. He has played in the outfield only six 
times since, serving primarily as a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer Neal underwent shoulder surgery by Dr. Frank Jobe, who has rebuilt 
hundreds of arms. But Neal is afraid to test his arm. He's appeared in 38 games 
this year, all as designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think I've been a baby about it, not going out earlier," Neal 
said. "But, hey, it's my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Even his family has been impatient, Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't sports oriented and they see all this money I can make," he said. 
"It gets frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days I can go out there and throw the heck out of the ball. But I'm 
afraid one time it's going to pop out and that will be the end of it. I feel 
it's real close to 100%. I have a checkup with Dr. Jobe on Monday. I'd like to 
hear it from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the telephone rings daily. Major league scouts are telling Neal, 
21, to hustle up. They want to see if he has enough arm strength to make a 
relay throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get out there soon enough for these scouts," he said. "They don't 
want to draft a guy who they haven't seen play defense." 
</P>
<P>
 No one questions Neal's bat. He has hit since the day he arrived in San Luis 
Obispo. He didn't show much power his freshman year -- one home run, nine runs 
batted in -- but he hit .373 in 75 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 He exploded last year, finishing with a .584 slugging percentage. In 233 
at-bats, he struck out only 26 times. And he got exposure when the Mustangs 
reached the Division II College World Series final. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to Baseball America and word of mouth, everybody knows him. 
Pitchers too. They're throwing him fewer fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I get 3-1 changeups," Neal said. "I see first-pitch sliders instead of 
fastballs." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal is batting .301, fifth among Mustang starters. (Freshman Andy Hall from 
Camarillo High leads the team at .349). 
</P>
<P>
 But Neal leads the Mustangs in runs (32), hits (41), RBIs (34), triples 
(five), home runs (four) and total bases (72). He has the same number of 
strikeouts this year, but in 97 fewer at-bats (136). 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not bad, but I'm capable of a lot better," he said. "This is the big 
year. You have much more leverage in the draft as a junior than you do as a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I'm recognized. Being the man on the team, you put a lot more 
pressure on yourself. I've never experienced this before." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said he was a relative unknown coming out of Westlake, where he was 
overshadowed by Mike Lieberthal, the third player chosen in the June draft 
Neal's junior year. Neal wonders in which round he'll be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read that I could go anywhere from the fifth to the eighth round. But now I 
hear lower," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Neal said, he is satisfied with what he has proved to himself. 
He had partial scholarship offers from USC, Long Beach State and Cal State 
Northridge three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know if I was good enough to play Division I, so I took the easy way 
out," he said. "I don't regret it. I hit just the same against Division I 
pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo junior pitcher R.J. Simone 
(Hart/Canyons) is 7-2 with a 3.66 earned-run average and three complete games. 
. . . At Nevada, Shane Slayton (Royal) and Andy Dominique (Alemany) have nearly 
identical batting statistics. Slayton is batting .333 with 29 runs, 42 hits, 
six home runs and 36 RBIs. Dominique is batting .328 with 29 runs, 45 hits, six 
home runs and 34 RBIs. Nevada (29-7) is ranked 20th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In softball, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo junior third baseman Kelley Bannon 
(Camarillo) leads the team in batting (.403), runs (35), hits (58), RBIs (27), 
doubles (six) and total bases (75). Christie Collier (Thousand Oaks) and Laurie 
Weidenhaemer (Buena) have chipped in with .281 and .265 averages. The Mustangs 
are 25-12. . . . Freshman Nicole Ochoa (Thousand Oaks) has four home runs, four 
doubles and 20 RBIs in 40 games at Long Beach State. . . . Catcher Heather 
Siegel (Taft) leads eighth-ranked Nevada Las Vegas with a .416 average.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SCC BASEBALL MAKING NEWS WITH 
VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern California College baseball team has received national, and even 
international, attention this season because of the performance of pitcher Ila 
Borders, the first woman to win a college baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 But until recently the Vanguards weren't doing anything to warrant another 
look. They lost their first seven Golden State Athletic Conference games and 
were showing few signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before SCC won six of its last seven conference games, including 
doubleheader sweeps of then second-place Azusa Pacific and first-place 
Westmont. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're playing more free and easy because we thought we were out of 
it," SCC Coach Charlie Phillips said. "But now we're in fourth place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards (16-22, 6-8 in the GSAC) have moved back into contention for a 
spot in the NAIA District 3 playoffs. With six games -- doubleheaders against 
Cal Baptist (8-5), Concordia (5-9) and Point Loma Nazarene (8-5) -- remaining 
in the regular season, SCC is three games behind Westmont (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're lucky to be in it, but take away some of our early losses and we might 
be in first place now," said Phillips, noting that three of the Vanguards' 
first seven losses were by one run. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three conference teams automatically qualify for the four-team 
district playoffs. The final playoff team will either be the conference's 
fourth-place team or one of the independents, Biola or The Master's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said the turnaround came after he made some defensive switches. Jason 
Brissey moved from shortstop to third, Jason Albrand from second to short and 
Augie Pena from designated hitter to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then we've played extremely well on defense," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitching has been notably strong: Entering the week, the Vanguards led the 
district in team earned-run average at 3.45, which dropped to 3.37 after giving 
up two earned runs in 13 innings of a 4-3 victory over Concordia on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips used four pitchers, his entire full-time pitching staff, Tuesday. 
Borders started and left after six innings tied, 3-3. Rick Homutoff pitched 
into the ninth and was relieved by Jeff Beckley, who pitched a perfect 3 2/3, 
striking out seven of the 11 batters he faced, including six in a row. Paul 
Gutierrez (4-6) pitched the 13th to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his 3-6 record, Beckley, a 6-foot-4 left-hander from Trabuco Hills 
High, is the ace. He leads the team in innings pitched (88 1/3) and strikeouts 
(69) and has a 2.99 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Homutoff, who entered the week with the third-best ERA in the district, 
lowered it to 2.01. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia Coach Jackie Schniepp was ejected in the bottom of the 13th Tuesday 
after arguing a balk call against Eagle reliever Jake Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a left-hander, has picked off 17 runners this season without being 
called for a balk, but Schniepp was arguing more than the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp said the same umpire had made a bad call in a game earlier this 
season, which led to a loss to Cal State San Bernardino. And in the first 
inning Tuesday the umpire made a call that cost the Eagles a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought this was the third case of over-umpiring, so I brought up the 
other two calls and he threw me out of the game," said Schniepp, who noted it 
was the first time he had been ejected from a game as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (15-23-1), still in the race for a playoff spot, plays at Azusa 
Pacific on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let's play three: The Southern California College softball team had a 
productive day against Azusa Pacific Saturday. The Vanguards swept a 
doubleheader from the Cougars and completed a suspended game by scoring a run 
in the 10th inning for a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With the sweep, SCC (39-8, 12-2 in conference) moved within a victory of 
clinching its second consecutive conference title. The Vanguards, who are 
ranked eighth in the NAIA national poll, finish the regular season on Saturday 
with a doubleheader at second-place Cal Baptist (7-3).  
</P>
<P>
 "The sweep was a confidence booster," SCC co-Coach Bekki Turner said. "But the 
kids are well aware that it isn't over. Even if we win the conference title we 
still will see these teams in the district playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Beth Howard, who won all three of the games with Azusa Pacific, was 
named NAIA national pitcher of the week. Howard, a senior from Cypress High, 
had a 5-0 record, striking out 30 and giving up four earned runs in 30 innings. 
Howard also was named the conference and district player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Indicative of the transition the Chapman athletic department is making is that 
all but one of its spring sports teams finish their seasons this week. NCAA 
Division III programs play shorter seasons than their Division II counterparts. 
The women's track and field team, which is at the Azusa Pacific invitational 
Saturday, finishes May 7 at the Cal Poly Pomona invitational. The men's and 
women's tennis teams are at the Ojai tournament, which started Thursday. The 
softball team lost two games to Cal Lutheran, Monday, and finished 27-17. The 
baseball team, which played 54 games and finished in late May last year, lost 
to UC San Diego Tuesday to finish the season 10-25-1. The Panthers, who lost 
their first 10 games of the season, finished with an eight-game losing streak. 
Chapman's pitcher James Thomas, the only senior on the team, took the loss, 
dropping his record to 2-8, despite a 3.63 ERA and 74 strikeouts in 86 2/3 
innings.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; SOME GLOBAL TIES WRAP UP THIS RECRUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER

<P>
 It's not too often that Irvine beats Arkansas, Cal and Seton Hall for a 
blue-chip basketball recruit. But the Anteaters did just that when Raimonds 
Miglinieks, the point guard from Latvia who averaged more than 400 assists a 
season at Riverside Community College, signed a letter of intent last week. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two reasons Miglinieks chose Irvine, one compelling and the other 
clearly a factor. So, every time Miglinieks creates a scoring opportunity next 
season, Anteater fans can thank first, the Southland's large and gregarious 
Latvian community and second, the dedication of Irvine assistant Greg Vetrone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live here for two years and I have lots of friends now, so it would be hard 
for me to leave," Miglinieks said. "That is my biggest reason. There are a lot 
of Latvians and a Latvian Church in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to United States two years ago, it was like I have to start my 
life again. And if I moved somewhere else, it means I have to start over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks and his wife, Krista, left the turmoil of Latvia two years ago to 
try to make a new life in the United States. He had met former Irvine standout 
Wayne Engelstad while touring this country with the Latvian national team and 
stayed at Engelstad's house for the first four months he was here. 
</P>
<P>
 While playing pick-up games in Irvine's campus gym, he met Riverside assistant 
Maz Trakh, who asked him if he wanted to play there. The rest is history in the 
Riverside record books. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, in the person of Vetrone, watched Miglinieks' community college career 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Vetrone) did a really great job," Riverside Coach Bob Schermerhorn said. 
"He's been at it since Raimonds was a freshman here and came to every game he 
could. I think Raimonds understands loyalty and puts importance in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks: "He's a good guy. Vetrone and Coach (Rod) Baker are nice guys and 
good coaches, I think. Maybe they didn't have luck or whatever last season, but 
they are good coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks believes the Anteaters, 10-20 last season, will be a good team and 
says he is looking forward to helping them rebound from a disappointing 7-19 
regular season and build on the momentum gained when they swept into the final 
of the Big West Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Irvine's regular-season woes can be traced to the sometimes 
spectacular, but often out of control, play of point guard Lloyd Mumford. 
Miglinieks figures to be a more stable force. He's 23, made the dean's list at 
Riverside and has served two years in the Soviet Red Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Schermerhorn says Miglinieks is the most unselfish player he has ever coached 
and his presence on the court seems to make everyone else play at a higher 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "First thing I want to do, I want to win game," Miglinieks said. "It doesn't 
matter who scores what. I like to pass more than score. 
</P>
<P>
 "And defense is most important thing you have to do on court, I think. If you 
play defense, you win games." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Going, going . . . Junior Jermaine Avie, a 6-foot-7 forward who transferred 
from College of Eastern Utah and was a starter most of the season before his 
role was reduced to reserve status, is considering quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Avie averaged seven points and seven rebounds and was among the top three 
players in minutes played, but he lost his starting job to LaDay Smith and 
scored only 11 points in the Anteaters' four-game march to the Big West final. 
</P>
<P>
 The available playing time at the power forward spot was further reduced this 
week when Michael Tate, a 6-6 forward from Ventura College who Irvine coaches 
believe can have an immediate impact, signed a letter of intent to play at 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 After saying he would have a statement about his decision this weekend, Avie 
was still hedging Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Baker and I talk all the time, but I haven't talked to him about 
talking to the papers," Avie said. "Really, it's not a big deal yet. Nothing 
has come to a conclusion. I haven't made up my mind one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The men's tennis team, two-time defending Big West champions and winners of 
six conference titles in the last seven years, has been ravaged by injuries 
recently. The Anteaters lost to San Diego State last week when three of their 
top players -- Julian Foxon (ankle), Carlos Bustos (knee) and Fredrik Bach 
(hamstring) -- were sidelined. All three players expect to play in the Big West 
Conference Championships, which begin Friday at the Ojai Valley Racquet Club. 
Irvine is seeded No. 2. The Anteaters (11-11) have lost three dual matches in a 
row and dropped to No. 30 in the national rankings. . . . The women's tennis 
team is seeded sixth in the Big West Championships, which began Wednesday in 
Ojai. Irvine (9-12, 4-4 against Big West opponents) has never finished higher 
than third in the tournament. . . . The UCI Track & Field Invitational, 
featuring university and club teams, will be Saturday at UCI Track Stadium. . . 
. The golf team will compete in the U.S. Intercollegiate Tournament at Stanford 
University Saturday and Sunday. Senior Drew Sells leads the Anteaters with a 
75.91 stroke average, followed by freshman Darren Humphrey (76.10). Irvine will 
compete in the Big West Championships May 2-3 at Stockton's Elkhorn Country 
Club. . . . The 1994 Anteater Golf Classic, which benefits the UCI Athletic 
Scholarship Fund, is scheduled June 27 at SeaCliff Country Club in Huntington 
Beach. Cost per player is $175 and includes green fees, cart, continental 
breakfast, hospitality bag, competition package and dinner. For more 
information, phone 856-5550.

CITY HALL NEWS; DEFEAT OF CITY COUNCIL VETERANS EXPECTED TO ALTER PRIORITIES; 
POLITICS: NEARLY A THIRD OF THE REGION'S 44 INCUMBENTS SEEKING REELECTION WERE 
UNSEATED. MANY ISSUES IN DOUBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The ousting of more than a dozen incumbents and the election of a host of new 
faces last week could mean changes in several San Gabriel Valley cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the region, 24 new City Council members and a new mayor in Azusa began 
taking office this week as 14 incumbents who lost and another 11 who retired 
took their last bows. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of the valley's 44 incumbents seeking reelection were unseated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monterey Park, the defeat of Sam Kiang, who successfully repelled a 
proposal to build a card club last year before it even became a formal plan, 
could mean a development firm will try again for a referendum on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The result also means that the city probably will go forward with an 
$11.5-million city redevelopment agency investment in a large multiscreen 
cinema and specialty-store complex on North Atlantic Avenue. All the defeated 
candidates opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last year approved the investment in the complex, which has been 
proposed by BCTC Development Corp., the same developer that wants a card club. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters elected incumbents Fred Balderrama and Marie Purvis and challenger 
Francisco Alonso, all of whom favor putting a card club on the ballot, over 
three Asian Americans -- Kiang, Peter Chan and Mitchell Ing -- who opposed the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although BCTC did not financially support any candidates, a consultant for the 
firm was behind a flyer of election rules sent out to Monterey Park homes in 
English and Chinese that the acting secretary of state said may have illegally 
discouraged Chinese American voters. The secretary has asked the district 
attorney to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is going to take the position of gambling interests and say, 'Let 
the people decide,' while not pointing out any of the negative impacts," said 
Kiang, who maintains that the flyer was designed to hurt his election chances 
because of his opposition to the card club. 
</P>
<P>
 Purvis remains neutral, saying, "It's not my duty to decide the casino issue. 
If the voters want it, that's fine; if they don't want it, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 BCTC officials did not return The Times' telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arcadia, newly elected council members Mary B. Young, Barbara Kuhn and 
Sheng Chang all campaigned on a platform of pruning the city's budget, 
including delaying a $5-million downtown revitalization project. Architectural 
plans for the project already had been drawn up, but at the new majority's 
first City Council meeting Tuesday night, members agreed informally not to 
build at this point and to discuss the project at a later meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The revitalization project, which was approved last year, would widen 
sidewalks and aim to turn Huntington Drive into Arcadia's version of Old 
Pasadena. But the newly elected trio now outnumbers Bob Margett and Dennis 
Lojeski, who support the revitalization project. Young was elected mayor 
Tuesday, and Chang was elected mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we get the budget under control, any revitalization plan must be put on 
hold," Young said before the council meeting, adding that the council might ask 
city staff to take a pay cut to avoid layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters sent a clear message to City Hall that they wanted a more conservative 
fiscal approach by ousting George Fasching and Joe Ciraulo last week from the 
five-member council, said newly elected council members. The retirement of Bob 
Harbicht created the third open seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Foothills city of Azusa, the election has thrown the issue of the 
city's further restricting the operations of the Azusa Rock Quarry into doubt. 
Although quarry critic Stephen J. Alexander, who already was a councilman 
before the vote, was elected mayor, new Councilwoman Diane Moritz-Beebe and 
Councilman David O. Hardison are considered quarry supporters. With incumbent 
Tony D. Naranjo, they comprise a pro-quarry majority. Council members Alexander 
and Cristina Cruz-Madrid are the two remaining critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to get a third vote for tough restrictions on the dust created by the 
quarry, through public pressure," Alexander said. Owners of the quarry deny its 
dust pollutes the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Covina, the election of two opponents of BKK landfill means that the 
majority of council members favor the closure of the dump in 1995. Incumbent 
Steve Herfert and Michael Touhey beat Mayor Richard Jennings and Stuart York, 
who argued that the city couldn't afford to close the dump. The new majority 
chose Councilman Bradley McFadden, committed to closure in 1995, as the city's 
new mayor Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Temple City, incumbents Bobbie McGowan and Mary Manning were unseated by 
candidates who opposed inaugurating a utility tax and promised no new 
assessments or increases in the lighting assessment fee.

INCENTIVE TO ACHIEVE; YOUTH PROGRAM OFFERS REWARDS FOR GOOD GRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 By the time Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole finished talking to the 15 schoolchildren 
packed into a tidy house on the north end of Navarro Street, two things were 
clear: these wide-eyed youngsters don't lack for ideas, and a hotdog barbecue 
might be one way to end interminable council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole spent a good part of a recent Saturday morning discussing the ups and 
downs of being mayor with youths participating in the Navarro 
Avenue-Tremont-Howard Assn. (NATHA) Scholastic Achievement Program. Cole told 
the youths, ages 8 to 18, that one of the ups is that he can help improve the 
city he loves. On the downside, he said, he only earns $4,000 a year -- not the 
$1 million one young boy guessed a mayor brings home. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for his time, the children gave the mayor an earful of ideas for 
bettering Pasadena. Among them were giving unwanted appliances to the homeless 
and electing the mayor by popular vote. Only the smell of charcoal-broiled dogs 
kept the youths from staging a referendum on the latter issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The barbecue was a light finish to a gathering with a serious purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The career presentation -- a regular part of the NATHA meetings held at the 
home of Joseph Rodriquez and Sonya Hildreth-Rodriguez -- are aimed at steering 
young people away from the streets by encouraging academic achievement and 
introducing vocational options. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATHA program is the brainchild of a crime watch group turned neighborhood 
association. It is being praised locally as a model of community activism.  
</P>
<P>
 The program seeks to motivate neighborhood children and teen-agers to do 
better in school by rewarding their achievements. Those who stay enrolled and 
maintain a "C" average or better get to go to Magic Mountain at the end of the 
school year. Those who earn a 3.4 grade point average, or boost their grades 
two points, will spend a week in August in Washington, D.C.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing these incentives, program organizers identify 
tutoring needs by monitoring report cards and talking to teachers, and then 
directing students to nearby programs. At last count, 23 of the 38 youths who 
started the program had stuck with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of grass-roots, self-help is really much better than the government 
programs of the past," Cole said after the meeting he attended. He said the 
NATHA program is an example of -- and a model for -- a growing neighborhood 
movement in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most positive thing that is happening, parents not waiting for 
programs to solve their problems. This neighborhood recognized that their 
problem was that the kids needed help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navarro Avenue block between Tremont and Howard started a crime watch last 
year because rampant drug-selling was attracting crime and violence to their 
street, according to frustrated residents. Soon, organizers focused on helping 
youths in the neighborhood even though most of their own children were grown. 
</P>
<P>
 NATHA member Ted Smith said that during one of the crime watch meetings, 
treasurer Betty Coleman suggested that in addition to monitoring crime on the 
street, the group should do something for the children. Smith proposed paying 
the youths to get good grades, and Harry Washington, also active in the crime 
watch, suggested a trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Smith said, "It snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crime watch group, led by Coleman, Washington, Smith and the Rodriguezes, 
formed the neighborhood association last April and recruited youths to help 
design and participate in NATHA's scholastic program. The city helped with a 
$5,000 grant and the experiment kicked off this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said that even though many of the organizers do not have children in 
the program, their motivation is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like kids are losing out on so much because of crime," Coleman said. 
"You get tired of seeing them die. This is really important to them because you 
know they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 NATHA hopes to improve the program next year by working more closely with the 
school system, reaching out to more at-risk youths and providing counseling as 
well as tutorial services. "We are trying," said Hildreth-Rodriquez, NATHA's 
president. "We are all amateurs. But, hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes 
and build." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodriguezes said one of the biggest challenges will be finding funds to 
expand the program. NATHA is currently applying to a number of foundations for 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Lee, whose grandchildren Phillip and Cameron Allums are in the 
program, believes it is already a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has given them an initiative to want to pull their grades up and do their 
homework," Lee said, "and they feel like they belong to something. It's been a 
blessing to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The youths who stayed with the program seem to agree. "It's fun, you get 
prizes and stuff for doing better in school, and we get to go to Washington, 
D.C.," said Ato Walker, 14, who attends Pasadena Middle School. "That's a good 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 The youths said they were looking forward to the big prize -- the trip to 
Washington -- for a variety of reasons. Some wanted to see the capital's 
Smithsonian museums, as well as the city's famed monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Allums, 10, was delighted that "you get to go without your parents."

CONDO OWNERS WHO WON SUIT CAN'T REST YET; VERDICT: PASADENA RESIDENTS FACE A 
FIGHT TO COLLECT THEIR $6.3 MILLION, THEN MONTHS OF DISLOCATION DURING REPAIRS. 
BUT THE BATTLE HAS BROUGHT THEM CLOSER TOGETHER.

<P>
 Now that they have won a $6.3-million jury verdict, the hard work is just 
beginning for 17 Pasadena condominium owners who sued over excessive noise, 
leaks and other structural problems in their new luxury condos. 
</P>
<P>
 First comes the challenge of actually collecting the money, since the attorney 
for the developer they sued plans to move for a new trial. If they succeed in 
crossing that barrier, they still face months of dislocation while the money is 
used to repair the condos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel partial relief and vindication," said homeowner David Shultz. "We 
know there is still a long time ahead to collect the money and do the work." 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict against developer Victor Illig and his company Orange Grove 
Partners came April 12 after seven weeks of trial. The jury decided unanimously 
that the residents of 515 S. Orange Grove Blvd. had indeed been sold defective 
condos that in some cases were also smaller than advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the residents had been forced to replace water-soaked ceilings five 
times, and others had to remove large sections of bulging parquet floors. 
</P>
<P>
 The work, which will include replacing decks on second-floor units, 
re-roofing, and stripping the building's outside plaster to fix faulty shear 
walls, will require the owners, many of whom are elderly, to move out for 
months. "It's not something we look forward to at this point in our lives," 
Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The up side is that the shared tribulations and trial brought the residents 
closer than they ever expected to be, according to Shultz and others. "It's 
like you are all captive from some kidnaping or something," Shultz said. "We've 
really gotten to like each other and bond over this." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homeowners had been friends with developer Illig when they bought 
their condos from him for prices ranging from $600,000 to $1 million in 1988. 
Illig is not commenting pending further legal action, but his lawyer said the 
verdict was unfair.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that earthquakes, fires and mudslides have recently damaged many 
California homes made it difficult for this jury to reach a fair verdict," 
attorney Bruce Gridley said. "This verdict was not fair and we will make that 
argument to the trial judge, and if necessary to the appellate court." Gridley 
has until April 28 to move for a new trial.

ETHNICITY IS A KEY FACTOR IN ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY; ELECTION: MONTEREY 
PARK CONTENDERS, ONE LATINA AND ONE CHINESE AMERICAN, ARE AT ODDS OVER 
LEADERSHIP, EFFECTIVENESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park) was supposed to be a shoo-in 
for reelection. After all, Democrats outnumber Republicans in her 49th District 
more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before fellow Democrat Judy Chu, a veteran Monterey Park 
councilwoman, issued a challenge that is to be settled in the June 7 Democratic 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her strong standing as a local politician, Chu has an 
all-important ingredient to put up a good fight. She has raised $163,000 for 
her campaign so far, about twice as much as Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 She has attacked Martinez, daughter of Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey 
Park), as an ineffective legislator who cannot get along with other lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This district needs new leadership," Chu said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge grates on Martinez, who sees Chu as overly ambitious. With term 
limits in effect, Chu should have waited for an open seat, the assemblywoman 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of dividing our efforts in contested primaries, we should be working 
to elect a (Democrat as) governor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her effectiveness in the Assembly, Martinez said she has done 
considerable work as a freshman legislator and needs a second term to continue 
her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and Chu largely agree on the issues. Both said they will work to 
improve education and the economy, reduce crime and press for completion of the 
710 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debate centers on who is more qualified to achieve those goals. A 
more rudimentary issue -- ethnicity -- also is expected to play a role in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and Chu are members of ethnic groups that have been striving for more 
political representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon her election two years ago, Martinez joined a small but growing pool of 
Latinos in the Assembly. Chu hopes to become the first Chinese American in the 
Assembly since March Fong Eu, now U.S. Ambassador to Micronesia, left the 
Legislature in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its sizable Asian population, the 49th District is considered 
friendly toward Asian candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian communities have changed the district's landscape in recent years. In 
some parts of Monterey Park, where people of Asian descent are 53% of the 
population, Chinese writing is as common as English on store signs. 
</P>
<P>
 But districtwide, Latinos are about 55% of the population, whereas Asians make 
up 29%, according to census data. The 49th District includes parts of Monterey 
Park, Alhambra, San Gabriel, Rosemead, Temple City, El Monte, Los Angeles and 
unincorporated East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is even more favorable for Latino candidates when it comes to 
anticipated voter turnout in the primary. Estimates provided by both campaigns 
indicate that Latinos cast about 50% of the votes in the 1992 Democratic 
primary and Asians 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of ethnicity is especially significant in low-profile primaries in 
which candidates are not household names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Race is a very significant factor, particularly in races such as this," said 
Alan Heslop, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu declined to concede an ethnic advantage to Martinez, but she acknowledged 
her appeal must go beyond the Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that people will vote on the issues and on the quality of candidates, 
and I'm running on that basis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu, a psychology professor at East Los Angeles College, won a seat on the 
Monterey City Council in 1988, in part by promising to bridge cultural gaps in 
the ethnically diverse community. Chu worked toward that goal in 1990, when she 
spearheaded Harmony Week, an event to celebrate Monterey Park's ethnic 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has shown a willingness to make decisions unpopular with the local 
Asian community. After Chu cast the deciding vote in 1991 to fire a city 
manager, members of the Chinese community picketed City Hall, calling for her 
ouster. Former City Manager Mark Lewis was considered a strong supporter of 
affirmative action and a friend of the Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ethnicity may hurt Chu at the ballot box, it apparently has helped 
fill her campaign coffers. Campaign disclosure statements show Chu's 
contributions have come primarily from the Asian community in and around the 
49th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez has not raised as much money as Chu so far, but that could change as 
the election nears. 
</P>
<P>
 As an incumbent, Martinez has the ability to tap into campaign donors with 
statewide interests. Her campaign disclosure statements show contributions from 
special-interest groups concerned with issues from education to gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Martinez has the support of the Assembly's Democratic leadership 
and the state Democratic Party, which could provide mailers and campaign 
workers to help get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu angered Martinez in October, when the assemblywoman made it known she was 
considering running for the state Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles). Torres is running for state Insurance Commissioner. At that 
point, Chu put her name in for Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) also was eyeing the seat. 
Martinez deferred to Solis, generally considered a more effective legislator, 
and announced she would seek reelection; Martinez feels that at that point, Chu 
should have deferred to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's unfortunate that someone has so much ambition that they can't 
wait their time," Martinez said of Chu. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu says the 49th District can't wait. She cited a recent survey by the 
California Journal, a magazine on state politics, that rated Martinez as a poor 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey polls legislators, legislative staff, executive branch staff, 
lobbyists and members of the Sacramento press corps. Respondents rate 
legislators in six areas, ranging from effectiveness to potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Martinez ranked below all but three of her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our district is clearly being shortchanged," Chu said. "She doesn't get along 
with legislators up there and people don't respect her." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez discounted the survey results, saying they are "tantamount to 
gossip." 
</P>
<P>
 Political pundits have said Martinez is neither a star nor a failure in the 
Capitol. They said she is not doing poorly for a legislator completing her 
first term. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also note that she has had run-ins that do not ingratiate her with 
some colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In one incident, Martinez irked state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) when 
she grilled him on his proposal to break up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, which the assemblywoman opposed. She later referred to the Senate 
leader, who is of Italian descent, as the "godfather." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said she has rankled some lawmakers by aggressively pursuing her 
goals -- and she does not intend to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I start to concern myself with how the other legislators view me, and not 
the issues, I'm in trouble," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez defended her legislative record, noting that she sponsored a new law 
that prohibits school district officials from spending public money on 
alcoholic beverages. She co-authored another law that increases the punishment 
for armed adults who sell drugs near school bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
 And Martinez has a bill pending that would allow Caltrans to continue the Long 
Beach (710) Freeway through South Pasadena without the agreement of the city, 
which is fighting the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 A third candidate also has entered in the primary. Roy T. Torres has raised 
$2,230 to fund his campaign, according to campaign disclosure statements.

PASADENA OKS CHANGES IN GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena City Council has revised two elements of the city's General Plan 
in an effort to protect neighborhoods and direct commercial and industrial 
development to certain parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised land-use element unanimously approved by the council Tuesday night 
downzoned some single-family neighborhoods to preserve their character and 
increased allowable density in other neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an attempt to help neighborhoods . . . to direct development so there 
are like needs in targeted areas," Vice Mayor Kathryn Nack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The land-use plan dovetails into the so-called mobility element, a 
transportation development plan that also won council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The areas targeted for growth will be near public transportation, including 
the Blue Line light-rail system, which is under construction. Councilman Isaac 
Richard was absent for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials made the changes in accord with an out-of-court settlement of a 
1990 lawsuit against the voter-approved Growth Management Initiative. Business 
owners and minority groups initiated the lawsuit, saying the GMI, which placed 
annual limits on commercial and residential development, was stifling 
commercial growth in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials held more than 50 public forums, workshops and other 
informational meetings to gather testimony on the General Plan changes, 
officials said. About 3,000 residents attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Some property owners argued for zoning changes that would limit development 
and put a lid on traffic and other crowding problems. Others opposed zoning 
changes that would limit the development potential and value of their 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected new development under the plan through the year 2010 includes 6,104 
new housing units, mostly apartments, 6.3 million square feet of new commercial 
development and 1.7 million square feet of new industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial development is to center on Colorado Boulevard throughout the 
city. Most of the industrial development is to take place in East Pasadena on 
both sides of the 210 Freeway, east of Altadena Drive.

TOPICS / HEALTH; PASADENA BUYS SITE FOR PROPOSED HEALTH CENTER TO SERVE THE 
NEEDY; MEDICINE: CITY NOW SEEKS FUNDS SO IT CAN BEGIN TREATING LOW-INCOME 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Health care for the needy in northwest Pasadena is a step closer, now that the 
city has acquired a building for a proposed community health center. The next 
hurdle is finding funding for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to bring critical services for a population that's been 
underserved," said Jacqueline Stiff, the city's health officer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the city will seek grants from the federal government and private 
foundations to treat patients at the proposed Pasadena Community Health Center 
at 1845 N. Fair Oaks Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will serve the one in four Pasadena residents who have no medical 
insurance -- about 33,000 people -- as well as those with inadequate coverage. 
Many of them live in the northwest part of the city. The center also will 
handle Medi-Cal patients.  
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials announced in February that they had purchased the 
61,000-square-foot former Pasadena Community Hospital for $1.7 million. The 
site, which includes three buildings, will be renovated at a cost of about $5.5 
million. The city has issued bonds, secured a grant and other funds to pay for 
the purchase and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money that must be raised for treatment has not been determined, 
Stiff said. The health center could open in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is expected to house a public health clinic offering outpatient 
services, including well-child and prenatal care, alcohol- and drug-recovery 
programs, and testing and treatment for HIV and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 It will have a contingent of doctors and nurses to treat routine injuries and 
illnesses. Serious cases, such as heart attacks and major injuries, will be 
referred to area hospitals, most likely Huntington Memorial Hospital and St. 
Luke Medical Center, Stiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also will house most of the city Health Department's administrative 
offices, which are presently in several locations throughout Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Black Males Forum, a group of community activists, and 
others called on city officials several years ago to establish a health center 
in northwest Pasadena, one of the city's poorer areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Chris Holden and Isaac Richard supported the campaign that led to 
the recent purchase of the old hospital site, a forum spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Marcus Williams said group members will serve an advisory role to 
ensure that the health center provides a range of services, along with an 
emphasis on preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want our people to have access to doctors for preventive care, not just 
when something happens," Williams said. "We'd like to see a lot of that in that 
building."

TOPICS / THEATER; THEATER GROUP HOPING ITS NEW NAME WILL SING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that its name should match its high-interest offerings, the San Gabriel 
Valley Civic Light Opera is changing its name to the Music Theatre of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "People on the Westside might want to check us out," said Bill Shaw, the 
10-year-old company's artistic director and co-founder."We feel that by 
changing our name, we might get a little more interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shows fill 70% of the San Gabriel theater's 1,440 seats, said M. Roger 
Lockie, its executive director. The goal is to consistently fill at least 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said business surged last year for the La Mirada Civic Light Opera when 
it changed its name to the Whittier/La Mirada Musical Theatre Assn. Paul 
Garman, associate executive director at Whittier/La Mirada, confirmed that 
ticket sales went up 40%. But because the group made other changes last year, 
Garman is uncertain what role the new name played. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Shaw said part of the reason for the changes were public perceptions of 
what "civic light opera" means. 
</P>
<P>
 Such groups have traditionally performed works similar to those by Gilbert and 
Sullivan, which are called light operas. However, the companies have been 
exclusively producing Broadway musicals for so long, patrons may have forgotten 
the term's roots and tend to associate it with heavier fare, such as Don 
Giovanni. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel company also hopes the change will attract patrons from 
farther away.

PROSTITUTION RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two dozen people were arrested and charged with prostitution-related 
offenses during a raid on an acupuncture clinic in a strip mall in the City of 
Industry last week, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving a search warrant last Thursday afternoon at Gale Acupuncture, an 
acupuncture and massage parlor at 15341 Gale Ave., deputies arrested a man and 
six women for maintaining and residing in a "house of ill fame," said Lt. David 
H. Kading of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.Nearly 300 
bulk-packaged condoms were seized. 
</P>
<P>
 Kading said an eight-hour sting operation that followed the raid resulted in 
the arrest of 13 men for suspicion of soliciting prostitution from female 
undercover deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The offenses are punishable by up to six months in jail or a fine not 
exceeding $1,000.

SCHOOLS; STUDENTS APPLY SCIENCE PRINCIPLES TO THEIR LIVES; LEARNING: SEVENTH- 
AND EIGHTH-GRADERS AT GIDLEY ELEMENTARY ARE CHALLENGED TO CREATE PROJECTS THAT 
ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM EVERYDAY EXISTENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Seventh- and eighth-graders at Gidley Elementary in El Monte are learning that 
science isn't all textbooks and test tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 It can also be a way to measure which basketball shoes jump the highest, or 
what acne cleanser works best. 
</P>
<P>
 Gidley students are putting the scientific method to the test in a school 
contest that challenges them to apply rigorous standards of inquiry to the 
daily puzzles they encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows how science is connected to life, how it's connected to everyday 
things -- whether it's the products you buy or the things you're curious about 
in your environment," said Gidley science teacher Marilyn Coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Students think of a question, formulate a hypothesis, conduct an experiment 
and develop a graph of their results on a computer. The process takes from 
October to March, and the final projects went on display March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand prize winner Lisa Tseng won a $100 savings bond for her experiment 
showing how temperature variations affect whether fruit flies have curly or 
straight wings, or longer or fatter bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the contest's ninth year; last year, 22 entries from the school went 
on to the county fair in Pomona; 16 won awards, including best of show. 
</P>
<P>
 Although students learn the methodology in science class, an after-school 
workshop held three to four days a week helps them put it into practice. 
Students aren't required to complete a project, but about 230 of the 300 
seventh- and eighth-graders did. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as uninteresting as I thought it was," conceded eighth-grader 
Desiree Millsaps, who tested mouthwashes to determine which brand kills 
bacteria best. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-grader David Hong turned an interest in recycling into an experiment 
about which type of paper -- white, brown or newsprint -- recycles best. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong shredded the paper, mixed it in a blender and pressed it himself. 
Newsprint, he found, was the strongest, and white paper the best for writing. 
To make sure, he used it for his homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recycling is good for the Earth and we can reduce waste by doing it," he 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Moreno received $20 for her prize in this year's contest. She won high 
marks for her project on which solution keeps roses fresh longest. Moreno 
tested roses with and without leaves in solutions of aspirin, sugar, flower 
preservative and plain water, and found roses kept longest without leaves, in 
water alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing a project helps children learn to teach themselves, Coffin said. 
"We try to get them to focus on how they learn rather than how a teacher 
teaches," she said.

<P>
 Today, the school is holding a trike-a-thon, raffle and bake sale to help out

COMMUNITY NEWS: POMONA; REGISTRAR COUNTING SOTO RECALL PETITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pomona City Councilwoman Nel Soto could face a recall election this year if 
the county registrar validates enough of the 1,648 signatures handed in to City 
Hall last week on recall petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Recall Soto Committee, led by teacher and community activist Bob Jackson, 
needs 1,440 valid signatures -- equal to 25% of the registered voters in Soto's 
District 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, whom Soto defeated in the 1991 District 1 council race, alleges that 
Soto, through acceptance of campaign contributions, has sold out to special 
interests such as the billboard industry. Jackson and his group also allege 
that Soto has misappropriated some of her election campaign funds, using money 
to pay for work on her house. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto, who says she's done nothing illegal in spending or accepting campaign 
contributions, argues that Jackson is simply a sore loser who's trying to 
tarnish her reputation in an effort to get elected.

COMMUNITY NEWS: POMONA; WARNING ISSUED ON COLLEGE SOLICITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials at Mt. San Antonio College are warning the community about 
door-to-door solicitors claiming to be raising money for athletic programs at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the college, solicitors for American Sports Center, who are not 
connected with the college, have been fund-raising in the Upland/Ontario area, 
outside of Mt. SAC's district. Although the group has a permit to solicit 
funds, it does not apply to Mt. SAC because it is illegal for that college to 
solicit money in another college's district.

COVER STORY; SIX MONTHS AFTER FIRE RAVAGED THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTS OF 
MESALOA LANE ARE WITNESSING THE . . .; REBIRTH OF HEARTBREAK CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an unlikely spot for a picnic breakfast -- a charred slab in a canyon of 
dead trees -- where Jane Arvizu lays out a blanket, camping stove and thermos 
of coffee. In the still of the morning, the 47-year-old feels right at home 
here -- because she is. 
</P>
<P>
 Arvizu still goes home to catch the sunrise, just as she used to. That way, 
she doesn't forget the solitude of her fire-ravaged Kinneloa Mesa canyon home, 
which she now jokingly refers to as "The Slab." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a year has passed since Arvizu lost her home of 22 years to the Oct. 27 
Altadena firestorm. But she didn't lose her connection to the beloved canyon 
that turned ugly, providing fuel for the flames that changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The firestorm, which burned 5,700 acres and 123 homes in the Altadena area, 
roared down Arvizu's street, gutting four of 14 houses and leaving none 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hearts of the burned-out homeowners are still on Mesaloa Lane, a 
hillside street in unincorporated Pasadena with horse stables, one-acre lots 
and ranch-style houses hidden behind tall trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The street's displaced residents include die-hards such as Dr. Kaye H. 
Kilburn, 62, who hasn't let the fire interrupt his morning routine. Almost 
every day at 7 a.m., he returns to Mesaloa Lane and swims 40 laps in the pool 
on his bulldozed property, where twin brick chimneys towered for months after 
the fire as ghostly remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Lutz forgets herself sometimes and walks zigzag through her empty lot 
as though the house and all its walls and doorways were still in place -- 
through the imaginary front door, into the family room, out the back door. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Barnard squirreled away bricks from her crumbled fireplace at a 
neighbor's place, so her new house someday will have a piece of the old. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's Arvizu, who wants to hold on to the feeling of home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to come up and remember why you're doing all this," said 
Arvizu, who is renting a house in San Gabriel. "Why you're not saying, 'Let me 
just go buy a home someplace and go.' You've got to come back up here and 
remember you love it up here and that's why you're here." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of all four fire-ravaged homes on Mesaloa Lane have chosen to 
rebuild rather than walk away from the heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 None of them have building permits yet, but all are on their way and starting 
to put together blueprints for their new houses. Each has an endless to-do 
list, everything from checking with county fire officials on whether the 
street's hydrants meet water storage capacity requirements to making sure that 
gardens forsake fire-loving greenery -- pampas grass, juniper and pines -- for 
sturdy summer holly and California lilac. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same story throughout the Altadena fire area, where only 15 building 
permits have been issued, mostly for small structures such as decks or walls, 
said Ursula Hyman, chairwoman of the Eaton Canyon Recovery Alliance Steering 
Committee. The committee, which represents eight homeowner groups in the fire 
area, estimates that residents ultimately will apply for more than 300 building 
permits to replace houses and garages and everything else they lost on that 
terrible October day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a long and somewhat painful process for every homeowner," 
Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mesaloa residents who lost their homes cling to glimmers of hope in 
the process of rebuilding, buoyed by small triumphs and unexpected kindnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arvizu, who has grown children but lives alone, hope came in the form of a 
stranger's offering. The stranger, a woman in her 80s, read about Arvizu in The 
Times -- a single sentence about how flames had consumed the wedding 
handkerchief that she and her mother had carried as brides and was to be passed 
on for her own daughter's walk down the aisle in May. The woman picked out an 
antique handkerchief owned by her mother and mailed it to Arvizu with a letter, 
apologizing for offering such a small comfort. Next month, Arvizu's 28-year-old 
daughter will carry the handkerchief in her Pasadena wedding in front of 
invited guests, including the elderly stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a new piece of family tradition," said Arvizu, choking back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Arvizu, who helps run a family restaurant, plans to rent tables and tidy up 
her Mesaloa Lane property so she can throw a wedding brunch on her concrete 
slab; she wants her friends and relatives to get a feel for where she's been 
and where she's heading. So far, she said, the road ahead looks clear, with her 
insurance covering rebuilding costs. An architect has begun sketching designs 
for the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Loren Lutz, 73, never gave up hunting for family treasures, 
including his wife's wedding ring. Day after day, the retired dentist sat under 
the canopy of his blackened oak tree, sorting through bucket after bucket of 
ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, he knocked on the door of the 35-foot motor home where the 
couple is staying in front of their Mesaloa Lane property. As his wife, Marion, 
opened the door, he opened his fist. There it was -- a charred circle of white 
gold with five intact diamonds, the long-lost ring that reminds 72-year-old 
Marion Lutz of their wedding day, when her husband whisked her straight from 
the church in a turquoise suit to a duck-hunting honeymoon near Palm Springs. 
Now the Lutzes have four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, and they 
want to rebuild a house big enough for family visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Lutz, an avid hunter, doesn't back off easily. He said he once put 39 
slugs into an 850-pound grizzly bear that charged him in northern British 
Columbia. But he is tiring of rebuilding hassles, of jumping through hoops at 
every step. 
</P>
<P>
 His effort to get a building permit for a hay shed, for instance, is taking 
weeks. First, county officials sent him packing because he didn't draw up 
building plans on the right size of paper. Then they picked apart the plans and 
asked him to interview his neighbors to find out if there were objections to 
his new hay shed. There have been other hassles, mostly with his insurance 
company, California Fair Plan, which provides fire coverage to high-risk 
property owners. The company is offering a $381,000 settlement, less than half 
the amount that Lutz says he needs to rebuild his 3,200-square-foot home. Lutz 
said his house was appraised recently at $850,000. But his adjuster, Dennis 
Farlin, said the Lutzes signed a policy for coverage up to $381,000, so 
California Fair Plan can only pay that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lutz and his wife take joy in small victories such as the rebirth of their 
prized sago palm. The palm, reduced to a blackened three-foot stump, is showing 
green shoots, important reminders of rebirth and a little piece of the past. 
The Lutzes even nixed their architect's plan to move the palm from its spot 
next to what had been the front entryway. The way they see it, he should design 
the house around the palm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to move it," Marion Lutz said firmly. "It's going to stay 
right there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kilburns are staying in a rented house near Dodger Stadium. The couple 
have a building permit to rebuild their pool house where they had planned to 
live temporarily; they changed their minds when they realized that the 
structure would be too small to live in comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 They are eager to get back, but the wheels are moving slowly, said Gerrie 
Kilburn, an administrator for the American Lung Assn. of Los Angeles County. 
The Kilburns are still working on getting a building permit for a new 
three-bedroom house, with the kitchen facing the mountains to catch the sunrise 
and the family room facing the canyon view, which stretches to Catalina Island 
on clear days -- like in the old house. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, life is limping along. The deer are back, bedding down in the 
Kilburns' blooming rose garden. Recently, a mountain lion left his calling card 
on the badminton court in the form of a dead deer. And the couple keep close 
tabs on their property, lunching often on a redwood picnic table near the pool. 
It feels right to be home, said Gerrie Kilburn, who knew almost immediately 
after the fire that she would not abandon the property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask yourself . . . if you were not here, where would you rather be?" she 
said. "And I couldn't come up with another answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Barnard, 74, the woman who saved her fireplace bricks, never thought of 
turning away. She didn't listen to friends who urged her to take the easy way 
out and buy her rental house in Pasadena instead of trying to rebuild the 
three-bedroom, ranch-style house that her late husband designed 34 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the same thing, exactly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnard speaks briskly of the fire, saying that the worst is behind her, and 
she's ready to move on, especially now that her insurance company and adjuster 
have agreed to completely cover her rebuilding costs. She's comfortable in her 
rental house, furnished mostly with items borrowed from friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends brought the former grade school teacher everyday necessities, 
including a bed, a microwave oven and a box of household items such as an 
extension cord, a stapler and pens. They didn't neglect matters of the heart, 
either, digging up copies of her students' class pictures from the '60s to 
replace the ones that burned. For her part, Barnard brought with her the only 
possessions that survived the flames -- three potted cymbidium orchids -- and 
put them on her patio to remind her of home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Mesaloa Lane, the remaining residents are eager for their neighbors' 
return and grateful that the sickly smell of scorched concrete and melted 
rubber is gone. The air is sweet with the scent of fresh lemons and oranges 
hanging on neighborhood trees, and the street is awash in swaths of color -- 
orange poppies and fuchsia bougainvillea vines -- instead of the dreary blacks 
and grays in the firestorm's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sickening to see it all black," said Pat Greutert, whose garden was 
singed in the firestorm, "but it's coming back beautiful and better than 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Harlan Tripp, 71, said the street is quiet, as always, but he looks 
forward to the buzz of chain saws and the pounding of hammers, signs that life 
is getting back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine six months from now," he said, "it'll be a madhouse."

THEATER REVIEW; LACK OF GIMMICKRY BRINGS DEPTH TO PORTRAYAL OF THE ELEPHANT MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downstage we see a life-size projection of a horribly deformed human 
cauliflower of a figure known as the Elephant Man and ballyhooed in a garish 
adjacent poster as half-pachyderm and half-human. The hideous black-and-white 
photograph is an actual enlargement showing the real-life Victorian circus 
performer John Merrick, who was later rescued from the circus and even socially 
celebrated before his death at 29 in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, upstage to the left, stands a non-deformed young man (actor 
Steven Memel), who slowly twists and contorts his body into the gnarled figure 
of the man in the picture -- a leering, shuffling, vocally distorted youth whom 
the actor must emotionally redefine under the deepening momentum of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The overlapping imagery is a masterful device and establishes the compelling 
style of Bernard Pomerance's "The Elephant Man" at the Knightsbridge Theatre in 
the heart of Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 By not donning a mask or grotesque makeup, the actor is much better able to 
convey the interior emotions of his character -- giving the impression of a 
misshapen body without the off-putting distraction of its physical reality. 
</P>
<P>
 This play has not often been seen here since its 1980-81 national tour and 
subsequent David Lynch movie adaptation (in which grotesque makeup did disguise 
the actor). But it remains an exceptional, fresh work, deceptively written, 
full of vivid characters (20 in all, performed by 10 multiple-playing cast 
members) and thematically provocative under the strong direction of company 
co-founder Joseph P. Stachura. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Elephant Man" is not a freak show. To the contrary, it questions 
conventional standards of what constitutes normalcy, reinvents the old Beauty 
and the Beast myth and eviscerates human preoccupation with image over 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
 As Memel's hulking protagonist is taken in and nurtured by London's medical 
and cultural elite (most earnestly represented by Preston Maybank's staunch but 
self-serving physician, Frederick Treves, and Barbara Naylor's glittery, 
confident London actress, Mrs. Kendall), the disfigured hero begins to 
flourish. Gradually his sensitivity and intelligence (he likes to read Thomas 
Hardy) begin to radiate and alter the views of those around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Memel, adapting naturally to his challenging role, is so convincing that he 
artfully negotiates the uncanny trick of appearing repellent and attractive at 
the same time -- the final measure of his and director Stachura's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Richly cloaked in period costumes by designer Sallie Licata and austerely 
designed and lit by director Stachura, the show wisely opts for no 
intermission. A scene near the end in which Naylor's disrobing actress awakens 
the Elephant Man to his stirrings of sexual desire, is tastefully, even 
poignantly, staged. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the production's rather deliberate and measured tone is enlivened 
by swiftly sketched supporting characters. Notable are Sarah Courtney and 
Priscilla Finch, who segue between elegant royal countesses and freakish 
physiological pinheads in carnival-like striped T-shirts, and Horace Martin, 
who colorfully dovetails dual portraits of a doctor and a crass circus 
huckster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 British accents, led by Maybank's physician, are uniformly authentic. A 
cellist (Jennifer Novak Chun) sits behind a gauzy curtain, subtly underscoring 
the formal Victorian climate and linking the drama's numerous scenes with grave 
and forlorn classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knightsbridge, committed to staging multiple productions simultaneously, 
is alternating "The Elephant Man" with a British farce ("Situation Comedy"), an 
Agatha Christie mystery ("Black Coffee") and an evening of cabaret music ("The 
Ways of the Heart"). 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Elephant Man," Knightsbridge Theatre, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Braley Bldg., 
Old Town, Saturday, 5 p.m., Sunday, 7:30 p.m. Ends May 15. $15. (818) 440-0821.

NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM NAMES NEW HEAD 
</P>

<P>
 Ending an 11-month search for a new executive director, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Natural History announced Wednesday that James Lawrence Powell will 
take over leadership of the problem-plagued museum in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, director at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, the oldest science 
museum in the nation, will succeed Craig C. Blackas executive director of the 
county museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Black's leadership of the 80-year-old museum has been questioned in recent 
years, and he has come under fire for allegedly using county personnel to 
remodel his home. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Los Angeles County auditor-controller's office audited the 
museum's operation last year, and in a report presented to the Board of 
Supervisors said it found that museum managers violated Civil Service rules 
during a round of layoffs and failed to maintain a complete inventory of the 
museum's collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Black had pointed to the museum's shrinking budget as the source 
of problems and said his successor will inherit a facility whose reputation 
Black enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
 During Black's 12-year tenure as director, attendance at the museum rose by 
more than 20% to 850,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, a geochemist and former president of Reed College in Portland, Ore., 
is expected to make fund raising a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have someone who can assist in raising funds and have sensitivity 
to the area," Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said Wednesday. The county 
pays $14 million of the museum's estimated $19-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said the county is discussing ways to increase private support for the 
museum, which has come to rely increasingly on private funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Black has said that private funding for the museum rose from $400,000 to more 
than $5 million annually during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell is a nationally known scholar appointed to the National Science Board 
by President George Bush. Before he was at Reed College, Powell was the 
president of Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., from 1983 until 
1988. Before that, he spent 22 years as a professor of geology at Oberlin 
College in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued by the museum, Powell said he was leaving Philadelphia 
because "Los Angeles and the Pacific Rim, in spite of short-term difficulties, 
is the place to be for the rest of this century and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaves behind a $181,000-a-year job to move to Albuquerque, N.M., where 
he expects to teach and do research.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SOME PARTS OF BUDGET WILL BE TOUGH SELL; FINANCES: CRITICS SAY 
RIORDAN'S PROPOSAL TO CONSOLIDATE A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS WILL REDUCE THEIR 
EFFECTIVENESS. SHIPPERS, AIRLINES MAY FIGHT PLANNED TRANSFER OF HARBOR AND 
AIRPORT REVENUES.

<P>
 As Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan seeks council approval of his 
$4.3-billion spending plan, he is likely to face his most serious skirmishes 
over proposals that involve the least amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, critics have raised objections to Riordan's plan to crunch a city 
bureaucracy that for decades has remained largely impervious to change. For 
example, they said merging a half-dozen agencies into a new Community Services 
Department cannot help but reduce each group's authority and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be folded into a department . . . with another layer of bureaucracy is 
going to dilute our power," argued Paula Petrotta, director of the city's 
Commission on the Status of Women. She said the commission needs to be seen as 
independent to encourage women to come forward with sexual harassment 
complaints and other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan expects to save just $1.2 million by merging the agency with the Human 
Relations Commission, the Department of Aging, the Department of Social 
Services, the city's child care coordinator and portions of the Community 
Development Department. His aides said that the departments will be able to 
maintain their identity through their own citizen commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Breidenbach, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of 
Non-Profit Housing, said its 450 members are concerned about the consequences 
of a second consolidation, one that would place the Community Redevelopment 
Agency and Housing Department in a new Citywide Development Agency. The move 
would save about $4 million annually, which would be plowed back into the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had it that way before and neither side got enough attention," 
Breidenbach said, "and what they found was that single-focus agencies gave more 
attention to the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others noted that former Mayor Tom Bradley created the Housing 
Department in 1990 amid concerns that the need for new affordable housing was 
being lost in the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Breidenbach said, that concern looms again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just created a Housing Department and it is functioning fairly well 
in the second-largest city in the country with the largest affordable housing 
crisis in the country," she said. "Why do we want to change it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, elimination of the Board of Public Works, which has been attacked 
often over the years as an arcane and scandal-prone overseer of contracts, will 
save no more than $1.1 million a year. More importantly, critics say, its 
disbanding could cost the city far more by leaving street and environmental 
services in the hands of civil servants instead of political appointees. Those 
services and projects include the multibillion-dollar overhaul of the city's 
sewage treatment system and the cleanup of Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a strong and representative Board of Public Works, the city may be 
destined to repeat the mistakes of the past," the environmental group Heal the 
Bay wrote city officials in urging that the board not be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Stodder, an environmental consultant who served six years in the 
Bradley Administration: "In the Bradley years, (the Board of Public Works) 
allowed us to challenge some political realities and address problems, maybe 
not on a dime but certainly faster than if we had gone through any other city 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan argues that a single department head can be held more accountable than 
five board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, another major component of Riordan's budget -- multimillion-dollar 
transfers from the city's three independent departments -- seems likely to draw 
its biggest opposition from the shippers and airlines that use the harbor and 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Department of Water and Power is being asked for $75 million and 
the Harbor Department $20 million, officials there say they can live with those 
numbers. The same is true at the Department of Airports, which faces a 
$13-million transfer that is almost double last year's amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the move could spark a new battle with the airlines, which figure 
they will be asked to make up that amount with higher fees. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that happens, the Air Transport Assn. says, it will have no choice but 
to pass its costs on to the traveling public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a $13-million tax on those using the airports. That is all it is," said 
John Ek, the association's director of state government affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not use the word lawsuit, Ek said of the transfer: "We will 
pursue all avenues available to us to oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Harbor Department, there was resignation, if not outright relief, among 
some city officials that the mayor was not asking for more than the $20 million 
he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy that none of our capital improvements or services for tenants 
will be affected," said Harbor Commission President Frank Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 But again, his position was not shared by the association representing port 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have $20 million to give away, they ought to give it back to their 
customers," said Jay Winter, executive secretary of the Steamship Assn. of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Riordan's overall budget plan could change overnight if state 
lawmakers, groping for ways to overcome California's $3-billion deficit, decide 
again to ask the city for money to help balance California's budget. In the 
last two years, the city has given up $117 million in property taxes to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City), there are no 
indications that the city will be asked to provide the state more than it has 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying . . . to make sure the city doesn't get impacted this year 
beyond what was done in last year's budget," Katz said. "We are going to try 
and hold the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, no one can provide that assurance -- certainly not this early in 
the budget year. 
</P>
<P>
 As Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said Wednesday: "Where do we go when the state 
has its own shortfall and takes it out on the cities?" 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's chief of staff, William McCarley, acknowledged that the state's 
budget could force revisions to the city's budget. If the state taps the city 
for money, he said, the mayor is prepared to make adjustments.

FOREVER A HERO; CLASSMATES VOICE RESPECT FOR AILING NIXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He may go down in history books as the only President to be driven from office 
amid scandal and disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Nixon will forever remain a hero in Dolores Ball's book. And in 
Clint Harris' and Alice Newsome's and Hubert Perry's.  
</P>
<P>
 "A fine, fine person," said Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good guy," said Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so proud of him," said Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great President," said Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing will ever change their view, the four college classmates of Nixon 
vowed Wednesday as they returned to the campus they all graduated from 60 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They gathered in the school library's Nixon Room to reminisce. A worn 1934 
yearbook was on the table in front of them -- opened to page 36, where a 
smiling photo of Student Body President Richard Nixon was printed. From a 
corner of the room, a larger-than-life sculpture of U.S. President Richard 
Nixon gazed down at them. 
</P>
<P>
 There were happy recollections of how Nixon had remained in contact over the 
years with the small Quaker college and how he had delighted in returning for 
his class's 50th reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the sad realization that he will be missing from the 60th -- 
planned for June 26. "It will be a luncheon," Harris said. "At our age a lot of 
us don't like to drive at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, now an 83-year-old Oldsmobile dealer, recalled double-dating with 
Nixon and making him ride in back in the roadster's rumble seat. Harris allows 
that he would have been more polite if he'd known Nixon was destined to be 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were clues to their classmate's greatness even then, the group 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he was too scrawny and uncoordinated to make the football team, 
Nixon suited up for games all four years he attended Whittier College, said 
Harris, who was a regular starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just a good guy. A buddy who had more motivation" than any of the 
others who actually won spots on the team, Harris said. "He studied hard. He 
got up early to work in his family's grocery store. He was all drive, drive, 
drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball nodded in agreement. "You never saw him sitting around. He was always 
going somewhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon telephoned frequently when her husband, Ken -- also a Nixon classmate -- 
became ill a few years ago. When he died, Nixon called her to offer 
condolences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the things you remember," Ball said. "I have nothing but very good 
memories about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because it was a small class -- fewer than 90 members -- or perhaps 
because the Depression had given them a special sense of gritty camaraderie, 
the Class of '34 retained lasting bonds, according to Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmates were invited to the White House by their former student body 
president. And she remembers Nixon being "so gracious" when he returned for the 
45th class reunion a few years after his Aug. 9, 1974, resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon stepped down after it appeared he might be impeached as a result of the 
infamous Watergate Hotel burglary and a subsequent cover-up by some 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried all day the day he left the White House," Newsome said. "My heart 
ached for Pat." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the death of Harris' parents and his wife, "nothing ever hurt me 
like that did," Harris said. "Watergate seemed so insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry agreed. "Compared with other things presidents have been involved in, 
Watergate was nothing," said the 80-year-old retired banker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watergate was not something that should ever (have) gone as far as it did. It 
shouldn't have been the tragic event that it was. Watergate was not a crime . . 
. no one was killed in Watergate. No one lost any money. There were no moral 
implications. . . . Nixon had no involvement in Watergate. I think it's been 
blown completely out of proportion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tragedy that a fine President was brought down. Quit calling it a 
crime. It was a sad misunderstanding. . . . I don't know why it was put on 
Nixon's shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving, the four lingered in the Nixon Room -- its collection includes 
about 3,000 books, a quarter-ton of newspaper clippings, about 800 photographs, 
campaign souvenirs and foreign government artifacts collected by Nixon during 
his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, these weren't mementos of a skilled politician, an international 
statesman or a disgraced, unindicted co-conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
 To them, these were memories of a friend.

KING, OFFICERS NOW SHARE GOAL: SETTLEMENT; TRIAL: BOTH SIDES WOULD BENEFIT IF 
THE CITY CONSENTS TO FOOT THE BILL FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ASSESSED TO 
INDIVIDUALS. BUT LEGAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES MAKE A LAST-MINUTE AGREEMENT 
UNLIKELY. 
</P>

<P>
 As Rodney G. King and the former Los Angeles police officers who beat him 
prepare for the second half of a civil trial to determine individual damages, 
for the first time they share a common interest: settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the unlikely event that the city agrees to indemnify those four former 
officers for any punitive damages, they would be free from the prospect of 
large judgments that could loom over them for years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a settlement with the city could be the best way for King to 
get more than the $3.8 million he was awarded Tuesday, since the individual 
officers have little money to pay court awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the chances of settling the case at the last minute, at least for the four 
principal officers, appear remote because of a number of vexing legal and 
political questions. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Would the City Council agree to foot the bill for punitive damages for 
former officers Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon, even though the two of 
them already have been sent to federal prison for their actions? 
</P>
<P>
 * Would the council refuse to pay awards for bystander officers who never used 
their weapons but who have been sued because they were present at the scene and 
did not report the incident? 
</P>
<P>
 * Would the council abandon its tradition of standing behind former Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates, who also is a defendant in the case? 
</P>
<P>
 * Would council members make themselves liable for damages if they backed 
police officers and former officers? 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for King and for the four officers who were tried for beating him 
agree that settlement would benefit all involved, but they say the political 
and legal issues have so far proved insurmountable, blocking progress toward a 
resolution of the case. The result: No one is optimistic about the chances of a 
last-minute settlement that would avert the punitive-damages phase of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the city could do now is say: 'We have on-duty officers and Chief Gates. 
We take responsibility for them,' " said Ira Salzman, Koon's attorney. "We're 
hopeful that the city will do that. They have not come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is slightly different when it comes to the bystander officers. 
The city represents those officers and former officers, and legal analysts 
noted that the city therefore has a responsibility to protect their interests. 
If those interests appear to demand a settlement, the city would be obliged to 
explore that option -- even if it meant that the city might have to shell out 
some money to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, the lead attorney representing King, said he spent Wednesday in 
his office but received no word from the city attorney's office about possible 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they do try to reach me, they are going to have to come with a check in 
hand," Grimes said. "I don't believe they really want to settle this case. When 
all the expenses are in, they are going to wish they had settled." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he acknowledged that the individual officers may not have much money, 
Grimes said he would press the case against them partly to demonstrate their 
personal responsibility for beating King. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individual officers should be held accountable so that officers will know 
that their individual wrongs will be paid for by them personally," Grimes said. 
"They can't hide behind the deep pockets of the city. That doesn't teach them a 
lesson. I don't care if they have to pay $5 every paycheck, they should pay." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent groundbreaking decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
diminishes the chances of the city stepping in to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 28, a unanimous panel of the 9th Circuit ruled that Los Angeles City 
Council members do not have "absolute immunity" from lawsuits when they vote to 
pay punitive damage awards for a police officer found liable for brutality. 
Council members and aides say the ruling makes it extremely unlikely that the 
city would agree to pay punitive damages in this case, should any be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 That ruling may effectively remove the city from the second phase of the civil 
case because no matter how large the jury awards may be, the City Council could 
simply refuse to pay. If that is the case, King's chances of recovering a large 
amount of money are greatly reduced because none of the officers from whom it 
would come are wealthy. This is particularly true of the four principal 
defendants, none of whom have worked since the March 3, 1991, incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd all like to end it," said Skip Miller, a private attorney hired by the 
city as co-counsel. "From an economic standpoint, I don't understand why the 
plaintiffs would want to go forward against police officers, who presumably 
have little or no net worth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salzman said Koon is almost destitute. "All of his assets together amount to 
about $5,000," Salzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives Koon little to bargain with and therefore little chance of settling 
the case without the city. And since the city has almost no incentive to push 
for a settlement because it is unlikely to agree to pay no matter what happens, 
both sides are preparing for a grueling second round in the civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the jury verdict in the first phase of the trial Tuesday, U.S. District 
Judge John G. Davies met with attorneys to outline how the second phase, 
assigning punitive damages, will be tried. Davies, who futilely attempted to 
limit the first part of the trial to five days, is seeking to streamline the 
second phase. He has given both sides about two weeks to present an estimated 
76 witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Salzman said he expects to present 17 witnesses in the trial's second phase, 
focusing largely on the training and tools provided to Los Angeles police 
officers. Koon always has maintained that the officers at the scene of the 1991 
beating in Lake View Terrace performed according to their training, and Salzman 
has argued that the incident never would have occurred if city leaders had not 
deprived the officers of certain controversial tools, such as the chokehold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Salzman's proposed witnesses are expected to testify about those 
issues, as they did during last year's criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael P. Stone, Powell's lawyer, is expected to call roughly 20 witnesses. 
King's attorneys plan to call 31 people to testify, and lawyers for the other 
officers also are expected to call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening arguments are to begin today in the second phase, with the same jury 
hearing witnesses.

MORE FAMILIES TO BE MOVED IN DDT CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced 
Wednesday that it is offering to move 18 more families to hotels while it 
removes DDT-tainted soil from two back yards near a Superfund site east of 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 That means up to 23 families may be relocated at federal expense during the 
two-week project, which is expected to start next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The news led to rejoicing up and down West 204th Street, where some residents 
had lobbied hard to be relocated temporarily, saying they fear being exposed to 
DDT during the excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be glad I'm out of the range of fire," said Carmen Herrera, 54, who is 
among the additional families to be relocated and whose house is directly 
across the street from the project. She said she worries that construction dust 
could contain DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 "See how the winds pick up? Let's say they're putting it on the trucks, and a 
strong wind comes up," Herrera said. "I'm happy to be going." 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials have repeatedly assured residents that the project poses no 
health threat, and EPA section chief John Blevins stressed Wednesday that the 
additional families are not being moved because they are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency instead is trying to rebuild confidence among residents, Blevins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to be overly protective, to work with the community and to provide 
them with some confidence that we will protect them," said Blevins, whose 
agency has met with sharp criticism from residents who claim EPA has not been 
attentive to their health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Lindsay, chief of the Superfund enforcement branch at EPA's western 
regional office, said in a press release Wednesday that the agency does not 
plan to take such extensive steps "in other potential removals in this 
community, but we will base any future actions on the experience gained in this 
pilot project." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the EPA had held firm to moving only the three families who live 
closest to the back yards where the soil would be removed. But last week, under 
pressure from residents, it boosted that number to five and postponed the 
project -- originally set to begin April 11 -- while it held a community 
meeting to hear neighborhood concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The new EPA relocation plan will include more families than requested by a 
community group, the Del Amo Action Committee. The expanded relocation area 
runs from addresses on the north side of West 204th Street from 1017 to 1063 
and from 1036 to 1058 on the south side. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA has also agreed to build a temporary fence and wind screen in response to 
community concerns about dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The project initially was expected to remove 8,000 cubic feet of soil from two 
back yards at a cost of $317,866. The exact cost of relocating the additional 
families was not available Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the excavation project began in March after soil tests in two 
back yards found unusually high levels of DDT, a banned pesticide and suspected 
carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood concern mounted April 8 when new EPA tests showed DDT levels 45 
times higher than the level considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Wednesday, the Del Amo Action Committee said it had 
ordered an independent test of back-yard soil and received results showing DDT 
levels twice as high as that found by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing was done by the Citizens Environmental Laboratory in Boston, which 
is a project of an environmental group called the Jobs and Environment 
Campaign, said laboratory director Fred Youngs. The lab is not state-certified 
but uses EPA-approved methods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Babich, a leader of the Del Amo Action Committee, said that she 
presented EPA's Blevins with the Boston lab results Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, it just confirms more so that there's DDT in the soil," said 
Blevins, adding that his agency will study any possible discrepancy between the 
two sets of results. EPA is investigating possible sources of the back-yard 
DDT, which some residents believe came from the former site of Montrose 
Chemical Corp., once a major manufacturer of DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 The two back yards where the DDT was found are about a half-mile from 
Montrose, a federal Superfund waste site. A second proposed Superfund site 
known as the Del Amo Study Area is directly north of West 204th Street.

MAYOR'S BUDGET TO AFFECT EVERYDAY LIFE IN THE VALLEY; GOVERNMENT: THE 
$4.3-BILLION PLAN WOULD FUND MORE POLICE AND IMPROVE STREETS BUT WOULD ADD NO 
ADDITIONAL STAFF AT NEW PARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid funding for more police officers and improved street maintenance, Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's first city budget provides dozens of small 
program cuts and staffing changes that would impact everyday life in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the $4.3-billion budget pays for new books and supplies for three 
new Valley libraries and adds staff to investigate drainage problems 
Valleywide. But it provides no additional staff for parks and recreation 
centers opening in Pacoima and Sylmar and calls for the closure of a city 
personnel office in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the reaction by Valley council members to Riordan's first budget 
was generally positive, with most agreeing that the mayor's proposal to 
increase police staffing fulfills his campaign promises to Valley voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Valley residents really put their trust in him and he has delivered on it," 
said Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents a northeast section of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents parts of the southeast Valley and 
chairs the council's finance committee, echoed Wachs' comments. "I think the 
mayor has fulfilled his campaign promises," he said. "He's done a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's spending plans received a lukewarm reaction from Councilman 
Richard Alarcon, who represents areas of the northeast Valley. Alarcon 
questioned whether the police academy can accommodate the 450 new police 
recruits the mayor plans to hire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor has painted an aggressive target for hiring police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, the mayor's budget adds the equivalent of 1,522 full-time police 
through a larger department budget, added overtime pay and a reorganization 
program that puts more officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget does not prescribe where the officers would be assigned, leaving 
that to Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams. An LAPD representative said 
the chief would not comment on deployment questions until the budget has been 
approved. But she added that police deployment is normally based on 26 factors, 
including crime statistics and the size of a community. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's budget also provides $1.5 million for books and material for three 
new Valley libraries but offers no added funding for staffing or furniture. The 
mayor's budget report says the Library Department must use existing staff or 
ask the City Council for added funding to staff the new libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The libraries to open in the next 12 months are the Mid-Valley Regional 
Library in North Hills, the Platt Branch Library in Woodland Hills and the 
Porter Ranch Branch Library in Porter Ranch. Construction costs were paid for 
by a $53.4-million voter-approved bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley motorists may also benefit from the mayor's proposal to double the 
miles of streets that are resurfaced annually and increase funding for street 
and bridge improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects funded that might otherwise have been postponed include upgrades to 
Chandler Boulevard from Van Nuys Boulevard to Woodman Avenue; Roscoe Boulevard 
from Laurel Canyon Boulevard to Ventura Canyon Avenue, and the Reseda Boulevard 
bridge over the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the budget did not provide the $1.3 million the Recreation and Parks 
Department requested to staff 18 parks and recreation centers, including the 
new Pacoima Senior Citizens Center, the Paxton Community Center in Pacoima and 
the Stetson Ranch Park equestrian center in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Klippel, chief financial officer for the department, said he is not sure 
how the facilities will be run without the requested staff funding. "We are 
down to a minimum" staffing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget also called for reducing city funding for six community arts 
centers, including the McGroarty Arts Center in Tujunga, the Lankershim Arts 
Center in North Hollywood and the Encino Photography Center. The mayor hopes 
private art groups will make up for the city's cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also proposed eliminating two clerk positions who assist in 
recruiting for the city's personnel department at Van Nuys City Hall. The move 
would close the personnel office.

IRS SEIZES RECORDS IN TAX FRAUD PROBE; INVESTIGATION: MISSION HILLS PREPARER IS 
SUSPECTED OF FILING FALSE DOCUMENTS FOR THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal agents seized thousands of documents from a Mission Hills tax preparer 
suspected of filing false deductions, adjustments and credits for clients, the 
Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the IRS is mailing completed, but unfiled, tax returns back to some 
clients for possible corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Robert C. Jimenez and two employees is expected to be 
arduous because the three helped file more than 12,900 returns in the past two 
years, said William Gilligan, branch chief of the IRS Criminal Investigations 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the thousands of tax returns, many were completed 1993 tax forms that 
Jimenez, 54, and his workers, Joe Garcia and Enoch Martinez, failed to get in 
the mail by the April 15 deadline for filing federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the documents are being photocopied as evidence and the clients, 
a number of them recent immigrants, are being contacted by IRS agents to 
determine how much tax information is false. 
</P>
<P>
 That will enable authorities to figure out charges to recommend to the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles, Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the volume of returns prepared by him and his associates, this is a 
very large practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other (tax fraud) cases, people have gone to the tax preparer based on a 
referral from their friends," he said. " 'John Doe, my tax preparer, can get 
you a big refund.' To them, the tax system is complex and they rely on the 
expertise of tax preparers." 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials suspect that Jimenez and his employees benefited financially 
from the alleged scheme by collecting tax preparation fees from a large number 
of clients. Most tax preparation offices, Gilligan said, only average several 
hundred returns a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For those people whose tax returns were not mailed on time because of 
Jimenez's office, IRS officials will ask the agency's service center in Fresno 
to adjust the penalties for late filing and allow extra time for clients to 
redo the returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients of Jimenez's office who have already received excessive refunds or 
failed to pay taxes will probably be forced to make up the difference and pay 
interest or penalty charges, Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud schemes by tax preparers are a nationwide problem for the IRS, he added. 
The Jimenez case is the second time this year that IRS agents in Los Angeles 
have seized records from a tax preparation office suspected of fraudulent 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents with a federal search warrant seized several file cabinets of potential 
evidence from the Richard C. Jimenez & Associates office at 11100 Sepulveda 
Blvd. during business hours April 15 -- timing that Gilligan called a "fluke." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez has not filed a tax return for himself in 15 years, despite the fact 
that he has been a tax preparer for at least 20 years, according to the 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez could not be reached for comment Wednesday and his office in the 
Windsor Center mini-mall was closed. A sign posted on the door said the office 
would reopen today. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez has been in trouble with the IRS before. The IRS conducted a criminal 
investigation against Jimenez for failing to file his 1972-75 personal tax 
returns. He was sentenced to four years probation and was required to file his 
taxes in a timely manner. In 1979, he pleaded guilty to two counts of preparing 
false tax returns for clients and one count of failing to file his own tax 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Jimenez's office began in 1993, when undercover agents 
posed as clients needing tax returns done, according to a 17-page search 
warrant affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, an agent who brought in a W-2 form showing an annual income 
of $18,559 and a tax withholding of $1,891 was told he would receive a $357 
refund. If calculated correctly, the agent should have paid an additional $10 
in taxes, or $1,901. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent received a completed tax return that listed expenses of $978 for 
church contributions and $2,701 for miscellaneous repayments -- items the agent 
knew nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials contend that Jimenez listed someone else's Social Security 
number, rather than his own, at the bottom of tax returns he prepared as a way 
of avoiding IRS scrutiny and hiding the unusually large number of clients he 
served. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilligan said he has not yet determined the amount of tax dollars lost in the 
alleged scheme. But Jimenez's office helped clients get a total of more than 
$7.9 million on 1991 tax returns and about $7.9 million on 1992 returns. 
</P>
<P>
 It will probably be awhile before Jimenez's clients see their tax refunds, 
Gilligan said, because the IRS is inundated with last-minute filings. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials are asking clients who need their tax records back and anyone 
with more information about the investigation to contact the agency's Glendale 
office at (818) 244-2511.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CHARGE 
REDUCED IN ALLEGED HARASSMENT OF GIRL ON PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused of harassing a young girl on a flight from Los Angeles to Las 
Vegas will face a reduced charge of annoying a minor, a prosecutor said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Edward Gustafson, 48, of Hermosa Beach, was arrested in Las Vegas on 
Feb. 27 after a 12-year-old girl complained that he touched her repeatedly on 
the flight despite her efforts to get him to stop.Gustafson was charged with 
open and gross lewdness with a child under 14, but that charge has been 
dropped, John Lukens, chief deputy district attorney for Clark County, Nevada, 
said Wednesday. Gustafson now faces a misdemeanor charge of annoying a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of interpretation," Lukens said Wednesday. "The conduct was 
inappropriate and offensive, but I'm not sure I could establish it as being 
lewdness at trial." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would have to prove Gustafson's intent was to arouse himself or the 
young girl to get a conviction on the lewdness charge. "There was no touching 
that was specifically sexual," Lukens said, but rather incidents like reaching 
across to raise or lower the window shade on the plane, and touching the top of 
the breast. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was returning from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on a Southwest Airlines 
flight when she reported the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents said Gustafson trapped the girl in an inside seat and touched her 
repeatedly throughout the flight. They said she called out, "Stop touching me," 
but that flight attendants and other passengers ignored her.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STUDENT 
ACCUSED IN RAPE WINS CHANCE TO GRADUATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ordered Pomona College Wednesday to allow a student accused of date 
rape to graduate and to postpone a disciplinary hearing based on claims his 
accuser made to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The student received a letter from the college in March ordering him to appear 
at a disciplinary hearing Friday that could threaten his chance of 
graduating.The hearing was prompted by a complaint from a student who claims 
the man raped her in his dormitory room in October, 1991. The accused student 
admits he had sex with the woman, but says she consented.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne ordered the college not to hold 
the hearing until after she hears more arguments on the legal representation 
issue on May 24. 
</P>
<P>
 She ruled that both students' names be kept secret and the accused student be 
allowed to graduate on schedule May 15.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TUTTLE 
SEEKS OUTSIDE PROBE OF CITY BUILDING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle on Wednesday called for an outside investigation 
of the city's program to construct and improve sewers, libraries, police 
stations, bridges and other city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city ordered a dramatic speedup in the spending of millions of 
dollars in voter-approved bonds. But Tuttle maintains that the construction 
program is in chaos and still has not produced accurate timetables for 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disorganization in the leadership of this program and the failure to have 
a meaningful schedule and resource plan raise serious concerns," Tuttle said in 
a letter to Mayor Richard Riordan.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PLAY TO BENEFIT YOUTH SHAKESPEARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local theater company will hold its first fund-raiser Tuesday to provide 
scholarships for a summer school program designed to make Shakespeare fun for 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old classic theater company called A Noise Within will present 
Shakespeare's "All's Well That Ends Well" Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at 234 S. Brand 
Blvd.Tickets are $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the play will benefit the company's Summer With Shakespeare 
program, now in its second year. The program is open to teen-agers in the Los 
Angeles area.  
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to make Shakespeare's comedies and tragedies -- 
replete with stories of love, jealousy and gang warfare -- relevant to today's 
teen-agers, said Julia Rodriguez Elliott, the company's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We demystify Shakespeare and when students actually start to see themselves 
reflected in the work, it becomes fun for them," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater directors hope to raise enough money to pay for at least half of the 
students who will attend the program -- scheduled to run from June 27 to Aug. 
14. Fees to attend are $650 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's program drew 16 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The program includes lessons in stage combat, speech, and improvisation. At 
the end of the session, students will present one of Shakespeare's comedies.  
</P>
<P>
 A Noise Within was formed to fill a void in today's entertainment industry -- 
as many actors trained in the classics have a hard time finding a company to 
perform in, Elliott said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; MAN RELIVES HIS GLORY DAYS OF 1950S AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sock hops and hot rods. Rumblers wearing leather and girls in tight sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Main never got over it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old building contractor comes home each night to a private museum 
of 1950s kitsch, where he can woo his "teen angel" to the croons of Elvis and 
Buddy Holly, and relive the glorious time when he was a high school wrestling 
star and self-proclaimed juvenile delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of the studs in high school because I grew up fast and I was 
tough," said Main, who still wears his hair in a modified pompadour. "I stole a 
lot of cars just to go on joy rides." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering Main's home on a West Hills cul-de-sac is like stepping into a '50s 
wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 One end of the family room was reconstructed from a bankrupt soda shop piece 
by piece, including the soda fountain, the spinning bar stools and copper trim. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to it, at a vintage diner table, Main and his wife, Vanessa, sip homemade 
malts as the jukebox cranks out such tunes as "Will You Still Love Me 
Tomorrow?" by the Shirelles or "Transfusion" by Nervous Norvus. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite the soda fountain is a couch made from the back end of a '57 Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where you can go about your business of necking," Main said, "without 
getting in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Three pinball machines (newer models because they're more fun), antique scales 
and cash registers, stuffed animals (Vanessa's) and posters from "Attack of the 
50-Foot Woman," "Dragstrip Girl," "King of the Rocket Men" and other movies 
line the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it kind of closes in on you," said Vanessa Main, 39. "But it makes 
him happy, so I get into it. And he calls me his 'teen angel.' That makes me 
feel great." 
</P>
<P>
 Main started collecting memorabilia about 10 years ago after divorcing the 
woman who had been his sweetheart from Mt. Whitney High School in Visalia and 
marrying Vanessa. 
</P>
<P>
 It was watching his own children and their generation grow up that Main says 
helped turn him back to the days of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a simpler time," Main said. "We liked girls and we liked cars. 
There were fights, but it wasn't like the violence now. All you have to do is 
watch the old movies to see. The kids today would have eaten us alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Main's latest endeavor is to publish a catalogue of obscure drag racing and 
science fiction videos, such as "Hot Rod Herman," "Eat My Dust" and the 
"Zombies of the Stratosphere" series, which he transfers from film himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the movies apparently is not enough, however. Each month, Main races 
his souped-up 1929 Ford roadster against other hot rods in the desert at El 
Mirage, a favorite drag-racing spot for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole group of us that goes out there," Main said. "Nothing has 
changed about it since the '50s, except that we're all a lot older." KURT

 Sally Barnes, a senior lead officer in the Devonshire Division, was named by 
state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 "Officer Barnes richly deserves this distinction," Wright said. "She has made 
many outstanding contributions to the community in her more than 25 years of 
service with the Los Angeles Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, 47, of Northridge, is part of a community-based policing effort in the 
San Fernando Valley that joins officers with residents and businesses to reduce 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes also established a Junior Watch program to give youngsters, ages 6 to 
17, a sense of direction and self-respect. The program also teaches children 
about the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Barnes said, "they run toward me instead of away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes began her career with the LAPD 25 years ago in the Downtown area. She 
moved to Northridge 15 years ago, where she now conducts her community-policing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationships forged by neighborhood groups proved essential in the 
aftermath of the Northridge earthquake that devastated so much of the 
community. The 85 block captains in Barnes' hard-hit area immediately began 
going door to door to check on neighbors and reported back to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright cited the earthquake response in her praise of Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful honor. It came at a nice time in my career. It's an 
incentive to do more," Barnes said. "There's still a lot to be done and we're 
so shorthanded here I don't see retirement in the near future for me. I feel 
there's still a need and I can still contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Hoffman has been chosen to receive the 1994 Chai-ay Olam Torah Fund 
Award by the Sisterhood of Adat Ari El. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always thinking about somebody else," said Shirley Moore, vice 
president in charge of the Torah fund. "If there's somebody in need, somebody 
in bereavement, somebody who's sick, she's always the first to go give a 
special hug." 
</P>
<P>
 In her role as co-chairwoman of the Noon Forum of the sisterhood's 
Multi-Interest Day Program, Hoffman finds speakers to talk to the 250 women who 
show up weekly for the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman of Valley Village is also co-chairwoman of the Art Council of 
Feingold's Gallery on the Milken Campus of the Jewish Federation Council of the 
San Fernando Valley. She is a member of the executive board of the women's 
division of the Jewish Federation Council and of the program committee of Adat 
Ari El.

<P>
 A local soccer organization has won praise for a program that serves 1,100 
children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 American Youth Soccer Organization Region 71, which serves Woodland Hills, 
Canoga Park and nearby communities, won two awards April 16 and 17 at an 
Anaheim convention of the Southern California American Youth Soccer 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer-run group won the National AYSO World Class Club Award for 
attracting new players and the Gold Certificate of Merit for its programs, 
including its emphasis on sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis in AYSO is not whether you win or lose, it's that you let all 
the kids play. And we do," said Commissioner Howard Greitzer.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; MEETING TO ADDRESS COFFEEHOUSE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about noise and parking that could be caused by the opening of a 
late-night coffeehouse in their neighborhood, Encino residents will meet today 
with representatives of City Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Dunn wonders if Encino residents are losing sleep over nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not even sure we're going to open in Encino yet," said Dunn, co-owner 
of the Insomnia cafes in Sherman Oaks and Los Angeles, who is also considering 
opening a third cafe in either Encino, Malibu, Woodland Hills, Calabasas or 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, however, do not want to be caught unprepared. Two groups, the 
Encino Property Owners Assn. and the Homeowners of Encino, will have Braude's 
representatives brief them on what can be built along Ventura Boulevard, where 
Dunn is considering the Encino location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible they could turn over a new leaf -- be angels and serve cupcakes 
and tea," said Gerald Silver, president of the Homeowners of Encino. "But if 
the past is any indication, we're headed for problems in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on complaints from the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., the Los Angeles 
City Council last year ordered the Insomnia Cafe to reduce its weekend hours. 
Instead of being open until 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, the cafe was 
forced to close at 1 a.m. Sunday's closing time was moved from 2 a.m. to 11 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Los Angeles city attorney's office charged the cafe's 
operators with keeping the establishment open past the ordered time.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said he is "working out" that charge with the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunn is more concerned with working out a location for the third Insomnia 
with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 He was disappointed that Braude's office would hold a neighborhood meeting 
discussing any aspect of the Insomnia Cafe's plans without inviting a 
representative of the coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Insomnia should at least have the opportunity to explain what's going 
on," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cindy Miscikowski, Braude's chief deputy, said the meeting was called at 
the request of the homeowners and property owners.  
</P>
<P>
 She said she never received a call from anyone associated with the Insomnia, 
nor did she feel a need to contact them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't taken a position," Miscikowski said of the possible Encino 
coffeehouse. "It's an information-gathering meeting." JEFF SCHNAUFER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; REPAIR OF 
QUAKE-DAMAGED COLISEUM PERISTYLE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A discussion on repair of the quake-damaged peristyle end of the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum was held Wednesday by representatives of the Coliseum, state 
historic preservation groups and officials of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. Demolition and reconstruction of some of the historic columns was one 
option examined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum's project director, Don C. Webb, said that under all three 
options for repair that are being considered, the central arch of the peristyle 
would remain. But side columns may be rebuilt, he said, and all parts of the 
peristyle structure will have to be reinforced or crowned with new material, at 
the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 No cost estimates have been made for this part of the Coliseum repair. Such 
work is apt to be unfinished in time for next fall's football season, Webb 
said, even while other parts of the stadium are opened to spectators. Other 
repair costs have been estimated at $34.7 million.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MUSLIM, 
ARAB NATIONS URGED TO PULL OUT OF U.N. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslim and Arab nations should pull out of the United Nations because it 
failed to stem Serbian aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the head of a Los 
Angeles-based Muslim group said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "The United Nations has only proven effective when taking measures against 
Muslims," said Maher Hathout, a spokesman for the Muslim Public Affairs 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the rallying cry Hathout used in a letter to Muslim and Arab 
ambassadors in the United States. "The U.N. is a wasteful -- with a very 
inflated budget -- organization that's proven that it is effective only to be 
used by major powers to punish the weak, not to maintain law and order in the 
world as it was supposed to be," he told reporters.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the New York-based organization could have taken the same kind of 
action it employed when Iraq tried to annex Kuwait, "if the will was there." 
The allied forces, he said, could have cut the flow of ammunition to the Serbs 
by interrupting their supply lines. And the United States, for its part, could 
have gotten the Muslim and Serb leaders together for peace talks.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RED CROSS CHAPTER IN L.A. OKS MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Red Cross Los Angeles chapter's board of directors Wednesday 
approved a merger with the group's Burbank chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger is expected to go into effect on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years of deficits led to a 15-5 vote two weeks ago by the Burbank 
chapter's board of directors to merge with Los Angeles. All that remains to 
finalize the merger is a vote by the Red Cross' National Board of Governors 
next month, which is expected to approve it. Talks on the merger began six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The current recession has cut the amount the Burbank chapter receives in 
donations from both the general public and the United Way. The chapter has also 
been strained by an influx of those who live in North Hollywood, Sun Valley and 
Sunland but come to Burbank to get help even though the Burbank chapter cannot 
solicit donations or recruit volunteers outside of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles chapter has promised to maintain services at their same level 
after the merger. Two Burbank representatives may be brought onto the board of 
directors, said Ann Sobel, associate manager for the Los Angeles chapter of the 
American Red Cross. ED BOND

BUILDING THE CITY ; A GUIDE TO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How a city develops is a complicated process that evolves over many years and 
is guided by many layers of local, state and federal regulations. Most land-use 
fights tend to focus on these regulations and how they are interpreted by 
landowners, local officials and citizen groups. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of most of these disputes, however, are fundamental differences 
in the way land is viewed. Some consider land a resource to be protected. 
Others say it is a commodity, like automobiles, toothpaste or pork bellies. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have considerable legal validity. 
</P>
<P>
 Land is protected by state and federal laws and can be regulated further by 
local rules, such as zoning. But even more deeply rooted is the notion that an 
individual can derive profit from a piece of property. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing those views is the realm of the political arena. It's no wonder then 
that disputes over a proposed golf course in Topanga Canyon, or whether a large 
office complex can be built near homes in Woodland Hills can drag on for years. 
PRINCIPLES OF PRIVATE PROPERTY  
</P>
<P>
 The notion of private property has three basic elements: 
</P>
<P>
 The right to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to exclude others from it. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to buy and sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 But these rights are not absolute. English Common Law established the idea 
that public nuisances can be restricted. And even before the Magna Carta in 
1215, the idea that the state could seize private land for public good was 
generally accepted. The Fifth and the 14th Amendments guarantee due process and 
just compensation if a person's land is seized by the government. PUBLIC GOALS 
VERSUS PRIVATE WANTS  
</P>
<P>
 The use of eminent domain by governments for everything from freeway 
overpasses to parks is well established. Other instances are less clear-cut, 
such as when a government agency creates regulations that restrict use of a 
property owner's land. 
</P>
<P>
 Such regulations might include zone changes that allow less development or 
halt it altogether. If those regulations deprive a land owner of all viable use 
of the property, it is considered a "regulatory taking" and is viewed the same 
as an eminent domain action. Deciding the "viable use" of the land, however, is 
subject to interpretation. UNEASY BALANCE  
</P>
<P>
 Two local cases -- Soka University and Warner Ridge -- demonstrate the 
difficult relationship between the rights of private property owners and 
responsibilities of public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Warner Ridge case, the city of Los Angeles changed the zoning on land 
proposed for an office complex in Woodland Hills so only single-family houses 
were allowed. The developer sued, claiming the action deprived him of 
economically viable use of the land. Several judges agreed and forced the city 
to change the zoning back. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Soka University case, public parks officials are trying to condemn the 
school's Calabasas campus to use it as a visitors center to the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. That case is pending in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. EVOLUTION OF LAND LAWS  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some landmark cases governing how property, from a giant office 
complex to a single-family home, can be used or protected: 
</P>
<P>
 Village of Euclid vs Ambler Realty Co.: In 1927, the Supreme Court upheld the 
constitutionality of zoning -- a new concept at the time -- rejecting a realty 
company's claim that the Ohio city of Euclid's zoning ordinance took property 
without due process. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn Central Transportation Co. vs New York City: In 1978, the Supreme Court 
legitimized historic preservation efforts. It rejected claims by the owners of 
New York's Grand Central Terminal -- who wanted to build an office tower over 
the historic station -- that the city's rejection of the project devalued their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Agins vs City of Tiburon: In 1979, the California Supreme Court ruled that 
landowners are not entitled to compensation from the government if a zoning or 
other law reduces the value of their property. Instead, it ruled, the property 
owner could sue only to have the restrictive ordinance overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 First English Evangelical Lutheran Church vs County of Los Angeles: In 1987, 
the Supreme Court essentially overturned the Agins case by ruling that property 
owners could indeed collect compensation from the government if their land is 
devalued through such "regulatory takings." The case involved a church camp in 
Tujunga Canyon that was not allowed to rebuild after a flood.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SCHOLARSHIP NAMED FOR ADAM BISCHOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Family and friends of Adam Bischoff, the 15-year-old boy who drowned in the 
rain-swollen Los Angeles River two years ago, have created a scholarship in his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers waited until this year to launch the $1,000 Adam Bischoff 
scholarship program for college-bound high school seniors because it coincides 
with the year that the teen-ager would have graduated from El Camino Real High 
School in Woodland Hills.At least one scholarship will be awarded annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Because soccer was a big part of Bischoff's life, the scholarship committee is 
accepting applications from students who have played soccer with the American 
Youth Soccer Organization for at least one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about him, you think about him playing soccer," said Don 
Winton, a member of the scholarship committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bischoff slipped while riding his bicycle along a flood control channel in 
Woodland Hills and was washed into the fast-flowing river during a severe 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarship applicants must write a one-page essay about soccer and their 
career goals, and have a grade point of 2.0 or better.  
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for applications is May 2. Interested students should call (818) 
544-6731. SUSAN BYRNES

IRS SEIZES TAX PREPARER'S RECORDS IN FRAUD PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal agents seized thousands of documents from a Mission Hills tax preparer 
suspected of filing false deductions, adjustments and credits for clients, the 
Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS is mailing completed, but unfiled, tax returns back to some clients 
for possible corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Robert C. Jimenez and two employees is expected to be a 
taxing one -- so to speak -- because the three helped file more than 12,900 
returns in the last two years, said William Gilligan, branch chief of the IRS 
Criminal Investigations Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the thousands of tax returns, many were completed 1993 tax forms that 
Jimenez, 54, and his workers failed to get in the mail by the April 15 deadline 
for filing federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the documents are being photocopied as evidence and the clients, 
a number of them recent immigrants, are being contacted by IRS agents in order 
to determine how much tax information is false. 
</P>
<P>
 That will enable authorities to figure out what kind of charges to recommend 
to the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the volume of returns prepared by him and his associates, this is a 
very large practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS officials suspect that Jimenez and his employees benefited financially 
from the alleged scheme by collecting tax preparation fees from such a large 
number of clients. Most tax preparation offices, Gilligan said, average several 
hundred returns a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients of Jimenez's office who have already received excessive refunds or 
failed to pay taxes will probably be forced to make up the difference and pay 
interest or penalty charges, Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud schemes by tax preparers are a nationwide problem for the IRS, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents carrying a federal search warrant seized several file cabinets full of 
potential evidence from the Richard C. Jimenez & Associates office during 
business hours April 15 -- timing that Gilligan called a "fluke." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez has not filed a tax return for himself in 15 years, despite the fact 
that he has been a tax preparer for at least 20 years, Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez could not be reached for comment Tuesday and his office was closed. 
The investigation of Jimenez's office began in 1993, when undercover agents 
posed as clients.

STUDY OFFERS HOPE OF KIDNEY DISEASE TREATMENT; MEDICINE: UCLA RESEARCHERS FIND 
THAT THE ANTI-CANCER DRUG TAXOL HALTS THE GROWTH OF DESTRUCTIVE CYSTS IN MICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH III, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA researchers report that they have opened the door to what may be the 
first effective treatment for a devastating inherited kidney disease that 
affects more than 500,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with mice with a naturally occurring form of the disease, called 
polycystic kidney disease, the researchers have shown that the anti-cancer drug 
taxol can halt the growth of the cysts that cause the destruction 
characteristic of the disease. Compared to untreated mice with the disorder 
that died four to five weeks after birth, those that received the drug lived 
several months before they were sacrificed for study, according to the report, 
which appears today in the British journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time that a medication has been given to an animal with 
polycystic kidney disease that stopped the disease in its tracks," said Dr. 
Jared Grantham, a nephrologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center and 
chairman of the Polycystic Kidney Research Foundation. "That's a very 
significant achievement, and I'm personally pretty excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians at UCLA hope to begin a multicenter clinical trial of the drug in 
humans within a year, according to UCLA molecular geneticist David Woo, head of 
the team that did the research. The path toward such a trial is a little 
smoother than usual, he added, because taxol is already approved for treatment 
of ovarian, breast and lung cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Bennett, a nephrologist at the Oregon Health Sciences University 
and chairman of the Polycystic Council of the National Kidney Foundation, 
cautioned that there are differences between the human and the mouse forms of 
the disease. Nonetheless, he said, "It is very encouraging that there is 
something that will do this (stop the disease)." Even if taxol proves not to be 
the best drug for humans, he said, "this will give us a lot of clues to help us 
find others." 
</P>
<P>
 Polycystic kidney disease occurs in approximately one out of every 800 people. 
Victims are born with thousands of microscopic cysts in their kidneys. These 
cysts accumulate fluid and grow in size over three to five decades, eventually 
destroying the kidney. In the last stages, patients require kidney dialysis to 
clean waste products from their blood and kidney transplants, at a yearly cost 
to Medicare of more than $750 million.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no known treatment that can halt progression of the disease. Most 
therapy is of a supportive nature that limits infections and includes dietary 
restrictions that minimize the accumulation of noxious byproducts.

 The mouse model used by Woo is actually like a more severe form of the 
disorder, called infantile recessive polycystic kidney disease. This form 
strikes only about one in 16,000 people, but is much more devastating because 
it progresses extremely rapidly, usually causing death before the age of 20. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Woo said, "there is no reason to believe that the pathogenesis of the 
slower form of the disease is any different from the more severe form," a view 
that is echoed by Grantham and Bennett.  
</P>
<P>
 German scientists have recently developed a rat model of the more common form 
of the disease. Woo did not work with it originally because studies with rats 
are substantially more expensive than those with mice, but he is planning new 
studies to determine whether taxol will work in this model as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxol was originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree and was 
initially in short supply because of the difficulties of obtaining enough bark 
to process. But drug companies have successfully devised techniques to isolate 
it from needles and branches of related shrubs, and currently there is no 
shortage of the drug.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 'F' GRADES REDUCE HIGH TRUANCY RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four San Fernando Valley high schools may have found an antidote to the 
disease of truancy that has plagued schools since their existence: an F. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary figures, attendance rates have improved markedly at 
four schools where policies allowing teachers to fail students who miss a fixed 
number of days in class were implemented last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't many consequences today that mean something to students," said 
Errol Jacobs, an English teacher at Taft High School in Woodland Hills, where 
20 absences mean an F. "This is an area where it really affects them." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to their own statistics from a year ago, Taft, Chatsworth and Van 
Nuys' Birmingham High School showed improvement in attendance rates after 
starting a policy that limits students to between 15 and 20 absences a semester 
before they fail a class. Figures for Kennedy High School in Granada Hills are 
trapped in an earthquake-ravaged building, but administrators say improvement 
was marked there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At Birmingham High School, at the end of the first semester of the 1992-1993 
school year, there were 360 students with more than 20 absences. At the end of 
the same semester this year, there were only 87 students who had more than 20 
absences. At Taft, the attendance rate in the first three months of the school 
year increased from 85% last year to 90% this year. At Chatsworth, attendance 
in the fifth month went from 80% to 89% after the policy was begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance rules like these are against the policies of most high schools, 
which are governed by a districtwide prohibition against directly linking 
grades to attendance.  
</P>
<P>
 But because the four schools are school-based management campuses, they have 
the flexibility to skirt district policy with a waiver.  
</P>
<P>
 At school-based management schools, decisions about operations such as budget 
and teaching methods are made by a leadership council composed of parents, 
teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence linking the improved attendance to the new policies. All 
of the schools are evaluating the program to fully gauge its effect. But many 
teachers and administrators believe the most meaningful measure of all is the 
increased student awareness about truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are worried," Taft junior John Pipkin said. "I know I have eight 
(absences). I'm scared. I wouldn't want to fail." SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; CITY COUNCIL OFFERS REWARD IN SLAYING

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council is offering a $25,000 reward for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons who killed a 
73-year-old Studio City man and wounded his wife in an attempted burglary in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Thompson was slain Jan. 26, beaten and shot after struggling with a 
burglar who entered his Aqua Vista Street home.His wife, Dorothy Thompson, 70, 
was shot in the chest during the incident but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an especially mean and vicious crime," Councilman John Ferraro said 
at a news conference Tuesday. "We're offering this reward in the hope that 
anyone who has any information will come forward to help us solve this 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Rodewald, a Ferraro aide, said the City Council approved the reward in 
March, but the councilman held a news conference Tuesday because investigators 
hoped a public appeal might generate more information to solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglar, armed with a handgun, entered the Thompson home shortly after 1 
a.m. and shot Dorothy Thompson once in the chest, police said. Her husband 
apparently fought with the burglar but was beaten severely in the head and shot 
in the upper body, police said. He crawled out his front door before dying on 
the lawn, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Canon Star 10 electronic typewriter was stolen from the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the case should call Detective Kevin Harley at the 
Police Department's North Hollywood Division, (818) 989-8831 (daytime), or 
(818) 989-8822 (evenings). HUGO MARTIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans will award a contract early next month to rebuild a quake-damaged 
freeway sound wall on the southbound side of the Golden State Freeway between 
California 170 and Van Nuys Boulevard in Arleta, according to a press advisory 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the estimated $1.2-million contract, concrete panels along the 
9,000-foot-long sound wall will be replaced with new panels and stronger 
reinforcement.State and federal funds are underwriting the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agency is scheduled to award the contract to a private construction 
company May 6. Construction will begin in six to eight weeks and take about two 
weeks to complete.  
</P>
<P>
 Within two years, the California Department of Transportation will award 
another contract to landscape the area around the sound wall. The wall, built 
in three sections, is 10 to 14 feet high and is made up of concrete panels. KAY

 The grand opening for a new community center in Sun Valley -- which would have 
been held today -- has been pushed back two weeks, said the president of the 
Sun Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing and schedule conflicts delayed the opening of the center, said chamber 
President Doriane Lee Parker.The new date for the event is May 5, and several 
city councilmen and elected officials will be on hand, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new community center at 8128 Sunland Blvd. will mean that Sun Valley 
groups will have a new meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce recently moved into the building from a location 
across the street. Next to the new offices is a community room that can be used 
for meetings, seminars, workshops and social events for up to 30 to 50 people.

 Preschoolers will be cycling and older children will be jumping rope to raise 
funds for their programs at the Verdugo Hills Family YMCA on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Fest is a first-time event which will combine fund-raising with a carnival 
and a Healthy Kids Day, in which the Los Angeles police and fire departments 
will give demonstrations on safety and drug and alcohol awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA is also celebrating the fifth anniversary of its facility at 6840 
Foothill Blvd. in Tujunga. The YMCA has been in the community since 1953, but 
operated from various locations. 
</P>
<P>
 A trike-a-thon, in its eighth year, will feature about 60 children riding 
tricycles to raise money from sponsors for equipment. The event usually raises 
about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Verdugo Hills Family YMCA runs the fund-raisers to help pay for child care 
when families cannot afford the service, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there will be a demonstration on bicycle safety and helmets 
offered by a local bicycle shop, a youth fitness challenge and pool safety 
tips. The LAPD will also offer fingerprinting for children's identification. 
</P>
<P>
 For its anniversary, the YMCA is offering tours of its facility, free one-week 
trial memberships and workout bags for those who get memberships that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Fest will run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ED BOND

MAN FACES CHARGES IN RAPES OF 3 GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old suspected gang member was scheduled to be arraigned today in the 
rapes of three 12-year-old girls in the Cerritos area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner Sampang, whose arrest culminated a three-month investigation by 
detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department juvenile 
investigations bureau, was being held Wednesday night at the Lakewood sheriff's 
station in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Benita Hinojos said Wednesday that Sampang, a reputed gang member, 
befriended the girls and then threatened them with retaliation by other members 
of his gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although Sampang was not armed during the rapes, he did use physical force 
with his victims," Hinojos said, adding that at least one of the children was 
raped at her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampang was arrested late Tuesday as he left a friend's house in Lakewood, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojos said the investigation began with "extremely little information," and 
that detectives arrested Sampang after detailed interviews with the victims and 
with confidential informants. 
</P>
<P>
 The three attacks, she said, occurred in the Bellflower, Cerritos and East 
Lakewood areas. The attacks date back to last summer, with the most recent 
occurring in February, she said. But authorities believe there may have been 
others, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe some victims, either because of their age or their fear of 
retaliation, may have been reluctant to come forward. Deputies are urging 
anyone with information to call (310) 946-8531.

PARTY PLANNED TO BUILD BRIDGE WITH NEIGHBORS; SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY: WORK CREWS 
TO THANK RESIDENTS FOR THEIR PATIENCE DURING THE PROJECT TO REPAIR TWO 
OVERPASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 They're planning a party for neighbors of the noisy, dirty Simi Valley Freeway 
reconstruction project in Granada Hills to thank residents for their patience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fete is scheduled for May 7 along San Fernando Mission Boulevard in 
Granada Hills, where two freeway overpasses that fell during the Jan. 17 quake 
are being rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the lanes of the Simi Valley Freeway have been patched and are open to 
traffic. Soon, however, Caltrans contractors will start tearing down the other 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, sponsored by Caltrans, Brutoco Construction and the Sierra Group, a 
public relations firm, is meant to thank residents for their patience in 
putting up with the round-the-clock dust and noise that will continue to 
disrupt their lives for several more months.  
</P>
<P>
 The laid-back atmosphere around the Granada Hills project offers a stark 
contrast to the public relations nightmare surrounding the rebuilding of the 
Santa Monica Freeway, Los Angeles City Council aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighborhoods near the Santa Monica Freeway, cynicism runs rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't hold your breath," resident Kitty Beaz said. "We haven't gotten 
anything we were promised." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaz and others feel burned by broken promises and are threatening to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the issue is a matter of the pocketbook. In the weeks after 
the freeways fell, Caltrans circulated letters to neighbors of both the Santa 
Monica and Simi Valley freeways, promising to pay $75 per night when the noise 
exceeded a certain level. Then, residents allege, Caltrans reneged. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaz cautioned her San Fernando Valley counterparts: Don't put on the party 
dresses yet, and don't count your chickens until they're barbecued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen a dime," Beaz said. "Caltrans decided we weren't getting any 
money and we weren't invited to the ceremony" when the freeway recently 
reopened. "And where's that barbecue they promised us?" 
</P>
<P>
 The $75-a-night offer was an issue in Granada Hills too, but after the squawk 
that erupted around the Santa Monica Freeway, officials quickly informed 
residents at a series of community meetings that proximity to the freeway 
construction didn't automatically entitle them to payment. The money was 
intended as a stipend to compensate residents who opted to stay in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened on the 10," said Greig Smith, an aide to City 
Councilman Hal Bernson. "They had a big public meeting with our constituents. 
There had been a lot of promises on the 10, and there were a lot of hurt 
feelings. Maybe they learned from their mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Caltrans spokesman said he didn't know the details and referred all calls to 
the contractors. Different construction companies were hired for the two bridge 
rebuilding projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills residents seem content to let the $75 question drop. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last meeting, "nobody had any gripes," said Fritz Yonkers, whose back 
yard abuts the Simi Valley Freeway construction project. "We were sitting there 
drinking punch and eating cookies and thanking everybody for what a good job 
they had done. Everybody seemed to be pretty cool. "They came around with a 
form, and I had to sign it. I didn't really read it," Yonkers said. "Some took 
it as a binding contract with Caltrans. I thought that was ridiculous. Some 
people read into it that regardless, they would automatically be getting $75 
per day." 
</P>
<P>
 Yonkers has been appeased by a temporary sound wall. He believes he won't be 
disturbed by construction on the other side of the freeway from his home on 
Jonfin Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main gripe is we want a permanent sound wall on the freeway, and we are 
getting one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Granada Hills contractor intends to keep his promise to hold a block 
party, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing ours, as you can see," said Rebecca Barrantes, a spokeswoman for 
the contractor. "We're serious about it. I want this to be a smiley face for 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Yonkers sees it: "They're gonna take the 75 bucks per person and buy 
hot dogs."

DRIVER MAY HAVE DIED OF HEART ATTACK BEFORE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 45-year-old motorist apparently suffered a heart attack and died moments 
before he lost control of his car and slammed head-on into another vehicle, Los 
Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the second vehicle was not seriously injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told officers that before the collision, they saw Roger Eubanks, 45, 
slumped over the steering wheel as his car traveled down Riverside Drive on 
Tuesday afternoon, said Officer Norman Nagengast of the LAPD's Valley Traffic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Eubanks of Ventura crossed into westbound traffic on Riverside Drive near Mary 
Ellen Avenue when he struck a vehicle driven by Stanley Neill of Pasadena, 
Nagengast said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy to determine the cause of death will be held this week, authorities 
said.

VICA MEMBERS ASSAIL HEALTH CARE PLAN'S KEY PROVISIONS; BRIEFINGS: GROUP OPPOSES 
PURCHASING COOPERATIVES AND MANDATES ON EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concluding their annual visit here, members of the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn. expressed intense opposition Wednesday to major provisions of 
the Clinton Administration's health care reform plan at a meeting with one of 
the proposal's architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Two VICA members -- one a physician, the other an insurance representative -- 
voiced their objections to Walter Zelman, a senior Clinton aide on health care 
and former California deputy insurance commissioner, who touted the 
Administration's controversial initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction became so vehement that Zelman at one point pleaded: "Let's try to 
keep the dialogue civil." 
</P>
<P>
 VICA, which has 350 member companies representing about 150,000 employees 
throughout the San Fernando Valley area, has endorsed incremental health 
insurance reforms rather than the sweeping overhaul proposed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Keith Richman, chairman of VICA's health care task force, said the group 
opposes those parts of Clinton's plan that call for the formation of mandatory 
alliances, or purchasing cooperatives, and mandates on employers to provide 
health insurance for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the group supports steps to guarantee that those who change jobs 
or have pre-existing conditions can still obtain insurance. It backs the 
creation of strictly voluntary purchasing cooperatives and tort reforms to 
limit lawyers' contingency fees. And it would provide subsidies to low-income 
people who are unable to afford insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Richman urged Zelman to "do something sensible and reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Zelman responded that VICA's proposal will "not solve the large problem of the 
people who are uninsured. We also think the problem is cost. We don't see any 
great capacity in this system to generate savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Frazee, a Woodland Hills representative for Connecticut Mutual Life, 
later said he was frustrated with the session. "I felt it was a lecture selling 
the plan rather than an exchange of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with Zelman in the ornate Indian Treat Room of the old Executive 
Office Building next to the White House was the culmination of three whirlwind 
days of briefings with Administration officials, lawmakers and lobbyists for 
the 38-member VICA delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The group hoped its visit would have a payoff next week. Working through John 
Emerson, an assistant to the President and former Los Angeles chief deputy city 
attorney, they discussed the prospect that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
will present a $9.1-million loan from the Small Business Administration to a

AROUND THE VALLEY / JOSH MEYER: RESEDA MAN IS WAGING SECESSION CAMPAIGN TO 
'SAVE CALIFORNIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's no secret that many proud residents of the San Fernando Valley want to 
secede from the rest of Los Angeles, what with all the slights they've endured 
from their neighbors to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there is the movement to split the state in half, so Southern 
California can be a government unto itself (and still one of the biggest in the 
nation). 
</P>
<P>
 But Reseda resident Robert L. Bell, 32, has a different idea. He wants the 
entire state of California to secede from the rest of the country, and he's 
mounting an effort to do just that. He fancies himself a modern-day equivalent 
of our founding fathers, that rag-tag bunch that fought off an invading army 
and declared this land a nation unto itself more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's weapon of choice this time around isn't muskets and cannon fire; he 
doesn't even expect a war -- at least one with weapons. He prefers the ballot 
to the bullet, and he's gathering signatures for what he calls the "California 
Independence Initiative," to establish the Golden State as an independent 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real joke," one state official was quoted as saying recently about 
Bell and his quest, "but the guy's dead serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can, and must, save California," Bell exhorts in his two-page "Citizens 
for California's Independence" manifesto. He has been mailing the flyer 
describing his ballot quest to everyone he can in recent weeks -- including 
more than 250 newspapers, radio and TV stations up and down the state -- and 
has done countless interviews and appeared on as many talk shows as will let 
him. When he's not working as a driver for a Van Nuys office supply company, 
that is. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, while taking a breather from the driving business, Bell said he 
is working 10 hours a day for the company and that he can only campaign at 
nights and on weekends. He has virtually no funds, and says he has sent a 
letter to Ross Perot asking for $5 million in support to mount a grass-roots 
campaign to get the 615,958 signatures he needs by Aug. 5 to get the measure on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four weeks he has been pushing the measure, Bell says, he has collected 
several thousand signatures, but has not counted them yet. Although the 
proposal is mighty short on details, Bell says he has garnered support in 
communities from Eureka south to San Diego, where volunteers are spreading the 
word and gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, Bell's is a campaign waged on a shoestring. Married, with no 
children, he remains convinced he is behind an idea whose time has truly come. 
</P>
<P>
 "California's population has grown too large, and its needs are too complex to 
continue being governed by a President and a Congress 3,000 miles away," his 
petition flyer says. " . . . The only way to save California is to remove the 
ties that are binding it to the very causes of its economic and cultural 
decline." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Bell wants to exempt California from the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, and wants to sharply limit immigration in the state. He also 
wants to rescind a policy that allows the children of undocumented workers who 
are born in the United States to automatically become citizens and reap all the 
benefits that come with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell says he got the idea for the initiative after the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was passed. He said passage of NAFTA was the last 
straw in what he perceives to be an effort to usurp California's mighty 
economic power for the good of citizens of other states and the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell also says that if California were to secede, its residents would not have 
to pay an estimated $128 billion in federal income taxes, but that the money 
can be put back into the new nation's coffers for programs to help the state 
and its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ballot measure, California law would become the supreme law of the 
land, and the governor would become president, with both houses of the 
Legislature taking the place of Congress. But all federal employees -- 
including the state's congressmen and two senators -- would be sent packing and 
looking for work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell says the U.S. Constitution does nothing to prevent states from seceding 
if they want to establish their independence. Those states that sought 
independence during the Civil War went over the line into illegal and 
unconstitutional activity, he says, when they decided to form a confederacy, 
which drew opposition from the powers that be and resulted in one of the 
nation's bloodiest struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any other proposal to lower taxes, Bell's proposal is sure to gain some 
support. "I am totally confident," he says, "that if I got the initiative into 
the hands of every California registered voter that it would qualify for the 
ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell may want to work on his politics, however. He says he's a registered 
Independent, and even planned to vote for Perot in last year's presidential 
election until the Texas billionaire dropped his campaign and later jumped back 
into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't vote for Perot," he says. "When he came back, I thought he was just 
too unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 That being the case, maybe Bell should ask someone else for the $5 million, or 
learn from the old political adage that if you don't have something good to say 
about somebody, don't say anything, or make something up.

MAN SHOT BY POLICE PROBABLY FEARED ANOTHER ARREST, FATHER SAYS; CRIME: TERRY 
PARKER, 23, HAD BEEN OUT OF JAIL THREE MONTHS ON HIS THIRD DRUNK-DRIVING 
CONVICTION. AUTHORITIES SAY HE TRIED TO RUN OFFICER DOWN. 
</P>

<P>
 A judge had revoked Terry Parker's driver's license and the 23-year-old had 
been out of jail just three months after his third drunk-driving conviction. 
Still, his father had to hide the keys to the family truck so his son couldn't 
drink and drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, Parker found the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he led Los Angeles police on a chase that ended only after he was shot 
twice and wounded when he allegedly tried to run over an officer with his 
truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker was arrested and taken to Holy Cross Medical Center with bullet wounds 
in the chest and left leg, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said the wounds were not life-threatening. The hospital would not 
comment on Parker's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 When Parker recovers, he will be booked on suspicion of assaulting a police 
officer with a deadly weapon, as well as an earlier cocaine possession charge, 
police spokesman Arthur Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, James Parker, the suspect's father, said his son was probably 
fleeing police to avoid another arrest. His son had recently served 70 days in 
County Jail for the most recent of his three drunk-driving convictions, Parker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was drunk, there was no doubt about it," said the elder Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said his son has been drinking since the age of 8. "He doesn't drink 
much of the hard stuff, but he sure can pound beer," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Parker said he does not believe his son tried to run over the police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 9 p.m. Tuesday when officers tried to stop Parker for 
an alleged traffic violation near Lassen Street and Haskell Avenue, Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parker suddenly sped away and the officers chased the pickup truck he was 
driving for about a mile, to the Rinaldi Street on-ramp of the southbound San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Parker abruptly stopped, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Officers Carl Oschmann and Michael Clark, both 27, who had heard 
about the chase on their police radio, stopped their police car in front of 
Parker's vehicle. Holmes said Oschmann got out of the passenger's seat and 
started walking toward the truck and then Parker drove forward, hitting the 
police car's open passenger door. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Parker began to back the truck in the direction of another officer. 
Oschmann, who feared for the safety of his colleague, fired twice from his 
9-millimeter service revolver and hit Parker both times, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said Parker was "apparently unaffected by the rounds," and continued 
driving. He led officers on another pursuit, this time for several blocks to 
the Harvest Street home he shares with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He drove up over the curb to the door and said, 'I'm shot, Dad,' the elder 
Parker said Wednesday. "I said, 'What do you mean you're shot?' Then I noticed 
the glass in the window was broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, nine police cars and a helicopter surrounded the house and his 
son was arrested, James Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Parker, 59, who won custody of Terry after he divorced in 1974, said 
his son has been drinking on and off since the boy's grandmother died in 1978. 
Terry Parker dropped out of Kennedy High School and has been employed only 
sporadically as a laborer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman Lt. John Dunkin said Wednesday that Terry Parker also had 
been wanted on a $35,000 felony warrant for possessing cocaine, which may have 
caused him to try to elude police. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said police are also investigating whether the younger Parker had been 
involved in a similar chase with California Highway Patrol officers in the past 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Oschmann, a 5 1/2-year veteran, has been assigned to desk duty pending an 
investigation into the shooting and psychological counseling, a standard 
practice of the Police Department, Dunkin said.

COUNCIL OKS 3RD OFFICE FOR ALARCON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved a request Wednesday by Councilman 
Richard Alarcon to open a third office in his east San Fernando Valley 
district, making him the only council member with more than two district 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said the office at 81228 Sunland Blvd., Sun Valley, will be in a 
building he will share with the Sun Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Los 
Angeles Police Department.It will be open by next month. 
</P>
<P>
 He defended his proposal for a third office, saying his district is elongated 
and lacks representation in the southeast end of the district. Alarcon operates 
district offices in Sylmar and Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said the costs of running an additional office will not force him to 
exceed his office budget because he shares leasing costs for his Sylmar office 
with Councilman Hal Bernson and shares costs for his Pacoima office with 
Pacoima Enterprise Zone officials.

VANDALS DEFACE MURAL AT SCHOOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mural at a Northridge elementary school that pictured youths of various 
races and ethnic groups has been defaced by vandals who marred it with racial 
and religious epithets, Los Angeles police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism at Castlebay Lane Elementary School, 190120 Castlebay Lane, 
apparently occurred Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, police 
said.School officials said the graffiti markings were erased before most 
students saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take this problem very seriously," Principal Natalie Messenger said. "I 
have the sense that it might have been older kids because it was relatively 
high up on the walls and all the words were spelled correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Messenger said teachers at the school, where the student enrollment is about 
one-half Anglo and one-third Asian American, will discuss the graffiti with 
students today. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE SEEKS OK FOR PALMDALE 
CAMPUS; EDUCATION: A STATE BOARD'S APPROVAL OF THE 100-ACRE DONATED SITE COULD 
PUT THE PROJECT ON FIVE-YEAR TIMETABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Antelope Valley College administrators will ask a state panel next month to 
approve a 100-acre site for a new Palmdale campus that could accommodate 10,000 
students and give the city a huge economic boost. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Board of Governors for the California Community Colleges approves the 
site, the proposed Palmdale campus will clear the first of several key 
governmental hurdles and be on track to open within five years, Antelope Valley 
College President Allan Kurki said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurki told members of the Palmdale Chamber of Commerce that his college's 
existing campus in Lancaster will be filled within 10 years when its enrollment 
doubles to about 20,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have another campus ready to go before we reach that capacity," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide that second campus, Laguna Beach businessman David P. Bushnell, 
founder of the binocular company that bears his name, has offered to donate a 
100-acre site at the southwest corner of 47th Street East and Barrel Springs 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In an important early review, the state's community college governing board -- 
meeting May 12 in Sacramento -- will consider whether this site is suitable, 
Kurki said. If it approves, the site would be subject to endorsement in 
September by a second panel, the California Postsecondary Education Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 If these approvals are obtained, Antelope Valley College officials would be 
able to ask the state next year for about $5 million to prepare the site with 
roads, sewers and other infrastructure. If the state provides still more money, 
the first buildings -- with room for about 3,000 students -- could be open 
within five years, Kurki predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2010, when additional buildings are finished, the enrollment should reach 
10,000, he said. By that time, the Palmdale campus will be pumping about $33 
million annually into the local economy, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kurki cautioned that the new college cannot be built unless the city of 
Palmdale approves a larger development plan proposed by Bushnell. 
</P>
<P>
 The college is one part of a 540-acre project that would also include an 
undetermined number of new houses, a golf course, a park and a small commercial 
center, said Sharon McCaughey, a Palmdale planning staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Wednesday that the Bushnell project, including the proposed college 
campus, will not be considered by the Palmdale Planning Commission, and later 
the City Council, until the developer provides additional documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurki acknowledged that the donation of land for the college is a bargaining 
chip in Bushnell's negotiations with the city. "They didn't give us 100 acres 
with no strings attached," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DUMP FOES TO MEET TONIGHT WITH OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents worried about the effect of a major earthquake on a 
proposed dump in Elsmere Canyon are expected to meet with federal and county 
officials tonight to voice their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft environmental impact report is being prepared on the Elsmere project, 
which would place a 190-million-ton dump just outside Santa Clarita, southeast 
of the intersection of San Fernando Road and the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled from 7 to 10 p.m. at the Ranch House Inn, 27413 N. 
Tourney Road. It is sponsored by the Los Angeles County Regional Planning 
Department and will include a representative of the U. S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will review the comments made and if they cover something new that should 
be covered, it will be included (in the environmental documents)," said Richard 
Frazier, a county regional planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without an earthquake, opponents say the dump would threaten the area's 
ground water, harm air quality, disrupt surrounding wildlife and bring unwanted 
trash trucks into the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the rare opportunities where you get to have input into a 
health and safety issue that affects a lot of people," said Pat Saletore, 
chairwoman of the Sierra Club's Santa Clarita chapter. "It's the first kind of 
public input we've had since the scoping hearings four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-dump activists have been more vocal about their environmental concerns in 
the wake of the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake that rocked the Santa 
Clarita Valley. Dump foes say a large temblor could rupture a landfill's 
protective liner. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to know why in the world they're siting a dump here when they 
know the damage an earthquake is going to do," said Marsha McLean, president of 
the Santa Clarita Valley Canyons Preservation Committee, which opposes the 
landfill.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY ENDS BID FOR SANTA CLARITA WATER CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials here won't be getting into the water business. 
</P>
<P>
 By a unanimous 5-0 vote, City Council members halted efforts to buy the Santa 
Clarita Water Co. on Tuesday, opening the way for the company to be bought by a 
wholesale water supplier in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials had argued that buying the water company would give the 
city more control over growth and development. The Santa Clarita Water Co. 
serves about 20,000 of the city's 50,000 water connections. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Castaic Lake Water Agency signaled that it too is 
interested in buying the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Pederson said he voted against the idea because he strongly 
opposed the city running a water company. 
</P>
<P>
 'We have so much to do, I can't for the life of me figure out what we're doing 
thinking about this," Pederson said. "I object to this. I object to spending 
any money on consultants (for this). I object to spending money on stamps (for 
this)." 
</P>
<P>
 Others hope backing away from the water company bid will prompt the Castaic 
Lake Water Agency to drop a lawsuit filed last month against Santa Clarita's 
$1.1-billion redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit said the post-earthquake Community Recovery Plan, which sets out 
ways to improve infrastructure, redevelop blighted areas and build affordable 
housing, actually reduces the water agency's property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does that make the lawsuit go away?" asked Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who 
accused the water agency of using intimidation tactics with the legal action. 
"That's what we all want, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Lake Water Agency officials expressed pleasure at the council's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they said the lawsuit is unrelated to the competition to buy the 
water retailer, CLWA board President Mary Spring acknowledged the city's 
decision will improve the relationship between Santa Clarita and the water 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agency has tried to keep that (lawsuit) as a totally separate issue," 
Spring said. "Certainly, it takes away a lot of the controversy that has been 
raised for weeks."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTONOVICH PRAISED AND PRESSED BY CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council recognized Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich for his efforts after the Northridge earthquake, then pressed him 
during a Wednesday meeting on issues ranging from future funding for local 
libraries to the possible closure of the Castaic animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Caravalho began the city's annual breakfast event with the 
county supervisor, held this year at a Valencia hotel, by thanking Antonovich 
and the sheriff's and fire departments for working closely with the city after 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without that kind of support and assistance, it would have been very 
difficult for us to do our jobs," Caravalho said. "We operated as one unit." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich thanked the council and said he is continuing to seek state and 
federal legislation to aid owners of businesses that have been dealt a severe 
economic blow as a result of The Old Road detour, which in some cases has cut 
off access to businesses. Traffic was diverted from the Golden State Freeway to 
The Old Road after the collapse of freeways in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them are facing bankruptcy," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor then addressed the issue of funding for local libraries, which 
he described as "critical" after a shift in property tax revenues to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich proposed seeking library funds for the 1994-95 fiscal year by 
searching for a way to tap into state school funds. He also encouraged 
cooperation between private companies and county and city governments to ensure 
the survival of Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Operating hours at Newhall and Canyon Country libraries have been cut back to 
three days a week. Meanwhile, the Valencia library is closed because of 
earthquake damage and for asbestos removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern raised at the meeting is the possible closure of the 
county-run animal shelter in Castaic, which serves the entire Santa Clarita 
Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Sam Azhderian, president of the Castaic Town Council, urged Antonovich and the 
City Council to fight to keep the shelter open, noting that the two closest 
facilities are in Lancaster and Agoura Hills. 
</P>

 City Councilwoman Joanne Darcy, who also is Antonovich's field deputy for 
Santa Clarita, said that after the Northridge quake the shelter placed 300 
animals with new owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy warned Antonovich that should the shelter close, the supervisor and the 
county would face "an avalanche of opposition you never thought possible."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ELECTIONS / SANTA CLARITA CITY COUNCIL; 
KLAJIK'S MANAGER REQUESTS A RECOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The campaign manager for defeated council candidate Jill Klajic on Wednesday 
requested a recount of election results that had Klajic losing by a mere 16 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip Newhall said he asked for a second vote count because Klajic's supporters 
"would always wonder 'what if?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic, 47, conceded that the recount may turn out to be "an act of futility." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact time of the recount has not been determined, but it must be held 
within seven days of the request, said Santa Clarita City Clerk Donna Grindey. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever requests a recount is charged for the staff time and supplies used, 
making a hand count much more expensive than simply running ballots through the 
computer, as is done on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 A recount of the 10,426 ballots is projected to take four hours and cost $500 
if done via computer, or take five days and cost about $6,840 if counted by 
hand, Grindey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall said he'd rather have the recount done by hand, but the cost is 
prohibitive. About $350 to $400 in donations have been pledged by contributors 
to help cover the expense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first recount in the history of Santa Clarita, which became a city 
in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Clyde Smyth, who at last count had edged Klajic by 3,804 votes to 3,788, 
was sworn in Tuesday night along with returning incumbents Jo Anne Darcy and 
Carl Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth, 62, said he isn't against a recount. He retired from the William S. 
Hart Union High School District in 1992 after more than 16 years as 
superintendent.

700 SCIENCE ENTRIES VIE FOR TOP HONORS; EDUCATION: PROJECTS RANGING FROM 
COOLING THE HEAT OF CHILI PEPPERS TO FAMILY PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES COMPETE FOR 
AWARDS IN VENTURA COUNTY CONTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nicholas Guzman's idea for his science project began as a burning sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was eating chile peppers," the 17-year-old Fillmore High School 
student said, "it got too hot." 
</P>
<P>
 After he grabbed the nearest drink he could find to cool his mouth, Nicholas 
began to wonder which beverages work best to provide relief to people who like 
their food hot. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting science project, titled "Red Hot Chile Peppers," is one of 700 
entries in the 1994 Ventura County Science Fair being held this week at the 
County Fairgrounds in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the sixth through eighth grades from private and public schools 
throughout the county entered projects in categories ranging from psychology to 
chemistry to math. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wednesday, 80 local scientists, teachers and other professionals spent 
hours evaluating the entries and interviewing students to select the fair's 
winners, who will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to looking for originality among the science projects, judges said 
they also rate projects according to how well students frame the question they 
are trying to answer and what experimental techniques they follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly we look for how well the scientific method is applied," said judge 
Raquel Izumi, a research associate at Amgen in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nicholas' project on chile peppers, he conducted taste tests on 20 family 
members, friends and acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
 After blindfolding each of his subjects, Nicholas fed them a type of hot chile 
pepper called chile de arbole and, after each pepper, had the subjects drink 
sodas, juice, milk and other liquids. The subjects told Nicholas how well each 
drink worked on cooling their burning mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experiment's results were clear: The best beverage to drink after 
chomping on a hot pepper is milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nicholas' project, many entries at this year's science fair attempted to 
find solutions to real-life problems. And some judges said one of their main 
criteria was for projects to have practical value. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging students to focus on science projects with a practical application 
helps prepare them for the world of work, judge Danny Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're actually working, you have to have some real-life application or 
you're not going to get paid," said Clark, an electronics engineer at the Port 
Hueneme Naval Surface Warfare Center. "You can't just divide numbers for the 
fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of a project with practical value, some judges cited a 
psychology experiment -- titled "Are Personalities Hereditary?" -- by Thousand 
Oaks student Rachel Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
 A sophomore at private La Reina High School, Rachel said she got the idea for 
her project after an argument with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just been in a fight with my mother and I wanted to know why we couldn't 
get along," the 15-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that she and her mother fought because they are different, Rachel 
tested this hunch by taking a psychological personality test she had at her 
home and then giving the test to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 To her surprise, they both had the same personality types. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Rachel began to wonder whether personality was hereditary. So she gave 
the same psychological test to the parents and children in 26 families -- half 
of whom had adopted children. 
</P>
<P>
 Her results showed that biological children nearly always have personalities 
similar to one of their parents, while adopted children only rarely have 
temperaments like their mothers and fathers.

BAD WEATHER FORCES EDWARDS LANDING OF SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR; NASA: THE SPACE PLANE 
ENDS A PRODUCTIVE 11-DAY MISSION BY SCRAPPING A PLANNED TOUCH-DOWN AT KENNEDY 
SPACE CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After bad weather in Florida twice prevented a hoped-for landing at the 
Kennedy Space Center, the space shuttle Endeavour returned to Earth here 
Wednesday, ending an 11-day mission that garnered reams of data on changes in 
the Earth's environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The radar lab has provided an unprecedented view of our planet," a mission 
control announcer at the Johnson Space Center in Texas told the six astronauts 
aboard Endeavour as it came to a stop on concrete Runway 22. "Welcome home." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, enough data was recorded during the journey, dubbed "Mission to Planet 
Earth," to fill 20,000 encyclopedia volumes. About 12% of the Earth's surface, 
more than 70 million square kilometers of land and sea, was mapped during the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth-observing instruments met scientists' "highest expectations, 
collecting unique imagery of important environmental sites around the globe," 
according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour touched down with its payload of sensitive radar equipment and six 
astronauts a few minutes before 10 a.m. in what a NASA announcer described as 
"virtually pristine" weather conditions at Edwards Air Force Base on the edge 
of the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture-perfect landing under a cloudless sky left Endeavour with what 
appears to be heavier than normal wear on its nose gear tires, something that 
will need further evaluation, NASA spokesman Don Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California landing, the first since the shuttle Columbia landed here Nov. 
1, means that Endeavour will have to be ferried back to Florida atop a modified 
747, adding more than $1 million to the cost of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it was an unscheduled landing, few others besides those who work at 
Edwards Air Force Base were on hand to watch Endeavour's return. Only a few 
people were at NASA's hillside viewing site, a VIP area that is usually packed 
during a scheduled shuttle landing. There are no scheduled shuttle landings at 
Edwards in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Endeavour mission was planned for nine days, but early into the flight was 
increased by a day "because of abundant supplies," according to NASA. The first 
landing attempt in Florida on Tuesday was canceled because of cloud cover and 
poor runway visibility. Poor weather there Wednesday morning forced the 
California landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour, which has now completed six missions, is expected to be returned to 
the Kennedy Space Center on Monday morning, Haley said. The orbiter's next 
flight is scheduled for August. It will carry the same radar equipment as on 
the just completed mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the April 9 launch, the radar equipment in the shuttle's 
payload bay was activated and continued to collect data without interruption 
throughout the mission, NASA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Data was gathered from points around the world, ranging from Mammoth Mountain 
in California to the forests of the Amazon in Brazil to the Kamchatka Peninsula 
in Russia, as the shuttle orbited the Earth every 89 minutes, traveling more 
than 4.7 million miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In orbit about 135 nautical miles above the Earth's surface, the radar 
equipment was able to penetrate the dry sand cover of the Sahara Desert to 
reveal drainage patterns hundreds of years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Data on the amount and distribution of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere was 
collected to aid in determining "how well the atmosphere can clean itself of 
'greenhouse gases,' chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature," 
according to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar instruments were also used to observe flooding in Missouri and 
Germany, as well as the San Andreas fault. Astronauts supplemented the vast 
radar data by taking more than 14,000 still photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the flight, mission specialist Jay Apt used amateur radio equipment to 
have an in-space chat with Russian cosmonauts aboard the MIR space station. Apt 
also used the equipment to talk with two American astronauts and a pair of 
cosmonauts who were at the Star City training center near Moscow.

THE TIMES POLL; ENTHUSIASM FOR CLINTON'S HEALTH REFORM IS WANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As critical decisions approach on President Clinton's top domestic priorities, 
Americans are cooling on his agenda for health care reform, enthusiastic about 
elements of his emerging welfare reform proposal and divided over how best to 
fight crime, a Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unmistakable sign of waning enthusiasm for health care reform, 
two-thirds of those polled said that they would not be angry if Congress cannot 
pass a comprehensive plan this year. By contrast, those surveyed said they want 
Congress and the President to put top priority on anti-crime legislation. But 
they were divided along ideological, partisan and racial lines over whether the 
best way to fight crime is tougher punishment or more programs of prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Those polled placed less priority on reforming welfare, but showed 
overwhelming agreement that work requirements and measures to discourage 
out-of-wedlock births should be central elements of any reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On another issue, even as Clinton called Wednesday for wider airstrikes to 
deter Bosnian Serb attacks in Bosnia, the poll showed growing public acceptance 
for such measures. In the survey, which was completed before Clinton's remarks, 
46% said that they support U.S. airstrikes as part of an overall NATO effort to 
"repel Serbian and Bosnian Serb forces . . . besieging the Muslim population of 
Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 In the poll, Clinton's overall political standing remains tentative, with his 
job approval essentially unchanged at 54% since January and the percentage of 
people who believe there was "wrongdoing" in the Whitewater controversy rising 
to 30% -- more than double the figure earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But half of those surveyed still said that they don't know enough about the 
Whitewater matter to render a judgment, and nearly two-thirds said the 
President and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, are cooperating sufficiently 
with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the poll finds little evidence of the voter backlash Republicans 
predicted when the tax hikes were approved last summer. The survey, which began 
just one day after the tax-filing deadline of April 15, found that one-third of 
Americans believed their taxes went up this year, but only about one-third of 
that group blamed Clinton for the hike. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Treasury Department estimates that about 1.2% of all taxpayers 
saw an income tax increase this year, 3.2% if higher Social Security taxes are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, supervised by John Brennan, interviewed 1,682 adults from 
April 16 through April 19; it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 
three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the poll shows Clinton receiving positive, but lukewarm, grades for 
his performance. Of those polled, 54% approve of Clinton's overall job 
performance and 39% disapprove, a showing virtually identical to figures in 
December and January. Approval and disapproval of his handling of the economy 
was 47% to 41% -- also virtually unchanged from January. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps reflecting uneasiness over the turmoil in Bosnia, however, Clinton's 
approval rating on foreign affairs has dropped. In January, 51% of Americans 
approved of his management of foreign affairs; but in the new survey, only 43% 
approve -- with 46% giving him failing grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Still on almost all major issues, from welfare reform to crime to health care 
and the economy, a plurality of those surveyed believe Clinton would do a 
better job than congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, it may have been a victory of sorts merely to avoid a drop in his 
approval rating since the last survey: He has held his ground despite growing 
concern over the Whitewater land deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the last poll in January, the percentage of Americans who believe the 
Clintons engaged in "serious" wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter rose from 7% 
to 17%, with the percentage that perceived any wrongdoing jumping from 13% to 
30%. Twenty-eight percent said Whitewater had made them look less favorably on 
Clinton (only 6% said it had made them more favorable); 32% said the 
controversy had diminished their assessment of Hillary Clinton, while only 4% 
said they now thought better of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorable rating has slipped to 44% positive and 34% negative, down 
noticeably from 56%-25% in January; the decline has been sharper among women 
than men. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, only one in four of those interviewed said the investigation into 
Whitewater hasn't gone far enough, with 37% calling the inquiry adequate, and 
one-third saying it has gone too far. Three in five said Clinton has the 
honesty they expect in a President, essentially unchanged since January. And 
when asked whether Clinton or Republicans in Congress exhibited higher 
standards of integrity, those polled picked Clinton, 42% to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new poll, Americans expressed more optimism about the economy than at 
any point since 1991, with fully 44% saying the recession is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the increasing economic optimism, respondents were notably more 
pessimistic about the country's overall direction, an unusual disjunction in 
attitudes. In the survey, 64% said the country was off on the wrong track, the 
highest figure since last June. Just 28% said the country is moving in the 
right direction, a marked drop from the nearly 40% who expressed satisfaction 
in polls last winter and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfaction with the country's direction tends to be particularly strong 
among those least satisfied with Congress and Washington. As if tracking a 
storm surging toward land, the poll maps what appears to be a gathering 
hurricane of discontent about conditions in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one of every 10 Americans say Washington is making a great deal or a lot 
of progress toward "solving the major problems facing this country." And 10% of 
those polled also expressed a lot of confidence in Congress. Fifteen percent 
said government can be trusted most of the time "to do what is right." These 
numbers rank among the lowest in Times polls over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 These imposing measures of dissatisfaction with government are proving a 
significant hurdle for Clinton's health care reform proposal, which is moving 
toward mark-up in congressional committees over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Several individual elements of Clinton's proposal remain popular, with almost 
two-thirds of those surveyed agreeing that universal coverage should be a 
component of any health care bill. But support for his overall plan continues 
to slip, and the public appears leery of giving government too large a role in 
managing the health care system, as critics maintain Clinton's blueprint would 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the most extreme choice, just 21% of those polled say government should 
run the system "without private insurance companies," while more than 70% say 
they want to keep private firms involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are ambivalent about imposing price controls on health insurance 
premiums and medical services to keep down costs. Asked if they would prefer 
price controls "even if that means limiting health services for the average 
person," or would prefer prices set by the free market "even if that means 
higher costs for the average person," those polled split 42% for government, 
44% for the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans overwhelmingly support raising taxes on cigarettes to help pay for 
the health care plan. But the poll found substantial concern about another 
proposed funding source: a government mandate on employers to provide health 
insurance for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if they would support an employer mandate to fund "universal health 
coverage for all Americans even if that might cost jobs," just one in six 
Americans backed the idea; another 40% said they would prefer a broad-based tax 
to pay for universal coverage. One-third of those surveyed said they would 
prefer to postpone universal coverage rather than accept either of those 
funding options. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the survey's clearest messages is slackening enthusiasm for the 
entire enterprise of health care reform. Overall approval of Clinton's reform 
plan continues to slip: Americans now back it by a 43%-34% margin, down 
slightly from January and more substantially from December. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two percent of those surveyed say they will be angry if Congress fails 
to pass health reform this year; by contrast, 67% say they would not be angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as strikingly, only about one in five said they expected any reform to 
improve their own health care coverage, while an equal number said it would 
worsen their care, and about half said it would mean no change in their own 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers are essentially unchanged since June -- three months before 
Clinton introduced his plan -- despite millions of dollars poured into 
television advertising by the plan's proponents and opponents, dozens of 
appearances by the President and First Lady to plump up their plan and the 
counterstrikes from Republican critics. 
</P>
<P>
 For legislators looking for guidance on what to do next, the poll offers 
mostly a picture of confusion: Just 5% say Congress should pass Clinton's plan 
with no changes, 39% with minor changes and 14% with major changes. Another 15% 
say Congress should pass another plan, 10% say it should pass no plan and 16% 
say they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Americans most often cite crime, rather than the economy or 
health care, as the nation's most pressing problem, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Senate approved sweeping anti-crime legislation centered on 
toughening sentences, building more prisons and helping cities hire 100,000 
additional police officers. This week, the House is completing action on a 
competing crime bill that places relatively more emphasis on providing job 
training, drug treatment, educational services and other programs aimed at 
preventing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 By a thin 47%-44% margin, those surveyed would rather emphasize prevention 
than punishment. But that narrow divide masked wide divisions. Clear majorities 
of Democrats, Clinton voters, Latinos and blacks preferred prevention; but 
Perot voters, Republicans, the affluent and whites leaned toward punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most Americans seem willing to try ideas from all sides of the spectrum. 
When asked which proposals they believed would be most effective in reducing 
crime, those surveyed put at the top of the list two ideas favored by right and 
left: mandatory life imprisonment for three-time convicted felons and more 
money for youth recreation and job training programs. A proposal to add 100,000 
police officers nationwide, perhaps Clinton's top priority in the bill, drew 
relatively less enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than on crime, the poll found striking consensus for a broad range 
of welfare reform ideas that the Administration is considering. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement begins with overwhelming rejection of the existing system: 
fully eight in 10 of those polled say welfare encourages people to stay 
dependent, while just 11% say it offers poor people a second chance. Two-thirds 
of those polled say poor young women frequently have babies so that they can 
collect welfare checks. On both of those measures, blacks are as likely as 
whites to accept the negative characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Consensus also marks the public's ranking of the goals for welfare reform: 
almost three-fourths say the top priority should be to move welfare recipients 
into the work force, compared with 17% who cite reducing illegitimate births 
and 6% who want to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the means of mandating work attracts consensus: fully 69% of those 
surveyed support Clinton's idea of requiring welfare recipients to work after 
two years on the rolls, and providing public employment for those who cannot 
find private sector jobs -- even when told that such a plan could cost as much 
as $50 billion over the next 10 years, as the Administration has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly two-thirds of those polled support at least one of two other proposals 
that the Administration is considering to discourage out-of-wedlock births: 
requiring young women who receive welfare to live with their parents or another 
responsible adult, and denying additional benefits to women who have more 
children while already on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the widespread agreement on work programs, that proposal to 
deny benefits could become a racially tinged flashpoint. Over two-thirds of 
whites, and a majority of Latinos support it, but blacks narrowly reject the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial divisions also interlace reactions to a proposal to pay for welfare 
reform by denying social welfare benefits to legal immigrants who are not yet 
citizens: whites like the idea, but majorities of blacks and Latinos reject it.

 HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,682 adults nationwide, by telephone, from April 
16 through 19. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in 
the nation. Random-digit techniques were used so that listed and non-listed 
numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. 
Results were weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, 
age, and occupation. Selected questions were asked to a half sample of 
approximately 840 respondents. The margin of sampling error on the full sample 
is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for half-sampled questions it is 4 
points. For certain sub-groups the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll 
results can also be affected by other factors such as question wording and the 
order in which questions are presented.UNITED STATES

HOUSE MOVES ON; HISTORIC COTTAGE DUE FOR DEMOLITION GETS NEW LOT IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 A historic cottage that has rested alongside Ortega Highway for 110 years was 
moved about 100 feet Wednesday, out of the path of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sagging blue-gray home, known as the Hankey/Rouse house, is on the city's 
list of historic landmarks but was slated for demolition until a local 
contractor stepped forward last year with an offer to buy an adjacent parcel of 
land and move the house there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's history," said contractor Michael Palmer as he pointed to the 
steep-roofed Victorian cottage, with dormer windows and a wraparound porch with 
ornate woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to preserve our history for our children and our children's 
children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Palmer supervised the crew of workers who lifted and then shifted the 
wooden structure to its new resting place -- where it will soon be remodeled 
and sold -- about two dozen Hankey family members and friends looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that somebody had the love to (remodel) it," said Thomas Forster, 
president of the San Juan Historical Society and a longtime friend of the 
Hankeys. "Somebody will end up with a real treasure here." 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly called the "Rose Cottage," because of the lush rose bushes that 
surrounded the dwelling, the house was built by the Rouse family in 1883 in the 
center of a walnut ranch, according to a history provided by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1909, a French priest came to San Juan Capistrano, bringing a group of 20 
or so French immigrants with him, and bought the house. The colony built some 
additional cottages, grew walnuts and olives and raised ostriches and Belgian 
draft horses, the city history notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1921, Carl and Adele Hankey bought the home and 21 acres of land and began 
to plant orange trees on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the five Hankey children, ranging in age from 61 to 73, were 
among those who watched the house being moved to a lot on a corner of Ortega 
Highway and Via Cristal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorna Hankey Ross, 63, a retired schoolteacher and current citrus rancher, 
gazed at the home and recalled growing up there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a marvelous mom and dad who didn't have a lot of money, but we never 
knew it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their house had no central heating system, only a wood stove. "But I never 
woke up to a cold house," Ross said, explaining that her father always rose by 
5 a.m. to stoke the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having five children and only two bedrooms and an unfinished attic in 
the house, the elder Hankeys also raised a young cousin and often took in young 
people who needed a place to stay while they looked for a job or finished high 
school, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, 55 foreign exchange students also lived there. They came from 
local schools like Chapman College (now Chapman University) mostly on weekends, 
as a way to get away from the distractions of campus life, said Hankey sibling 
Eleanor Widolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Hankey, a prominent rancher, citrus grower and school board member, later 
traveled the world with this wife, visiting the people he had once hosted, she 
said. He was instrumental in urging county supervisors to construct Ortega 
Highway and has a Mission Viejo elementary school named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Hankey children vacated the deteriorating home and last 
July sought permission from the city to demolish it so they could subdivide 
their one-acre parcel into four lots, city planner Mary Raskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Cultural Heritage Commission initially denied the request because 
of the historic value of the house. But the Hankeys appealed and in August the 
City Council agreed to let the family demolish the home. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Palmer stepped in and stopped the wrecking ball by purchasing part of 
the land from the Hankeys, and moving the house there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with that house," Palmer said. "It's something that just needs 
to be done."

ANOTHER TOP OFFICIAL RESIGNS HER UCI POST; EDUCATION: KATHLEEN T. JONES, IN 
CHARGE OF UNIVERSITY ADVANCEMENT, FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS OF M. ANNE SPENCE. NO 
WOMEN VICE CHANCELLORS ARE LEFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kathleen T. Jones, the first woman to be appointed a vice chancellor at UC 
Irvine, announced Wednesday that she is resigning, becoming the second 
top-level administrator in a week to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 52, in charge of university advancement, said she will leave UCI July 1 
to become vice president of alumni and university relations at Georgetown 
University in Washington. Jones has worked at UCI since 1968, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's meant a great deal to UCI," Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening said in an 
interview. "She built her career here. She has roots deep in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Vice Chancellor of Academic Programs M. Anne Spence told officials 
she would leave her post to return to her research as a human geneticist at 
UCI's College of Medicine. Jones' resignation added another name to a growing 
list of administrators who have recently left UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' new job at Georgetown will be on the same executive level as her 
position at UCI. Jones is responsible for communications and fund-raising 
efforts, UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said. Fund-raising increased 12% 
since she took office in 1991, Young added. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the position at Georgetown is "a step up" because Georgetown is a 
private university with substantial endowments, a long tradition and strong 
opportunities to run fund-raising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 She will become one of Georgetown's 11 executive officers, called "the 
Cabinet," Georgetown spokeswoman Sandra Hvidsten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her resignation means there will be no female vice chancellors left at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "That for me is a very sad note," Wilkening said. "I have now lost my two 
women vice chancellors, and I strongly believe in having a diversity of 
backgrounds and experiences in administration so we get varied perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said committees searching for replacement vice chancellors will look 
for "the best person" but will also take diversity into account. 
</P>
<P>
 James Asp, associate vice chancellor under Jones, will become acting vice 
chancellor of university advancement in her place, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials were quick to point out that the resignations of Spence 
and Jones were unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, in a way, it's an unfortunate coincidence," Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones added that she did not seek out the Georgetown job; Georgetown President 
Leo J. O'Donovan called her about the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said that in Spence's case, Spence decided "maybe she'd be better 
off doing something she enjoyed -- genetics research," instead of handling a 
sometimes uncomfortable job as an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget-cutting proposals made in two recent university task force reports 
suggested that Spence's position should be abolished, as well as two other vice 
chancellor posts. The prospect of that was one factor in her decision to return 
full time to the College of Medicine, UCI officials said. They announced 
Tuesday that the position of vice chancellor of academic programs will be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the task forces also recommended that responsibilities handled by Jones 
be combined with those of the vice chancellor for research. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said that the job of university advancement is too important to 
eliminate. Decisions on whether to combine the two positions will not be made 
until June. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the two posts require different skills: heading research requires 
knowledge of federal regulations governing research projects, for example, and 
heading advancement means meeting and recruiting people from the community to 
help sponsor UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, no, they shouldn't be combined," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent administrative flight has created open slots in top management that 
may stay vacant until decisions on budget cuts are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a little lag time . . . and it'll give an opportunity to Laurel 
(Wilkening) to set up a team that works well together," said UC Regent Meredith 
Khachigian. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening and others downplayed the loss of administrators, terming it "a time 
of change" and an opportunity to look at streamlining UCI and making it more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who was born in San Francisco and grew up in Southern California, 
called the move East "a cultural adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I have lived in California all our lives," said Jones, a 
Laguna Beach resident. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Stanford University, Jones became director of public relations 
at UCI in 1981 and worked her way up to become an assistant vice chancellor in 
1984 and an associate vice chancellor in 1987. She has also served as a trustee 
of the Laguna Beach Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian said Jones will be sorely missed at UCI. "Being somewhat laid-back 
yet totally professional is a winning combination for her position," she said.

STATE TESTS TARDY AT MANY SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: LATE DELIVERY OF THE 
CONTROVERSIAL STANDARD EXAMS THROWS SOME DISTRICT'S SCHEDULES INTO TURMOIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delay in delivery of exam materials has forced hundreds of schools throughout 
the state to postpone the second round of California's controversial 
standardized tests, resulting in scheduling conflicts and administrative 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Southern California school districts that were supposed to give the 
California Learning Assessment System tests during the past few weeks have been 
forced to put plans on hold because materials did not arrive in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Most have since received their packages -- a week or more later than expected 
and, in some cases, rushed via air freight -- but some were still waiting 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, it's thrown our whole testing schedule into chaos," complained 
Peter J. Boothroyd, assistant superintendent of Brea Olinda Unified, one of at 
least seven Orange County districts affected by the delays. "How we're going to 
undo that mess will be determined by what day they arrive. If the tests arrive 
tomorrow we'll be OK, but we don't know. . . . We're just sitting on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are unsure how extensive the delivery problem is. 
Minnesota-based Questar Data Systems Inc., the company hired to package and 
deliver the tests for the state, is currently preparing a report detailing how 
widespread the delays were and how much extra it will cost, state Department of 
Education spokeswoman Susie Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange attributed the delay to "just a series of problems . . . with moving 
millions of sheets of paper" and said Questar was not entirely responsible for 
the delay. Despite the problems, she said, all eligible students will be able 
to take the tests this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its second year, CLAS will test well over 1 million fourth-, fifth-, 
eighth- and 10th-graders at a cost of $26 million. Several private companies in 
California and out of state handle parts of the processing under state 
contract, and testing dates are staggered based on school schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Though in most cases tests have only been delayed about a week, the situation 
has launched further criticism of CLAS, which in recent weeks has been attacked 
because of problems in scoring last year's tests and by conservative groups 
outraged over its content. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most schools, it's just an inconvenience," Lange said of the delays. "I'm 
not minimizing that, but there were no costs incurred for them. It's just a 
matter of rescheduling." 
</P>
<P>
 But local school officials are worried that CLAS will now conflict with other 
standardized tests planned for later in the spring or long-ago scheduled events 
such as field trips, open houses or staff development days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put out to schools in August the testing calendar for the coming year and 
they try to schedule other things around that," Los Angeles Unified testing 
coordinator Linda B. Lownes said. "Now this piles a lot of tests on top of each 
other and schools will be trying to give the CLAS tests at times they have . . 
. other things planned." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators also said they are frustrated that arrangements they made for 
CLAS testing are now for naught, and that there is less time to sort through 
the material and train teachers to give the new segments of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 And while principals typically warn students, teachers and parents of testing 
days to encourage attendance, a good night's sleep and a healthy breakfast, 
some administrators said they now will be forced to spring the tests on 
children with no notice. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles Unified, the state's largest district, hundreds of schools were 
scheduled to administer the tests this month, Lownes said. Calling the 
situation "very, very disruptive," she said the district has postponed CLAS 
three times and now plans to give CLAS between May 4 and June 3 -- the same 
period previously set aside for the California Test of Basic Skills, which is 
given to all students. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's largest district, Santa Ana Unified, got its materials on time 
and is in the midst of testing. But other local districts that had some delays 
include Anaheim Elementary as well as Brea-Olinda, Capistrano, Los Alamitos, 
Orange, Placentia-Yorba Linda and Tustin unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim's testing coordinator Rebecca Welsh echoed Lownes' annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a master calendar. We're required by law to do this (give CLAS 
tests). When we aren't given the materials, it's very frustrating," Welsh said. 
"That's the thing, we can't solve our own problems. We have no control over it, 
that's the frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the delays have been short -- a few days to a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of panicked for a while until we settled down and realized it 
wasn't a big problem, it was something we could deal with," Placentia-Yorba 
Linda testing technician Mary Farrell said. "The feeling around here is, what 
are you going to do? It's just one of those things. We have to accommodate." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state's plan, each school district was to give the tests 
between its 135th and 155th day of instruction, with some starting in March and 
others testing through the first weeks of June, but most scheduled for April 
and May. Schools planning to test next week or afterward should not have any 
delays, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questar was supposed to collate and deliver the exam packages on a rolling 
schedule that matched each school's calendar and testing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The disruptions began last month. Administrators who were awaiting arrival of 
the tests instead received a series of memos from Questar announcing the 
delays. None explained the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Education apologizes for the inconvenience this will cause 
you and the schools in your district," Questar CLAS Coordinator Ruta Engstrom 
wrote in memos March 28 and April 13. "We are doing everything possible to 
assure that your materials will be delivered as soon as possible without 
jeopardizing the accuracy of the complex packaging process." 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS will test students in reading, writing, math, science and history and 
measure performance against tough statewide standards. The performance-based 
assessments are designed to evaluate students' thought processes as well as 
their ability to derive correct answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the 1993 tests released in March painted a grim portrait of 
California students, with one-third demonstrating little or no understanding of 
basic math concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery delays, administrators said, are just the latest CLAS-related 
hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be too hard on the state, because this is the first time 
we're doing something like this and there are always glitches and bugs, but it 
has become so typical, it's demoralizing," Capistrano Unified Supt. James A. 
Fleming said. "It's just a continued indication of the poor planning that has 
taken place."

POIGNANT GOODBY TO A 'VERY SPECIAL LADY'; FUNERAL: 250 MOURNERS ACCOMPANY 
EVELYNE MARIE LOBO VILLEGAS' CASKET IN A TRADITIONAL JUANENO PROCESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the clanging of the old mission bells Wednesday, more than 250 mourners 
accompanied the casket of Evelyne Marie Lobo Villegas -- a Juaneno who was 
crowned the city's matriarch -- during a funeral procession to the Old Mission 
Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 In a poignant service rich with tradition, Msgr. Paul Martin eulogized the 
beloved Villegas, who died last Friday at age 69, as a "very, very special 
lady." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighborhood, Little Hollywood, lost another legend," said pallbearer 
Dennis Sommer, 49. "In fact, San Juan lost another legend." 
</P>
<P>
 Sommer joined five others selected as pallbearers for the symbolic procession. 
All grew up in Little Hollywood, one of the city's oldest sections, and shared 
kind remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked over to her house the other day and it wasn't the same," said 
pallbearer Joseph Lopez, 35. "She wasn't at the kitchen window. She was always 
at the kitchen window, checking to see who was coming. If she wasn't at that 
window, you weren't at the right house." 
</P>
<P>
 The descendant of a family that lived here before the arrival of the Spaniards 
in 1769, Villegas was one of eight children born to John Edward and Esperanza 
Lobo. Her brother was Clarence Lobo, chief of the Juaneno Band of Mission 
Indians who died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-mile procession on foot to the cemetery Wednesday follows a tradition 
for descendants of Juanenos, Native Americans who helped build the Mission San 
Juan Capistrano for Spanish missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I see here is tradition," said David Belardes, Juaneno Band chairman. 
"It's something we've done for more than 200 years. Some 3,000 to 4,000 
Juanenos were buried right here all around the east side of the mission. But in 
the 1860s, they started burying them east of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas, Belardes recalled, was a warm and spirited woman who retired after 
helping found the Head Start program, which provides meals, instruction and 
health services to poor children. She later became the first non-credentialed 
teacher in the Capistrano Unified School District, where she taught for 23 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas told friends it was through her teaching that she learned to speak in 
public and stand up for what she believed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, she said in a newspaper interview: "I am not afraid to talk. When you 
speak the truth, why should you be afraid?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though initially a reluctant candidate for the title of community matriarch, 
Villegas later took to her role and made the city's children a priority as she 
explained the Juaneno heritage, Belardes said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the cemetery, Martin presided over a brief graveside ceremony that featured 
several Juaneno children. Accompanied by a drum, clapping sticks and rattles, 
the children sang Native American songs as a tribute to Villegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ceremony was wonderful," said Villegas' daughter, Valerie Villegas 
Cordes, 37. "She said she wanted the children to send her off and they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Nunez, 11; Nathan Banda, 10, and Pearson Nunez, 7 -- all 
fifth-generation Juanenos -- used the drum to mark a cadence symbolic of the 
heartbeat during the procession. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came to my school and talked about us being Indians," said Nathan Banda, 
a fourth-grader at San Juan Elementary School. "She made me proud because she 
told class, 'Nathan is my nephew.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to Native American lore, although the body dies, her spirit lives on 
with the help of "Grandfather God." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent photograph of Villegas displayed at the funeral depicts her carrying 
a white sage, which is used by Juanenos during spiritual cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the side of the photograph were two hawk feathers, which served as 
spiritual helpers, and tiny abalone shells symbolizing the Juanenos' coastal 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas family members said they were saddened at her death, but glad that 
she had lived to see the state officially recognize the Juaneno Band, make an 
appearance in the city's Swallows Day Parade, and also attend last October's 
groundbreaking ceremony for the Clarence Lobo Elementary School, named after 
her brother, in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos formally applied for federally recognized tribal status in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession to the cemetery Wednesday was mostly symbolic. Villegas, who 
had suffered a stroke, will be cremated and her ashes interred at a brief 11 
a.m. ceremony today at the cemetery.

 The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a $2.5-million gymnasium to 
be built at Hurless Barton Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23,000-square-foot gym, which will be the second in the city, is planned 
for the south side of the park next to Yorba Linda Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to reach a joint-use agreement with Placentia-Yorba Linda 
Unified School District that would give the school use of the facility during 
school hours on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult and youth sports teams and other city-sponsored recreational activities 
would have priority after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the school district would be responsible for about 30% of the cost 
of maintaining the facility, which is expected to be about $120,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym has been a project of Councilman John M. Gullixson since he took 
office in 1990. Gullixson, who is active in a youth basketball league, has 
frequently complained about the lack of indoor facilities for basketball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 He often refers to the disparity between the city's 58,000 residents having 
one gym at Travis Ranch Activity Center, and Placentia's 40,000 residents 
having five gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Travis Ranch is a tremendous facility, but it gets a lot of use," Gullixson 
said.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 More than 5,000 people are expected at a march here Saturday to raise money 
for the March of Dimes. The nonprofit organization raises about a third of its 
national budget at the yearly marches, which will be held in more than 1,400 
communities, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County organizers hope to raise more than $425,000 to prevent birth 
defects. The event is titled "Walk for Healthier Babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised will be used for research, community service advocacy and health 
education. The March of Dimes is now working to reduce infant mortality and low 
birth weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers will meet at the Magnolia Street entrance to Huntington State Beach 
on Pacific Coast Highway and follow an eight-mile, oceanfront route. To 
participate, call (714) 631-8700. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; BOYS, GIRLS TO WATCH SEX VIDEOS SEPARATELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boys and girls in sixth and seventh grades in Tustin Unified School District 
will no longer watch sex education videos together, after complaints from 
parents who said the practice is inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 School district trustees adopted the same-sex viewing policy after Monday's 
town hall meeting in which some parents demanded that they see the videos first 
before they are shown to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent, Mike McClay, suggested that the videos not be shown at all until a 
panel of parents could determine if the materials are appropriate for 12- and 
13-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district began showing the videos that contain information on AIDS, 
HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases to sixth- and seventh-grade 
students this year as part of the health curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Lynch, the assistant superintendent for instructional services, said 
that the videos are shown during science classes, which both boys and girls 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynch said that boys and girls do not discuss the contents of the videos 
together. Under the new plan approved Monday, boys and girls will watch and 
discuss the videos separately. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 parents attended the town hall meeting and several expressed outrage 
at the showing of the videos, which they said used slang language to describe 
sexual situations and body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the videos, particularly the one featuring former basketball star 
Earvin (Magic) Johnson, do not stress abstinence strongly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think Magic is a good role model," said Bart Hansen, a parent. "His 
advice of safe sex gives kids a false sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
 In the video called "Magic Johnson: A Conversation With Magic," the former 
Lakers star says that postponing sex until marriage is the best attitude. But 
he urges those who are having sex to use a condom. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also objected to the video "Who Am I Now?," which is intended for 
sixth-graders, and "Kids to Kids," which is shown to seventh-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contain slang terminology," said Sandy Kenny, who prohibited his son, a 
seventh-grader at A.G. Currie Middle School, from watching "Kids to Kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Two videos, produced by a company that manufactures sanitary napkins, also 
contain scenes on how to use sanitary napkins, which are embarrassing to girls, 
Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynch said that the videos, which are also used in other school districts, 
were approved last year by the school board after a review by a panel of 
teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said students can watch the videos only after getting a written consent 
from their parents. Last year, the videos were made available to the public for 
comment, but no one opposed them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we provided the opportunities before," Lynch said. "But we respect 
(parents') viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. David Andrews said that changes in the way the videos are 
presented are being made in the interest of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll continue to assess what we are doing," Andrews said. "We have to listen 
to what the community is saying." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; MAN IS ARRESTED IN IMMIGRANTS' DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested a 23-year-old man Wednesday in connection with last month's 
fatal shooting of two men who had recently immigrated from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Williams of Anaheim was arrested on suspicion of murder and is being 
held in the city's temporary detention facility, police said.Williams is 
suspected of killing Julio Bautista, 26, and Benjamin Ibarra, 25, who are 
cousins, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still unclear as to the motive," said Lt. Vince Howard. "We're still 
investigating to determine why it happened." Howard said that Williams and the 
victims were not neighbors and police did not know if Williams knew the two 
victims before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's bodies were found March 19 in a battered car in the 2200 block of 
Katella Avenue. One was in the front seat, the other in the back seat of the 
car, which was parked in front of a condominium complex. A relative who 
discovered the bodies frantically waved down traffic to get assistance for the 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 One man did stop and tried to administer emergency aid, but he said it was 
obvious both were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista and Ibarra were recent immigrants from the state of Michoacan, 
relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Bautista, who identified himself as Julio Bautista's uncle, described 
his nephew as "a very nice kid" who liked to hang around with his friends at a 
garage fixing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police credited Garden Grove police and the California Department of 
Corrections' special service unit for assistance in the arrest.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; SMOKING BAN LOSES, WILL GO ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed ordinance that would have banned smoking in restaurants, workplaces 
and other public buildings was rejected 3 to 2 Tuesday by the City Council, 
though the council did agree to place the issue on the November ballot as an 
advisory measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barbara Kiley cast the deciding vote, joining Councilmen Daniel T. Welch 
and John M. Gullixson, who criticized the measure as too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The existing smoking ordinance is already quite restrictive," Welch said, 
adding that the proposed ordinance "is going too far." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are (currently) all kinds of places you can't smoke," Welch said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance had passed, smoking would have been prohibited in all 
restaurants regardless of size and all workplaces. In addition, tobacco vending 
machines would have been banned. 
</P>
<P>
 The current ordinance requires restaurants of 40 or more tables to set aside 
30% of the tables for nonsmokers. Smoking is allowed in businesses with fewer 
than 10 employees and in private offices at businesses regardless of size. In 
addition, designated smoking areas may be set aside, a provision the proposed 
ordinance would have eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one residents, health officials and business owners addressed the 
council at a public hearing on the proposed ordinance, with 12 arguing against 
the measure and 9 urging the council to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be a leader in our state and with our youth," said Joyce Netherly, a former 
smoker who spoke in favor of the ordinance. "We might save lives in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 But several restaurant and business owners complained that banning smoking 
would hurt commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 12,000 bowlers in here every month, and the sad fact is, 60% of them 
smoke," said Tom Laspada, owner of the Yorba Linda Bowl. "If this ordinance 
passes, I won't survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hill, owner of the Original Pancake House, said his business was off 
$38,000 in the first six months after he converted his restaurant voluntarily 
to a smoke-free eatery last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sales did not increase," Hill said. "I'm here to tell you (restaurants) 
will lose money." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill went smoke-free because there was demand for tables in the nonsmoking 
section, while tables in the smoking section sat empty. But he has experienced 
a slower customer turnover, as smokers step outside to have a cigarette or two 
during their meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see someone they know outside, they visit, and it ties up the table 
longer," he said. "A table means money." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of putting the ordinance on the ballot is about $10,000. The results 
will not be binding on the council, though both Gullixson and Welch have said 
they would support a ban if voters favor it.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY TO GIVE $4,000 FOR GRAD NITE 
PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To foster sane-and-sober Grad Nite parties for local students, the city is 
donating $1,000 to each festivity at its four public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously voted Monday to make the gifts to the Grad Nite 
celebrations at Huntington Beach, Marina, Edison and Ocean View high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Most county high schools hold Grad Nite parties on the evening of high school 
graduation. The events, supervised by parents and faculty, are usually held on 
campus and feature an array of entertainment and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Grad Nite, including the Huntington Beach Police Department, 
contend that the high school graduates are kept safe at the alcohol- and 
drug-free events. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's $4,000 donation to the Grad Nite parties comes from the Police 
Department's Narcotic Asset Forfeiture Fund. That fund consists of money and 
property seized from drug dealers. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; FRENCH PARK RENTALS SET FOR UPGRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has picked French Park as the next neighborhood to be 
improved under a community program that targets rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Proactive Rental Enforcement Program, which began last year, is run by the 
Planning and Building Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, inspectors survey every apartment in the designated area 
and require tenants and landlords to fix potentially hazardous problems such as 
faulty wiring and inadequate plumbing. Areas are chosen based on the number of 
code violation complaints as well as the number of calls for police and fire 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 French Park includes the area bounded by Washington Avenue to the north, Civic 
Center Drive to the south, Main Street to the west and Poinsettia Street to the 
east. The neighborhood contains 124 rental properties with a total of 572 
dwelling units, according to a report by Robyn Uptegraff, executive director of 
the Planning and Building Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The area generates an above-average level of calls for police and fire 
service, she said. Also, in the last five years, residents living there have 
filed 344 complaints of potential code violations, many citing overcrowding, 
poor maintenance and sanitation problems. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; RESIDENTS WORRIED BY THREAT TO VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fran Bennett knew her house hunting was over when she stumbled upon Newport 
Heights, where the gently sloping terrain provides residents with some of the 
city's most spectacular bay and ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, four years after her family moved to the area, Bennett and other 
residents fear their vistas -- and the community's distinctiveness -- could be 
threatened by proposed changes in a city ordinance that governs limits on 
building heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Heights is on a hill directly above Coast Highway in an area of the 
road known as Mariners Mile. The stretch of highway is dotted with pricey 
restaurants, real-estate offices and boatyards. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents worry that the City Council might alter the wording of Newport 
Beach's height ordinance, making it easier for developers to construct 
buildings on Coast Highway that obscure the views from Newport Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't New York, it's Newport Beach," Bennett said. "We bought in this 
area largely because of the views -- not just the view from the homes but from 
the streets and the parks. The views (define) . . . the whole feeling of the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents expressed their fears about the issue at last week's council 
meeting, where some council members said they are considering modifications to 
the height ordinance. Residents also distributed flyers in the neighborhood 
warning of possible city action. The council will take up the item again at its 
meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The height limit for flat-roofed buildings on Mariners Mile is 26 feet. But 
developers can request a waiver from the Planning Commission that allows 
flat-roofed structures as tall as 35 feet, said James D. Hewicker, the planning 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing ordinance states that before granting a height waiver, the 
Planning Commission must consider how the project would affect the views from 
nearby streets and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members have expressed interest in changing the ordinance's 
wording. Critics fear the alterations would threaten their neighborhood's views 
by making it optional for the commission to consider local vistas when deciding 
a height waver request. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Evelyn Hart opposed the changes and said the city should work to 
protect the views in Newport Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very expensive homes," said Hart, noting that some houses in the 
area sell for $2 million or more. "People don't appreciate losing their views." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said developers should be encouraged to design buildings that preserve as 
many hillside views as possible. One way of doing this is to utilize slanted 
roofs that block out less of the view from Newport Heights and other 
neighborhoods above Coast Highway, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they are concerned less with a specific project that would 
obstruct views than with what they see as the city's lack of concern about view 
preservation. They fear that developers would be quick to take advantage of any 
loosening of the height regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a beautiful area -- the views of the bay are wonderful, not just from 
the homes but from the parks as well," said resident Margit Motta. Theatened 
Vistas Newport Heights residents worry that changes in city's height limits 
would allow Mariners Mile developers to block their views.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BANKS, CITIES JOIN IN FIGHTING BAD CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new partnership between several Orange County banks and cities will help 
curb the hundreds of bad checks floated each month at businesses countywide, 
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating banks will help spread the word about the county's Bad Check 
Restitution Program by telling business owners where they can go for help when 
they fall victim to bad checks. Capizzi said at least 18 cities have also 
agreed to offer program information when merchants apply for or renew business 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't write a check if you don't have money in the bank," Capizzi said. "If 
you do write a bad check, we're coming after you." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Bad Check Restitution Program collected $58,000 for merchants 
left holding bad checks -- a record recovery since the program started in 
September, 1990, Capizzi said. In all, the program has collected $1.3 million 
in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is fully paid for by fees charged to bad-check writers, who also 
must attend an eight-hour education class to avoid criminal prosecution. People 
with criminal records or those who bounced checks totaling more than $1,500 are 
not eligible for the class, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said the program is critical because taxpayers wind up paying when 
businesses fail because of their losses, or hike prices to cover financial 
gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent the idea I have to pay the cost of these bad-check writers," Capizzi 
said, adding that the program also frees his deputies to prosecute more serious 
crimes, while costing taxpayers nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants are asked to file a complaint with the program after efforts to 
recover the check amount fail. Bad checks written for more than $1,500 are 
investigated for possible criminal prosecution, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 11,000 people have gone through the program. Less than 1% have been 
caught writing more bad checks, the county's top prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical bad-check writer is not a criminal looking to rip off a business, 
but someone looking for a short-term, interest-free loan, said Don Mealing, 
president of American Corrective Counseling Services in Santa Ana, which runs 
the education program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people are stretched to the limit financially, and this is a 
last-ditch effort to stay afloat," Mealing said. "They don't really think of it 
as a crime."RENE LYNCH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; STORE OWNER GETS REPRIEVE ON FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A painting of a U.S. flag on a local storefront targeted for removal by the 
Laguna Beach Design Review Board has been granted a one-year reprieve by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously Tuesday to allow James T. LaFave, owner of 
Galaxy Sports Inc., to keep the stars and stripes on a wooden awning above his 
sporting goods business.LaFave had painted the flag for the Fourth of July 
holiday last year, then decided to leave it up. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Design Review Board called it "garish and out of character with the 
neighborhood," the council chose to compromise with LaFave, who says business 
has picked up at the store since the flag was painted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph said LaFave will be allowed to keep the sign until he can 
come up with some kind of proposal next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Christoph said, however, that to allow such signs to proliferate would 
"cheapen the image" of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag, which LaFave estimated to be 40 by 8 feet, is too large to be 
approved under the guidelines for city signs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaFave, whose store is located at 1045 S. Coast Highway, said Wednesday that 
he was pleased and surprised by the council's decision. Previously, he had 
chided the city for "somewhat crippling" local merchants with its regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me they're going to be more cooperative with the businesses in 
this community as they realize a lot of the small retailers are having a hard 
time," he said. "So that's very exciting to me to see."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Board of Supervisors took more steps this week to deal with the shortage 
of affordable housing in Orange County, moving forward on projects in Santa Ana 
Heights and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping an unprecedented seven-month design competition known as "Breaking New 
Ground," the board approved a development team Tuesday for an apartment complex 
project in Santa Ana Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, acting as the Orange County Development Agency, originally 
received 21 proposals for its 3.1-acre parcel in the Santa Ana Heights 
Redevelopment Project Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate to have three excellent development proposals and the final 
decision was difficult," Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said in a statement 
announcing the competition winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning $7.7-million proposal, excluding land costs, includes 75 units 
with two to four bedrooms, two pools, two playgrounds, a community room, 
victory garden, picnic tables and a motorized vehicular gate. The county agency 
will contribute about $1.8 million toward the project, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which will serve families with annual incomes between $20,000 and 
$34,000, will be planned and built under an agreement between the development 
team and OCDA. Construction should take from 12 to 18 months and will start 
late this year or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three proposals were selected as finalists for that project, with the winning 
proposal composed of the following: W.F.A. Inc. of Newport Beach, Akins 
Communities of Irvine, Partnership Housing Corp. of Santa Ana and J&M Realty 
Co. of Fountain Valley. The alternate team selected includes L.C. Major & 
Associates, Kathryn G. Thompson Construction and Related Companies of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The design competition allowed developers to offer more creative projects than 
the usual process containing more rigid development requirements, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the board unanimously approved a new financing package 
involving the proposed Park Stanton affordable housing project for senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial backing for the 335-unit project had been a matter of concern for 
county officials since July, 1990, when the Orange County Housing Authority 
lent the developer, JAN Development Co., $1 million. The project has been 
granted numerous extensions through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is back on track so far," said Bob Pusavat, county director of 
housing and redevelopment. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; BACKPACKER HOSTEL PLAN TO BE HEARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to convert a nondescript brick building in the city's Cannery district 
into an international inn for backpackers and other young travelers will come 
before the Planning Commission tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian investors want to spend thousands of dollars to transform the 
two-story structure on 32nd Street into a 40- to 50-bed hostel complete with 
sleeping areas, a kitchen and community rooms where travelers can plan day 
trips and get to know one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Newport residents are expected to oppose the plan, fearing the inn would 
bring noise, traffic and rowdy young people into the neighborhood. If the 
project is approved, the city may limit the number of days people can stay at 
the hostel. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers admitted that they need to dispel residents' stereotypes about 
backpacking and educate them about what their project is really about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to be bringing drug abusers or young skaters in here," said 
Philip Boston, an investor from Perth. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston said many backpackers are either taking time off from college or 
already hold degrees. They are lured to the United States from Europe and 
Australia by low-priced airline tickets that allow them to travel around the 
world, spending several weeks at each of a dozen or so destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some travelers even use suitcases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach inn would be independently managed. It would be associated 
with a national backpacking group that helps local hostels with worldwide 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodging at the inn would cost about $12 a night. Boston said the hostel would 
also sponsor day trips to amusement parks, museums, Catalina, Yosemite and 
other attractions. More "adventure-oriented" activities such as bungee jumping 
and scuba diving would also be offered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A key goal of the inn is to create a comfortable social environment that 
allows guests to meet other travelers. Boston stressed that the inn will not 
host wild parties or allow drugs on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 At other hostels, guests stay for two weeks or longer. But the city could 
limit the stay of Newport Beach inn guests to just a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cannery area's zoning allows for such an inn, said James D. Hewicker, the 
planning director. But the developers need a special-use permit from 
thePlanning Commission, which could vote on the proposal tonight or postpone a 
decision, Hewicker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach was selected as the home for the hostel because of its central 
location to beaches, amusement parks and other attractions, Boston said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that some nearby residents are concerned about the proposal, 
but said that their fears should be soothed when they understand how the hostel 
would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot to offer the community," he said.SHELBY GRAD

WITNESSES SOUGHT TO MOTORCYCLIST'S FATAL CRASH ON I-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A motorcyclist was killed early Wednesday in what the California Highway 
Patrol said may have been a felony hit-and-run incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, 41-year-old Oliver Steele of San Diego, was riding north on 
Interstate 5, north of Ortega Highway, when he was "possibly sideswiped" by 
another vehicle and knocked off his motorcycle, said CHP Officer Steve Miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele suffered major injuries despite wearing a helmet, said CHP spokesman 
Bruce Lian. He was was pronounced dead at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center in Mission Viejo, Miles said 
</P>
<P>
 Steele was driving between 55 and 60 m.p.h. when the accident occurred at 5:35 
a.m., he said. The CHP is asking anyone who might have witnessed the incident 
to call its offices in San Juan Capistrano at (714) 661-6215. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was light fog and it was still dark at the time of the 
incident, the morning commute was underway and "we have the feeling someone 
might have seen what happened," Miles said.

TEEN'S SLAYING CALLED CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF GANG WARFARE; COURTS: PROSECUTOR SAYS 
'93 SHOOTING WAS 'PAY-BACK' FOR LOST FIGHT. DEFENSE SAYS ALLEGED GUNMAN NEVER 
MEANT TO KILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The fatal shooting of a teen-age soccer player outside Century High School is 
a classic example of gang warfare -- and a tragic reminder of the youthful 
victims who are caught in the cross-fire, a prosecutor told a juror Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged gunman, Miguel Camarena, 19, is on trial for murder for shooting 
17-year-old Jose Luis Lopez, a varsity soccer player who was gunned down as he 
drove to school with his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Rozenberg said Camarena, a reputed gang member, was 
seeking revenge when he opened fire as Lopez drove by on Feb. 26, 1993. Two 
days earlier, Camarena had lost a fight with Lopez's brother, Adrian, while 
Jose Lopez and others looked on, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a vicious cycle of pay-back" that rules gang-riddled streets, Rozenberg 
told an Orange County Superior Court jury. Camarena had "lost face" in the 
fight, and was determined to regain "respect" with murder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the trial's closing arguments Wednesday, defense attorney James 
Appel said Camarena has the mentality of a 12-year-old and was a "slow and 
easy" target for bullies. He only armed himself to scare off another attack and 
never intended to kill anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he trying to get respect, or is he a person who is mildly retarded and is 
just trying to get people to stop beating him up?" Appel asked jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Appel asked jurors to consider lesser offenses -- second-degree murder or 
manslaughter -- as an appropriate verdict. He insisted that Camarena did not 
ambush the teen-ager by trying to take him by surprise, noting that Camarena 
opened fire in front of several witnesses at 8 a.m. on a busy street. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his closing argument, Rozenberg pulled the alleged murder weapon from 
his waistband and waved it in the direction of surprised jurors, noting that a 
gunman does not have to be in hiding before carrying out an ambush attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors began deliberating late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez faces life in prison without parole if convicted of first-degree murder 
and allegations that the crime was gang-related and Camarena was lying in wait 
for his victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal shooting came in the midst of a seemingly endless escalation of 
violence on school campuses. Lopez was the fourth Southland student to die by 
gunfire in the month leading up to his death, and the shooting was the eighth 
near Orange County schools in the 1992-93 school year.

NOT-GUILTY PLEA IN FORGED-MEMORABILIA CASE; BASEBALL: SAN JUAN MAN IS ACCUSED 
OF SELLING $8,000 IN FAKE COLLECTIBLES. SCAM MAY HAVE INVOLVED 14 O.C. VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Juan Capistrano man accused of selling up to $8,000 worth of phony 
baseball memorabilia pleaded not guilty here Wednesday to three felony counts. 
Authorities say the alleged forgery scam involved 14 victims in Orange County 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies on Monday arrested Harold Berg (Hal) Gardner, 36, whose 
reputed activities extended to Los Angeles, Long Beach, Hollywood and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, who works as a roofer, pleaded not guilty during his arraignment in 
South County Municipal Court. He was booked on suspicion of forgery, grand 
theft and possession of methamphetamine and is being held in Orange County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the district attorney's office said Wednesday that Gardner 
will remain in jail without bail because he violated the terms of his probation 
stemming from previous convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 A public defender was assigned to represent Gardner, whose pretrial hearing 
was set for April 28 and his preliminary hearing for May 3. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigator posing as a collector met Gardner in Lake Forest on Monday and 
bought three documents that allegedly carried signatures of such Hall of Fame 
greats as Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Jackie Robinson, Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts quickly verified the signatures as fakes, exposing a pattern of crimes 
throughout Southern California, said Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. Last week, 
Gardner had been arrested in Costa Mesa on similar charges, but had been bailed 
out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner is also suspected of having circulated phony Beatles memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County authorities first arrested Gardner last summer, when 
investigators say a sting operation exposed an attempt to sell a Mission Viejo 
collector a rare document reportedly autographed by Mantle and Maris. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner had approached Orange County collectors with an affidavit that he 
claimed was signed by Mantle and Maris in 1965, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit indicated that Mantle, Maris and other baseball greats would not 
be able to appear at a charity auction for Children's Hospital in New York, but 
would send along other items as a donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner allegedly circulated three such affidavits, all drawn on what appeared 
to be new paper and signed with a felt-tip pen, which investigators said did 
not come into widespread use until the 1970s. Licensed collectors later 
verified the affidavits as counterfeits, said sheriff's fraud investigator Don 
Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Gonzalez, the owner of The Winning Play, a sports collectibles shop in 
Mission Viejo, tipped off sheriff's deputies after Gardner approached him with 
the affidavits, others of which had been sold to dealers in Laguna Niguel and 
El Toro, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew immediately that it was bogus," said Gonzalez, who, along with 
authorities, set up the sting operation at his shop in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told this guy (Gardner) that I had a buyer willing to purchase the 
affidavit for $1,000," Gonzalez said. "The deputies hid nearby, and when he 
stated that it was a one-of-a-kind item, they arrested him on the spot. You 
should have seen the look on his face. It was one of utter disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
 With the popularity of sports collectibles, Orange County has become one of 
the nation's hot spots for trading and selling.  
</P>
<P>
 Such sudden popularity also has brought a sharp rise in fraud-related cases 
and a preponderance of sellers of counterfeit items, investigators said. The 
price of legitimate items has also soared in recent years.

2 MEN FORCE MOTORIST OVER, ROB HER AT GUNPOINT IN SEAL BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman driving home early Wednesday morning was forced to the curb by 
assailants in two cars and robbed at gunpoint when she stopped her car, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seal Beach resident was not injured in the robbery. She had exited the 
southbound San Diego Freeway at Seal Beach Boulevard about 1:30 a.m. when two 
male motorists -- one in an older Jeep and the other in a Chevrolet Camaro -- 
boxed her in and forced her to pull over and stop, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Jeep approached the woman and put a gun to her head, 
demanding her purse, which she gave to him, police Investigator Darrell Hardin 
said. The unidentified woman, who works in a Gardena casino, had $1,300 in cash 
in the purse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told police both vehicles sped toward the San Diego Freeway after 
the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the robbery, the victim went to a nearby fire station and 
called police, said Rick Paap, spokesman for the Seal Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hardin, this type of robbery is not uncommon.  
</P>
<P>
 "The head of security at the club said it is not an uncommon crime," Hardin 
said. "They have quite a few of these types of robberies of customers and 
employees, (incidents in which victims) are followed and robbed. There is no 
telling how many people are being victimized this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin said the driver of the Jeep was described as a black male in his 20s 
who was about 6 feet to 6 feet, 2 inches tall, with a thin build. The driver of 
the Camaro was described as a Latino male in his 20s who was about 5 feet, 6 
inches to 5 feet, 8 inches tall, with a stocky build. 
</P>
<P>
 Both vehicles are either black or dark blue in color, Hardin said. Anyone with 
information on the case should call Seal Beach police at (310) 431-2541.

COUNTY YIELDS TO TUSTIN OVER POTENTIAL USES OF BASE; CONVERSION: PLANS FOR WORK 
FURLOUGH JAIL, SECOND JUVENILE HALL AND ALCOHOL RECOVERY CENTER DROPPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with opposition from Tustin leaders, Orange County officials have backed 
away from a plan to build a work furlough jail facility, a second juvenile hall 
and an alcohol recovery center at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, county staff members on Wednesday recommended a revised proposal that 
would move the county's animal control facility to the base when it closes in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said the shift in the county's 
plan comes after months of negotiations with Tustin officials over a list of 
potential uses for the 1,620-acre helicopter base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Tustin's support for those facilities, there's a high probability our 
application would be denied," Schneider said. "In the spirit of cooperation and 
negotiation, we have agreed that if Tustin will accept part of the list, then 
we'll withdraw the most offensive parts of that list." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to moving the animal control center from Orange, the county also 
has suggested that a family resource center, a child-care shelter, a regional 
law enforcement training center and an urban regional park be placed at the 
Tustin base. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan, including withdrawal of the detention and sobering-up 
facilities, will be presented to the Board of Supervisors for consideration on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an adjustment based on reality," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of the Navy eventually will make a final determination on 
conversion of the Marine base after reviewing the recommendations of local 
officials and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin officials greeted the county's proposed shift for the base with 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has been cooperating with us very well," said Tustin Mayor Thomas 
R. Saltarelli, chairman of the 16-member City Council-appointed Base Closure 
Task Force. "We're very close, if not there already, in reaching what we all 
believe to be a constructive compromise for the uses of the base."  
</P>
<P>
 Proposals for the detention and alcohol recovery facilities were just "not 
appropriate" with the other uses envisioned for the base, Saltarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relocation of the animal shelter from its present Orange site would free up 
that land for other county uses. The Orange site, however, remains a source of 
controversy involving proposed expansion plans at the nearby Theo Lacy Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials hope to submit a final reuse plan to the Navy later this year. 
It could take another year beyond that for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Land and buildings at closed military bases can be given or sold at 
below-market prices to local governments as long as the federal government 
approves of their future uses, according to federal law.

BISHOP TESTIFIES IN SUIT OVER PRINCIPAL'S FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The highest-ranking official of the Diocese of Orange was the first witness 
called to testify Wednesday as a civil trial began into allegations that a 
former principal was fired two years ago for complaining about unsafe 
conditions at a Catholic school in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony, Bishop Norman F. McFarland denied the charges, saying he had 
placed Marion Patzem, the former principal of St. Joseph School, on 
administrative leave after a four-member committee found that she was a 
"divisive" influence at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed last year, Patzem said she was dismissed in May, 1992, 
after she repeatedly complained about toxic fumes leaking from fluorescent 
light fixtures in a third-grade classroom. The substance was later found to be 
a carcinogen commonly known as PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems began when a teacher and students in the classroom noticed flickering 
lights and complained of stomach pains, respiratory problems and recurring 
rashes on their forearms, necks, torsos and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Patzem alleged in her lawsuit that the school's pastor, Father John Ruhl, 
poked her in the chest for making repeated complaints. She was later fired 
without notice and escorted from the school's grounds by Placentia police in 
front of her students, the suit contends. She is seeking unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In his termination letter, McFarland told Patzem -- nominated by school 
officials in 1991 for a national Catholic school principal of the year award -- 
that she was being dismissed because "you chose not to cooperate in our effort 
to look into the general unrest in St. Joseph Parish." 
</P>
<P>
 Patzem, who served as principal for seven years, was dismissed amid 
acrimonious debate within the parish.

BIRDS DIDN'T BUDGE FROM ROAD, WHICH MADE DRIVERS SITTING DUCKS

 A pair of stubborn ducks sitting in the middle of Coast Highway triggered a 
multi-car collision Wednesday, sending three people to the hospital with minor 
injuries and leaving several others in a foul mood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ducks, however, were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They caused the accident and then they fled the scene," said Sgt. John 
Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 2:50 p.m. when Teri Norwood, 22, of Newport Beach, 
who was traveling west on Coast Highway near Orange Avenue, stopped to avoid 
two ducks that had decided to sit in the middle of the road.

 "She stopped her car and starting honking at the ducks to move, but it didn't 
work," Desmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon there were two cars waiting on the ducks. Then Brian Dawson of Los 
Angeles, driving his 2-week-old 1994 Chevrolet Corvette, joined the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along comes a Southern California Edison truck, which rams into the back of 
the Corvette," Desmond said. The Corvette was pushed into another lane, where 
it struck a Toyota sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, his unidentified passenger and the unidentified driver of the Toyota 
were taken to Hoag Hospital with minor injuries.

4 MEN ARRESTED IN THEFT FROM POSTAL TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and U.S. postal inspectors said they arrested four men Monday after 
watching them smash the back window of a parked postal vehicle and take a tray 
of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, all from Santa Ana, were later identified as suspects in an April 4 
postal truck burglary -- one of seven such thefts that occurred in the county 
that day, when monthly Social Security checks were expected to be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on suspicion of auto burglary were Jesus Ceja Gutierrez, 21, Carlos 
Toleda Nava, 27, Carlos Carillo Diaz, 26, and Rodolfo Cupa Celia, 27. All are 
being held at the Anaheim Temporary Detention Facility, police Capt. John E. 
Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 4, seven mail trucks were broken into in five Orange County cities, 
with a loss of 4,500 pieces of mail, postal inspectors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the burglaries occurred in Anaheim, two in Fullerton, and one each in 
Santa Ana, Westminster and Huntington Beach. Flanagan said the investigation of 
all the postal crimes is continuing, and that the four men arrested Monday may 
have been responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're exploring the possibility that they were involved in some of the other 
ones," Anaheim Police Sgt. Charles Chavez said. A vehicle similar to the one 
carrying the four men arrested was spotted near the April 4 postal truck 
burglary in Santa Ana, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it's the right car," Chavez said. "You just can't say it's 100%, but 
everything fits to a T." 
</P>
<P>
 Mail theft is a federal offense, punishable by up to five years in prison. 
Police said Wednesday they did not know if the men would be charged with a 
federal crime, and postal authorities could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, investigators Monday staked out several locations in 
Anaheim. Detectives at one stakeout noticed a vehicle stopping to look into 
parked postal trucks, Flanagan said. Investigators followed the vehicle through 
Anaheim, Garden Grove and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 900 block of West St. Andrews Place, the four men broke into the parked 
postal truck, took the mail and were then arrested without incident, Flanagan 
said.

DEVELOPER OFFERS SANTA ANA A NEW SPACE-SAVER SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified School District trustees were presented Wednesday with an 
alternative proposal for a "space-saver school," an option proponents said 
could save the state as much as $15 million in land acquisition costs. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting, the Board of Education heard a commercial developer's 
plan to build an intermediate school at 2828 N. Bristol St., the site of a 
vacant and dilapidated 180-unit apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the item was not scheduled for a vote, the board took no formal 
action. But school board President Sal Mendoza, and board members Audrey 
Yamagata-Noji and Robert W. Balen expressed some reservations about the site. 
</P>
<P>
 There are "too many variables, too many unknowns," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Rosemarie Avila and Tom Chaffee defended the proposal. "We would 
be delinquent not to consider this site," Avila said.  
</P>
<P>
 Space-saver schools are built vertically, with several stories, so that they 
don't take up large areas of land with single-story buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 The district is pursuing acquisition of property behind Bristol Marketplace to 
build the space-saver campus. The board has approved construction of an 
intermediate school at that site, and the state is prepared to pay as much as 
$21 million for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Jim Righeimer proposed Wednesday that the district consider building 
the space-saver project at the alternative site. Under his plan, a partnership 
that includes Righeimer would acquire the 15-acre site for $6.9 million and 
then sell 12 acres of that parcel to the district for the same cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Righeimer downplayed potential obstacles, which he said include annexing the 
property from the Orange Unified School District and some legal entanglements 
between the property owner and its current leaseholder.

CELLULOID HERO; HIS SMOOTH JUMPER CAPTURES THE MOMENT IN 'HOOSIERS' 
</P>

 "I'll make it."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Jimmy Chitwood, "Hoosiers" 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Dawson has officiated dozens of recreation league basketball games at 
the small Salvation Army gym on Edinger Avenue. But something was bothering 
Dawson on this April evening, something he couldn't quite place. 
</P>
<P>
 Maris Valainis stood out among the 10 guys playing in the 6-feet-4-and-under 
league game that night. Dawson recognized that jump shot, the one so perfect it 
should be cast in gold and sitting atop a trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever seen the movie, "Hoosiers," Jerry?  
</P>
<P>
 " That's who he is?" Dawson asked. " He's Jimmy Chitwood? I thought I've seen 
that jump shot somewhere before." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to forget it if you saw the 1986 movie's final scene, where Chitwood 
hit the game-winning jump shot for tiny Hickory High School in the 1952 Indiana 
State High School championship basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Same jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Same player. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the same person. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people walk up to me after I play, and they'll say, 'Hey, you look 
like that guy from 'Hoosiers,' " Valainis said. "If I'm playing well, I'll tell 
them it was me. If I'm not playing well, I tell them it's not me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, Chitwood hit the winning shot that no doubt propelled him to 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, Valainis was cut four times from his high school team in 
Indianapolis, played golf for a year at Purdue and dropped out as a junior to 
pursue an acting career that landed him roles that included an ax murderer in a 
TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years after his first and biggest role, Valainis, 31, works as a golf 
pro in Mission Viejo and wants nothing to do with the Hollywood scene. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's quite content with playing hoops in a small, dark gym much like the 
one the Hollywood casting agent discovered him in back in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 But some things never change. Valainis is among the rec league's scoring 
leaders, averaging 18 points. His team is in first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis made his acting debut in one of the best sports movies of all time. 
Filmed on a $7.7-million budget, "Hoosiers" has grossed $30 million on the big 
screen, with millions more in video rentals and sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie has become a cult favorite with basketball junkies, players and 
coaches, who show it to motivate their high school and college players. 
</P>
<P>
 It inspired Duke center Cherokee Parks, who watched it shortly before his 
Marina High team played for the 1991 Southern Section I-A championship. Parks 
shouted, "Hickory!" through an empty L.A. Sports Arena, just as one of the 
Hickory players had done before the big game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," Valainis said. "I never realized what a motivational thing 
this movie has become. It's great that after eight years, people still rent it 
and like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little like the 'Wizard of Oz' in that it's set back in another era 
but is enjoyed today and will be 40 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hoosiers" is loosely based on the story of tiny Milan High School, which 
upset powerhouse Muncie Central in the 1954 Indiana state tournament final. The 
movie was written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh, both Indiana 
natives. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the story of Norman Dale (Gene Hackman), a temperamental former college 
coach haunted by memories of punching a player several years before. Hickory, a 
small town that isn't used to change, doesn't exactly put out the welcome mat 
for its new, volatile coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's vice principal (Barbara Hershey) keeps Chitwood, his best player, 
off the team, encouraging him to pursue an academic scholarship, rather than an 
athletic one. 
</P>
<P>
 As losses pile up, the townspeople grow tired of Dale's sideline temper. And 
the fact that he has turned the town drunk (Dennis Hopper) into an assistant 
coach hasn't helped, either. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting, the townspeople voted to fire the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Chitwood. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems he has been watching Dale in games and practices and likes what he 
sees. Chitwood announces: "If I play, coach stays. He goes, I go." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach stays, Chitwood plays, and Hickory goes undefeated the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Valainis, it was the basketball championship he never got a chance to 
play for in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis grew up in Indianapolis, the sixth of seven children. Like most kids 
in Indiana, he wanted to someday play for the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a big IU fan," he said. "My brother was going there in 1975-76, when 
they had the undefeated team. Every night they played, I would watch it on 
Channel 4 -- Kent Benson, Scott May, Quinn Buckner. It was a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides playing basketball, Valainis also found time to hit golf balls at a 
local course. By 9, he was working as a caddie along with his five brothers, 
and his swing developed must faster than his jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Always small for his age, Valainis played on youth basketball teams through 
the eighth grade. He always shot from his hip because he wasn't strong enough 
to shoot a conventional jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only 5 feet 6 by my freshman year," he said. "And I wasn't very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make the freshman team very badly, so I practiced my shooting 
every day that summer. That was all I worked on. Finally, I got the ball up 
over my head when I shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Valainis was cut during his freshman year at Chatard High, a Catholic 
school of about 800 students. He was cut as sophomore and junior, too. Too 
short and too slow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally grew to 6-1 by my senior year," said Valainis, now 6-2. "But by 
then, the coach had his team." 
</P>
<P>
 While he struggled in basketball, Valainis made Chatard's varsity golf team by 
his sophomore year and played on three city champions. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating in 1981, he joined Purdue's golf team as a walk-on, playing 
only one season before quitting to concentrate on his mechanical engineering 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 His college career came to an end early in 1986 when a casting director for 
Hoosiers walked into an elementary school gym and spotted Valainis draining 
jump shots from all over the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy walked up to me and asked me if I wanted to try out for a basketball 
movie," Valainis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed up the next day and was greeted by a line of 400 people outside the 
gym. Get in line, superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nuts," he said. "I couldn't wait around four hours. I had a job 
painting houses, and I had to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But just as Valainis began to leave, the casting director emerged from the 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought me right in," Valainis said. "They (casting crew members) had me 
dribble and shoot for a while, then they invited me back to audition a week 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis had no acting experience, not even a credit in a school play. But his 
audition, basketball skills and his dark, thin features caught the director's 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really nervous for the audition," he said. "A local TV crew was there 
filming some of the auditions, and thank God they filmed the guy before me 
instead of me. I would have been so nervous, I wouldn't have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis made it, and so did a handful of other actors who portrayed Hickory 
players. Most of them were unknowns. Most grew up in Indiana, and all but one, 
Valainis, played high school basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 They practiced together two weeks before filming started in October in 
Knightstown, Ind., just outside Indianapolis. They installed a few plays to run 
during the basketball scenes. Hackman arrived early to help the rookies polish 
their acting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Filming lasted 10 weeks, all of it done on location in Indiana. Days were 
long, and sometimes tempers flared. 
</P>
<P>
 On one particularly frustrating day, Hackman announced to anyone within 
earshot that the movie would become another "Heaven's Gate," considered one of 
the biggest box-office bombs of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured if anybody would know, it would be him," Valainis said. "We were 
sort of surprised by all the success the movie has had." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the younger actors hung out with Hopper, who told them stories about 
his early days on the set of "Rebel Without a Cause" with James Dean. To kill 
time between filming, the players organized free-throw shooting contests and 
played cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty laid back," Valainis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship game was filmed at Hinkle Fieldhouse on the Butler University 
campus. Strangely enough, it was filmed at halftime of a high school game 
involving Chatard, Valainis' alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chatard coach came over and said 'Hi,' " Valainis said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The final game scene was one of the toughest to film. The players were 
exhausted from filming so many basketball scenes. Fans had to be moved to 
different sections of the arena to make the crowd seem bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 And Valainis' winning jump shot had to be perfect . 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly wasn't during rehearsal, when he missed jumper after jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't hit the side of a barn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An impatient Hackman suggested he move closer to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 No need. 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis did just what Jimmy Chitwood told his coach he would do: "I'll make 
it." He drilled the shot on the first take. Cut. Print it. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I hit the shot, the crowd was supposed to charge on the court," he 
said. "During practice, somebody noticed I wasn't focusing on the basket 
because I was distracted by the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis' winning shot brought a smile to Bobby Plump, the 57-year-old 
Indianapolis insurance agent who hit the winning shot for Milan in the 1954 
title game. Before filming the final scenes, Valainis studied game films of 
Plump's winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maris did a wonderful job as Jimmy Chitwood," he said. "I know a lot of 
people in Milan were disappointed when the movie came out, because they didn't 
use the town's name or the school's name. But I thought it was a fantastic 
film, and Maris was terrific for a guy who had no acting experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis has never watched the entire film at once. He was too uncomfortable 
watching himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said, "it's just funny to look at, to see yourself on 
screen. It's an ego thing. I've become more and more comfortable with it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis missed the premiere of "Hoosiers" in Indianapolis. He moved to 
Southern California three weeks after filming ended and was "too paranoid" to 
miss scheduled movie auditions to attend the premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only 23 at the time, and I wanted to give acting a try," he said. "I 
figured I was young enough to come back and get my degree." 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed with his sister in Palos Verdes and managed a local golf course to 
pay the bills. He got an agent, who helped him land a handful of small TV and 
movie roles, including: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A role as a Russian student in "Combat High," a TV comedy about a military 
school, made in the spirit of the "Police Academy" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An ax murderer in one episode of a short-lived TV series called "Private 
Eye." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A spot playing basketball in a soft drink commercial that aired in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A brief appearance as a soldier in "Casualties of War" with Sean Penn and 
Michael J. Fox. Valainis' character was blown up in one of the early war 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to go to Thailand for that one," he said. "I was there five weeks. Then 
I was laying by the hotel pool one day, and the assistant director came by and 
said, 'That's it. You're finished.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis took him literally. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his last movie role, although he has dabbled in a few stage productions 
in Los Angeles. He also auditioned for Woody Harrelson's role in "White Men 
Can't Jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Will he ever give acting another shot? 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt it," he said. "There's too much rejection. You get your hopes up for 
a role, then you don't get it. I'm happy with what I'm doing now." 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis moved to Costa Mesa in 1992 and has been the head pro and assistant 
manager at Casta del Sol Golf Course in Mission Viejo for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 He plays hoops in a couple leagues, spends time with his girlfriend and plays 
golf all day. It's not Hollywood, but it's a heck of a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 So we know what happened to Valainis, but what became of his character, Jimmy 
Chitwood? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hoosiers" ends with the team celebrating the victory, so are we to assume 
that his character, Chitwood, landed a scholarship and went on to star in 
college? 
</P>
<P>
 Valainis grins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he said, "he went to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he dropped out to become a movie star."

REAL PLAYER'S LIFE REMAINS TRUE TO SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A who's who of Indiana basketball gathered last year in Indianapolis to film a 
TV commercial for a local insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the distinguished guests were George McGinnis, Jerry Sichting, Mike 
Woodson, Don Busey, Louis Dampier and a guy named Bobby Plump. 
</P>
<P>
 During taping, McGinnis surveyed the group, noting that several players had 
worn Indiana Mr. Basketball's No. 1 jersey and some had played in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he turned to Plump. 
</P>
<P>
 "You only hit one shot," he said, "and you're more famous than all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Plump became a statewide legend in 1954, when his 15-foot jump shot with two 
seconds left led tiny Milan High to a 32-30 victory over Muncie Central in the 
final of the Indiana State High School basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Milan's season served as inspiration for the 1986 movie "Hoosiers," in which 
Jimmy Chitwood, a shy, quiet kid, hits the game-winning basket in tiny Hickory 
High's victory over South Bend Central in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Plump, now 57, sees some parallels between himself and the movie's Chitwood, 
played by Costa Mesa's Maris Valainis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just a shy, backward kid back then," said Plump, who owns an insurance 
and financial planning company in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Plump turned down scholarship offers from Indiana, Purdue 
and Michigan State to play at nearby Butler, setting single-season and career 
scoring records. He spent three years after college traveling the world with an 
industrial league team before returning to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Plump and his Milan teammates get together annually to celebrate the team's 
28-2 championship season, and the talk always turns to the key players and 
coaches involved. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk about Marvin Wood, their 26-year-old coach who took over the team in 
1953. Milan finished 24-5 that season and reached the state semifinals. Wood, 
after suffering from cancer in 1990, often joins Plump on the lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk about Plump's 28 points in a 65-52 quarterfinal victory over 
Indianapolis Crispus Attucks and its star player, sophomore Oscar Robertson. 
Robertson led Crispus Attucks to state titles the next two seasons and a 
combined 63-1 record before moving on to successful college and pro careers. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, they talk about Plump's game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Plump remembers it, Muncie Central tied the score, 30-30, with 1 
minute 18 seconds left to play. Milan ran the clock down to 18 seconds, then 
called timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in the movie, there was no question who was taking the last shot. 
Plump, a 5-foot-10 guard, was having a terrible game (he finished with 10 
points), but he was the team's leading scorer (15.3 points per game) and the 
go-to guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Wood said I should dribble around and take the last shot," Plump said. 
"Then Gene White, our center, suggested we spread the court and let me take it 
in alone from the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to have ice water in my veins, but I turned to Mr. Wood and 
asked: 'Coach, could we go over all this again?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Plump got it straight. 
</P>
<P>
 He faked to his left, forcing his defender off him, and pulled up for a jumper 
near the free-throw line and . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was in from the moment it left my hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if I would have been wrong, I wouldn't be talking to you right 
now."HOOSIERS (

 Strange but true facts about the 1986 movie "Hoosiers": 
</P>
<P>
 -- After filming, producers bought the actors portraying Hickory High players 
state championship rings that read: "1952 Indiana State High School Champions" 
encircled around the players' names. They got a deal on them, too. Brad Long, 
the actor who played Buddy, the team's mouthy point guard, sold class rings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Producers had a problem with the state-of-the-art scoreboard that hung over 
the court at Butler University's Hinkle Fieldhouse, where championship-game 
scenes were filmed. It had to be covered with a large black canvas during 
shooting because that style of scoreboard hadn't been invented by the early 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All of the actors on the Hickory team played high school basketball except 
one -- Maris Valainis, who played the Huskers' star player, Jimmy Chitwood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The last names of the South Bend Central players, Hickory's 
championship-game opponent, were taken from the real last names of actors 
portraying Hickory players. Boyle, Central's guard, came from Brad Boyle, who 
played Whit, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ray Craft, who started in the backcourt for the 1954 Milan High team that 
inspired the movie, had a small role as the tournament official who greets the 
Hickory team as it enters the gym for the championship game. Craft is the 
assistant commissioner of the Indiana High School Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the original script, Chitwood had a younger brother who was injured 
while participating in a donkey basketball game. Coach Norman Dale (Gene 
Hackman) was supposed to take the youngster to the hospital, thus forming a 
bond with Jimmy. The script also called for Buddy to have a love interest -- a 
cheerleader. Both scenes were later written out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The movie premiered in Indianapolis in November, 1986, and wasn't 
well-attended. Hopper was the only star who showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is no Hickory High. The gym used for shooting home-court scenes is 
located in Knightstown, Ind. (No, it's not named after Indiana Coach Bobby 
Knight). 
</P>
<P>
 -- During filming, several players suffered blisters on their feet from 
playing in the canvas high-top shoes. They had been used to playing in modern 
leather models. MIKE REILLEY Sources: Maris Valainis, Bobby Plump and NSB Film

CHANDLER STRIPS SCHOLARSHIPS OF 2 CSUN PLAYERS; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: WALDORF, 
ESPARZA ARE REMOVED ON SAME DAY SCHOOL ANNOUNCES SIGNING OF SIX RECRUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two of Cal State Northridge's top women's basketball players were removed from 
the team by Coach Kim Chandler on Wednesday night, only hours after the school 
announced the signing of six recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Kris Waldorf and leading scorer Michelle Esparza said they were 
told during individual meetings with Chandler that their scholarships would not 
be renewed after this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldorf, a 5-foot-5 sophomore from Gahr High in Artesia, started in all but 
one of Northridge's 25 games, averaging 4.6 points and passing for a team-high 
71 assists. Esparza, a 5-10 sophomore guard from El Rancho High in Monterey 
Park, averaged 15.7 points, 4.9 rebounds and made a team-high 45 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Katina Mines, a junior forward who transferred to Northridge after a standout 
career at Valley College, also will not be returning, team members said. Mines, 
who averaged 7.3 points and 6.2 rebounds, has had little contact with her 
former teammates since Northridge's season ended in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said Wednesday that she was meeting with each player later in the day 
and would not comment on any the status of any player until today. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, the Northridge sports information department released the 
names of six newly signed women's basketball players, including guard Sara 
Hagman, who averaged 24.8 points for Crescenta Valley High and set a Southern 
Section record by making 13 three-point shots in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight freshmen, sophomores and juniors who started last season as 
players with scholarships, only center Maureen Batiste and guards Shannon 
Crouse and Carrie Dormire are set to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Amy Horst and guard Jeannette Salazar quit early in Northridge's 3-22 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's moves did not come as a surprise to either Waldorf or Esparza, each 
of whom said they found their way into the coach's doghouse because of "a 
personal incident off the court" that occurred during the season. Neither 
player would elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something that came up, a mistake we made, and we couldn't solve it," 
Waldorf said. "We were never able to talk about it and get past it." 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza said she did not make an effort during her meeting to dissuade 
Chandler from removing her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went along with it," Esparza said. "What could I say? Her mind was 
made up. I wasn't going to give her the satisfaction of seeing me kiss up to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza hopes to transfer to another school, and based on her resume she 
should find some takers. She was selected to a preseason all-star team 
consisting of the nation's top players from NCAA Division I independent teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldorf also would like to continue her career. However, she said Chandler 
refused to grant her an official release. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kicked me off the team and when I said I wanted to transfer she said, 
'No. Why should I do anything for you?' " Waldorf said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to bad-mouth her, but I don't understand why she's being so 
vindictive about me playing somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldorf, who carries a 3.8 grade-point average, said she would like to 
transfer to UCLA and have the option of trying out for the Bruins as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither player said they would contest the removal of their scholarships. 
Schools are required by the NCAA to provide athletes with written notification 
when their scholarships are not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletes can contest the decision before a non-athletic authority at the 
school, according to Dan Dutcher, an NCAA director of legislative services. 
</P>
<P>
 Dormire, one of the trio of scholarship players returning to the team, said 
she was surprised that Waldorf and Esparza were removed but added that she 
would "stick by the coach's choice." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a great team," she said.

PASTORINI FINDS SANCTUARY BEHIND A MASK; TAFT SOFTBALL CATCHER GLAD TO ESCAPE 
THE GLARE OF TENNIS' SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The powerful stroke is back. So is the swagger. And the air of defiance, 
that's back too. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft High's Brahna Pastorini has returned, but it's a different Pastorini 
playing a different sport: softball instead of tennis. The often-temperamental 
singles player who won the City Section championship in 1992 but lost the final 
last December is making a bumpy transition to a team sport with daily 
shepherding from Coach Donna Hetman. 
</P>
<P>
 Polished and powerful on the tennis court, Pastorini plays a humble, 
unglamorous position in softball: catcher. Pastorini, who never played youth 
softball, is a work in progress on the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's such a good athlete, it's scary," Hetman said of Pastorini, who rode 
the bench as a junior last year but has been groomed for a successful senior 
season. "But she's learning what it's like to be a part of a team, and we've 
had some long talks about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorini becomes quiet when asked why she took up softball -- she tried it, 
she liked it, she said. But as the only daughter of high-profile parents -- her 
father is former NFL quarterback Dan Pastorini, her mother is actress June 
Wilkinson -- she has tired of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention proved particularly uncomfortable in December when she advanced 
to the City tennis final but lost in three sets to Dorsey freshman Kendra 
Segura. The score of the match -- 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 3-6 -- won't be remembered. 
But the dozens who saw Pastorini, the reigning champion who had a 41-0 varsity 
record, won't soon forget how she lost. 
</P>
<P>
 With a blistering serve and hard ground strokes, Pastorini had blown away each 
of her opponents in '93. But Segura, a spindly 14-year-old, returned everything 
and ran Pastorini, who was playing on an injured ankle, into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 By the second set, Pastorini seemed to sense defeat, and so she mocked it. She 
started hitting balls out on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators looking down on the Studio City Racquet Centre court groaned. 
Murmurs of disapproval swept through the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, Pastorini managed to mask her frustration behind a cold glare. But 
eventually, the poker face disappeared. After the match, she cried. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined interviews. All she wanted was to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But now she is back with her familiar strut and power game, handling the 
pitchers and knocking in runs for the Taft softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," Pastorini said. "Less pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 But catcher? 
</P>
<P>
 "The position was sort of given to me," Pastorini said. "(Hetman) said, 'You 
can get an attitude on the field. You can be aggressive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And she is. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent game against El Camino Real, Pastorini stared down a runner she 
had thrown out at second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Hetman marvels at the 5-foot-8 senior's ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a great arm," Hetman said. "It comes from her serve in tennis. If 
she had more experience, she'd be great." 
</P>
<P>
 But softball is just a diversion for Pastorini, whose future is NCAA Division 
I tennis. She is close to accepting a full scholarship at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she says hitting a softball is easier than hitting a tennis ball, and 
she makes a good case. She entered the week batting .450. Seven of her 18 hits 
went for extra bases -- three doubles, three triples and a home run. She has 
driven in 16 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 She has thrown out 15 runners and has not made an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorini's contributions have aided Taft (8-8), which has struggled to a 2-5 
start in Northwest Valley Conference play after going 17-4, 9-1 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many tennis players would attempt this switch. Softball is no country club 
sport. And few catchers are held to tennis-like standards of etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Catchers crouch much of the game. Pastorini takes foul balls off the chest 
protector and must hold her ground when runners slide into her oft-injured 
ankles. The game seems more suited for her aggressive, if not tempestuous, 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 She's making plenty of noise with her bat. But Pastorini's teammates don't 
give her the star treatment and Hetman calls the pitches and gives her constant 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know what she did in tennis," Taft center fielder Dikla Orevi said, 
"but she's one of the players here, where everybody contributes." 
</P>
<P>
 And that comes as a relief for someone who felt uneasy under the scrutiny that 
came with her status as City tennis champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like everybody's looking at you," Pastorini said. "And you're going, 
'God, why do they have to look?' "Here, you have a family sort of feel. You 
work together. In tennis, we have a team and all, but it wasn't really family. 
When you're out there on the court, you're on your own." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressure comes in softball, Pastorini can put on a face mask. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun just blending in instead of standing out," she said. "It's a new 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't been a smooth one. Pastorini can be moody and demanding, Hetman 
said. She nearly cut Pastorini last year for arriving at practice late and 
trying to leave early. Hetman spent as much time showing Pastorini how to 
behave around teammates as teaching her how to bat, catch and throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to constantly stay on her," Hetman said. "She needs lots of 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hetman does so freely, knowing that Pastorini is reaching out. She was not 
raised by her famous father, who is divorced from her famous mother. In fact, 
Pastorini has remarked that she wouldn't know her father if she saw him on the 
street. Her mother is frequently out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brahna practically lives on her own," Hetman said. "Or she stays with our 
pitcher (Nicole Ortiz)." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hetman, who also coaches the Taft junior varsity football team, takes a 
tough-love approach to Pastorini. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to constantly remind her it's a team sport when she gets into a sulk," 
Hetman said. "I say, 'You have to pick up the pieces. You still got to go out 
there and catch Nicole. You have seven more innings.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never played tennis; I've never played an individual sport. Maybe you 
need that mentality in tennis: me, me, me. But in softball we win together, we 
lose together." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lesson in humility, perhaps far greater than the tear-jerking loss to 
Segura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a long talk before the season," Hetman said. "I told her she would be 
playing an important position and she would have to be a leader. And being the 
catcher, she's starting to realize the focus of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastorini has continued to practice tennis every day and play in weekend 
tournaments. Her private coach, Gene Malin, said he wants to see her spend more 
time on the court and less time on the softball field. But he supports her 
decision to play softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played team sports in high school," Malin said. "It helps. You get a little 
different attitude. You're not as cocky." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hetman: "Playing with other people is going to make Brahna a better 
person all the way around."

OJAI VALLEY TENNIS TOURNAMENT SETS SAIL FOR 95TH TIME 
</P>

<P>
 More than 100 area tennis players, and several more from high school and 
college teams in the region, will participate in the 95th Ojai Valley tennis 
tournament which starts today at various locations throughout Ojai and Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai, is considered the oldest and one of the largest tournaments in the 
United States sponsored by one club.Singles action starts today with 700 
matches being played by 1,400 of the 1,600 total entrants in 34 divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25 Ojai participants have won Wimbledon titles, including Stan Smith 
and Billy Jean King, both five-time champions at Ojai. Jimmy Connors, Arthur 
Ashe, Jack Kramer and Bill Tilden also won at Ojai, which started in 1896 with 
15 local players, including Ojai's William Thacher, an NCAA doubles champion at 
Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon women's champion Tracy Austin is also a former Ojai participant. 
</P>
<P>
 Among local participants, Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks will defend her 
1993 girls' 18-and-under championship. Philip Tseng (18-and-under) and Mike and 
Bob Bryan (16-and-under) lead the top junior players. Former touring pro Roscoe 
Tanner (Westlake Village) is among the favorites in men's open singles. DANA

FOR CSUN, BIG WEST COULD BE IN FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports that Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State might bolt the Big West 
Conference to join the Western Athletic Conference could boost Cal State 
Northridge's efforts to place its athletic program in an established alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hiegert, Northridge's athletic director, said this week that he has 
informally discussed the school's interest in joining the Big West with 
conference commissioner Dennis Farrell on "a couple of occasions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their posture all along has been that expansion is not part of their plans 
unless something drastic happened in terms of their membership," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of UNLV and San Jose might be drastic enough. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons the Big West has been unwilling to accept Northridge is 
that the Matadors play football on the Division I-AA level rather than Division 
I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West qualifies as a Division I-A conference in football, but with the 
loss of UNLV and San Jose, that designation is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Without UNLV and San Jose, the Big West would be left with only four football 
programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Division I-A teams are required by the NCAA to play 70% or more of their 
schedules against like opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The College Football Assn. suggests schools meet that requirement within their 
conference schedule, which would leave the Big West four teams short. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said he believes Northridge and the Big West would be "a good fit." 
</P>
<P>
 He also predicted, "I think the Big West will be looking at expansion a little 
differently at its next executive board meeting in June." MIKE HISERMAN

AGAIN, COUNTY'S TOP SINGLES PLAYER TO MISS OJAI 
</P>

<P>
 For the second consecutive year, the top-ranked senior boys' tennis player in 
Orange County will not be participating in the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament, 
which begins Thursday at various sites in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View's Jakub Pietrowski, who lost in the semifinals of last year's 
Southern Section individual tournament and would have been seeded first or 
second in this year's boys' interscholastic singles draw at Ojai, will not play 
because of obligations he made to his school. Ocean View will be hosting a 
model United Nations Conference this weekend. Pietrowski will hold the fourth 
highest office within the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always enjoyed playing Ojai, but hopefully I'll be able to play CIF to 
complete my senior year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Canyon senior Eric Lin could not play Ojai because of an injury and 
Loara senior Cameran Lindee had to default his first-round match when his high 
school coach did not show up. Lin and Lindee were seeded Nos. 1 and 2 in the 
interscholastic division. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Abrams of Newport Harbor High is top-seeded in the boys' interscholastic 
singles division. Other highly seeded players include North Hollywood 
Harvard-Westlake's Phillip Tseng, Santa Barbara's Nathan Jackmon, El Toro 
senior Johnny France, University senior Jason Meyers and Sunny Hills sophomore 
Kevin Kim, the nation's top-ranked 16-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top-seeded doubles teams in the boys' interscholastic division 
should be Corona del Mar's Jed Weinstein and Tyler Stonebreaker. San Clemente's 
tandem of Daniel Roditi and Jeff Shoemaker will be highly seeded, but their 
chances of winning will depend on the health of Shoemaker, who is nursing a 
sore pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county players who figure to be highly seeded are Joseph Gilbert of 
Sunny Hills in boys' 16, Laura Ruben of Mater Dei and Sarah Hawkins of Newport 
Harbor in the girls' 18 and Faye DeVera of Villa Park in the girls' 16. 
Noticeably absent from the girls' 18 draw for singles are El Modena's Brandi 
Freudenberg, Valencia's Jenny Gonzalez and Newport Harbor's Mara Colaizzi, all 
top-ranked players in Southern California. However, Freudenberg and Gonzalez 
will compete in doubles on different teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The finals of the high school and age-group events will be Saturday at Libbey 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton are competing in the Big West championships 
that run through Sunday.

REALITY VS. SIMULATION; ONLY THING MISSING IN FLIGHT GAME IS NAUSEA

 "Sign here," said Mark Hession, a pilot and veteran of 32 combat missions 
during Desert Storm. "It says I get your car stereo if something happens to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 I signed, releasing Air Combat USA from any liability if I crashed in combat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a marketing ploy of some genius, a group of journalists were going to fly 
real airplanes, then compare the experience to playing Sega of America's newest 
computer game, "Tomcat Alley." I was the lucky pilot from my newspaper to face 
"the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sega, inspired by the Tom Cruise film "Top Gun," sank $1 million into the 
game, which includes live-action film footage of F-14 fighter jets. Forget cute 
computer animation, the company says. This is the real thing, an interactive, 
movie-like gaming experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the day's mission, sponsored by Sega at the Fullerton Airport, 
was to encourage the media to write about the Sega CD game, which became 
available in stores last week for $59.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the single-engine, propeller-driven SIAI Marchetti fighter-trainers 
we were to use were not Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter jets. But my chest cavity 
probably wouldn't have survived a true comparison. I've logged hundreds of 
hours in video arcades and played flying games on my home computer, but a pilot 
I am not. 
</P>
<P>
 Hession told us how to fly in formation, track the enemy with the gun sight, 
do maneuvers known as "yo-yos" -- and how to use a parachute. ("If this D-ring 
doesn't work, bring it back, and we'll give you a new one.") 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not who's more studly," he said. "It's more like a chess match. Or a 
tennis game, where you hit back and forth and wait for someone to make a 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked the logical question: "So how do we avoid crashing into each other?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hession covered his eyes with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he said, "Fun is the No. 1 thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, let me take that back," he said. "Safety. Safety is the No. 1 thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots would sit next to us with override controls just like those in driver 
education cars. They wouldn't let us fly within 500 feet of each other, and 
they wouldn't allow us to shoot while flying straight at each other -- which 
would be like playing chicken at 300 miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 We could shoot each other using buttons on our joysticks, which were wired to 
sensors on the other plane. Whether we hit the target was determined 
electronically. If we succeeded, the sensors would activate a trail of smoke to 
make the experience look realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 I donned a flight suit and found a helmet that fit my head. This was serious 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 My co-pilot was Stephen (Skids) Donnelly, a Navy Tomcat pilot who had flown 
missions over Iraq. He took the plane up and then, with amazing calm, watched 
as I flew on my own into the clouds and above the hills of Palos Verdes and 
Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 My enemy was Ben Kelly, a disc jockey for KKBT radio, 92.3 FM: "The Beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly encouraged me to exhibit pilot bravado. He told me not to worry if I 
pulled so hard on the stick that the plane began to shake and buffet. (As 
Hession had said earlier, "If we call you Jimmy Buffett up there, it's not 
because we like your singing.") 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly was a wise guy, too. He kept offering to read me the tips I had 
written down in my notebook. But I had no problem smoking the enemy when he 
flew into my cross hairs. Pow! Send in the next victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke trailed from Kelly's plane, and Donnelly gave me a "high five." I 
toasted Ben twice, and he got me once. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awesome!" Donnelly shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, are you guys really trying over there?" I yelled into the radio. The 
response was inaudible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next dogfight, Kelly came up behind me, and I couldn't keep his plane 
in view. As he passed me by, I glanced back but then focused my eyes forward as 
if I were driving a car. I broke the cardinal rule: Never lose sight of the 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're on our 6 o'clock," Donnelly said. "Uh-oh. That's not good, Dean." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting shot down was a humbling experience. 
</P>
<P>
 We did a couple of "roll" maneuvers, and I started getting a sinking feeling 
in my stomach. We quit the combat just in time. I spent the last moments of the 
flight concentrating on not throwing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly knew what was going on when I got quiet. He lifted my visor and 
opened the cockpit canopy. "Try to breathe deeply," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the ground, I felt wobbly. My forehead was dripping sweat, and my face 
felt sunburned. We were only up for an hour. Kelly said it felt like three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt elated, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was some good flying," Hession said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You picked it up fast," Donnelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 I beamed. All those hours with the computer joystick paid off. The whole 
mission was recorded on videotape, which was part of the deal. (For $695, you 
too can fly for an hour through Air Combat USA, based in Fullerton.) 
</P>
<P>
 My mission, however, was only half over. I was greeted by a throng of Sega 
people wearing blue Tomcat Alley baseball caps. Now I had to play the computer 
game so I could compare the experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 I got sweaty palms shooting down the enemy on the computer, but I didn't get a 
queasy stomach. Chris Bankston, producer of the game, assured me that he does 
not want people to get nauseated playing Tomcat Alley. "It's like an arcade 
game with a story line that gives you a rush of adrenaline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The film footage of the game merges seamlessly with animations and special 
effects. The speed of the video is about half that of ordinary television, 
which makes the scenes spotty and fuzzy, like a poorly colorized classic movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The game gives a flight officer's view from the cockpit. Peter Loeb, product 
marketing manager, says the game rewards players for thinking quickly -- 
hitting a button that drops a flare within seconds of being hit by an incoming 
missile, for example. You have to react fast with the right maneuver, or your 
plane goes up in smoke. More embarrassing, your wingman or pilot can abort the 
mission because of your inexperience, and then belittle you. 
</P>
<P>
 It took me about 10 attempts to knock out all the MIG fighters in the first 
mission of the game. I never made it to the end of the game, where I was 
supposed to blow up renegade Soviet Col. Alexi Povich's hide-out. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't feel bad, though. Bankston said there are 60 hours of playing time in 
the seven missions, with a million scenarios possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I had to agree with Danny (Dooley) Jackson, a 54-year-old Air 
Combat USA pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too old for this," he said of the computer game. "This is for 
youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jackson, I'll take the real plane any day.

DEREGULATING ELECTRIC POWER; POWERFUL QUESTIONS; CONCERNS RAISED FOR SUPPLIERS 
OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dramatic overhaul proposed Wednesday for California's electric power 
system sparked concern that providers of renewable energy will be priced out of 
the newly deregulated marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade, California has taken major steps toward ensuring that the 
state's three big investor-owned utilities buy a certain portion of their power 
from alternative sources, including power derived from the sun, wind, water and 
subterranean steam. 
</P>
<P>
 But some environmentalists said the plan laid out by the California Public 
Utilities Commission -- in which businesses and consumers would be able to 
choose their own power sources within eight years -- would create a market 
dominated by whatever firms can make electricity most cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 That would hurt renewable energy firms, which are smaller than the major 
utilities and often can't sell their power at as low a price, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unleveling the playing field between renewable systems and 
conventional systems," said David Goldstein, co-director of energy programs for 
the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But PUC Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon noted that under the new proposals, 
Californians would be able to choose renewable energy as their source for 
electricity. He predicted that many would, even if it cost more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people in California would be receptive to that," Conlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said some renewable energy firms, notably those providing wind-based 
power, are increasingly able to sell electricity as cheaply as the big 
utilities, which rely on oil and gas to generate power. 
</P>
<P>
 "These alternative-energy providers need to be cost-competitive, and some of 
them feel they already are," Conlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the PUC does, Goldstein said, it would be unfair for consumers to pay 
more just because they chose to buy renewable power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should people with a conscience pay more for electricity than those that 
don't have one?" he asked. "The whole concept of environmental regulation is 
that these are shared costs, because they benefit everybody" by creating less 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Conlon said he is seeking comments on an option that was not part of the 
formal PUC proposal: placing a surcharge on all Californians' electric bills 
that would subsidize renewable energy firms and keep them in business. Such a 
step would require legislation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil was once the dominant source for California's electric power, but that 
changed after the Middle East oil shocks of the 1970s. State officials 
responded with a unique policy that ultimately required utilities to buy a 
certain portion of their power from alternative sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co., for instance, today buys 16% of the 
electricity it sells from outside renewable power firms; it generates an 
additional 6% from its own renewable efforts, namely hydroelectricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Vikram Budhraja, an Edison vice president for planning and technology, said 
many of Edison's contracts with renewable power suppliers extend past the year 
2010. "We expect them to continue," he said, regardless of the PUC's new 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Budhraja reiterated earlier Edison statements that the utility currently 
has no need to buy additional power from the outside. If Californians get to 
start choosing their own sources of electricity, he added, "our portfolio (of 
alternative energy purchases) would get wound down." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Graff, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, said more competition 
in the utility business, "in the long run, is likely to be positive for both 
the economy and the environment." But he too said alternative energy firms 
"could be at risk in a deregulated" market if consumers opt only for the lowest 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to go to a local grocer and buy a head of lettuce that's free 
of pesticides," Graff said. "But electricity is kind of a generic product. 
You're not getting a better type of electricity from your renewable resource, 
even though you may feel better about how it's generated."

'HAM' ON ROM; DEAL WILL PUT DR. SEUSS BOOKS ON COMPUTER DISCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Audrey Geisel had one requirement for the multitude of multimedia firms vying 
to license her late husband's work over the past year: "That cat had to be that 
cat. Down to the last whisker." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the 72-year-old widow of Theodore Geisel -- known to generations of 
children as Dr. Seuss -- said she had granted the rights to create interactive 
versions of such classics as "The Cat in the Hat," "Green Eggs and Ham" and 
"Horton Hatches the Egg" to Living Books, a joint venture between Geisel's 
longtime publisher, Random House, and Broderbund, the leading publisher of 
children's software. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scramble among multimedia developers to gobble up rights to 
intellectual property for translation to the new medium, the Dr. Seuss books 
were among the most hotly contested. The author's 48 children's books, which 
began in 1937 with "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," are among 
the best-known literary properties ever licensed for multimedia and will 
probably help drive future deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not an easy negotiation," said Random House Chairman Alberto Vitale, 
who had long yearned to turn the Seuss books into CD-ROMs. Terms were not 
disclosed, but a source familiar with the deal said it was "well into the seven 
figures."  
</P>
<P>
 Orchestrated by the ICM talent agency, a parade of software firms including 
Microsoft, Paramount Interactive and Activision trekked out to visit Geisel 
near her La Jolla home last year, armed with personal computers, CD-ROM drives 
and the best multimedia pitch they could muster. 
</P>
<P>
 They found no pushover. Since the author died in 1991, Audrey Geisel, who as 
chief executive of Dr. Seuss Enterprises owns all rights to his work, has been 
a fierce guardian of its artistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worried that the quality would hold up . . . and that it be absolutely 
line-proof to the books," she said. But Geisel said she was never uncertain 
about whether to enter the brave new world of CD-ROM with her husband's 
much-beloved rhymes and illustrations. "This is a new form of communication 
that never existed before. And that was what Ted was all about." 
</P>
<P>
 After producing a prototype, Living Books nearly lost out, despite Geisel's 
desire to honor her husband's 50-year association with Random House. "They had 
a bad hair day, a bad CD-ROM day, who knows," Geisel said. But she gave them a 
second chance and, Geisel said, they came through. 
</P>
<P>
 Living Books come on CD-ROMs, which look like music compact discs except they 
hold text, video and animation in addition to sound. Played on a device hooked 
up to a computer, CD-ROMs hold 400 times the data of a typical computer floppy 
disk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Living Book titles already on the market, such as "Just Grandma and 
Me," each page of the book is displayed on the computer screen. Each character 
has a voice, and when children click on different objects, the objects respond. 
Living Books won't say which Dr. Seuss book it will do first, but the first is 
scheduled to go on sale early next year. Will Dr. Seuss' immortal rhymes be 
altered to suit the children of the Information Age? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the children would say, 'That's not the way it goes,' " Geisel said. 
" 'I meant what I said and I said what I meant . . .' "  
</P>
<P>
 When she couldn't remember the rest, a listener filled in: "An elephant's 
faithful 100 percent." 
</P>
<P>
 "See?" Geisel said. "You don't mess around with that."

DEREGULATING ELECTRIC POWER; POWERFUL QUESTIONS; Q & A: HOW THE PLAN WOULD 
AFFECT RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission's proposal to make sweeping changes 
in the way the state's electricity services are regulated eventually would give 
all industrial and residential customers the power to choose which company they 
want to supply their electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are answers to some key questions about the plan and how it could affect 
utilities, customers and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What exactly did the PUC propose? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The commission laid out a two-pronged plan. First, beginning Jan. 1, 1996, 
large industrial and commercial customers in California would be allowed to buy 
electricity from any source of their choosing, rather than simply from the 
utility company holding a monopoly in their service territory. That option 
would gradually, by 2002, be extended to all business and residential 
customers. Any customer could, of course, continue to tap the utility company 
as its source. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the state would shift away from traditional formulas that have tied 
electric rates to utilities' costs for power plants and other expenses. Under 
that approach, major investor-owned utilities have been able to recover costs 
by raising rates, even if the power-generating facilities have proven 
uneconomical, as was the case with Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diablo Canyon 
nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new method, known as a performance-based approach, utilities would be 
rewarded for more efficient operations, management and investments. To the 
extent that a utility could reduce costs below an established target, it could 
divide any savings between ratepayers and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did the PUC propose these steps? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The goal is to reduce the state's electricity prices -- which generally run 
50% higher than the national average -- by fostering competition. Lower rates 
would make California more attractive to businesses and therefore help create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would the plan work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: PG&E, Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. would 
be required to open their transmission lines -- for a fee -- to companies 
seeking to sell electricity. Customers could choose any provider, but at least 
during a transition period, they would still be obligated to cover certain 
costs incurred by the utilities under the previous regulatory formulas. 
Utilities should not be forced to absorb those costs, the PUC said, since the 
plants were built under an earlier system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who would stand to benefit most? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Utilities could benefit by competing without many of the previous 
regulatory restraints. For example, the current process of setting rates for 
large customers can stretch to 18 months. The new performance-based formula 
would put an end to that. Furthermore, utilities' shareholders would be 
insulated from most risk, particularly with regard to expensive nuclear power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Large industrial customers could gain by having the option of shopping around 
for better rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about small customers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some consumer advocates fear the PUC proposal would leave small business 
and residential customers out in the cold by letting the utilities compete 
without risk. Performance-based regulation, they say, would allow utilities 
higher profits with less regulatory scrutiny. Also, they would have control 
over transmission lines and would tend to favor themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC said one of its chief goals is to protect residential customers by 
ensuring that utilities will pass on any savings from increased efficiencies to 
small ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When would the changes take effect? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Nothing has been formally decided. The PUC has asked interested parties to 
respond in writing by May 20. On June 14, it will hold its first public hearing 
on the proposal in Los Angeles. After that, it will determine whether other 
hearings are necessary before it adopts a final policy, probably in August. 
Customers would probably not see any effects until at least 1996. The End of 
the Electric Monopolies 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission has proposed an unprecedented 
deregulation of the electric utility business. Over the next eight years, all 
customers of Southern California Edison Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San 
Diego Gas & Electric Co. would be freed to buy electricity from the supplier of 
their choice, just as they are free now to select a long-distance telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW DEREGULATION WOULD WORK 
</P>
<P>
 Under the PUC's plan, a range of power suppliers -- from the existing local 
utility to out-of-town utilities to upstart independent producers -- will 
compete to sell electricity to power customers. The local utility's existing 
transmission system -- including existing power lines to homes and businesses 
-- will deliver the power to the end user. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PUC'S PROPOSED TIMETABLE 
</P>
<P>
 Deregulation would be phased in over six years. 
</P>
<P>
 1996: Large industrial customers can buy electric power from any producer. 
1998: Deregulation extends to smaller industrial customers 1999: Deregulation 
extends to commercial customers, including small business 2002: All California 
customers, including residential ratepayers, may choose power supplier of their 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 IMPACT ON KEY PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 Customers: The PUC says the freedom to shop North America for electric power 
would lower rates for all categories of consumers. But a transition fee 
covering the costs of big past investments by the utilities -- notably for 
nuclear plants -- will be tacked onto bills, trimming the savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilities: They win in two ways. The commission endorsed in concept their 
proposal to switch from traditional rate-making to a method that allows 
utilities to pass on savings from efficiency gains to shareholders and 
ratepayers. And the transition fee would make ratepayers -- not shareholders -- 
shoulder the costs of retiring old investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists/Alternative energy producers: They are unhappy with the plan 
to eliminate utility set-asides guaranteeing business for suppliers of 
environmentally benign power. Consumers still would be able to buy power from 
such sources, but the sources might not be competitive.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: INTERNET USERS! READ NOW TO LEARN OF UNIQUE 
OPPORTUNITY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The citizens of cyberspace are shocked! Outraged! Appalled! Barbarians have 
breached The Net and that could mean The End of Civilization as They Know It. 
The horror, the horror . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalierly exploiting the laid-back, laissez-faire culture of the Internet, an 
Arizona law firm earned the enmity of the entire cyberspace community by 
broadcasting an unsolicited electronic mail advertisement to more than 5,000 
Usenet groups, which are basically electronic bulletin boards for subjects 
ranging from the Postal Service to pet birds. The firm was trolling for green 
card applicants in need of legal help.  
</P>
<P>
 That only a fraction of the vast Internet audience would be interested in this 
message was beside the point. Given that through the vagaries of Internet 
pricing, the advertisement could reach millions at the cost of mere pennies, 
the lawyers got a heck of a direct-mail buy. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a culture where commerce is supposed to be an act between consenting 
adults and not a trespass into personal conversations, the Internet community 
-- the prototype of tomorrow's interactive masses -- viewed the green card ad 
as the sort of boorish, unsanitary act one associates with tinkling in a public 
pool or passing gas in a crowded elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm undeniably got some business. However, thousands of Usenet 
participants sent angry e-mail to the lawyers, condemning the intrusion. For 
its premeditated violations of Internet protocol, the law firm was disconnected 
from the Net. Naturally, the law firm threatened to sue to get back on. America 
is truly a great country. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times reports that the lawyer responsible for the green card ad 
is unrepentant and quotes him as saying, "We will definitely advertise on the 
Internet again."  
</P>
<P>
 Now, this conflict has been portrayed as a clash between the commercial values 
of ruthless entrepreneurs and the "information wants to be free" 
Twinkies-and-Jolt-Cola values of the hackers. That's nonsense.  
</P>
<P>
 This clash isn't even about the future of "netiquette" or why it's a pity 
that, in cyberspace, it's so easy for jerks to express themselves on a global 
scale. No, this is really a story about what kind of networks we want, who gets 
to have access and why. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we certainly don't allow the telemarketers and obscene phone callers to 
determine how we use our phone system. Do we really want to allow the excesses 
of the exploiters and the parasites to define the dimensions of our computer 
network interactions? Or does it perhaps make more sense to design networks 
that can profitably coexist as both marketplaces and communities? 
</P>
<P>
 The green card tale merely confirms what we all know: We need public networks 
that neither subsidize bad behavior nor penalize people who are going about 
minding their own business. Networks must respect the boundaries of personal 
privacy while offering the potential for reaching out to those unknown.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, that's not nearly as difficult as it sounds. For example, there's 
a simple way to handle pseudo-entrepreneurial law firms that want to turn the 
Internet into the world's largest direct e-mail medium: Create the equivalent 
of e-mail stamps and charge people a per-message fee. The discipline of a 
pricing mechanism would go a long way toward preventing a recurrence of the 
excesses of the green card ad. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another market mechanism that offers even greater potential for 
striking a better communications balance. Every Internet message that is sent 
out has a "header" that describes something about its origin: who is sending 
it, where it's from and so on. It would be a straightforward matter of simple 
programming to make the header do a little more work. For example, instead of 
simply listing name and origin, headers could also list whether the message is 
solicited or unsolicited; it could mention whether the message is commercial or 
private. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients could then program their mailboxes to screen out unsolicited 
commercial messages or even seek out commercial messages on topics they're 
interested in -- say, how to get a green card. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, what you'd have is a thriving market in software filters, screens 
and agents to get the information you want and get rid of the messages you want 
to avoid. In many corporations today, individuals use "bozo filters" to screen 
out e-mail from unwanted senders. And Usenet users can use a "kill" feature to 
block out postings from any e-mail address. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Usenet groups and individuals who wanted to get commercial solicitations 
could design filters that let those queries in; bulletin boards that didn't 
want ads could easily block them out. (The design of software agents and 
screens is one of the hottest areas of computerdom.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this system requires people who send messages to accurately 
describe them in the header. In other words, it requires truth in labeling. 
Now, you couldn't imagine a lawyer improperly or inaccurately labeling a 
network solicitation, could you? That would be unethical. In the future, it 
should also be illegal. Fine the abusers and kick them off the Net. Think of it 
as the Information Age counterpart to mail fraud. 
</P>

 The Internet may well be the most fertile development and testing ground for 
the development of software agents and filters for the future. This kind of 
experimentation should be encouraged. You can be sure that these kinds of 
filters and agents will eventually find their way onto tomorrow's interactive 
cable networks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of treating the green card episode as the end of the open Internet 
era, let's use it as the opportunity to build a network infrastructure that 
gives people the power to create new choices in a new marketplace of messages.

 American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it earned $1.09 billion in the first 
three months of the year as its revenue rose 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications and computer conglomerate said the revenue growth 
reflected a modest increase from long-distance telephone service as well as 
double-digit percentage gains from sales of equipment and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's profit amounted to 80 cents a share for the three months ended March 31 
and contrasted with a loss a year earlier of $6.83 billion, or $5.07 a share, 
when its results were reduced by huge onetime charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the charge a year ago, its latest profit was up 17% from income of 
$936 million, or 69 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1993. Revenue for 
the quarter rose to $16.56 billion from $15.72 billion a year ago.

WILLIE BROWN TO INTRODUCE TAX CREDIT BILL FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. said Wednesday that he will introduce a 
tax credit bill, probably next week, designed to make California more friendly 
to business and to persuade such companies as Taco Bell Corp. to remain in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would provide, among other inducements, a 6% investment tax credit 
for companies locating or expanding their headquarters in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which is expected to decide any day whether it will stay in Orange 
County or move its headquarters and 1,000 jobs to Texas, supported the San 
Francisco Democrat's effort. Spokeswoman Janis Smith said such legislation will 
help business, speed the state's economic recovery and "influence our 
relocation decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's effort came too late for Thrifty Drug Stores, which said Wednesday 
that its merger with the PayLess drugstore chain will result in its 
headquarters moving to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's bill stems from the February, 1993, Economic Summit, a two-day hearing 
at which corporate executives, employees and business professors told 
legislators that California was unfriendly to business and needed to change 
laws before it lost major taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's aides said the bill was legislation he intended to introduce at some 
point but was speeded up by the threatened departures of Taco Bell and Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would, among other things: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow companies to accumulate tax credits during a five-year period starting 
this year and deduct 6% from their taxes for the next 15 years until the tax 
credits are used up. The credits would come from the costs of property for a 
headquarters site, construction costs, computer and other office equipment 
costs and new employees' wages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require that companies grow at least 1% and maintain that level for at least 
five years to obtain and use tax credits. It also sets thresholds by requiring 
a corporate headquarters to have at least 500 employees to start, a national 
headquarters to have 200 employees and a regional headquarters to have 100 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Waive residency requirements at University of California and California 
State University systems for employees who are transferred from out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that we want to keep the jobs we have and create more growth by 
having the companies make a commitment to stay here and increase their employee 
base," said Leslie Medina, Brown's chief consultant on the proposed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the guarantee to California that it will be repaid," she said. "The 
state then will use other taxes, like increased sales taxes and income taxes, 
to help offset the tax credits." 
</P>
<P>
 While the bill applies to large operations only, it would help those in all 
three categories that are expanding their employee bases or building new 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is likely to have bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having the Speaker carry it guarantees a fair degree of success in 
the Assembly," said Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach). "I can't imagine 
there will be any opposition to strengthening the economic climate in 
California."

INTEREST RATES PUT CLOUD OVER JUMP IN HOUSING STARTS; ECONOMY: GOOD WEATHER 
BOOSTS ANNUAL RATE TO 1.47 MILLION NEW HOMES. ANALYSTS SAY FED HIKES HELD DOWN 
FIGURE.

<P>
 Housing construction rebounded 12.1% in March from a winter slump, but 
builders said they fear sales may be threatened by rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Assn. of Home Builders, said 
a late-March/early-April survey of 455 members found many expressing concern 
over the increased cost of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, builders are aware of how important rates are to their 
businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After spiking to a 1.61-million annual rate in December, housing starts 
plunged 21.2% in January, to 1.27 million, because of the harsh winter. 
Continued inclement weather held the rebound in February to just a 3.4% gain, 
at 1.31 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But with arrival of more temperate weather in March, starts jumped 12.1% to a 
1.47-million annual rate, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was even 
higher than the 1.41-million rate many analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Every region in the nation posted gains, led by a 30.4% jump in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, the 30.4% jump in the Midwest pushed starts to a 330,000 annual 
rate, the highest since a 353,000 rate in the final month of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Starts were up 8.7% in the West to a 375,000 rate; 8.4% in the Northeast to 
142,000 and 7% in the South to 626,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (interest) rates had not gone up, March would have been even better," 
Seiders said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., mortgage 
interest rates averaged 7.75% in March, up from 7.14% a month earlier. They hit 
8.47% two weeks ago but dipped back to 8.26% last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen expressed concern Tuesday over higher 
long-term interest rates, which he contended could curb overall economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that the Federal Reserve 
Board's recent boosts in short-term interest rates were anticipated and are 
unlikely to derail the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "I don't see the justification for the increase in long-term 
rates. . . . As the markets stabilize, hopefully, long-term rates will drop 
down to a more normal level." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert R. Davis, an economist with Savings & Community Bankers of America, 
agreed that higher mortgage rates "will have a moderating effect on demand" for 
new houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that could be offset in the near term by potential home buyers 
accelerating their purchases out of fear of further increases in mortgage 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiders now is forecasting 1.39 million starts this year, down from 1.43 
million in January, and is "poised to make another forecast cut if the 
financial markets do not settle down." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that would be more than the 1.29 million starts in 1993. Starts during 
the first three months of the year are already 20.6% above those of the same 
period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future activity, rose 
5.1% in March to a 1.31-million rate after falling for two straight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of single-family homes shot up 11.3% in March to a 1.25-million 
annual rate after a 0.4% loss a month earlier. It was the highest level since a 
1.38-million rate in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment construction also rose, climbing 16.5% to a 226,000 rate, after 
jumping 32.9% the previous month. It was the highest level since December, when 
multifamily starts hit a 229,000 rate. Housing Starts

QUAKE LEADS 20TH CENTURY TO POST $256.1-MILLION LOSS; INSURANCE: THE HIT WILL 
WIPE OUT A THIRD OF THE COMPANY'S SURPLUS, LEAVING IT IN SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKER 
CONDITION. 
</P>

 Devastated by earthquake insurance claims, 20th Century Industries on 
Wednesday reported a first-quarter loss of $256.1 million, which wiped out more 
than a third of its surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the quake, far greater than 20th Century's earlier estimates, 
leaves the Woodland Hills-based insurance holding company in substantially 
weaker financial condition. On Tuesday, even before the loss was reported, a 
major financial rating agency downgraded 20th Century's claims-paying ability. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century said in a statement that it now expects total gross claim costs 
from the Jan. 17 quake to reach $475 million. After taxes, reinsurance and 
other adjustments, the net charge against first-quarter earnings is $269.5 
million, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, for the quarter ended March 31, nearly matched 20th Century's $277.6 
million in revenue for the period.  
</P>
<P>
 The news came after the market closed. The firm's stock added 25 cents to 
$18.50 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Corp. on Tuesday cut its ratings on 20th Century's two 
insurance units to A (good) from AA (excellent), citing a much smaller expected 
charge: $161.7 million. The insurers remain on the ratings agency's CreditWatch 
list.  
</P>
<P>
 The loss, $4.98 per share, caused stockholders' equity -- roughly equivalent 
to surplus -- to fall to $412.2 million at the end of the quarter, from $655.2 
million at year-end 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the extent of damage to many structures can only be discovered through 
engineering inspections, estimates for all insurance companies have been 
leapfrogging upward in the three months since the 6.8 temblor.  
</P>
<P>
 20th Century first projected gross quake costs of $160 million, then last 
month doubled the estimate to $325 million. As of Monday, 20th Century said it 
had received 31,000 homeowner and condominium claims and 9,000 automobile 
claims, resulting in the latest estimate of $475 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside contracting firms that specialize in catastrophe work have told 20th 
Century that the damage they are seeing is unprecedented, a company spokesman 
said.

 Allstate Raises Quake Estimate to $950 Million: The insurer said its estimate 
of Northridge earthquake insurance claims is now $950 million instead of $600 
million, citing hidden damage from the Jan. 17 quake and aftershocks.Allstate 
predicted higher costs per claim, "resulting primarily from engineering reports 
which revealed previously unreported hidden damage to dwellings." The company 
expects about 40,000 claims. Other large insurers have also raised their 
estimates. The industry's official estimate for total insured damage is $4.5 
billion.

DERIVATIVES LIMIT FOR BANKS NOW CONSIDERED; INVESTING: CHIEF REGULATOR, WHO HAD 
SAID THE HIGH-RISK SPECULATIONS WERE NO THREAT TO THE INDUSTRY, DOES AN 
ABOUT-FACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene B. Ludwig said 
Wednesday he is considering placing strict limits on the ability of national 
banks to speculate in "exotic and complex " derivative instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-risk financial speculations -- which are resulting in big trading 
losses for major corporations such as Cargill Inc., Procter & Gamble and Kidder 
Peabody & Co. -- could be especially dangerous for banks, the nation's chief 
bank regulator warned in a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks can be involved two ways in the market for derivatives: speculating 
themselves or, for six of the biggest banks, creating the complex financial 
packages for sale to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week ago, Ludwig and other bank regulators indicated they were keeping 
a close watch on the complex financial instruments but saw no immediate threat 
to the nation's banks. 
</P>
<P>
 But his warning Wednesday in a speech to the Exchequer Club marked a 
significant change: the first time a top government official said speculation 
in derivatives might be placed off-limits for banks whose deposits are 
protected by federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at whether we should place capital or risk limits on (banks') 
proprietary trading activities and whether some other type of regulatory 
response is appropriate," Ludwig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major banks, including Citicorp, Bankers Trust and Chemical, are large 
dealers in derivatives, earning substantial fees for finding customers who want 
to speculate on or hedge against the future performance of commodities markets 
and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks, along with other investors, have long used "plain vanilla" derivatives, 
such as futures and options contracts, whose values are derived from changes in 
interest rates and foreign currency values. Such securities, which require 
relatively little money down, allow investors to hedge against sharp moves in 
financial markets by granting the owner the right to buy or sell securities at 
set prices in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the explosion in ever-more-complex derivative contracts over the past two 
years has raised questions about their use in raw speculation, the severity of 
players' potential losses if markets react in unforeseen ways, and the ability 
of parties on the other side of the transactions to honor promises to buy or 
sell the designated investment if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig said he asked one of his staff experts in October about financial 
derivatives and was offered a list of 900 products. They had "such interesting 
names as 'harmful warrants' and 'worthless warrants,' 'death backed-bonds,' 
'limbos' and 'heaven-and-hell bonds' -- descriptions obviously designed to 
inspire confidence," he said in a wry tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, the tally of derivative instruments "has expanded by at least 
one-third," Ludwig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks can be winners and losers at the same time, earning fees as packagers 
and sellers of derivatives to others, but taking big hits on trading for their 
own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust, Chemical and Citicorp all reported Tuesday that they had 
suffered big declines in their trading revenues in the first quarter. On 
Wednesday, Chemical acknowledged that derivatives contributed to its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig said he will issue 20 pages of "guidance" to bankers next week, 
covering such topics as "the duties of senior management and the board of 
directors for oversight of derivative activities" and the monitoring of risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in the comptroller's office said the speech Wednesday did not 
represent a response to recent losses in the corporate world, but rather 
Ludwig's decision to deliver a definitive statement of his concerns after much 
research and preparation. Ludwig said his remarks were a yellow flag, not 
necessarily the precursor of a ban.

EARNINGS: BOFA PROFIT UP 6% WITH HIKE IN LOANS AND CREDIT QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BankAmerica Corp. on Wednesday said improving credit quality, cost savings and 
increase in loans boosted profit 6% in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's second-largest bank earned $513 million, or $1.27 a share, for 
the first three months of 1994. It had net income of $484 million, or $1.19 a 
share, for the same period of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based BankAmerica said a decline in soured loans enabled it to 
lower its loan-loss provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled assets totaled $2.49 billion during the quarter, down 13% from $2.89 
billion in the fourth quarter of 1993 and down 50% from $5.03 billion a year 
ago.

FCC SETS AUCTION FOR NEW BROADCAST, PAGING LICENSES; TECHNOLOGY: SUMMER BIDDING 
MAY TRANSFORM HOW AMERICANS COMMUNICATE, WATCH TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clearing the way for the first government auctions of licenses for advanced 
new telecommunications services, the Federal Communications Commission on 
Wednesday gave final approval to new broadcast and paging technologies that 
promise to transform the way many Americans communicate and watch television. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC voted unanimously to auction 10 nationwide and 3,543 local and 
regional licenses for so-called narrow-band personal communications service, a 
wireless technology that offers two-way paging and data transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC also approved auctions for about 1,450 licenses for interactive video 
and data service, or IVDS, that will allow viewers to respond to broadcast and 
cable programming. The auctions will take place this summer, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both technologies are forerunners of more advanced offerings expected next 
year: broad-band PCS, a cellular phone competitor that will offer two-way voice 
and data services through wireless transceivers that will eventually be as 
portable and unobtrusive as a wristwatch, and multipoint distribution service, 
a cellular-style video service that can provide interactive TV, data 
transmission and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wednesday's vote, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said the agency "is jump 
starting a competitive industry in interactivity and mobile telephony." By 
having auctions, Hundt added, "we will attract people who want the business and 
make sure consumers have . . . a real choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's green light is significant because narrow-band PCS and IVDS would be 
the first FCC licenses to be auctioned to private companies under a Clinton 
Administration plan that is expected to raise $7 billion to $10 billion over 
the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrow-band PCS will improve on today's pagers by being smaller and more 
powerful and by allowing the devices to acknowledge electronically that a 
message has been received. PCS pagers will also be able to send and receive 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 TV, too, will gain flexibility with IVDS which uses radio waves and satellites 
to provide an electronic return path that viewers can use to respond to what 
they watch on television. The system, which will connect to TVs through a 
set-top box and display on-screen icons to prompt viewers, is a rudimentary but 
low cost way to provide interactive communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can make a wireless drop into a household for $1.35, and neither PCS or 
cable is that cheap to install; that makes us an attractive partner" for those 
seeking to provide interactive services, said R. Michael Sheridan, president of 
EON Corp., a leading Reston, Va.-based interactive TV company. 
</P>
<P>
 EON will likely be among hundreds of others -- ranging from computer giant IBM 
to the NBC television network -- that have expressed interest in offering PCS 
or interactive TV services. For months, say experts, scores of the hopeful have 
been conducting mock competitions to hone their bidding skills for the 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the anticipation over auctions, there has been some grumbling about 
the timing, with some complaining that PCS has been delayed so long that 
cellular phones, which have begun bundling pagers into one device, have 
overcome their technological shortcomings.

 Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported a first-quarter loss of $40 million, 
blaming depressed prices for crude oil and chemicals. 
</P>

 The loss, the equivalent of 19 cents per share, compared to a profit of $80 
million, or 25 cents per share, during the first quarter of 1993. Sales fell

 Earnings from the Los Angeles company's oil and gas division fell from $53

 Coca-Cola to Introduce New Soft Drink: The company said it will market an 
orange-flavored soda called OK that will be aimed at young males.Sergio Zyman, 
Coca-Cola Co.'s senior vice president and chief marketing officer, told a news 
conference that the orange-brown colored soda is aimed at 12- to 25-year-olds, 
particularly young men. "There is a latent demand for new brands that represent 
values of today's youth, especially young males," he said. Zyman declined to 
release further details about the product, saying Coca-Cola made the 
announcement out of fear of a news leak about the new product. The 
Atlanta-based company said the new product will go on sale within 30 days in 
150 countries.

INDUSTRIALS FALL AMID WORRIES OVER ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A steep drop in industrial issues and other economy-sensitive stocks produced 
another depressing day on Wall Street on Wednesday, despite rallies in the bond 
market and utility shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials, off more than 40 points at midday, closed with a loss of 
21.11 points at 3,598.71 -- just above the 1994 low of 3,593.35 reached April 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Dow's decline was blamed on a plunge in industrial bellwether 
Caterpillar, which sank 4 7/8 to 103 1/2 even though the company reported 
strong quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar was one of many heavy-industry stocks that suffered frenzied 
selling Wednesday. Traders said investors suddenly decided that this year's 
rise in short-term interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve Board may 
slow the economy enough to significantly crimp industrial firms' profits later 
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They finally woke up to the Fed's tightening" and the implications, said Jon 
Groveman, president of brokerage Ladenburg Thalmann in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Many technology stocks were also lower, pulling the Nasdaq composite index of 
mostly smaller stocks down 7.33 points to 705.52. That index now has lost 12.2% 
from its peak earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers topped winners by 14 to 8 on the New York Stock 
Exchange and by 18 to 10 on Nasdaq. NYSE trading volume surged to 366.6 million 
shares. Surprisingly, broader market indexes showed relatively little damage. 
The blue chip Standard & Poor's 500 index, for example, eased just 0.58 point 
to 441.96. 
</P>
<P>
 The S&P was helped as utility stocks and some other interest-rate-sensitive 
issues rallied for a second day, as bond yields continued to ease. The yield on 
the Treasury's 30-year bond slipped to 7.31% from 7.37% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, even as investors sold industrial stocks, they flocked to consumer 
products stocks and other classic "defensive" issues that tend to hold their 
value better when the economy weakens. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues slumping badly included Clark Equipment, down 5 3/8 to 58; 
Tenneco, down 2 7/8 to 49 3/4; Deere, off 4 7/8 to 75 5/8; Eaton, off 4 to 50; 
Chrysler, down 2 1/2 to 46; Ford, off 2 to 54 3/8, and Briggs & Stratton, off 3 
3/8 to 81 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech arena, Lotus Development tumbled 7 7/8 to 56 3/4 after its 
quarterly report showed slower-than-expected sales growth. Other tech losers 
included Cabletron Systems, down 2 3/8 to 95 1/8; IBM, off 1 1/8 to 52 1/4, and 
Cirrus Logic, off 3 3/8 to 29 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But earnings reports boosted AT&T 1 1/2 to 52 1/8, Compaq 3 1/8 to 101 7/8 and 
DSC Communications 2 1/8 to 55 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow utility index surged 4.08 points or 2.1% to 199.64 as battered 
electric utilities continued to rebound. Baby Bell shares also rose, including 
Bell Atlantic, up 2 3/8 to 53 5/8; BellSouth, up 2 1/2 to 62, and Ameritech, up 
1 3/4 to 41 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, Torrance-based environmental firm International 
Technology leaped 3/4 to 3 1/8 after a Texas jury awarded it $84 million in a 
breach-of-contract suit related to Superfund cleanup site.  
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo shares slumped, with the Nikkei index losing 310.16 points to 19,882.18. 
London's FTSE-100 index fell 29.7 points to 3,098.3, while Frankfurt's DAX 
index edged up 10.22 points to 2,182.64. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar slumped against European currencies even though Germany's central 
bank allowed another small drop in short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, May crude oil futures on the New York Merc gained 33 cents to 
$16.82 per barrel, the highest since November. Gold futures added 70 cents to 
$372.20.

BATTERED BOLSA TAKES YET ANOTHER POUNDING; MEXICO: CENTRAL BANK'S RATE HIKE 
DELIVERS NEW BLOW TO LATIN AMERICA'S LARGEST STOCK MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a tough year for the Mexican stock market, and it's getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Battered by the Chiapas rebellion, the kidnaping of a prominent banker and the 
assassination of the country's leading presidential candidate, the market's 
Bolsa index has plunged more than 30% in dollar terms since Jan. 1, more than 
any major international exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the impact of another factor in the market's slide was evident. 
The Bolsa fell 5.2%, or 107.44 points, to 1,957.33 after the Mexican central 
bank announced that the interest rate on Mexico's bellwether 28-day Cetes, or 
treasury bill, soared 3.42 percentage points to 18% at the weekly auction, the 
highest level since November, 1992, and up from 8.8% just two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank has been lifting its treasury bill rates since late February 
to stem a massive flight of jittery investors from Mexico, an exodus spurred in 
part by the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Even analysts who see the higher rates as a short-term phenomenon said 
Wednesday that they fear Mexico is running a big risk in raising rates so high. 
If prolonged, the high rates could reignite inflation, peso instability and the 
financial turmoil that laid waste to Mexico's economy in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Others such as Nora Lustig, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, say 
the chances of renewed hyper-inflation are low because of Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's fiscal reforms. She insisted, as did others, that 
the spike upward is due as much to the recent rise in U.S. interest rates as 
internal events in Mexico. The U.S. interest rate hikes have also fueled a 
slide in the U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, uncertainty and turmoil are bound to prevail in the Mexican 
market -- Latin America's largest -- until the presidential election in August 
and the new leader lays out the nation's course for the next six years, said 
Jonathan Heath, chief economist at Macro Asesoria Economica, a Mexico 
City-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, foreign investors will remain fearful of further trauma, such as a 
recurrence of peso devaluations that historically have coincided with Mexican 
elections, Heath said. Investors are also trying to make sense of a murky 
political situation marked by Colosio's assassination and the peasant uprising 
in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fundamentally, there is no reason for what is happening, this deterioration 
in the stock market. So what we may have is an unfortunate case of a 
pessimistic self-fulfilling prophecy," said Abel Beltran del Rio, president of 
Cie mex-Wefa, a think tank in Philadelphia that follows the Mexican economy. 
</P>
<P>
 By making the treasury investments more attractive, the Mexican government 
hopes to compensate foreign investors for their fears about Mexico's future. 
"The Banco de Mexico (central bank) is just giving foreign investors a better 
option," a Mexico City securities analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltran del Rio estimated the outflow of foreign capital at $6 billion since 
the Colosio assassination. One foreign investor who has already headed for the 
border is Gilman C. Gunn, senior manager of Keystone Fund for the Americas. 
Gunn reduced his fund's Mexico holdings to 5% from as much as 35% at the end of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A continued drain of foreign capital would hurt Mexico because outside funds 
are critical to its internal growth. An exodus of foreign capital would also 
mean a huge sell-off of pesos. Part of Salinas' economic strategy has been to 
keep the peso within a certain range of the dollar to ensure foreign investors 
of stability.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; AIRLINES DISMAYED OVER 
'BACK-TO-BACK TICKETING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As anyone who flies frequently on business can tell you, the cost of a full 
business-class ticket can far exceed what the leisure traveler in the next seat 
over paid. This has been a source of irritation for business travelers as long 
as there have been differences in fare rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines, which depend on business travelers as their bread and butter, 
created the discount tickets to attract leisure travelers and build traffic 
volume. To do that, they built in certain restrictions, such as advance-notice 
and minimum-stay requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 But the discrepancy between the two classes of fares has created a practice 
known as "back-to-back ticketing," in which customers buy two staggered 
round-trip tickets to take advantage of discount prices. Up to 20% of business 
travel is ticketed this way, estimates John Fazio, vice president of the 
National Business Travel Assn., even though in many cases it is specifically 
prohibited by airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this, many travelers won't admit they do it. Similarly, many travel 
agents and corporate travel planners, fearful of repercussions from airlines, 
won't acknowledge making such ticketing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, back-to-back ticketing has been a longstanding conflict between 
airlines and travel arrangers. In the past year, however, the American Society 
of Travel Agents has been lobbying airlines to change their practices, and some 
airlines are beginning to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a touchy area for the airlines because they don't want to antagonize 
their customers," said Tim Neale, spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., a 
Washington-based trade group representing the airline industry.  
</P>
<P>
 "What bothers the airlines about it is they lose revenue," said Don Garvett of 
New York-based SH&E, an airline industry consulting firm. "On the other hand, 
it is a difficult practice to prevent and creates ill will." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works. Say you have a business trip that requires you to fly 
from Los Angeles to New York on Wednesday, May 18, returning on Friday, May 20. 
You don't qualify for the minimum stay required to get a discounted ticket; 
therefore, you pay full fare, which is $1,000.  
</P>
<P>
 However, let's say the airline is offering a special 60% discount if you stay 
over a Saturday night. So instead of buying one round-trip ticket as described 
above, you buy two round-trip tickets for $400 each, for a total of $800, thus 
saving $200. 
</P>
<P>
 The first ticket is a round-trip departing from Los Angeles on May 18 and 
returning June 3. The second is a round-trip ticket departing from New York on 
May 20 and returning June 1. You can use the first half of each ticket to 
complete your trip and throw away the second halves, or if you plan carefully 
enough, use the second half of each ticket for future travel.  
</P>
<P>
 Airlines' responses to the practice vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska, America West, American, Northwest, TWA and USAir all have language in 
their tariff rules prohibiting the use of "two or more tickets" issued at 
round-trip fares for the purpose of circumventing minimum-stay requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put it simply, we don't like it," said John Austin, a spokesman for 
Northwest Airlines. "And when we find it's going on, we have confiscated 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 The airline has also audited travel agencies suspected of issuing back-to-back 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither United nor Continental has specific language in its tariff rules, but 
spokesmen for both airlines said they discourage the practice and reserve the 
right to charge full fares for people found in violation of the Saturday night 
stay requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta used to have language prohibiting back-to-back ticketing, but it removed 
it last year after discussions with the American Society of Travel Agents and 
its own consumer groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines has gone one step further. It doesn't prohibit back-to-back 
tickets and no longer requires a Saturday night stay.  
</P>
<P>
 Some airlines, such as Continental, have increased their computerized 
monitoring of ticketing arrangements to try to detect back-to-back tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are caught using such a ticket, Continental will deny you boarding, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are unresolved legal issues on both sides. Some travelers argue that 
once they've paid for a ticket, it's their right to use it or not use it. "It's 
like if you buy the special at a restaurant but you don't eat the dessert," 
airline consultant Garvett said. "Does that mean you shouldn't have been 
allowed to order the special?" 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, however, when you buy an airline ticket, you've entered into a 
contract and must abide by its terms, he said. The rules are not published on 
individual tickets but are laid out in each airline's tariff regulations.  
</P>
<P>
 As airlines have begun trying to police tickets more thoroughly, travelers 
have gotten more creative in purchasing their tickets. For example, some 
travelers use different names on the tickets to avoid being flagged by the 
computer, Garvett said. Others buy their tickets at two different agencies when 
making back-to-back arrangements. Still others purchase each leg of the trip on 
a different airline.

 I arrive at the airport at least one hour before my flight is to depart.During 
this hour, I check in and relax by reading the Los Angeles Times or local 
newspaper and enjoying a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 By checking in early, I have been able to change to aisle seats (from middle 
seats), and I have been able to fly on first class (with coach-class tickets) 
simply by asking the airline attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving early to the airport allows me to avoid the stress of last-minute 
hassles such as having to walk through the metal detector machine two or three 
times because of accessories I forgot I am carrying, and worrying that I will 
miss the flight as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 I gain peace of mind by not feeling rushed and am able to get in the airplane 
feeling relaxed. I know it is not always possible for every business traveler 
to be early for a flight. I think, however, that we sometimes stretch our 
business day longer than necessary; we think that we will have plenty of time 
to catch our next flight, only to find ourselves later in a mad rush to get to 
the airport and to our flight, creating for ourselves unnecessary stress. 
</P>
<P>
 We have seen people at airports running wildly, hearts pounding, legs pumping, 
luggage in tow, trying to get to a flight at the last minute. I don't want to 
be that person, because it does not look like fun. I want to enjoy my short 
stays at airports.

BRIEFING BOOK / JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; PAKISTAN'S LEADERS 
STILL NEED TO TAKE TOUGH ECONOMIC STEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG

<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: After a year of political tumult mixed with near-economic paralysis, a 
dearth of hard cash in state coffers and a drop in exports linked to floods and 
disease, 1994 in Pakistan looks far rosier. But skeptics wonder if Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto dares court the anger of voters and powerful interests 
by implementing more tough measures needed to transform Pakistan's economic 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: In February, the International Monetary Fund approved a 
$1.4-billion facility for credit to Pakistan, and a few days later, individual 
donor nations pledged $2.5 billion in grants and low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for Bhutto, who was elected in October, is one reason Western nations 
are again flocking to assist Pakistan. (The United States is not among them, 
because of Pakistan's nuclear program.) Another reason is the reformist line 
laid down by Moeen Qureshi, an erstwhile World Bank and IMF official who served 
as caretaker premier from last July until the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Not having to worry about pleasing either the citizenry or parties, Qureshi 
took harsh but long-overdue measures such as increasing prices for gasoline, 
electricity and wheat and depreciating Pakistan's overvalued rupee. 
</P>
<P>
 On a much smaller scale, Pakistan's economy suffers from many of the same 
maladies as India's. Protected by high tariff barriers, many industries are 
lazy and non-competitive. There is a surfeit of regulation and graft. 
</P>
<P>
 Birth and illiteracy rates are among the world's highest. Workers in textile 
plants are unqualified to use state-of-the-art machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: The 40-year-old Bhutto has embraced Qureshi's policies on 
liberalization, privatization and decentralization. Her Cabinet is drafting 
Pakistan's eighth Five-Year Plan, which reportedly is being finalized.  
</P>
<P>
 "What has to be done is to keep things going, to keep the (government) budget 
under control, keep monetary policy strict and implement structural changes," 
one foreign economist involved in assistance programs to Pakistan said. So, 
far, he said, Bhutto remains "on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
 To open up the economy and force home-grown companies to be more competitive, 
the government plans to cut tariffs from a top rate of 92% to 70% in the next 
fiscal year, then to 45% and 35% in the two ensuing years. 
</P>
<P>
 To widen a precariously thin tax base, Parliament passed a wealth levy on the 
politically powerful farm sector in February, and a separate agricultural 
income tax is supposed to be enacted by the country's four provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 Those measures are being promoted by international donors because the land 
barons who chiefly run Pakistani politics (the Bhutto clan included) pay 
virtually no tax. It's a novelty to jail someone for tax evasion, but Bhutto 
has said her government's inspectors will have a free hand to pursue evaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by Bhutto's election win and commitment to the IMF's three-year 
austerity and deficit-cutting package, private investors have also become more 
bullish. Since October, at least $200 million in fresh foreign investment has 
reportedly flowed into Pakistani stock exchanges, and this year the figure 
could double. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The IMF has advised the government to cut defense outlays, raise 
utility rates, hike petroleum prices further and take a host of other painful 
measures to keep the economy on the road to recovery. Those steps carry large 
political costs, and some Western economists in Islamabad who have seen other 
Pakistani leaders embrace reform don't believe Bhutto can follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic growth in Pakistan this year is expected to be about 5% -- quite 
respectable in today's world. The rate would have been higher, but cotton, 
responsible for 60% of exports, was hit hard in 1993 by the leaf curl virus, 
and production plummeted to 9.3 million bales from 12.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, cotton is still prey to the disease, and the harvest is expected to 
drop by almost another 2 million bales. 
</P>
<P>
 News is better in other farming sectors: Sugar and rice crops are said to be 
up over last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry on the whole is doing well, with manufacturing exports -- excluding 
textiles -- up 16% over 1993.

 Jobless Rate in Britain Declines: The figure fell to 9.7% in March from 9.8% 
in February, the Department of Employment reported.The March data shows that 
2.72 million people were unemployed, about 30,000 less than in February. The 
drop was larger than economists had expected. With economic recovery under way, 
the unemployment decline has averaged about 28,000 a month over the past six 
months.

 Truck Ban in Switzerland Proposed: The Swiss government introduced a law to 
back up a February constitutional amendment forcing all trucks traveling 
through Switzerland onto the railways by the year 2000.The proposed law forbids 
the expansion of many roads in alpine regions on which transit vehicles make up 
10% of total traffic. Neighboring countries have sharply criticized the 
so-called Alpine Initiative, which was launched by environmental groups. They 
have threatened retaliatory measures, despite assurances by the Swiss 
government that it intends to uphold international transit agreements. On 
Monday, the European Union delayed until September negotiations on a new 
transport accord with Switzerland to see how Switzerland implements the ban.

DAIMLER OFFICIALS ARE COMMITTED TO DREAM DESPITE LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all looked so good. Daimler-Benz, manufacturer of the world-famous Mercedes 
car, embarked on an expansion into areas such as aerospace and defense with the 
dream of becoming the world's leading integrated technology group. 
</P>
<P>
 That was during the fat years of the mid-1980s. But less than a decade later, 
Daimler has crashed to the first loss in its postwar history -- 1.84 billion 
marks ($1.07 billion), according to U.S. accounting rules. 
</P>
<P>
 This was in spite of doubling in size to become Germany's largest industrial 
concern, making everything from planes to trains to cars and with annual sales 
of almost 100 billion marks ($58.23 billion). 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the end of the Cold War caused cash-strapped Western governments to 
slash defense budgets. Second, a slump in air travel caused new aircraft orders 
to nose-dive. Third, a severe global recession caused car demand to crash. 
</P>
<P>
 While recovering car sales, cost cuts and huge layoffs are expected to push 
Daimler back into profit this year, the businesses it bought during the 1980s 
acquisition binge will not contribute positive earnings until 1995 at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, it took over electronics group AEG AG, engine and turbine 
maker MTU, aircraft maker Dornier, defense group MBB and Dutch plane builder 
Fokker. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Daimler reorganized itself into a holding company with four 
subsidiaries -- Mercedes-Benz, AEG, Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and finance and 
information technology unit Debis (Daimler-Benz InterServices). 
</P>
<P>
 Group Chairman Edzard Reuter and finance chief Gerhard Liener remain firmly 
committed to the dream of an integrated technology group in spite of a wave of 
criticism that Daimler should have stuck to its core business of making cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many countries, car markets are almost saturated. It makes sense to expand 
into new areas with growth promise for the next century," Liener said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 While presenting a futuristic fuel cell-driven vehicle project earlier this 
week, Reuter said the group could survive only through investment in new 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critics of our strategy have been silenced because our concept is showing 
successes despite the crisis," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daimler's earnings have collapsed but its aim of being an integrated 
technology group has not," a London-based analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 A drive toward the globalization has been accompanied by a search for new 
sources of capital to fund the expansion. In October, Daimler became the first 
German company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and plans to be 
listed in Singapore from next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The most encouraging changes, analysts say, are happening at Mercedes-Benz, 
which accounts for two-thirds of group sales. Once known for its limited lineup 
of prestigious but conservatively styled sedans, Mercedes has confronted a deep 
sales slump on the key European car market by focusing more on customers' wants 
and producing more "niche" vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the new compact A-Class city car, which will roll off the production 
line in 1997, and a decision to cooperate with Switzerland's Nicholas Hayek to 
produce a radical, environmentally friendly mini car known as the Swatchmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also plans to build four-wheel-drive sports-utility vehicles in 
the United States, beginning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important for now is the new lower-priced C-Class model (the 
replacement for the old 190 series), which the company introduced last year in 
a bid to recapture sales lost to the stunningly successful 3-series from arch 
rival BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-Class is selling extremely well and will make a vital contribution to 
the whole group's recovery, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 DASA, the second-largest division, lost nearly a billion marks ($582.3 
million) in 1993 due to falling orders for both civil and military aircraft. It 
plans to shed 16,000 jobs, close six plants and reorganize many businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 AEG, which also lost nearly a billion marks last year, is selling its 
household goods unit to Sweden's AB Electrolux, and will hive off non-core 
interests and concentrate on railways and microelectronics. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be a welcome break for Daimler, which acquired loss-making AEG in 
1986 from bank creditors who had rescued it from the brink of bankruptcy only 
four years earlier and has since pumped hundreds of millions of marks into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Daimler began restructuring long before many other German firms 
and will be in good shape to reap the benefits of a pickup in demand when the 
recession ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Restructuring costs, which amounted to 3.5 billion marks ($2.04 billion) in 
1993 will fall sharply this year. This plus cost cuts and rising C-Class sales 
should propel Daimler back to profit of up to a billion marks this year, 
analysts say.

 PDA Engineering: The Costa Mesa software and engineering services company lost 
$1.3 million, or 16 cents a share, for its latest fiscal quarter. That 
contrasted with a profit of $792,000, or 8 cents a share, for the same period a 
year earlier.Revenue for the company's third quarter, which ended March 31, 
dropped 14% to $8.9 million from $10.4 million. For the first nine months of 
its fiscal year, the company reported a loss of $776,000, or 9 cents a share. 
That contrasted with a profit of $3.4 million, or 33 cents a share, for the 
same period a year earlier, when the company had a gain of $840,000 from an 
accounting change. Nine-month revenue declined 9% to $28.1 million from $30.8 
million.

HELIONETICS PLANS NEW SUBSIDIARY, PUBLIC OFFERING

 Helionetics Inc. said Wednesday that it will form a new publicly owned 
subsidiary to oversee two of its divisions and intends to raise $7.5 million in 
the initial stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are to be used for production and marketing of an electrical 
filtering device. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Helionetics, headquartered in Irvine, said the company's KSW Inc. 
division in Long Island City, N.Y., and its AIM Energy Inc. division in 
Clinton, N.J., will become units of AIM Energy Inc., to be based in Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 A public offering is expected this summer, with proceeds to be channeled into 
development and marketing of a device that screens out potentially hazardous 
harmonic distortion waves produced by energy-efficient electrical appliances 
and computers. Left unfiltered, the waves could cause wiring to heat up and 
could start a fire, said Helionetics President E. Maxwell Malone.  
</P>
<P>
 Helionetics stock closed Wednesday at $4 a share, up 6 1/4 cents.

CREDITORS' BID TO CONTROL LINCOLN MORTGAGE DENIED; COURTS: BANKRUPTCY JUDGE 
GIVES FOUNDER SARVAK AT LEAST 90 DAYS TO PREPARE A PLAN TO REPAY $30 MILLION 
LOST IN SECOND TRUST DEED POOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A bid by creditors of bankrupt Lincoln Mortgage and Loan Co. to wrest control 
of the business from founder Kenneth E. Sarvak failed Wednesday as a federal 
bankruptcy judge ruled that Sarvak could remain in charge for at least 90 days 
while preparing a financial reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarvak, a 68-year-old real estate investor, was given until July 13 to prepare 
a plan to repay creditors who invested more than $30 million into his second 
trust deed pool. 
</P>
<P>
 A court-ordered audit found that Lincoln, based in Newport Beach, holds deeds 
to about $9 million worth of land, leaving investors with a $21-million 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Though apparently profitable for Sarvak and its investors for most of its 20 
years in business, Lincoln by 1990 had become a victim of the collapsing 
Southern California real estate market and of several bad investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corporations also alleged in a civil suit filed 
earlier this year that the company and its investors were defrauded by Sarvak, 
who allegedly was cannibalizing the company by diverting investment funds to 
make promised interest payments to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Lincoln's business was lending investors' money to homeowners whose 
credit was not good enough for them to borrow from a bank. The borrower would 
take a second mortgage on the house and, in return, give Lincoln a deed to 
ensure that the company got its money back. 
</P>
<P>
 That is known as the hard-money second mortgage business. If the borrower 
cannot make the mortgage payments, the lender forecloses and takes the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the company stopped making interest payments late in 1992, investors 
earned returns as high as 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 Brochures for the company said that each investor's name would be recorded in 
county land records on each deed to reserve the investor a place in line if the 
homeowner did not make loan payments and the house had to be sold to pay off 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 But records show that many investors' names were never recorded, so their 
investments were unsecured by collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his lawyers, Sarvak has said that the case is a misunderstanding. He 
never lied to his investors, he said, and the documents he gave them did not 
require him to record their deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corporations' fraud suit, however, says he was required to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Lincoln apparently flourished during the 1980s, its fortunes declined 
with real estate values in 1990. By November last year, with the company facing 
a blizzard of lawsuits by disgruntled clients, Sarvak filed for protection from 
creditors in U.S. bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal bankruptcy law has allowed Sarvak to keep control of the company while 
planning its reorganization but requires court review and approval of 
significant transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful that Sarvak might somehow dissipate Lincoln's already diminished 
assets, the creditors initially had sought to have the company's voluntary 
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code converted to a 
court-ordered liquidation of assets under Chapter 7. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a nationwide telephone conference among themselves Tuesday, the 
creditors concluded that a liquidation might hurt them if Lincoln's land 
holdings were disposed of at fire-sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they asked Bankruptcy Judge John Wilson to leave Lincoln in Chapter 
11 but to appoint an examiner to take over administration of the company, said 
Emogene Butler, a Newport Beach real estate broker and co-chairwoman of the 
creditors committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who said she has invested $600,000 with Lincoln, said creditors hoped 
the arrangement would protect the company's assets while allowing Sarvak to use 
his real estate experience to get the most value out of the properties that the 
company owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The examiner, however, declined to take on the assignment, maintaining that 
the existence of several other companies owned by Sarvak and involved in 
separate bankruptcy proceedings would make the situation too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 And Judge Wilson agreed that selling Lincoln's property in a forced 
liquidation would almost guarantee further losses to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an individual investor, I'm pleased that he didn't order liquidation," 
Butler said. "Now we have at least 90 more days for Mr. Sarvak, under court 
supervision, to figure out how to get money back without dumping the real 
estate." 
</P>
<P>
 The extra time could be important, she said, "because there are signs out 
there that the (real estate) market is coming back."

 Luther Medical Products Inc., which makes catheter and neuro-diagnostic 
products, said Wednesday that the Food and Drug Administration has approved its 
newest device.The catheter, designed to replace others now on the market, is 
made of a new polyurethane material that changes texture inside the body to 
minimize vein damage and discomfort.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pot of gold for us," said company Chairman Ron Luther, who 
started the business in 1980. He said the product, called "Onecath," will go on 
sale in 45 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors apparently didn't see the pot. The company's stock, which has taken 
a beating in the past year, fell 12 1/2 cents a share Wednesday to close at 
$3.125 in Nasdaq trading.

HAVE LAPTOP AND CELLULAR PHONE, WILL TRAVEL; WORKPLACE: COMPANIES ARE 
ELIMINATING SPACE AND ARMING EMPLOYEES WITH PORTABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN TURN 
ANYWHERE FROM A CAR SEAT TO A HOTEL LOBBY INTO A VIRTUAL OFFICE.

 When he packed his personal effects in a box and took the photographs of his 
wife and two young sons from the desk, Ken Feldman looked like another casualty 
of corporate America's job-slashing austerity. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't. The marketing specialist at International Business Machines Corp. 
was trading his office for a laptop computer, cellular phone and control over 
his work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman is one of 800 IBM employees merged from five locations in New Jersey 
and New York into a Spartan facility in suburban Cranford, N.J., a remade 
warehouse with generic desks. The idea is that marketing and service employees 
come in only when necessary, a pit stop for IBM's road warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted our employees to spend more time with clients," says Duke Mitchell, 
general manager for IBM in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies across America are riding the latest trend in employee management: 
eliminating office space and arming workers with portable technology that can 
turn anywhere from a car seat to a hotel lobby into a virtual office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole new way of working and thinking," says Michael Bell, director of 
corporate real estate for Dun & Bradstreet Corp. "We're seeing the office 
change from a place to come to work to a place to convene." 
</P>
<P>
 The research firm Link Resources Corp. says about 41 million Americans, or 33% 
of employed adults, work from home, up from 27 million, or 22%, in 1989. Most, 
however, are independent contractors, free-lancers and entrepreneurs who work 
from home by choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is company executives who are seeing the benefits and initiating or 
encouraging the move away from traditional offices. Link says the number of 
so-called "telecommuters" was 7.6 million last year, 15% higher than the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those signing up are units of IBM, Ernst & Young, Arthur Andersen & Co., 
American Telephone & Telegraph Corp., General Electric Co. and Hewlett-Packard 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneers in the field report an improvement in employee productivity of 
between 15% and 20% and a savings in real estate costs of between 25% and 40%, 
Bell says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time of corporate cost-cutting and emphasis on productivity and global 
competitiveness, that's hard to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, employees gain flexibility and more control over their work and 
lives. Information workers, writers and consultants can gain uninterrupted 
peace and quiet to do their best. Sales and marketing employees are freed to 
spend more time with clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are worrisome drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees forced to leave offices often feel evicted and homeless. Others 
worry about their career status and miss the informal networking around the 
office water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of the traditional office poses vaguer but potentially more 
troublesome questions about the gray area evolving between work and home life. 
When does working at home become an invasion of privacy? How do employers guard 
against employee hooky-playing? How do employees guard against overwork? 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior at Northwestern 
University's J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management, said the notion 
underlying these questions is that "work takes place in no place in particular 
but any place." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cautionary notes, the acceptability of working anywhere has 
accelerated among employers. One reason is the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clean Air Act of 1990 requires companies with more than 100 employees in 
10 polluted areas to reduce solo driving among their employees. Telecommuters 
count as people who don't drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature also has played a role. Just in the past months, for example, the 
earthquake in Los Angeles and the harsh winter storms on the East Coast have 
forced companies to provide employees with laptops and other technology to 
avoid long, hazardous commutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, many companies are realizing telecommuting allows them to hire 
the best talent regardless of location, says Abhijeet Rane, a research analyst 
at Link. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the technology and cost barriers that once made telecommuting 
prohibitive are disappearing, with the advent of accessible wireless and 
portable technology, Rane says. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller companies such as Verifone, which sells technology that authorizes 
credit card purchases, and the advertising agency Chiat-Day, which created the 
Energizer bunny, were among the first to implement telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Now larger companies are following. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM equipped its marketing and service staff with laptops and cellular phones 
and in late February opened its New Jersey facility, a renovated warehouse with 
no partitions. 
</P>
<P>
 When workers want office space, they walk into a kiosk near the entrance, 
punch in a number and a computer assigns them a desk, where their phone calls 
and computer files are automatically switched. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, 43, a 20-year IBM veteran, says he had mixed feelings when asked to 
vacate his desk in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt displaced. I had to pack up everything into boxes. The only other time 
you have to do that is when you are laid off or fired," Feldman says. 
</P>
<P>
 But with an office established at home and more time in the morning with his 
young sons and wife, Feldman says he is acclimating. The challenges now are 
mostly in learning the new technology, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst & Young's northeastern operations moved from traditional offices to the 
"hoteling" concept in July last year, with flexibility built into its newly 
developed New York City facility for about 250 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members, equipped with cellular phones and laptops, call a "concierge" 
to reserve office or conference space. Only partners have private offices. 
Other employees share. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective, says David Tierno, managing director of the company's Northeast 
Management Consulting Group, is a paperless environment, with files, data and 
memos all handled electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the company's 50,000 to 60,000 employees worldwide are heading in the 
same direction, Tierno says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some businesses are taking the initiative toward telecommuting, more 
often it is the employees who are pushing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nynex, hundreds of the 70,000 employees work from home one or two days a 
week under a flexible work arrangements program introduced in 1990, says Mary 
Maher, a staff director at the large regional telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were responding to the changing needs of the employee," Maher says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Nynex telecommuters have working spouses or are single parents and need 
the flexibility, she says. The company expects to triple use of the plan at 
significant savings over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 At AT&T, one out of nine managers from a total U.S. pool of about 100,000 
works from home regularly, says spokesman Burke Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies see telecommuting as a contingency measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Nynex, which provides the special services required by a telecommuter, has 
seen customer interest pick up over the last months, prompted partly by the 
earthquake and the East Coast storms, says Georgene Horton, another Nynex 
staffing director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies are starting to realize they need contingency plans so they don't 
lose productivity," Horton says. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Pacific Bell established a telecommuting hot line right after 
the earthquake and received thousands of inquiries, says Carol Nolan, the 
company's telecommuting manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing an opportunity, Pacific Bell offered free installation of services 
such as telephone lines, voice mail, call forwarding and digital phone lines 
that allow computer users to send data back and forth at higher speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as a chance to educate people," says Lou Saviano, a spokesman for 
Pacific Bell. "We want companies to see that there are other ways of getting 
work done than putting a body in a car and moving it down the highway."

KID STUFF: YOUTH SHALL BE SERVED; SHARON, LOIS & BRAM HOLD THE AGE OF INNOCENTS 
AS SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Lois Lilienstein of the children's trio Sharon, Lois & Bram first stepped 
onstage at age 5, she was in no hurry to set the world on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I be back," she announced, warily eyeing the crowd, "when I be 6." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, even at that tender age, Lilienstein had formulated what 
would become a significant theme in her adult career: There's no sense rushing 
a good thing. Especially childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilienstein, with partners Sharon Hampson and Bram Morrison, has spent more 
than 16 years expressing that thought in the trio's recordings, concerts and 
long-running "Elephant Show," now in reruns on Nickelodeon. The group, which 
last week released its 13th recording, "All the Fun You Can Sing!," brings a 
stage show of the same name to the Orange County Performing Arts Center on 
Sunday at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert is one of three performances by name artists presented at OCPAC as 
part of the 1994 Imagination Celebration (Loretta Livingston and Dancers stage 
"The Grandma Moses Project" at the center April 27, and children's pop group 
Parachute Express performs there May 1). Imagination Celebration, a nationwide 
arts-awareness program begun by the Kennedy Center in Washington, is hosted 
locally by the center and the Orange County Department of Education and 
continues through May 1 with free or low-cost performances, exhibits and 
workshops by arts and community groups at sites across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast with many cohorts in the burgeoning children's music field, 
Sharon, Lois & Bram are old-fashioned. Banjos and slide whistles are heard more 
often than electric guitars in their mostly folk-inspired tunes. And, although 
Bram sports a salt-and-pepper beard, the trio's onstage look is more 
conservative than that of its hipper counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lilienstein makes no apologies for the group's choices, musically or 
sartorially. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do rap and hip-hop," she explained recently in a phone interview 
from her Toronto home. "It's just not us. We like the creative flow of folk 
songs because it allows children to make up their own rhythms, or words or 
movements. It's unique because it's unfixed, fluid, and it gets across the 
message to children that the music they make is as valid as what the guy or gal 
sitting next to them makes." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Sharon, Lois & Bram ended a long distribution and licensing deal 
with A&M Records to sign with Drive Entertainment, a Los Angeles-based 
independent that released their holiday album "Candles, Snow and Mistletoe" and 
"All the Fun You Can Sing!" If plans pan out, Drive will help bring the trio 
solidly into the '90s with an interactive CD-ROM project. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Lilienstein stresses that the group has no intention of 
abandoning its folkie roots for the kiddie-rock bandwagon, even if ignoring the 
trend means the trio appeals to a smaller audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be all things to all people," she said. "We can do some current 
stuff, but we'll always remain true to our main purpose, to use our music, our 
talents, in the service of our children. In the past, (our music) might have 
appealed all the way to age 10," she continued, a tad wistfully. "But there's 
such pressure now on even 5- or 6-year-olds to do away with childish things. 
There's a precious commodity called childhood, and I think that it stops sooner 
than it needs to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," she added with a laugh, "the three of us are the grand mammies and 
granddaddy (of children's music) . . . we are what we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon, Lois & Bram are now in their 50s; Bram is a grandfather (his 
grandchild refers to the trio as "Sharon, Lois and Papa"). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, with a borrowed $20,000 bankroll, the threesome formed their own 
label and produced their first album, the bilingual "One Elephant, Deux 
Elephants" (their mascot, Elephant -- actually the woman who choreographs their 
stage moves -- made her debut when "One Elephant Came Out to Play," a song from 
that album, was first performed in concert, and has stuck around ever since). 
</P>
<P>
 Lilienstein says the group has rebuffed offers to sign with other major labels 
and continues to record on the Toronto-based Elephant Records, using first A&M, 
and now Drive, as U.S. licensees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're too old to have people tell us what to do," she said with a rueful 
chuckle. "There have been attempts to 'do a job on us,' but as artists, 
controlling our own destiny is the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3 million Sharon, Lois & Bram recordings have been sold in North 
America, and the group has released four videos, four songbooks and toured 
extensively in the United States and Canada. Their television program, 
"Elephant Show," produced from 1984 to 1988, is rerun locally on Nickelodeon 
weekday mornings. The trio has been national ambassadors for UNICEF since 1988 
and is active in the nonprofit Food Research and Action Center, which fights 
child hunger in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilienstein, a Chicago transplant who has a background in jazz and classical 
piano, met Hampson, a folk singer, through Toronto's Mariposa Folk Festival, 
for which she established the first children's music category. She came to know 
Morrison, also an established folkie in the Toronto area, through a preschool 
music program she set up when her son was starting school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eclectic" is the word Lilienstein uses most often when describing the trio's 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our style is eclectic because that's what our taste is," she 
explained. "In our music, we bring to bear all the years we spent before we 
became a threesome, primarily the work we did with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have folk music in common, but when I grew up, I didn't much care for 
it," she admitted, recalling how her father, an insurance salesman who 
moonlighted as a pianist for bar mitzvahs and parties, sparked her interest in 
pop, jazz and musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The "All the Fun You Can Sing!" album reflects the group's varying tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Biscuit," Hampson and Lilienstein produce sweet, Andrews Sisters-style 
harmonies to big-band instrumentals. The children's standard "Peanut Butter and 
Jelly," which must show up on at least half of all children's recordings, is 
given a cool, jazzy spin that brings to mind a '60s coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 With December's release of "Candles, Snow and Mistletoe," Sharon, Lois & Bram 
premiered a new project that was a definite departure from their usual 
recordings and concert tours: a three-part package that included the recording, 
as well as a video created from an original, live stage show that the group 
presented in New York's Palace Theatre. A spokesman for the group said the show 
was well-received by audiences, despite slower-than-anticipated ticket sales, 
brought on largely, he said, by the show's Dec. 26 opening and generally 
sluggish sales for family shows on Broadway during last year's holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back on it, to have the temerity to put a show together for the 
Palace in four months is as mad a project as could be," said Lilienstein, who 
added that the musical harks back to the Hollywood spectaculars of the 1940s 
and '50s. "We had a story, a 14-piece orchestra; we danced, and we sang. Wasn't 
it a time!" 
</P>
<P>
 The group hopes to make "Candles" an annual event, bringing it to one or more 
selected cities each holiday season. The televised version is expected to air 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon, Lois & Bram's musical mix also includes a category that Lilienstein 
says reflects the "playground culture" of children, including everything from 
jump rope ditties to camp songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children have music of their own to give back to us," she said, "to remind 
grown-ups of when we were young. Maybe it's a tenuous thing, given the 
pressures of pop culture, but it's lovely," she said, her voice trailing off 
for a moment. "Basically, we subscribe to Woody Guthrie's idea, which is a 
children's song is any song that children like to sing."

KID STUFF: 'MOSES' TRIES TO REACH OUT TO THE UNINITIATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's some frightening talk going around about Loretta Livingston and 
Dancers' "Grandma Moses Project." Unsettling words such as "modern dance" and 
"tribute," which, when used in the same sentence, can cause otherwise-sensible 
parents to avoid the performance like car-pool duty during Friday rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But take five. 
</P>
<P>
 A conversation with the company's manager, David Plettner, revealed that the 
one-hour piece, which will be presented Wednesday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center as part of the Imagination Celebration, was designed 
specifically with families in mind, especially those unfamiliar with modern 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, based on Plettner's observations, adults might be more put off than 
their children by the prospect of an evening-length, modern dance concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through our outreach work in schools, we've found that children appreciate 
sophisticated, fully staged concert dance as long as it's about something they 
can relate to," Plettner said by phone from the company's Los Angeles studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at what's happened in children's theater," he continued. "In the last 10 
to 12 years, we've seen more works which are challenging, interesting and have 
vibrant content. The same things can be translated into dance." 
</P>
<P>
 We should immediately clarify that though this piece is inspired by the works 
of American folk painter Grandma Moses (a.k.a. Ann Mary Richardson, a farm wife 
who took up painting in her 70s and continued until her death at 101), it bears 
no resemblance to that other tribute to famous artists, Laguna Beach's annual 
Pageant of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Plettner, the dances in "The Grandma Moses Project" are not 
literal re-creations of the artist's paintings, and they are definitely not 
static. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are occasionally tableaux drawn from the paintings, but they are just 
moments," Plettner said. "Many choreographers use stillness as contrast. Nor 
are we trying to tell the story of the painting. It's the layering . . . of 
meaning which makes the experience more evocative." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of telling the story of individual paintings, Plettner said, the 
dances convey the spirit and vision of the artist by bringing to life 
characters and situations seen in her works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because (the paintings) are literally scenes from country life, fall harvest 
scenes, planting scenes . . . the dance is divided into four seasons," Plettner 
said. "In summer, for example, there is a stylized baseball game, a picnic, a 
Fourth of July parade -- all recognizable activities that are depicted in the 
paintings." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Grandma Moses Project" premiered in March 1993 at the UCLA Center for the 
Performing Arts and is the fruit of a yearlong collaboration by Livingston, 
Swiss composer Murielle Hamilton and Martha Ferrara, dean of the Cal Arts 
school of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it has its basis in late 20th-Century music, dance and visuals, the 
creators drew much of their inspiration from American country life nearly 100 
years ago, Plettner said. Modern dance interpretations of contra and folk 
dancing are seen in Livingston's choreography, and Hamilton's music includes 
styles ranging from Aaron Copland and turn-of-the-century hymns to folk music. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the minimalist look often associated with modern dance, Ferrara's 
richly colored costumes were created using 1890 clothing patterns, and her 
setting features a changing quilt-style backdrop modeled after a Grandma Moses 
landscape. Period farm and household items are used as props. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience participation is blended into the show as well. In one scene, viewers 
help dancers move farm tools in preparation for work in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-member cast, which includes Livingston and Plettner, portrays a 
"family unit" of a mother, father, two young girls and male and female hired 
hands. Although viewers could interpret it as such, the characters aren't meant 
to portray Grandma Moses' own family (the artist, a mother of 10, met her 
husband while both were working as hired hands on a farm). 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is the impression that there is this wonderful family 
interaction," Plettner said. "The children are playful, get in trouble, are 
obedient, work hard . . . they do things every parent and child can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Loretta Livingston and Dancers present "The Grandma Moses Project." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Wednesday, April 27, at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Segerstrom Hall, Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center 
Drive, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit at Bristol Street and 
drive north. Turn right on Town Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Tickets are $4 for children and adults and can be bought at the 
OCPAC box office or by phoning TicketMaster. Advance purchase is recommended.

PUSHING THE ENVELOPE; ERIKA ROTHENBERG SENDS SUBVERSIVE, SARCASTIC MESSAGES IN 
HER 'CARDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Cathy Curtis covers art for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day, a greeting-card manufacturer announced a new card designed to 
be sent to President Clinton. The card lists nine silly things he could do to 
"keep America No. 1," with space for a 10th item to be added by the sender. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if there were a genuinely subversive line of ready-made cards? How 
about a card offering sympathy to people living in a neighborhood with an 
unusually high rate of cancer? Or cards for abuse victims to send to their 
attackers? Or for attackers to send to their victims? Rueful wishes for parents 
whose kids are having kids? Invitations to book-burnings? Condolences for folks 
whose investments have plummeted in value? 
</P>
<P>
 The mind boggles at the Pandora's box of socially unacceptable, or at least 
eyebrow-raising, sentiments that might be sailing through the U.S. mail. But 
that's precisely the point of the 90 handmade greeting cards in Erika 
Rothenberg's "House of Cards," at the South Coast Plaza satellite of the Laguna 
Art Museum through July 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other prominent artists working in a conceptual vein, Rothenberg 
makes work that you don't need a broad knowledge of contemporary art to 
understand. Rothenberg, a former advertising agency art director, has 
deliberately cultivated a low-tech, slightly awkward approach, with flat, 
brightly colored imagery (full of unsophisticated hearts, daisies and balloons) 
and silly cutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The finished products seem to exist in a world of their own, halfway between 
the slick soullessness of mass-produced messages and the earnestness of 
homemade projects. As a result, the touchy, sarcastic messages the cards convey 
assume a weird intensity -- the flip side of all the polite phrases we utter 
while thinking something quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg's pieces generally follow the one-two punch of the traditional 
card: a riddle or a seemingly innocuous wish on the cover with a gotcha tag 
line inside. The more successful cards in her line retain certain traditional 
elements: They mark specific events with expressions of congratulations, 
sympathy or appreciation. But Rothenberg subverts the viewer's expectations 
with mordant remarks meant to wound and shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, most of the cards don't fall into the trap of telling the viewer 
what to believe or whose side to take. Just when viewers may think the piece is 
simply a primer in how to think like a liberal, they are zapped by cheerful 
exhortations to do hotly debated or frankly appalling things -- or simply to 
consider the mixed results of well-meaning efforts: 
</P>
<P>
 * A nervous-looking young woman is pictured on the cover of a card. "Don't go 
to your abortion alone . . ." the text reads. Inside, the woman reappears, 
encircled by people pointing fingers. Someone carries a Right to Life placard. 
The text continues: "Let us go with you!" 
</P>
<P>
 * The cover shows a black and a white hand in a handshake. Inside: "Thanks, 
boss! For your affirmative actions!" 
</P>
<P>
 * On a card decorated with teddy bears: "Remember -- if you tell Mom about 
what we did together . . . I'll kill you!"

 * A young woman leans casually against a giant gold star. "I'm so excited that 
you went out with someone famous!" the cover line reads. Inside, the star has 
backed the woman into a corner. ". . . And so sorry that he raped you." 
</P>
<P>
 * On the cover, crude images of a gun-toting black man and a bikini-clad white 
woman appear as images on a strip of film stock. Inside: "We appreciate your

portrays women and minorities . . . we wouldn't have sold $5.5 billion worth of

 These cards, arranged in a single row that circles the gallery, are quick 
hits, meant to be absorbed about as quickly as snack food. An allied group of 
three-dimensional cards have themes ranging from the heartfelt ("Please! 
Execute my son's murderer!" -- with a tiny body hanging from a miniature 
scaffold) to the goofy ("Thank you. . . . We had a great time aboard your UFO!" 
-- with a couple waving to a departing flying saucer). 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, despite the museum's claim that the cards are being shown for 
the first time on the West Coast, a smaller sampling appeared at the Rosamund 
Felsen Gallery in Los Angeles in 1991. The full group of cards was first shown 
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1992.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: VARIOUS ARTISTS "AFRICA: NEVER STAND STILL" / ELLIPSIS 
ARTS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the sounds of Africa occasionally find a brief spotlight in the U.S. 
mainstream through the cross-cultural efforts of such performers as Talking 
Heads, Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel, hearing examples of unadulterated African 
pop is a trickier proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, with so little chance to hear this stuff on the radio, how is one 
to get an introduction? One answer has been provided by the many multi-artist 
compilations released over the years, from the "Musique d'Afrique" collections 
of the '70s, to the "Indestructible Beat of Soweto" in the mid-'80s and the 
recent Madagascar project undertaken by David Lindley and Henry Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been many worthy choices over the years, but it's hard to recall 
any that approach the new "Africa: Never Stand Still" as a comprehensive slice 
of contemporary African pop. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Ellipsis Arts (which produced last year's acclaimed "Global 
Celebration") builds on its growing reputation as a creator of first-class 
explorations of world music with this release. With three compact discs (or 
tapes), 39 songs by 39 artists, more than three hours of music (all 
meticulously documented in a highly readable 46-page booklet), this project 
does it right. For newcomers to African pop, the intoxicating variety of styles 
and sounds could well be a revelation. And it's a safe bet that even longtime 
fans are likely to find more than a few new discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 All the songs here have been recorded since 1989, so this is a snapshot, not a 
history. Producers of the collection strive to mix artists familiar outside 
Africa -- Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Salif Keita, Ali Farka Toure and Youssou 
N'Dour -- with lesser-known performers, and the approach works. Slickly 
produced urban pop and more tradition-bound roots music exist side-by-side and 
complement rather than clash. 
</P>
<P>
 And as with any compilation, it is possible to nit-pick about who was left 
out. Even with the two wonderful selections here, Nigeria seems curiously 
underrepresented given its enormous musical vitality. And although women are 
fairly well represented, it might have been nice to add a couple more 
up-and-comers such as Ethiopia's Aster Aweke or jazz-pop singer Angelique Kidjo 
of Benin. 
</P>
<P>
 Such quibbles are minor, however, in light of what is offered. The bulk of the 
music here comes from south of the Sahara, with a few excursions to African 
societies off the continent proper (Madagascar, Cape Verde, Mauritania) and two 
tracks from North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the collection includes rhumba-influenced soukous from central 
Africa, maybe the most infectious dance music on Earth (Papa Wemba and Kanda 
Bongo Man of Zaire, Aurlus Mabele & Loketo of Congo), the more lilting rhythms 
of southern Africa (Oliver Mtukdzi and Stella Chiweshe of Zimbabwe), and the 
chunky township grooves of South Africa (check out the wonderful "Six Mabone" 
by Lulu Masilela). 
</P>
<P>
 The adventures in between are too numerous to elaborate upon here, but a 
couple of names are worth singling out. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of N'Dour will want to check out countryman Baaba Maal, yet another 
astounding singer from Senegal; similarly, devotees of Malian music can add the 
name of Oumou Sangare as a female counterpart to Toure and Keita. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to African pop may need a few listens before the music here really 
starts to emerge from a potentially confusing jumble, but the investment is 
worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward isn't an exercise in ethnography, but the revelation of a vibrant 
musical culture. RICK VANDERKNYFF

COMEDY; 20 YEARS UNDER HIS BELTWAY, AND POLITICS STILL SURPRISES HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Russell, who performs Tuesday at UC Irvine, has been lampooning the 
Washington scene with song and satire for more than 20 years now, but politics 
still has the capacity to surprise him. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the current Whitewater flap, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's new ground, and that is liberals attacking the media for being too 
tough on a Democratic president," Russell said, wryly noting the turnaround 
from the Reagan-Bush years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been months since I've heard the traditional Republican carping on the 
media." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand recently weighed in with a passionate defense of Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, and an excoriation of the press for pursuing her role in the 
financial scandal. Some have said the press is treating the First Lady harshly 
because she's a woman, but Russell dismisses that argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're attacking her because she's an equal," he said in a direct but 
friendly phone interview from his Washington home. "The god of politics is a 
eunuch." 
</P>
<P>
 For his own part, Russell prides himself on going after all sides in political 
life with equal gusto, and his audience has come to expect as much: "The worst 
thing I can be accused of is being too soft." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell began his career as a piano player in a Washington bar, where he began 
telling political jokes. That grew into his now-familiar mix of politically 
oriented song parodies and topical monologue, which he updates daily as events 
unfold (he continues to live in Washington "for the same reason a miner lives 
near the shaft"). 
</P>
<P>
 For 18 years now, Russell has been a regular on PBS, and he tours heavily, 
playing about 120 dates a year. If there is a role his humor plays, it is as "a 
sexy presentation of the First Amendment and a constant reminder of what we get 
away with in this country," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played before five Presidents, two of whom have been entertained." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell put himself in unexpected company last year when he instructed his 
attorney to urge the Supreme Court to review a ruling involving rappers 2 Live 
Crew and a song parody the group recorded. The court affirmed the group's right 
to make fun of a popular song, a victory for all satirists. ("I pictured Sandra 
Day O'Connor high-fiving the Crew"). 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have used this when I was starting out," Russell said. "As a 
newcomer, I would try to use this material (on television appearances), and 
they wouldn't clear it." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed with his PBS gig. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 18 years, not once have they ever wanted to look at a script or discuss 
the material," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Mark Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Tuesday, April 26, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: UCI Bren Events Center.

FESTIVALS & EVENTS; TIME DETECTIVES DUST OFF IMAGE OF ARCHEOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For many, the image of archeology comes straight out of the Indiana Jones 
movies -- dashing adventurers plucking bits of treasure from tombs and temples. 
Such swashbuckling may have had a small element of truth once upon a time, but 
no more. 
</P>
<P>
 "A century ago, we were treasure hunters," said Brian Fagan, a UC Santa 
Barbara archeologist who specializes in writing books on the subject for a 
general audience. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Fagan said, "archeology is a very sophisticated, multidisciplinary 
science," one that is concerned with reconstructing the daily lives of ordinary 
peoples more than with uncovering spectacular plunder. 
</P>
<P>
 This week in Orange County, archeologists are sifting and dusting their way 
through demonstrations and other activities to acquaint the general public with 
the work of real archeologists -- not the movie kind. The events culminate 
Sunday in Newport Beach with the Festival of Archaeology. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, meanwhile, the annual meeting of the Society for American 
Archaeology is underway. Most of the symposiums and other events are geared to 
professionals, but on Saturday there will be a free public session, with talks 
by Fagan and a UC Berkeley archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's festival at Village Crean (a private residence overlooking Newport 
Bay) is sponsored by the Orange County Society of the Archaeological Institute 
of America. The local society has apparently tapped into a widespread local 
interest in the science: In just less than two years, the group has attracted 
more than 200 active members, including professionals but mostly people with an 
amateur interest, its officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think now we're fourth largest in the country, which is amazing considering 
how young we are," said local society founder and president Norma Kershaw, 
adding that there are 89 local societies across the nation. The group aims to 
increase public interest in archeology and to support the research of 
archeologists in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The group offers seven annual lectures (the next is in October, after a summer 
break), along with bus trips to local museums and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the festival, 11 booths will be staffed by people who work in the 
discipline. Representatives of the Pacific Coast Archaeology Society will 
demonstrate stone-tool making, and two UCLA scholars will discuss their recent 
excavations in Syria. There will also be booths from the Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art, Mission San Juan Capistrano and the Biblical Archaeology Society. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there will be videos, dance, music and storytelling, along with 
ethnic food booths, prize drawings and a silent auction. Advance tickets are 
$10 for adults and $5 for children to age 12; proceeds from the event will help 
support archeology education in county elementary schools. Hours are noon to 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's public session of the Society for American Archaeology, 
"Investigating the Mysteries of Time," will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. in the 
Embassy West Room of the Disneyland Hotel. Fagan will open with "Time 
Detectives," a general introduction to what archeologists do. Speaking next 
will be Berkeley's Kent Lightfoot, who will discuss "Solving a California 
Mystery: The Shell Mounds of San Francisco Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 Fagan said the point of his talk will be to demonstrate how archeologists, 
working with only the fragments past cultures have left behind, "can conjure 
extraordinary details about people's daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "I shall be talking about left-handed stone workers, about the the Pharaoh 
Tutankhamen's wine labels, about the reconstruction of ancient Mesopotamian 
beer and basically talking about how archeology studies people. It's not just a 
science -- it's about people." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Festival of Archaeology. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, April 24, noon to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Village Crean, 2300 Mesa Drive, Costa Mesa.

 Whereabouts: From the Corona del Mar (73) Freeway, go south on Santa Ana

</P>
<P>

WANNA DANCE?: STEP ASIDE, THIS 'GATE' SWINGS BEST WITH LIVE TUNES BY LOCALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Attention, serious swing dancers: Go to the Starting Gate. Attention, serious 
country dancers: Do not go to the Starting Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, this scruffy, albeit spunky, Los Alamitos roadside bar works 
well for West Coast Swing but falls short of a good place to practice 
two-stepping. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the L-shaped, 1,500-square-foot dance floor provides room enough for 
swingers, who generally don't need that much room. Two-steppers, however, cover 
a lot of territory, and the floor is too small and oddly configured for much of 
that. It can accommodate only two rows of line dancers, far fewer than most 
honky-tonks pack in. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, breathing is easy on the Gate's three designated swing nights -- 
popular among some of the area's devoted swing hounds -- but unbearably smoky 
on its three country nights. The eyes begin to sting after a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Swing nights are Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday, while country dancers get 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Live music begins at 8 p.m. on Sunday and at 9 
every other night. (Monday is strictly karaoke, no dancing.) 
</P>
<P>
 The live music from local bands is a treat for swing enthusiasts, who often 
must dance to recorded fare. Ray and the Idols (the usual swing nights band) 
deliver a lively mix of 1950s and '60s blues and rock, plus such standards as 
Glenn Miller's "In the Mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether country hoofers are better or worse off depends on personal taste. 
Those hooked on the Top 40 songs and bankable stars now hyped by Nashville 
might prefer Denim & Diamonds. But at least one band, the Tooters, plays such 
classics as Bob Wills' "Take Me Back to Tulsa," and John Anderson's savory 
classic "Seminole Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting across Katella from the Los Alamitos Race Course (hence the name), the 
Starting Gate's work-a-day decor caters neither to a Lindy Hopping nor 
bull-riding clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Decidedly blue collar, it features straight-back red vinyl chairs, small 
linoleum-topped tables, neon Coors and Bud Light signs and framed pictures of 
mounted jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 With a dress code that allows T-shirts, baseball caps and shorts, the crowd 
tends to be equally casual. Ages range from mid-20s to 60s and includes 
servicemen, couples in matching Western garb -- the skirt for her, the shirt 
for him -- and a more uptown contingent in slacks or dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 A big draw, no matter your dancing preference, is the cover charge: There 
never is one. 
</P>
<P>
 Refreshment comes cheap, too, with all drinks $2 on Sundays, Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays after 9 p.m., and a good, one-third-pound cheeseburger with fries is 
only 60 cents from 10 p.m. to midnight Sundays through Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy hour, Monday through Friday from 3 to 7 p.m., boasts roast beef and 
turkey plus salads, all complimentary. * STARTING GATE

DO IT!: ON CLEAR TRAIL YOU CAN HIKE FOREVER

 With saw, lopper and mattock, Ken Croker has been clearing, and even building, 
trails in the backcountry of the Santa Ana Mountains for more than 20 years, 
working closely with a small core of like-minded Sierra Club volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend marks California Trails Days, and in light of the occasion, 
Croker is inviting the public to come out and lend a hand. On both Saturday and 
Sunday, volunteers are needed to help clear a section of the Morgan Trail, off 
Ortega Highway in the San Mateo Canyon Wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day event is sponsored by the Trails Committee of the Angeles Chapter 
of the Sierra Club, by Cleveland National Forest and by a pair of local outdoor 
retailers (REI on Saturday, the North Face on Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 For hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts, it's a chance to chip in on a worthy 
project and put in a day of hard but gratifying work in a rugged and beautiful 
setting. Most of the work will be general clearing and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morgan Trail runs from South Main Divide Road -- on the ridge overlooking 
Lake Elsinore -- down to the Ortega Oaks Store, a hiker's landmark in the tiny 
enclave of El Cariso, which is about 19 miles up the highway from San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not have to do a lot of heavy-duty brushing, but we'll do what it 
takes to get the trail clear," Croker said. The work sites are a short hike 
from the trail head, but "it's not a death-defying trek by any means." 
</P>
<P>
 The Morgan Trail survived the fires last fall, but some other local trails did 
not fare so well, notably the Lucas Canyon Trail, which Croker's crew finished 
building only two years ago. Stabilizing that trail against erosion damage will 
be a project for later this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Trail volunteers this weekend should bring a day pack with lunch and at least 
three quarts of water, work or gardening gloves, sunscreen, lip balm, 
sunglasses and a hat. Work clothes and comfortable, closed-toe shoes or boots 
are recommended. Tools will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Croker asks that everyone who can meet at the car-pool point in Tustin; 
parking at the trail head is limited. 
</P>

<P>
 The Laguna Beach Classic is Sunday. The event is expected to draw some 4,000 
runners and raise as much as $50,000 to rebuild portions of Thurston Middle 
School, damaged in last year's fire. Race-day registration opens at 6:30 a.m. 
The 5K takes off at 7:45 a.m., the 10K at 8:20 a.m. and a 1K kids' event at 
9:15 a.m. Race-day fees are $20 for the 10K and 5K, $15 for the 1K. 
Information: (714) 494-3980. 
</P>
<P>
 What: California Trail Days volunteer work party. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday and Sunday, April 23 and 24, 8:15 a.m. until late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Morgan Trail, San Mateo Canyon Wilderness, off Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: To car-pool, meet at 7 a.m. at the Stater Bros., 14171 Red Hill 
Ave., Tustin. From the Santa Ana Freeway, exit at Red Hill; the supermarket is 
just south of the freeway. To go directly to the trail head, exit Interstate 5 
at Ortega Highway and drive east 19 miles, to a paved parking area on the left 
just past Upper San Juan Campground (across the street from the Ortega Oaks 
Store).

KIDS ON FILM: A GROSS-OUT 'SERIAL MOM'; IN "SERIAL MOM," THE PERFECT, SUBURBAN 
WIFE AND MOTHER OF TWO TEEN-AGERS IS EVENTUALLY PUT ON TRIAL FOR HALF A DOZEN 
GRISLY MURDERS OF TOWNSFOLK WHOSE OFFENSES RANGE FROM DUMPING HER DAUGHTER TO 
WEARING WHITE SHOES AFTER LABOR DAY. (RATED R.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 She wears shirtwaist dresses at breakfast, won't allow gum or the word hate to 
be used in her perfectly appointed home. But the minute after waving her 
well-fed family off in the morning, she picks up the phone, dials a neighbor 
who once took her parking space and showers her with obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she goes to a PTA conference at school, brings her son's math teacher a 
home-baked fruitcake, then after he suggests the child get therapy for a morbid 
interest in sick horror films, runs him down in her station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she goes home, says her prayers, jumps into bed with her dentist 
husband for a noisy bout of hot sex to the disgust of her two children, who 
hear it all. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, most of the kids at a Sunday matinee of this film said 
it wasn't even their idea to come see this gross-out satire -- it was their 
parents'. Those who looked to be still in kindergarten could be heard asking 
questions about the action or the dialogue throughout. Older ones laughed some, 
said they thought it was funny, but conceded -- along with some parents -- that 
perhaps it was basically adult fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of violent," said Chris Beach, 14. "It's got a lot of bad words. If 
they cut some of the bad words, maybe kids would be able to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Betty White, said the movie was raunchier than she had been led to 
expect. No matter how much you know they know about sex, it's still hard to 
feel comfortable sitting next to your children during a scene of a teen boy 
masturbating under the covers to a porn video, even if you are laughing the 
next minute at his expression when the police break in by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an R-rating that's well deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had known the contents, I probably would not have taken him," White 
said. Retorted Chris: "It doesn't matter. My dad would bring me anyway." So 
much for parenting in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults got a few laughs, mostly at the lines and their delivery by Kathleen 
Turner as the mom, and Sam Waterston as her dentist husband. There was also a 
lot of head shaking and "Jeez" comments at the true-to-life greed of the 
victims and family who hired agents and sold "Serial Mom" T-shirts to 
capitalize on their instant fame. 
</P>
<P>
 One customer, buying a "Serial Mom" T-shirt from the accused's children, says: 
"I wish they had something like this at the Kennedy kid's trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Somers even plays herself as an actress lined up to play the serial 
mom on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the news-based jokes were bound to fly over the heads of the kids. 
Few could be expected to appreciate the novelty of Patty Hearst playing the 
white-shoed Juror No. 8 who pleads for her life after being cornered in a phone 
booth by Turner with: "No, please, fashion has changed!" 
</P>
<P>
 Chris admitted he didn't know who Patty Hearst is. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would not be surprising if they were disturbed by Turner's 
lightning-flash personality changes and the gruesome murders. In one, she stabs 
a boy in the back as he is using a urinal and pulls out his dripping liver. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the kids like that kind of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was funny," said Rachel DuBruyane, 14. Particularly, she said, "when she 
ran the teacher over." Natch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris liked the scene in a nightclub where female singers in a grunge band 
spit alcohol on the flaming back of a boy Turner has set afire. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also laughed when Turner fought with Somers over position in front 
of the TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what she said: 'This is not my good side.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't all that violent, he said, noting after all that it is a parody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like 'Boyz N the Hood.' "

SPECIAL SCREENING: '40S REMAKE OF 'ZORRO' LEFT A MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the many questions bedeviling cinema historians, this has to be one of the 
most compelling: Who swashbuckled better, Errol Flynn in "The Adventures of 
Robin Hood" or Tyrone Power in "The Mark of Zorro"? 
</P>
<P>
 A recent viewing of both left me straddling the issue. I'd like to side with 
pretty-boy Flynn, if only because "Robin Hood" is a classier movie, but even 
prettier-boy Power is a surprisingly able run-about in "Zorro." 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, they both dash and leap about the same, with Flynn maybe going 
higher, Power a little faster. Director Rouben Mamoulian helped in this regard, 
obviously speeding up a few helter-skelter scenes in "Zorro," which screens 
Friday afternoon in a free program at the Cypress Senior Citizen Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, neither Flynn nor Power could keep pace with the antics of Douglas 
Fairbanks, the hyper star of the original 1920 silent version of "The Mark of 
Zorro." He all but created the genre with his huge grin and huger acrobatics. 
But both are the swashbuckling sons Fairbanks never had (derring-do does not 
readily come to mind with Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), and Power serves the legacy 
well in the 1940 remake. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear the later "Zorro" was capitalizing both on the memory of the first 
and the success of "Robin Hood," which came out two years before. Like today, 
action heroes were cash cows then, and 20th Century Fox did nicely at the box 
office by decorating Power with mask, sword and mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, young boys were so taken by Zorro's exploits that contemporary news 
reports quoted parents complaining of that trademark "Z" being carved in 
furniture, fences and you name it by sons and daughters wielding steak knives. 
A fad was on; it was a publicist's prayer answered. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1940 picture is silly in a way that only an over-amped Hollywood can 
accomplish. The dialogue is corny and mostly laughable (set in pueblo Los 
Angeles, supposedly Latino characters sprinkle perfect English with phrases 
such as "Vamonos!" and "Santa Maria!" whenever things get rough), but Mamoulian 
rarely lets "Zorro" slow to less than a gallop. The love scenes between Power 
and Linda Darnell are mopey and boring, but they pass quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the film is funny, in the same self-mocking way that "Robin Hood" is. 
Mamoulian lets you know you're watching nonsense, but that doesn't mean it has 
to be tedious nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has an appealing hero in Power, who shows unexpected comic ability in 
this, one of his first pictures. As Don Diego Vega, he's called on to display 
two personalities. His Zorro is rightly dashing, athletic and noble, but his 
foppish Vega is where the joke lies. This hankie-sniffing, ever-sighing wimp is 
almost insufferably dainty, which makes for a goofy contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this version may be the best (purists, though, tend to prefer 
Fairbanks' original), it wasn't close to the last. There have been several 
remakes both for TV and the theaters, including "Zorro, the Gay Blade," which 
introduced Zorro's homosexual twin brother, Bunny, to stunned fans in 1981. 
That couldn't top what happened in 1972, though, when "The Erotic Adventures of 
Zorro" hit the porno circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Maria! 
</P>
<P>
 What: Rouben Mamoulian's "The Mark of Zorro."

IL FORNAIO DELIVERS ON AN AMBITIOUS UNDERTAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it opened its massive portals a few years back, Il Fornaio Cucina 
Gastronomia was, without doubt, the most ambitious Italian restaurant Orange 
County had ever seen. It still is. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you are not familiar with the Il Fornaio name, it refers to an 
international chain of bakeries and restaurants, about two dozen, a good half 
of them in Italy (as the carved stone tableau by the main entrance spells out). 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine branch cost nearly $4 million, and it shows. This enormous, 
free-standing palazzo features an Art Deco bar stocked to the ceiling with 
bottles artfully arranged on shelves of resplendent glass. Next door is an 
equally well-stocked espresso bar and bakery. A gorgeous outdoor patio is 
attached to the main building just for smokers. (There is no smoking inside.) 
</P>
<P>
 Across a small expanse you find an actual boccie ball court, presumably so the 
Italians among the restaurant's large staff can play this ancient game at their 
whim. The staff must also be happy that not much lifestyle adjustment is 
necessary when it comes to dining. Il Fornaio's food is quite close to what one 
eats in Italy, and the restaurant is prosperous enough to include dishes from 
the Alps to Sicily on its impressive menu. 
</P>
<P>
 This prosperity spills over into happy hour, when there are such great free 
hors d'oeuvres in the bar as fresh pizza, eggplant rolled with goat cheese and 
fabulous bruschetta . 
</P>
<P>
 The opulence extends to service, too: Unlike many understaffed dining spots, 
Il Fornaio has extra busboys who do nothing but rove around filling water 
glasses, replenishing your basket of bread sticks and ciabatta (a flattish 
Italian country bread) and generally pampering you. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of being pampered, try booking a table in the Rotonda, located smack 
in the center of the restaurant. It's a private room completely exposed to the 
sky, done in an intimate, rustic style -- the tables have varnished wooden tops 
rather than the white tablecloths on the more claustrophobic tables that run 
around the perimeter of the building or skirt the bar. The Rotonda is more 
casual and a whole lot quieter. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Fornaio hit the ground running when it opened; the interesting thing is 
that it seems even better today. About a year ago, Florence-trained chef 
Marcello Appolonio took charge and smoothed out some of the original wrinkles. 
The spit-roasted meats are juicier now, the pastas more consistently al dente.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a menu in which one easily can get lost, so it's a good idea to order 
judiciously. My favorite appetizer is still bomba , a focaccia hot from the 
oak-burning oven, puffed up into a dome and covered with smoked prosciutto di 
Parma and a suspicion of truffle oil. The waiters still make a production out 
of cutting it, at which point it deflates to cracker dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 A close second is the polenta con gamberi . It's a very soft polenta to begin 
with, and the intense shrimp broth makes it almost soupy. This is a dish I 
literally dream about. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to complain about the pappa con pomodoro , though. In the right hands, 
this simple Tuscan specialty made from soaked bread, chunked tomato and lots of 
olive oil can be wonderful, but Il Fornaio's version has a rough texture and an 
unappealing, sour aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty more primi not to miss, though. Tortino di riso con funghi is 
a crisp, delicious rice pancake topped with fresh mushrooms. Focaccia al 
stracchino is a flat bread with a thin filling of pungent stracchino cheese, 
pine nuts, basil and onions (which won't, incidentally, remind you of pesto a 
bit, despite the similar ingredients -- it's mostly cheese with just a kiss of 
herbs, and the nuts are roasted whole, not pureed into the mixture). 
</P>
<P>
 You'll do well to order any pizza here, but two deserve particular note. Pizza 
raggio di sole is topped with discrete portions of black olives, smoked 
mozzarella, eggplant, ricotta and fresh tomato. Pizza con la luganega comes 
with smoked sausage, roasted peppers and a liberal sprinkling of oregano. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastas tend to be very rich. Take ravioli di verdura con salsa di noci , 
which has a filling of spinach, Swiss chard and basil in a pine nut and walnut 
sauce. Another diet-breaker is lasagna d'anatra : sheets of pasta layered with 
finely minced duck ragout and marinara and bechamel sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not up to the likes of those, the place makes a good angel hair al 
pomodoro naturale . Or you could try pennette all'amatriciana -- chewy little 
tubes in a fresh tomato sauce with Italian bacon and pecorino cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 The main dishes are mostly meats from the rotisserie, mostly served with 
polenta, white Tuscan beans and fragrant steamed spinach. Coniglio con pancetta 
and anatra al balsamico are on an insert menu, and both are terrific. The first 
is tender Sonoma rabbit wrapped in Italian bacon, the second Petaluma duck 
brushed with balsamic vinegar. A pair of carnivores could share the 22-ounce 
bistecca alla Fiorentina , marinated in olive oil and rosemary. Fish lovers 
will cotton to Norwegian salmon or swordfish, both mesquite-grilled. 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least 10 desserts, so hang on tight. If the chefs are up to it, 
you can't go wrong with a plate of cookies from the adjoining bakery, called 
biscotti assortiti . If the cookies are not available, try the lightest 
tiramisu in Orange County, the meringue torte with whipped cream and shaved 
Belgian chocolate, or the budino di pane , a rich bread pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar, say honorable men, was ambitious, and surely ambition is a grievous 
fault. But not in a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Fornaio is expensive. Antipasti are $4.75 to $7.95. Pizzas are $7.75 to 
$10.95. Pastas are $7.95 to $11.95. Main dishes are $9.50 to $18.50. Desserts

PARKER'S PLACE: WE ARE HOW WE PLAY; DESIRE TO RULE OUR FATE DRIVES US, AND 
RUINS OUR FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much of life seems to be wrapped around unbridgeable poles -- rich and poor, 
empowered and subjugated, Republican and Democrat, left and right, male and 
female. If you are one, you can't be the other, and in between lies the 
tortuous processes of history. 
</P>
<P>
 The amateur sportsman or woman tries to buck this ancient system with 
imprecise notions not so much about winning or losing, but the way you play the 
game. Platonic ideals are ignored, Vince Lombardi-isms snickered at, and Zen 
acceptance is the call of the day. We tell ourselves we're in it for the love 
of the sport. We're just out to have fun. "Nice day," "It's just good to get 
out," or "Beautiful country, isn't it?" are oft-heard commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, we're really pretty good at "playing for fun." Plenty of us can feel 
temporarily satisfied at scoring miles over par with a few good shots to the 
green; many of us can be elevated by a morning on a pristine trout stream while 
catching no fish; most of us can play a set of tennis, smack a couple of 
winners, lose a tiebreaker and happily come back tomorrow for more. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, those time-proven, mutually excluding polarities exert their pull, and 
many sportsmen find themselves worrying about performance, who won or lost, how 
many strokes, points, buckets, goals or runs you got compared to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the amateur has wholly surrendered to the idea of successful performance 
-- winning or losing -- and the dynamic has drastically changed. "Love of the 
game" remains a stout precept for getting out there and doing it, but you can 
tell by the smiling grimace of the losers and how much beer they guzzle 
afterward that love is far from their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? One reason is that pure meaninglessness doesn't fit well with human 
nature, no matter how hard we try to create it. We all crave a time when 
meaning doesn't matter, when we're freed from the punishing notion that 
everything is a part of, a relationship to, a "micro" version of something 
else. No thinking human out to enjoy himself needs a reminder that life is 
short, death is certain and almost everything we do has consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion arose to surround our lives with meaning. Games were created as an 
island of enjoyable meaninglessness, as antidotes to the larger verities. But 
human nature being what it is, the thirst for meaning keeps creeping into the 
heart, and the game becomes not a vacation from the demands of mortality, but a 
model of them. We're easily led to believe, after a few thrashings at the hands 
of merciless opponents, that the game is life, and that we are how we play. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's back to the cosmic rock pile again, but with a twist. Though we all 
might admit that we're helpless against the larger currents of life and death, 
the sportsman will never admit that he's helpless against this particular 
opponent. Here's his chance to master fate, captain his own life, however 
briefly. At the end of the day, getting his sorry butt kicked in a game does 
little to further his sense of power and autonomy. Thus, in a nutshell, losing 
hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 I can easily trace the evolution of meaninglessness to meaning in my own game 
of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as a form of controlled aggression and an enjoyment of what 
physical power I could muster soon turned into a program of trying to do these 
things "right." Score didn't matter, because I was learning, and I was having 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing things right was hugely rewarding for a while, until I discovered that 
so many people did things "wrong" and were quite enjoying themselves at it. 
Weirdly, they were also beating me a lot, but I told myself winning and losing 
didn't matter. For months I tried to follow the book, telling myself that the 
points would come. 
</P>
<P>
 The points didn't come. What did come was an odd feeling as I walked onto the 
court: heart pounding hard, a lightness in the head, a heaviness in the legs 
and a foggy notion that I should have stayed home. And there, at the end of the 
match, with the score very lopsided and very much not in my favor, was the 
drastic confirmation that I'd have been happier if I had! 
</P>
<P>
 Last week -- two years since beginning the game, in fact -- I stood preparing 
to serve to the ad court against an opponent I was trailing love-40 in the game 
and 1-5 in the set. That I was getting murdered didn't just matter to me -- it 
mattered, at that time, more than anything else in my entire little world. I 
began to wonder if there were only two things you could be in life, as in the 
game -- a winner or a loser. What had I done to deserve this? I quickly 
double-faulted away the set (and the match) and slunk off like a rat from a 
garbage can. It ruined my day. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, I've played two matches of singles (and gotten killed in both of 
them) and three sets of doubles (leading my partners into resounding defeat all 
three times). 
</P>
<P>
 Concurrently, I've had dire misgivings about my work, profound questions about 
my behavior over the past few years, deep doubts about the quality of my heart 
and a general climate of fretfulness reigning over my soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the circle was complete: A quest for diversion led to sport; sport led 
to performance; performance led to expectation; expectation to comparison; 
comparison to defeat; and defeat killed the fun, paving the way for a diversion 
from the diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the sportsman asks, why am I doing this to myself? I stayed up 
for the better part of a night, wondering how to rethink this game, how to 
bring the fun back into it, how to make the heartbeat with excitement rather 
than anxiety. I will confess that I came up with no answers at all, just a 
brooding sense of loss of what had once been a naive and innocent joy. 
</P>
<P>
 But I do suspect that the solution lies in getting back to meaninglessness 
somehow, and that there are few better tools for this than a fuzzy yellow ball, 
an oversized racquet, a court of arbitrary dimension and a scoring system in 
which zero is called love. 
</P>
<P>
 One key, I think, must lie in that very difficult act of remembering -- 
remembering, exactly, what to forget.

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: HEADING SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a scene that brings to mind Scarlett O'Hara being squeezed into her 
waist-nipper before the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, Ina DiGrazia is being laced 
into a 12-eyelet corset. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarlett, you'll recall, had one thing in mind: Ashley Wilkes. 
</P>
<P>
 DiGrazia, too, has one thing in mind: Pulling off a Southern belle bit as a 
model at Friday night's Las Floristas Headdress Ball at the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in a day's work for DiGrazia and the other seven members of Las 
Floristas who will be headdress mannequins. 
</P>
<P>
 For her brief moment of glory beneath a towering peach, silver and white 
Southern fantasy, DiGrazia will have put in 150 hours of work. All that gluing, 
rehearsals, fittings, makeup . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But it's worth it, she says. "I guess it's like the old Jack Bailey show, 
'Queen for a Day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In early February in something akin to a football draft, she was picked by 
Long Beach florist Duane Rose as his mannequin. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a headdress is a bit like designing a Rose Parade float for the head. 
But "more tedious," says Rose, who knows -- he's also done floats. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, figuring his life "was already in disarray," he said yes once again 
when Las Floristas called. Besides, he asks, "How many casket pieces can you 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pondering the ball theme, "Las Floristas Celebrates the South," Rose toyed 
with the idea of the South Pole. He fancied DiGrazia "in an Eskimo outfit, with 
icebergs, floating chunks of ice, penguins . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But he got a cold shoulder from those in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 So he settled on "Southern Romance," a belle out for a stroll, all soft and 
pretty and romantic, under a magnolia tree, encircled by swimming swans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden under white orchids and peach roses will be DiGrazia's metal back 
brace, tucked into a pocket of that corset, keeping the weight on her hips, not 
her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 How those headdresses have grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1938, the year of the first ball, they were hat-sized. But by 1960 
they had evolved into extravaganzas and a surgeon was asked to design an 
orthopedically correct support system. Strict limits were set, including 
headdress weight (30 pounds), height (five feet) and circumference (six feet). 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, creativity occasionally ran amok. One mannequin was almost 
electrocuted in an electrifying number with twinkling lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're just making rose bouquets in a floral shop, you don't know diddly 
about what's going on here," says Rose, manager at Jerard's in Long Beach. 
"We're creating an illusion. A headdress is not supposed to just look like a 
big thing on your head." 
</P>
<P>
 They're also creating a package. Lights, music, choreography. Judges will 
scrutinize "Southern Romance" for everything from theme interpretation to how 
it moves. "Southern Romance" is up against seven other teams, including "The 
Devil Went Down to Georgia" and "Voo Doo Magic." 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 hours of petaling will have gone into "Southern Romance" by the time 
DiGrazia steps onstage to the strains of "Summertime." She has fit in 12-hour 
shifts around her job as a men's clothing rep. 
</P>
<P>
 The florists don't get rich. Each gets a stipend of $2,250, but their average 
outlay is more like $3,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Top winners will get cash bonuses of $1,500, $1,000 and $500. And, Rose says, 
it's a night for florists to show their stuff -- for charity. The ball is 
expected to raise $350,000 for handicapped children's clinics at County-USC 
Medical Center and Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey. (The ticket price is 
also bigger than it was in 1938 -- up from $3 to $175). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep it light, keep it light," Rose reminds himself as he hovers around his 
work-in-progress. His Long Beach home, a converted 1911 meeting house with a 
huge raftered living room, is a perfect workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Layering carnation petals on a foam magnolia, DiGrazia is saying, "It's kind 
of hard to find a Southern belle gown out there." She scoured bridal shops 
before settling on a peach number hanging in her closet. It's being Southerned 
up a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 She knows that her feet, even in mid-heel pumps, will protest the load. And, 
she says, "You always think you're going to be the first mannequin who just 
falls right off the runway." 
</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, at the Beverly Hilton, Rose will add the fresh flowers. Later, 
an impartial party will don "Southern Romance" and stand on a scale. A crucial 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow night, Rose will watch from the wings as DiGrazia makes her entrance 
a la Scarlett. His star in his creation. A L'Amour Market for Western Writers 
</P>
<P>
 We caught up with Kathy L'Amour at Edna Lillich Davidson's luncheon salon in 
Beverly Hills. She came bearing copies of Dell's new Louis L'Amour Western 
Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Its mission is to showcase new writers of traditional and not-so-traditional 
Western fiction and nonfiction travel articles, profiles, historical pieces. 
The May issue, the second, features a conversation with Elmore Leonard 
("Hombre"). 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, not surprisingly, are for boots and bolo ties, John Wayne and Roy 
Rogers video collections, country music compilations and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find her late husband's yarns therein. L'Amour, who divides her time 
between L.A. and her Colorado ranch, explains, "They needed a strong name to 
hook a magazine to. Louis was a natural. I knew this was something Louis would 
want to be a part of. He was always concerned about where young writers would 
get their opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 L'Amour, whose 32-year marriage to Louis ended with his death in 1988, tells 
of the lean days of the 1940s and '50s, when the Hopalong Cassidy books, which 
L'Amour wrote as "Tex Burns," earned him $900 each. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the pulps that paid the bills. They were the training ground for young 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes this sleek new bimonthly will fill that gap.

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: A NIGHT OF WINE, AUCTION AND SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opera and wine have always gone together. So, a quiz. In which opera does wine 
"take away this unhappiness?" In which does wine "mellow hearts to surrender?" 
In which is sung, "Champagne is so majestic -- tra-la-la-la-la?" 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. It all was music to the hearts of a heartily supping Los Angeles 
Opera International Wine Auction crowd of 500 at the Biltmore on Sunday 
evening. The Bowl was transformed into a vineyard with lattices and grapes for 
a silent auction, food wonders and operatic drinking songs. The wildly 
successful live auction conducted by Christie's Ursula Hermacinski was 
highlighted by honorary co-chair Joe Smith's bid of $2,400 for six bottles of 
rare Australian red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end, co-chairman Warner Henry tallied a net close to $175,000. The 
event, Los Angeles Music Center Opera's first benefit wine auction, was the 
brainchild of Robert Bookman, who had noted the successes of Chicago and 
Houston opera wine auctions and said, "Why not here?" 
</P>
<P>
 An illustrious crowd: First bidder Tom Jones, Sir Anthony and Lady Tennent, 
David and Margie Barry, Alice Coulombe, Royce and Joyce Diener, Nelson and 
Sharon Rising, Joyce and Herb Rosenblum, Joan and John Hotchkis, Val and Bob 
Montgomery, Jamie and Julie Kellner, Selim Zilkha and Michael and Nancy 
Harahan. 
</P>
<P>
 Said LAMCO general director Peter Hemmings: "What's so nice is that I know 
only 10% of the people. These are all new friends for opera." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 D Is for . . . : What makes fund-raising so exciting is the combination of 
frivolity and seriousness. Pierre, a majestic standard poodle, shook hands with 
certain guests at Barbara Davis' home, The Knoll, in Beverly Hills on Tuesday 
afternoon. Two pastel carousel horses flanked the front door. And the social 
pitch was high in the huge foyer with white cymbidiums and full-blown pink 
roses catching the vibes from a couture-conscious crowd of 70. Barbara, crisp 
in a pink Chanel suit with her hair tied back in a black chiffon bow, hugged 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as all sat to lunch, the drama began. Standing next to Nancy Reagan, the 
hostess held up a needle and a vial: "This is a needle and this is a bottle of 
insulin and my daughter uses this four times a day. This is a blood meter . . . 
to see how much insulin you use in a day. Without this needle and without this 
insulin, your life would not go on. Diabetes is a terrifying and horrible 
disease. You are here because you can save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Who could resist Davis' appeal? It was her way of kicking off the next 
Carousel of Hope on Oct. 28 at the Beverly Hilton. The biannual Carousel balls, 
with the generosity of her husband Marvin, tend to net $5 million consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostess said, "I have driven you crazy. I am a pain in the neck. . . . 
When I called, were you really out of town a month, Barbara Thornhill?"  
</P>
<P>
 Then she noted two important factors about the ball. Half the benefit tables 
are pre-sold for $1.917 million and, "In five years we will be able to prevent 
diabetes from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 A joyous crowd included Davis' daughters Dana, who has diabetes, and Nancy -- 
they will head the major auction. Friends turning somersaults to help: Betsy 
Bloomingdale, Joanne Kozberg, Marcia Hobbs, Natalie Cole, Lynn Palmer, Katrina 
Leffler (in a stunning Karl Lagerfeld), Justine Bloomingdale, Joanna Poitier, 
Marion Jorgensen, Jean Smith, Dr. George Eisenbarth, Nancy Livingston, Eleanor 
Lambert, Seth Baker, Wanda Ruddy, Marion Scharffenberger and designer Emanuel 
Ungaro, who popped in for a mammoth lemon meringue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton will be honorary Carousel of Hope chairwoman, and 
entertaining will be Neil Diamond, Placido Domingo, Jay Leno and Phil Collins 
-- just for starters.

 What's Success? Five million in 29 years to the L.A. Philharmonic? Hundreds of 
youth concerts? Thousands of children learning an oboe from a bassoon on a 
Music Mobile? An annual artsy Showcase of Interior Design? Thirty years of 
stupendous Premiere Nights?  
</P>
<P>
 Give the Pasadena Junior Philharmonic Committee plaudits. Friday evening, 450 
shuttled black-tie to the Linda Vista area Georgian house Pegfair to see the 
30th anniversary house and gardens decorated by Southland designers.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, headed by president Judy Frank, benefit chairwoman Susan Clayton and 
Premiere Night chairwoman Judy Epley, they returned to the Ritz Carlton, 
Huntington, for a '20s feathers/boas shindig under tented tennis courts.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerry McCluggage, chairman of Paramount Television Group, joined his wife 
Vickie, a Junior Philharmonic Committee member, before a 10 p.m. flight to 
Paris. Merlin and Susan Olsen flew in from Deer Valley, Utah. Showcase remains 
open to the public till May 15.

President Kit Joyce, Suzanne Dillard, Marilyn Silva, Rena Old, Peggy Edwards

TED TURNER HOOKED BY AMERICAN OCEANS

 Recalling his days as an avid sailor, Ted Turner admitted that he used to sing 
"The Oceans Belong to Me" in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can own them," the broadcasting entrepreneur said as he accepted the 
American Oceans Campaign Partners Award on Monday night at the Beverly 
Hilton."My wife, Jane, and I work very, very hard to try to make the world a 
better place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 AOC President Ted Danson acknowledged the presence of his children, Kate and 
Alexis, with his ex-wife, their mother, Casey Coates Danson, in the audience of 
supporters of restoration and preservation of America's oceans. Casey Danson is 
a co-founder and vice president of AOC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, I think there should be children at all these tables, because 
that's why we are doing this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I'm not doing 'Cheers' and I can't just write a big check, I find it 
easier to ask people to help," said Danson, who describes himself as "the 
emotional voice" of the advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Also present for the dinner of salad, salmon and strawberries were Danson's 
onetime "Cheers" cohort Kelsey Grammer; Gregory and Veronique Peck; Sam Elliott 
and Katherine Ross; Mariel Hemingway; Rob Reiner; AOC board members Joanna 
Kerns, Robert Sulnick and Mark Ryavec; former astronaut Buzz Aldrin; Jane 
Fonda, and her stepmother, Shirlee Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try not to be eating and keep smiling," the sleekly groomed Jane Fonda said 
as she instructed Larry King's wife, Sharon, on the art of looking good for the 
mass of photographers milling around. 
</P>
<P>
 King, the evening's emcee, trotted out the same collection of Yogi Berra jokes 
he used when he was honored by the American Friends of the Hebrew University in 
the same ballroom in February, but, luckily, they seemed foolproof.

 OC High asks: Should teens be required to go to school? 
</P>
<P>
 "They should go to school, because (otherwise) our whole country would be a 
bunch of uneducated ignorant idiots." Erika Sandino, 17 senior, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "What else are they going to do? It's not like they're going to get a job 
staying at home." Erick Moreno, 16 junior, Santiago 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't, you're going to be stupid." Bill Finn, 15 freshman, Los 
Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you think what the world would be like if it was run by people with an 
eighth-grade education?" Tammy Bennett, 17 senior, Mater Dei 
</P>
<P>
 "No. The people who don't want an education just sit at school and do nothing 
anyway." Chien Chu, 17 junior, El Modena  
</P>
<P>
 "If teen-agers are forced to go to school, they won't put in any effort and 
they will waste the government's money. Instead, the government should give a 
better education to people who want to go to school." Biren Metha, 17 senior, 
Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
 "No. I think it is a student's choice whether he or she wishes to learn." 
Sujit Pradham, 16 junior, University 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. Aren't Americans stupid enough?" Robert Solmer, 15 junior, Huntington 
Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are stupid enough not to go to school, you shouldn't be there in the 
first place." Yi-Hsien Lin, 17 senior, El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, or else we would have a lot more people on welfare because today's job 
market doesn't accept uneducated people." Aaron Sauser freshman, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the education but . . . part of the basic growing experience of 
life and becoming an adult." Samm Prather, 15 sophomore, Esperanza  
</P>
<P>
 "Students who don't want to attend school make it harder for those who do want 
to attend. They spend more time disturbing the class than learning." Diane 
Lopez, 15 junior, Loara  
</P>

 So what's it like to shave your legs? -- if you're a boy, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 The Accolade, the student newspaper at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, 
went right to the source -- males on the swim team -- for the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many male swimmers are at first repelled by the idea of shaving their arms and 
legs to improve their swimming times, especially since some haven't even 
started shaving their faces yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really hurt. It stung and burned so bad . . . some of my skin was taken 
off," said one male swimmer. Reported another: "The first time you get in the 
water, it feels really strange. You get fast and slimy. The worst part is when 
it is growing back and itches." 
</P>
<P>
 The up side? Girls "really admire how soft our legs are." One female 
concurred: "I think it's kind of funny . . . when their legs look better than 
yours."

 The Esperanza Aztlan, the student newspaper at Esperanza High School in 
Anaheim, interviewed recent transfer students about their assumptions and 
expectations about Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Some revelations: "Kids out here are really into surf wear, and the high 
school is different because it has an outdoor campus," said a transfer student 
from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 A transplant from North Carolina thought, based on media stereotypes, that 
there would be more convertibles full of teens and surfboards headed to the 
beach. What she found is that teens are basically the same. However, she says, 
teens here are more sensitive to what they say and have learned to avoid 
trouble as a result of the closer living quarters.

YESTERDAY, THE HOAXES SEEMED SO FAR AWAY; BOOKS: ANDRU J. REEVE'S 'TURN ME ON, 
DEAD MAN' RELIVES AMERICA'S OBSESSION WITH PAUL MCCARTNEY'S RUMORED DEMISE. 
</P>

<P>
 By now, most people are aware that the Fab Three are recording some new 
Beatles music, working with demo tapes of the late John Lennon provided by his 
widow, Yoko Ono.  
</P>
<P>
 In some circles, of course, this actually means that the Fab Two are 
recording, because Paul McCartney has been dead since Nov. 9, 1966, killed in a 
car crash and replaced by look-alike William Campbell in the most elaborate pop 
hoax of all time. It first became public in the fall of 1969, when clues 
allegedly planted by the Beatles themselves were finally uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 What, you missed this? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this will ring a bell: 
</P>
<P>
 As the Beatles cross "Abbey Road," McCartney is out of step. He's barefoot 
(that's how corpses are buried in Italy) and holding a cigarette in his right 
hand (the real McCartney was famously left-handed). The license of a VW Beetle 
in the background reads "28IF" -- the age McCartney would have been that year . 
. . if he had lived! 
</P>
<P>
 Or take the "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" cover. It includes a 
foreground flower arrangement (beside a grave!) that looks like both a P and a 
left-handed bass guitar, and an open-handed palm above McCartney's head (an 
Eastern blessing for someone about to receive a religious burial). 
</P>
<P>
 Or those unsettling audio clues: the distorted voice saying "I buried Paul" at 
the end of a slowed-down "Strawberry Fields Forever." And there's that weirdest 
of tracks: "Turn me on dead man" can be heard when the words number nine in 
"Revolution 9" are played backward. 
</P>
<P>
 Spooky, no? 
</P>
<P>
 Now you can relive those yesterdays in Andru J. Reeve's "Turn Me On, Dead Man: 
The Complete Story of the Paul McCartney Death Hoax," published by Popular 
Culture, Ink. The 218-page book uncovers the origins and evolution of events in 
the fall of 1969, when rumors of McCartney's death were the bizarre obsession 
of American radio, newspapers and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeve, ironically, was only 7 in 1969 and doesn't remember the original buzz. 
But he came across a two-page account of those weird events in the late 
Nicholas Schaffner's 1977 book, "The Beatles Forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably not fair for me to write about it," Reeve says from Sacramento, 
where he works as a television news tape editor. "But even though there had 
been books about every aspect of the Beatles, nobody had done this, and I 
realized there was an opening." 
</P>
<P>
 When he started on the book in 1988, Reeve was working at Biznet while 
spending most of his free time researching at the Library of Congress and 
interviewing key figures involved in the hoax, particularly Detroit deejay Russ 
Gibb, who first fielded phone calls about the rumor, and University of Michigan 
graduate Fred LaBour, whose lengthy expose in the Oct. 14, 1969, Michigan Daily 
is considered the catalyst for much of the madness that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney himself, Reeve recounts, never quite knew how to handle the rumors 
of his death, shifting from initial "No comments" to such typically flippant 
replies as "Don't even feel under the weather!" McCartney also said of the 
impostor Campbell: "Splendid . . . he can deal with John." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeve also pinpoints a possible starting point for the Paul Is Dead rumor: 
musician and Grand Funk Railroad manager Terry Knight and his 1969 single, 
"Saint Paul." Usually thought of as a hoax-fueled novelty, this very strange 
song actually came out in May 1969 -- five months before the first article on 
the subject appeared in the campus paper at Drake University in Iowa. More 
mysteriously, "Saint Paul" is the only Knight composition administered by 
Maclen Music -- McCartney and Lennon's exclusive publishing company.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's my original contribution" to hoax history, Reeve says. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeve's research pulls all this and much more information together, with a 
back-of-the-book nod to other Beatles rumors and an index with more than 70 
clues (and analysis). 
</P>
<P>
 The book is available for $40 from Popular Culture, Ink., P.O. Box 1839, Ann 
Arbor, Mich. 48106; by calling (800) 678-8828, or from Borders Bookstores and

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: DON'T PUT '50S ROCK PAST BIG SANDY; THE BAND'S 
LEADER AND CREW TAKE THE BEST ASPECTS OF ROOTS MUSIC AND, RATHER THAN BEING 
MERE RECYCLERS, DELIVER THEM WITH VITALITY. 
</P>

<P>
 If they could find a working contraption like the one H.G. Wells imagined, the 
two co-founders of Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys know where they would end up: 
Back in the 1950s, when the world was just learning to rock. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be no visit, says bassist Wally Hersom, who, at 25, can't remember 
the '60s, let alone the '50s. He would set the controls circa 1954, the year of 
Elvis Presley's famous Sun Sessions, and never return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked about it a lot with friends," said Hersom, a gangly scarecrow of 
a man whose angular face, toothy smile, slicked-back hair and thick, 
squared-off tortoise-shell eyeglass frames make you think instantly of Buddy 
Holly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some friends who share his passion for the music, cars and clothes of the 
1950s would rather pursue their fascination retrospectively, while continuing 
to live in the more tolerant 1990s, Hersom says. But given the chance, he would 
trade the present for the past and not come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert (Big Sandy) Williams, the tall, barrel-shaped bandleader, says that he 
would do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 With time travel unlikely, Williams, Hersom and the three other members of the 
Orange County-based Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys have done the next best 
thing. Their live shows and their just-released album, "Jumping From 6 to 6," 
retrieve some of the best aspects of the roots-music past and pull them alive 
and gleefully kicking into the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting together elements of the rockabilly of Presley and Gene Vincent, the 
Western swing of Bob Wills, and the honky-tonk music of Hank Williams and 
George Jones, Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys sound as if they themselves had 
just stepped out of a time machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sound is an authentic representation of its period-piece inspirations, 
yet the delivery is so infectious and brimming with vitality, native enthusiasm 
and assurance that they sound less like rehashers of past music than 
discoverers of some eternal wellspring of high spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 In concept, Big Sandy can be labeled a retro act. In concert, or on compact 
disc (a format still little-known to Williams, who is an avid and encyclopedic 
collector of old vinyl), the beholder will be too busy grinning and tapping 
toes to categorize. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersom thumps a bass fiddle while poker-faced drummer Bobby Trimble, 23, 
ignites the beat with explosive fills that have antecedents in big-band swing. 
Guitarist Ashley Kingman and steel-guitar player Lee Jeffriess, both 
transplanted Englishmen, play off each other in lively skittering dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 29, is the key to the band's ability to sound fresh while sounding 
old. His singing is smooth, rich and creamy, full of unstudied, unforced 
pleasure. Williams never strains for an effect, sounding natural and completely 
at home with everything he sings. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of it is original material with simple, innocent lyrics about the 
pleasures of rocking or the human comedy of falling in love, getting dumped, 
then starting the cycle all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether his band is creating something fresh or just exhuming 
the past "only comes up in interviews," Williams said recently between bites of 
arroz con pollo during an al fresco lunch in Orange. He is a genial, 
soft-spoken man who forms his thoughts slowly and deliberately, then unleashes 
them in staccato bursts. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can be into any new band, (yet) they can come and see us and enjoy it. 
To these kids, it's new music. Our point of view is (to play) as if this is all 
new music." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Hersom both began playing 10 years ago in bands on Orange 
County's rockabilly revival scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams already had a good grounding in roots music: "There was always a lot 
of music in my family. Coming from a mixed (background), my mother being 
Mexican, my father being Anglo, we listened to the R&B and doo-wop she listened 
to, while my dad was very much into rockabilly." 
</P>
<P>
 Big Sandy's own tastes leaned toward New Wave when he started buying records 
in junior high. Hersom teases him about knowing all the words to songs by the 
Knack. But it was rockabilly that pulled him in when he decided at 19 that he 
wanted to be in a band. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersom wasn't interested in music until he heard the Stray Cats and other 
rockabilly revival bands. That, he says, is when "I first found out what it 
feels like to love music."  
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, Hersom and Williams fell into what they refer to as a subset within 
the neo-rockabilly movement -- the fans and musicians who weren't content with 
the recycled forms of the music, but wanted to delve back deeply into its 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
 It took them a few years to form a band around their idea of playing music 
that would have the feel of the real thing, rather than being a contemporary 
re-creation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be more traditional, but it was difficult to get a group of guys 
together that shared that vision," Hersom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had the right people," Williams chimed in. "We needed a guitar 
player who was not so influenced by Brian Setzer (of the Stray Cats) but was 
more into Cliff Gallup (Gene Vincent's lead guitarist) or Merle Travis." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, they found T.K. Smith, a guitarist well-versed in the authentic 
rockabilly sound, and Trimble soon joined in place of original drummer Will B. 
The band's name was inspired by the name-patch on a hand-me-down uniform jacket 
Williams had gotten from his uncle Santiago, whose nickname is Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, they issued "Fly Right With Big Sandy and the Fly Rite Trio," on a 
tiny Burbank label, Dionysus Records. Favorable reviews in the English music 
press prompted the band to tour there and win a respectable following. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's connections with the English rockabilly scene led to the 
recruitment of steel player Jeffriess, a nimble instrumentalist whose arrival 
allowed them to pursue the Western-swing influences they had long wanted to 
explore. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Go," an album recorded before Jeffriess joined, appeared in 1992 on a 
London-based label, No Hit Records. That fall, British rock star Morrissey 
found himself in need of an opening act for his U.S. tour. His guitar player, 
Boz Boorer, had come up on the British rockabilly-revival scene, and pointed 
him toward Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's month of cross-country touring with Morrissey won it some new fans 
but cost it a talented guitarist when Smith became tired of the touring life 
that the other members avidly wish to pursue. Again tapping their English 
rockabilly connections, they came up with Kingman, who joined about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With two releases on obscure labels, the next goal was to land a 
higher-profile record deal. But there was no clamor for a young band that wove 
various venerable influences into a hard-to-categorize style that fit no radio 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Big Sandy and his band found an influential champion in Dave 
Alvin, the respected Los Angeles roots-rock singer-songwriter who had moved 
from the Blasters and X to a productive solo career on HighTone Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin liked what he heard on stage, and helped Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys 
land a deal with HighTone. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview, Alvin said that he had been a fan for several years. 
His interest became more urgent after he heard Big Sandy sing Hank Williams' 
honky-tonk lament, "Weary Blues From Waitin'," at a show last fall at the 
Palomino in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I was convinced," Alvin said. "It was as close as someone could 
get to the intensity of Hank Williams, but it didn't sound like a knockoff, and 
it floored me." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin was impressed that the band was not limited to the energetic, 
lighthearted jumping swing and rockabilly that was its signature, but could 
also pull off a song with deeper feeling. "It kind of showed their depth, what 
they're capable of and may (achieve) in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The album was recorded live in January at Capitol Records Studio B in 
Hollywood, which Alvin picked for its large-room atmosphere and its association 
with classic recordings by Gene Vincent, Buck Owens and others. Alvin came away 
impressed by Williams' consistency and staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recording was four days in a row, 11-hour days, cutting live. Most 
singers I've known and worked with or seen in the studio, as professional as 
some of them are, will bitch or lose it after several hours. Sandy never 
complained and maybe once or twice hit a flat note. I'd say, 'You've been in 
here 10 hours nonstop, and your voice hasn't shredded, you're hitting every 
damn note, and you're doing it all day long. You're a great singer.' And he'd 
say, 'No, man, you're kidding me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If that time machine did exist, Big Sandy and company could go back to the 
mid-'50s and stand a very good chance of making it big with such songs as 
"Hi-Billy Music," a thoroughly engaging and catchy Williams original. "If you 
don't dig hi-billy music. . . . It's the sound that's sweeping around most 
anywhere," he sings with cool-cat charm over a swinging backup. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, though, the alternative-rock world is consumed with much darker 
musings. It's hip to sound infected, not infectious. Country radio, meanwhile, 
treats the music's deepest roots as if they were an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash and George Jones may well do back flips 
when they hear "Jumpin' From 6 to 6," but that won't get the album played on 
contemporary country stations, which seldom depart from music with a slick, 
modern sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no set niche they can fit us into," Hersom acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan now is to go on the road -- with an eye toward landing bookings at 
country and roots-oriented music festivals -- and plow a furrow of their own. 
Williams and Hersom say the band aims to keep expectations low while stepping 
up its touring efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hersom put it, "If we can just get it out there in the stores, and we're 
out there playing and in people's faces, they'll hear it and like it, and it'll 
create a market." 
</P>
<P>
 * Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys play Friday at 9:30 p.m. at Linda's Doll Hut, 
107 S. Adams St., Anaheim. $5. (714) 533-1286. The band also plays April 30 at 
Jack's Sugar Shack in Los Angeles, (310) 271-7887, and May 7 at the Tiki Room 
in Costa Mesa, (714) 548-3533.

HOW DEEP IS UNIVERSAL INTO 'WATERWORLD'?; MOVIES: CHAIRMAN TOM POLLOCK DENIES 
THE PRICE TAG IS $100 MILLION FOR A FUTURISTIC OCEAN DRAMA STARRING KEVIN 
COSTNER SET TO BE FILMED OFF HAWAII THIS SUMMER.

<P>
 Universal Pictures is planning to buck the recent industry trend of trying to 
pare back huge budgets and embark this summer on a Kevin Costner film called 
"Waterworld" that, according to film industry sources, is projected to cost 
$100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The staggering price tag is confirmed by several sources on the lot but is 
hotly disputed by the studio's chairman, Tom Pollock, who contends the budget 
is actually closer to $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making the film at this budget," Pollock insisted. "It's irresponsible 
to say that a film costs any number, much less something as outrageous as this, 
when the movie hasn't even begun. People like to bad-mouth other people's 
movies before they are started." 
</P>
<P>
 But one source at Universal confirmed that the numbers for "Waterworld" are 
already "off the boards" and that studio executives are trying to keep the data 
close to the vest. This source said $100 million is a strong ballpark figure. 
In fact, sources said there has been speculation for several weeks that if 
costs on "Waterworld" soar too high, Universal would simply pull the plug, but 
that is not under consideration now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God -- good luck getting your money back," said Don Rudkin, managing 
partner of the communications division of the Hollywood consulting firm 
Deloitte & Touche, of the $100-million figure. "I wouldn't (go forward with 
such a huge budget); it's such a crapshoot to begin with. We already proved 
this with Schwarzenegger (in "Last Action Hero") that a big star can't always 
carry a picture. . . . You're not even factoring in cost of prints and ads and 
marketing. If I was a Universal shareholder, I'd be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the size of the projected budget is true, "Waterworld" would become one of 
the industry's most expensive films. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger's next 
film, "True Lies," reportedly cost $120 million and will be released by 20th 
Century Fox this summer. But unlike that film or the "Terminator" films, 
"Waterworld," an apocalyptic adventure film, is not expected to have 
state-of-the-art special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Its huge budget would seem to fly in the face of recent concerns in Hollywood 
over overblown expenditures. Before the cameras rolled on Eddie Murphy's 
"Beverly Hills Cop III," for example, Paramount Pictures chief Sherry Lansing 
called a temporary halt to production when she became alarmed that costs had 
climbed into the $70-million range. The film, now with a smaller budget, is 
scheduled to open May 25. And earlier this year, United Artists reportedly 
decided not to renew its option on "Higgins and Beech," a Korean War drama 
starring Richard Gere and Michelle Pfeiffer, because filming in Korea or China 
would have caused the budget to climb to between $40 million and $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for some concern about a high budget for "Waterworld" is that 
the film does not have huge above-the-line expenditures since Costner, who will 
receive $14 million, is expected to be the only big-name star. Its director is 
Kevin Reynolds, who directed "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," which also 
starred Costner. 
</P>
<P>
 Without special effects or huge star salaries, the only thing that could make 
"Waterworld" so phenomenally expensive, sources say, is that it is to be filmed 
on water. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, described as " 'Road Warrior' on water," is set in the future, when 
the polar ice caps have melted, deluging the earth. A group of rag-tag good 
guys living on top of the ocean fight bad guys who have oil and power. Costner 
plays a character called Mariner, who has gills and fins. Some have already 
nicknamed the movie "Splash II" for Mariner's mermaid-like attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 A set is being built in Kawaihae Harbor on the west side of the island of 
Hawaii. Filming could begin as early as mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock would not discuss the film's budget in detail, but Largo 
Entertainment, which originally had the "Waterworld" project a year ago, 
forfeited the picture because of anticipated budget overruns. One former Largo 
source, who had been involved with the project at the time, said the budget 
back then was expected to be about $65 million to $70 million. And that was 
merely a projection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooting on water is one of the most expensive endeavors you could ever 
undertake," the source said. "With water, you have terrible problems: the color 
of the water and light on it constantly changing, the winds blowing in the 
wrong direction, waves can change in an instant. And, in a place like Hawaii, 
you run the risk of hurricanes. There's no way you can really predict anything. 
We finally had to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock himself doesn't dispute that unforeseen circumstances could make 
production costs go up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible that things can go over budget," he said. "You're on the water 
and things can go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he is "keeping his fingers crossed" that another hurricane 
doesn't hit the Hawaiian islands as Iniki did in September, 1992, while Steven 
Spielberg was filming Universal's "Jurassic Park," causing widespread 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather is bad, then that is a problem with shooting on water," 
Pollock said. "Other than that, I don't think it will cost a penny more than 
the price at which it came in."  
</P>
<P>
 Pollock denied that there have been any mishaps to date with "Waterworld" that 
have caused costs to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Universal source, part of the sets under construction have 
already sunk once. They were large pontoons flown in from France that were 
supposed to hold everything up, but the crews managed to retrieve them, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No such thing ever occurred," Pollock said.

MINING FRENCH NOVELS FOR A GEM; 'DEEP PERSONAL REASONS' LED DIRECTOR CLAUDE 
BERRI TO TAKE ON 'GERMINAL,' THE STORY OF COAL MINERS' LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With "Jean de Florette" and "Manon of the Spring" in the late '80s, the 
prolific French producer-director Claude Berri reached a new plateau in a film 
career that began in 1967 with the semi-autobiographical "Two of Us," about an 
anti-Semitic old farmer who nevertheless loves the little Jewish boy he 
shelters during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In their power and simplicity, "Jean de Florette" and "Manon of the Spring," 
tales of greed and revenge set in a harsh countryside, hearkened back to French 
screen classics characterized by masterful acting and storytelling, the era of 
Marcel Pagnol, who wrote the novels upon which the two-part saga was based. It 
did not seem possible that Berri could ever equal his Pagnol films, yet many 
critics believe he has with his rich and uncompromising film of Emile Zola's 
"Germinal," a bleak but tempestuous drama depicting the harsh lot of French 
coal miners. The film, which played a one-week run in December, began a regular 
run Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could think that I take refuge in the great novels," Berri said in a 
recent interview, conducted partly through an interpreter in his West Hollywood 
hotel, "but that is not the case. I had very deep personal reasons for filming 
'Germinal.' It has to do with the lower-class environment of my childhood and 
especially my father. If I had not had the kind of father I had, I could not 
have made 'Germinal.'  
</P>
<P>
 "My father had a great sense of injustice. He was a worker, a furrier, with a 
great sense of class consciousness. He was born in Krakow just before World War 
I but was raised in France. It was easier for him to be politically conscious 
because he always had to fight in his life; it has been a much easier life for 
me, in making films. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably something deep down in my childhood that pushed me to do 
this film, but I'm not the only one involved in the film who felt that way. 
Gerard Depardieu (who plays the leader of a bitter miners' strike) wanted to do 
the film because his father had been a union man, a metal worker. Miou-Miou, 
who plays his wife, wanted to be in it because her mother sold vegetables in 
Les Halles. They both came to me, but from the start I had wanted Renaud to 
play the young man, the newcomer to the mining community; I did not know that 
he was the grandson of a coal miner! Renaud, who had never been in a film 
before, is a singer very well known in France. I told him he ought to be making 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berri, a small man with thinning hair and a graying beard who will turn 60 in 
July, exudes a youthful passion for the cinema. Had he never directed a single 
scene, he would still be one of France's most successful and venturesome film 
figures, having worked as a producer with directors such as the challenging 
Roman Polanski ("Tess"), Milos Forman ("Valmont") and Jean-Jacques Annaud ("The 
Lover"). 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a great emotion in reading 'Germinal,' " Berri says, "and thought it a 
good subject to reflect upon -- that it would be timeless and universal. When I 
decided to do the film, I didn't know the extent to which it was contemporary 
as well. I wanted a true film d'auteur even if I was not the original author. 
It is also not a producer's film -- no European producer could have taken on a 
budget that large -- $30 million -- which is enormous in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the profits from 'Jean de Florette' and 'Manon of the Spring,' plus 
those of 'The Bear,' " he continues, relating how he financed "Germinal." "It 
was not as complicated to do as you might think because you've created a whole 
universe for the film. You don't make a film alone, after all, and I had great 
set designers, Thanh At Hoang and Christian Marti." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the cost was Berri's insistence on shooting in the coal-mining 
region of northern France, where mining stopped only several years ago, and in 
adhering to Zola's cycle of seasons. This meant a staggering shooting schedule 
of seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspects that Berri would rather not be cast in the role of an industry 
spokesman, yet he takes pains to explain his position on the perceived problem 
of American film overwhelming the European screen. He believes that the quotas 
imposed by French TV on the number of American programs aired is essential to 
preserving the French film industry because much of its financing comes from 
television. On the other hand, he places a great deal of the blame for the 
paucity of European films on both French and American screens to a general 
decline in the quality of European product. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the same quality as in the '60s or early '70s," Berri says. "There 
is no more Bergman, Fellini or Bunuel, no early Demy, no great Italian 
comedies. Godard is a big influence on young filmmakers, but unfortunately 
there are not many young Godards. In Europe we are lacking entertainment films. 
Thanks to financing from French TV's Canal Plus some 30 to 50 young filmmakers 
are able to make their debut films -- but how many are good?" 
</P>
<P>
 Berri singles out Christian Vincent, director of "La Discrete," and Bruno 
Nuytten, a top cinematographer who made his directorial debut with "Camille 
Claudel," as young filmmakers who impress him. 
</P>
<P>
 Berri is already thinking about his next film. "I have an idea for a film 
about the French Resistance. It will be an original screenplay but based on a 
true story. I have to ask myself, 'What would I have done if I had been 20 when 
World War II broke out?' It is about the way a woman got her husband out of a 
Gestapo prison in Lyon. It is a love story, and it takes place during her 
pregnancy."

A FUSION IN FLORIDA; DANCE: MIAMI CITY BALLET'S JIMMY GAMONET DE LOS HEROS 
STAYS IN STEP WITH LATINO ROOTS BUT IS AS LIKELY TO DRAW FROM COMPUTERS, THE 
CLASSICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Gamonet de los Heros, resident choreographer of the Miami City Ballet, 
is a mixmaster of an unusual sort. A neoclassicist of the Balanchine school, 
he's making his mark with ballets that are as likely to be inspired by computer 
programs as Andean marriage rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the combination of old and new, European and Latin American 
influences, is a trademark not just of the man, but of the acclaimed young 
company to which he belongs. Founded and led by Edward Villella, the hotshot 
star of the New York City Ballet during the 1960s and '70s, the Miami City 
Ballet makes its awaited Southern California premiere Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented at the Wiltern Theatre by the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts, 
the company will offer two different bills, including four dances by its 
stylistic godfather, George Balanchine. Also featured will be four works by 
Gamonet de los Heros: "Nous Somme" (1986), "Danzalta" (1992) and "Divertimento 
Espanol" (1994) on Friday, and "D Symphonies" (1994) on Saturday. Both 
"Danzalta" and "Divertimento Espanol" were commissioned by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 These two dances also bear the signs of a hallmark style that has led 
reviewers to characterize the company's -- and the choreographer's -- work as 
Latin-flavored. Earlier this month, for instance, Jennifer Dunning wrote in the 
New York Times that the Miami company "dances with a Hispanic verve." 
</P>
<P>
 But these can be fighting words when you're an up-and-coming choreographer 
trying to avoid the proverbial artistic pigeonholes. And it's a particularly 
touchy issue for artists from culturally diverse backgrounds who are working in 
traditionally Eurocentric mediums. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamonet de los Heros, for one, has a "mixed reaction" to such critical 
epithets. "It depends on what they've seen," says the Peruvian-born artist, 36, 
who spoke by phone from Arizona, where the company was performing prior to this 
week's L.A. engagement. "When you see 'Danzalta' or 'Divertimento Espanol,' 
those are pieces that definitely have a Latin taste to them. It comes from the 
energy from the dancers -- that aggressive, go-for-it kind of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I do things in a neoclassical vein, I don't see them as Spanish," 
Gamonet de los Heros continues. "I don't think 'D Symphonies' and 'Nous Somme' 
show any Latin influence at all. I personally believe there's a tendency to 
label." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gamonet de los Heros began dancing as a teen-ager, with Lima's Ballet 
Nacional. He immigrated to the United States and met Villella in 1981 and has 
been with the Miami City Ballet since it was founded in 1986. Since then, he 
has developed a body of work that combines influences from his native Peru and 
other Latin American countries with the neoclassical style of the Balanchine 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danzalta," for instance, was inspired in part by Gamonet de los Heros' 
long-term interest in Ecuador's Andean region. Following a 1991 tour stop in 
Quito, the company was invited by government officials and diplomats to return 
to the region to research the indigenous culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were invited to find inspiration from the native costumes and art," says 
Gamonet de los Heros. "We met with local artists and musicians. I saw so much 
and I came out of it with a theme for a ballet: The piece is based on an Andean 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gamonet de los Heros also had trepidations about the feasibility of fusing 
such a traditional culture with the rigid style of 20th-Century Western ballet. 
"Before I took on the project, I thought -- especially given my experience of 
living in Peru -- that this was going to be tough," recalls the choreographer. 
"I was trying to look at some kind of physicality from the native dancers. It 
is simple and symmetrical, not as complicated as classical dance." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Miami City Ballet's design team found a ready pool of visual 
information, Gamonet de los Heros was initially stymied by the limited movement 
vocabulary of the region's dance. "To develop a complete work based on that was 
rough," he says. "So I was drawn to investigate more about pre-Inca work, to 
have more information." 
</P>
<P>
 He ended up finding ideas not just in the native Andean dances, but also in 
the movements of everyday street life. "When it came to the physicality, 
there're a lot of elements that I found just in the way people behave," he 
says. "The women walk with their upper backs bent forward -- because they are 
the ones who carry the weight (of packages), not the men, and their babies. 
They do it for so long that they have this tendency to lean forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Translating that kind of ingrained posture into ballet, however, wasn't 
necessarily simple for the choreographer: "I have certain turns in the 
beginning (of "Danzalta") where I had to explain that you have to drop the 
upper body. The tendency for dancers is to be a little more arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Divertimento Espanol" is Gamonet de los Heros' staging of Petipa's "Paquita," 
with the 19th-Century work dressed in what the choreographer describes as a 
"visually very aggressive style." There is a Spanish flavor here, but it is 
very different from the indigenous themes of "Danzalta." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gamonet de los Heros is just as comfortable creating dances that have 
nothing to do with his cultural heritage -- such as the neoclassical works 
"Nous Somme" and "D Symphonies." The former is a pas de deux and the latter, 
danced to Baroque music by C.P.E. Bach and J.C. Bach, was choreographed largely 
by computer and is described by the artist as "dance for the sake of dance." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this fusion of neoclassical and Latin sensibilities looks to become 
the trademark aesthetic for Miami City Ballet and Gamonet de los Heros, who 
concludes: "The styles do blend, it's just a question of how much of each 
element you take."

HIS EYE'S NOT ON THE PRIZE; THIRD PULITZER HASN'T MADE EDWARD ALBEE ANY 
MELLOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK PACHECO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time Edward Albee won the Pulitzer Prize -- in 1975 for "Seascape" -- 
the late producer Richard Barr joked, "We were burning the sets of the play 
when we heard the news." That's what producers do when a show closes. The drama 
had failed on Broadway, playing only 65 performances. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 11, when news of his third Pulitzer Prize, this time for the drama 
"Three Tall Women," reached the playwright, he was in Texas, where he is 
playwright-in-residence at the University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terribly discouraging," he said facetiously when interviewed on the 
phone early the next morning. "It makes one all grumpy and sad. Grump. Grump." 
</P>
<P>
 The comment itself is vintage Albee: a hint of a wicked self-mockery, mixed 
with reproof that a reporter would even ask how it feels to regain critical 
stature after nearly three decades of dismissive -- often brutal -- reviews and 
audience neglect. What do awards and public approbation have to do with the 
work at hand, which is, after all, writing plays? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a note of triumph can't help but creep into his soft, slight raspy 
voice when the 66-year-old playwright adds: "Of course, I'm surprised and 
delighted. But then I'm surprised when I don't win awards, too. Every artist 
has many lives and deaths and you really can't afford to think too much about 
it. There's never been much of a link between quality and popular acceptance, 
so you just keep on doing it on the assumption that you're doing good work." 
</P>
<P>
 Albee's fall from commercial and critical approbation had been all the more 
precipitous given his stunning successes in the early '60s, first with a widely 
hailed Off Broadway production of "Zoo Story," and then, on Broadway, with 
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," his acid-etched marital slugfest later 
translated to the screen in 1966 with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. 
Since then it's been a long dry spell. One would have to go all the way back to 
1983 to find a work of his on Broadway, "The Man With Three Arms," which 
received withering reviews and died quickly. Until recently, only academia and 
regional and foreign theaters have welcomed the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, his work had rarely been seen in New York at all until last fall, 
when the Signature Theatre, a small 77-seat house in downtown Manhattan decided 
to devote an entire season to his work. His latest play, "Fragments," opened 
two weeks ago and was the last in a lineup that included five New York 
premieres and two revivals. Like most of the other plays at the Signature, this 
abstract and enigmatic chamber piece met with respectful if unenthusiastic 
notices. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York critics' acclaim and the Pulitzer was reserved for "Three Tall 
Women," a play that received its world premiere in Vienna in 1991 and then 
played a now-defunct Upstate New York theater before bowing at Manhattan's 
Vineyard Theatre in January. The response was so strong that the production 
moved almost immediately to an open-ended commercial run at Off Broadway's 
Promenade Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Three Tall Women" an imperious 92-year-old woman played by 64-year-old 
veteran actress Myra Carter, simply identified by the letter "A," is based on 
Albee's rich socialite mother, Frances, whose tempestuous relationship with her 
son led her to disinherit him. She repeatedly told him, "I'm sorry I ever 
adopted you." 
</P>
<P>
 Albee gets his revenge. In the first act, she is an addled but remarkably 
feisty dowager who can't remember if she's 91 or 92. She alternately tyrannizes 
and is tyrannized by her young lawyer, "C," (Jordan Baker) and a middle-aged 
companion, "B" (Marian Seldes). At the end of the first act, the elderly woman 
suffers a stroke. At the beginning of the second act, what the audience takes 
to be her body lies motionless on a bed. But all three actresses suddenly 
materialize, each representing a different period in the matron's life. 
Sparring with their respectively younger or older selves, they review a 
lifetime of bent hopes and schemes with regret and lacerating humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, as he prepared "Three Tall Women" for its New York premiere, Albee 
reviewed his own life and career in his spacious TriBeCa loft, one of his three 
residences. Frances Albee may have disinherited him, but the playwright's early 
success made him a rich man. Against the backdrop of his stunning collection of 
primitive and contemporary art, the playwright spoke of the "tough old bird" 
who inspired the play that would represent his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was destructive and contemptible but there were reasons for her behavior, 
as there always are," he said. "Writing the play allowed me to understand her 
better, though I'm not sure I liked her any more or less than I already did." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he insisted that he isn't the type of writer who usually draws on his 
own life for subject matter, he admitted that writing "Three Tall Women" was a 
form of exorcism. "I just tried to get it all down," he said. "It's the theme: 
What is worse than coming to the end of your life filled with regret? I was 
interested in the facts, man, just the facts: the good stuff, the bad, the 
misplaced pride. The facts carry implications with them." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been often suggested that the playwright's steely iconoclasm and 
alienation stems from his adoption as a baby by Reed and Frances Albee, his 
father a wealthy scion of a vaudeville house chain and his mother a striking 
and ambitious one-time store model turned socialite. Their rebellious son, who 
grew up in a Larchmont, N.Y., mansion, got kicked out of a number of boarding 
schools and Trinity College before heading for Greenwich Village to steep 
himself deeply in the '50s counterculture and avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 He found his family's bourgeois values "detestable" and excoriated them in his 
1961 play "An American Dream" and in his first Pulitzer Prize-winning drama, "A 
Delicate Balance" in 1967. Although he got along better with his father -- he 
is recalled both with affection and bitterness in "Three Tall Women" -- Albee 
rarely returned home once he'd left.  
</P>
<P>
 Albee says that Frances was ambivalent about her son's stunning, if 
short-lived, early triumphs. On one hand, the social climber in her loved the 
celebrity and the famous people who eagerly sought out the enfant terrible of 
Broadway to boost the cachet of their dinner parties. On the other hand, she 
denigrated his bohemian and gay lifestyle. (In "Three Tall Women," the old 
woman is obviously homophobic, making a scathing reference to her son's young 
lovers.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His new work appears to be as corrosive and cutting as ever, especially when 
it comes to marriage. In typical Albee fashion, recrimination, reproof and 
betrayal affect the marriages represented not only in "Three Tall Women" but in 
two of his New York premieres at the Signature, "Finding the Sun," from 1982, 
and "Marriage Play" (1987). In the latter, he replays some of the airless and 
stultifying territory of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"; in the former, he 
scopes out new ground by presenting a gay couple who are no longer living 
together because, due to societal pressures, they have gotten mired in terribly 
unhappy marriages with women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against marriage," Albee said. "I've only railed against people 
who've continued in a relationship beyond its usefulness and continue in it 
dishonestly. It's the misuse and self-delusion that bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the man who has so wittily and viciously assailed the institution of 
marriage in his work takes a certain pride in his own long-term gay 
relationships, the present one having lasted for 23 years. He said he was the 
"happiest" he's been in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the domestic calm, he is at the same time insistent on the 
writer's role as social provocateur and critic. Sometimes playwriting attacks 
the problems directly, as in David Mamet's work, he explains, and other times, 
the approach is more subtle and ambiguous, as in his own. To those activists 
who fault him for not having written a play about AIDS, he responds that they 
don't understand his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all my plays confront being alive and how to behave with the 
awareness of death," he says. "If AIDS, on one level, is about how we, as a 
society, do not deal with what we don't want to deal with, if it is also about 
whether we should or not, then my plays have been about that from the very 
beginning. I now have a play I'm writing that tangentially touches on the 
matter of AIDS that will make a number of people very angry, but it's no 
departure for me." 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Albee has delighted in provoking audiences. (He maintained that 
he'd love to write screenplays but Hollywood hasn't exactly been beating down 
his door.) Yet, amid the bleakness and rage of his new work, one can detect the 
barest hint of redemption, if not optimism, seeping through. Yet the playwright 
will brook no suggestion that he has in any way mellowed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grump, grump," Albee mocks again, at the suggestion that perhaps the 
bloodletting in his plays lends a certain lucidity to the characters that will 
make the future, however limited, more hopeful. "I hope what you're suggesting 
is not a softening of my head," he said. "I do have persistent angers and 
concerns, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted that he would continue to mine those angers and concerns whether 
they met with popular and critical acceptance or not. "Yeah, I want to reach as 
wide an audience as possible but, alas, on my own terms. I don't want to 
compromise or oversimplify just to give myself the illusion of accomplishment. 
You start lying, telling half-truths, well, what's the point? Ascribe it to my 
arrogance -- an arrogance that any artist in the United States has got to have 
to survive -- but I can't really approach my work in any other way."DONNA

TOM JOYNER: THE WORK ETHIC WORKS; RADIO: THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO HOST A 
NATIONALLY SYNDICATED MORNING SHOW DOESN'T WANT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS EITHER A 
PIONEER OR A ROLE MODEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Joyner is so ambitious that he chose to do what probably no other radio 
personality would even consider. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, the disc jockey shuttled 1,610 miles a day to do a morning 
show in Dallas and an afternoon program in Chicago. Racking up more than 7 
million frequent-flier miles, Joyner rightfully earned the nicknames "fly jock" 
and "hardest-working man in radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that hard-driving work ethic has paid off as Joyner has become the first 
African American to host a nationally syndicated morning radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 These days he's heard in 37 cities around the country -- and he doesn't even 
have to leave his home base of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is breaking new ground as the first black man to host such a 
syndicated series, don't call Joyner a pioneer. Or a role model. He'll say he's 
simply in the business of providing good, clean fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to do entertaining radio and keep it clean every day," said 
Joyner, whose 5-10 a.m. weekday show is heard locally on KACE-FM (103.9). 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner believes his upbeat show will pave the way for other African American 
radio personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just the beginning," he declared in a telephone interview from the Dallas 
radio station where he broadcasts his show. "When everybody's put their success 
stamp on this, there will be lots more. I think of myself as being on the 
ground floor of something that's going to be around for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 With its debut in January, "The Tom Joyner Morning Show" -- syndicated by ABC 
Radio Networks -- joined the ranks of such nationally syndicated programs as 
those headed by Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joyner prefers not to be lumped together with either man, pointing out 
that, unlike Limbaugh or Stern, he plays music on his show. But he does pay 
grudging tribute to Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to say this but I think Howard Stern proved to radio that a syndicated 
morning show could work in a major market," Joyner said. "He proved that you 
could bring top-name talent to a major market and people would dig it. I can't 
stand Howard's program personally, but I have to thank him for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides playing about six R & B songs an hour, Joyner has a live band on the 
air with him -- although not in the same studio. Uncle Butchie and the Live 
House is hooked in from a studio in Chicago. It plays songs before and after 
station breaks and performs with guest artists a la Paul Schaffer on David 
Letterman's late-night TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 While music is an important element of Joyner's show, he refuses to play 
violence-laden gangsta rap, despite its popularity among teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in vogue now not to be into gangsta music, thank goodness," Joyner said. 
"I don't think I have to play gangsta rap to get the younger audience. If my 
audience wants it, then they're just going to have to go somewhere else to get 
it. . . . What we try to do is entertain positively. That's what's going to 
make our show work." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner began his entertainment career 25 years ago in what was then a 
little-known singing group that later became the Commodores, fronted by singer 
Lionel Richie. The two grew up together in Tuskegee, Ala. Indeed, Joyner still 
regularly kicks himself for quitting the group before it got famous. His family 
urged him to leave, believing the group had no future. He started working in 
radio a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bitter subject," Joyner quipped good-naturedly. "I've been friends 
with Lionel Richie since childhood. We go back to nursery school. And here I am 
getting up at 3 in the morning and he doesn't go to bed at 3 in the morning! Do 
I regret it? Here I am going to the bank every Friday and the bank comes to 
him. 'Got any checks for us today, Mr. Richie?' Don't get me started." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner's radio program is an energetic combination of comedy, music, sports, 
news and celebrity interviews. Some recent guests included Don King, Curtis 
Mayfield, Sam Donaldson, Aretha Franklin and Andrew Young.  
</P>
<P>
 Joyner also pays tribute on his morning show to one of his favorite forms of 
entertainment -- the soap opera. He's long been a soap opera aficionado and 
decided that instead of doing reports on "All My Children," as he used to 
during his Dallas show, he would create his own 90-second daily soap spoof. 
"It's Your World" is produced in Los Angeles and stars Roxanne Reese as 
Fontella, a businesswoman who owns a beauty shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner introduces the segment by recapping the last episode, then closes to 
the accompaniment of organ music.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the ratings for his first few months on the air in Los Angeles were 
among the lowest of all the stations tabulated by Arbitron -- Joyner finished 
in 37th place, attracting only .4% of the audience -- KACE officials said they 
plan to stick with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing people don't like is change," said KACE music director Mark 
Gunn. "I just think with time the show's going to work. . . . He's got a fresh 
perspective. It's almost a 'stop and smell the roses' type of thing. He's a 
very down-to-earth type of person. And you don't really get that much in 
morning radio anymore. You've got the superstar mentality that distances the 
listener from what's happening on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does he not have the arrogance of a superstar, Joyner also doesn't 
have much urge to become one. Don't look for him to make that now-familiar 
segue from radio personality to television star in the near future.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why (radio personalities) want to do it," he said. "They don't 
look so good. I don't look so good either, but I know my place. I'm glad to be 
here. I ain't looking for movies and television. I'm staying right in radio. On 
radio I look somewhere between Wesley Snipes and Denzel Washington, and when 
you see me, you say 'Damn!' 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stay on radio so I can look like whoever I want -- or whoever you 
want me to look like."

'MACBETH' TO OPEN ART'S 8TH SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shakespeare's "Macbeth" will launch the Alternative Repertory Theatre's 
1994-95 season in September, the company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming season, ART's eighth, will also include Arthur Miller's "Death of 
a Salesman" and Paul Zindel's "The Effects of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon 
Marigolds," as well as staged readings of Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" 
and a work to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 ART, which operates in a 61-seat storefront venue, has 431 subscribers. That 
is more than triple the number it started out with, spokesman Gary Christensen 
said, but also represents a decline from its record of 500 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage new subscriptions, he noted, ART is launching a "pay as you go" 
plan that will enable playgoers to become season ticket holders for $25 instead 
of $70, the full subscription price to all five shows. A "pay-as-you-go" 
subscriber will be charged $7 at the door for each production attended, in 
addition to the initial fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this will be especially attractive to seniors and students and 
anybody who lives on a budget," Christensen said. Single tickets for 
non-subscribers will remain $16. The '94-95 Season: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 29-Nov. 12: "Macbeth," by William Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 9-24: Staged reading of "A Christmas Memory," by Truman Capote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 20-March 4: "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 30-April 21: To be named (possibly a one-woman black musical or a 
Latino work with performances in English and Spanish). 
</P>
<P>
 * May 12-June 24, 1995: "The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon 
Marigolds," by Paul Zindel. 
</P>
<P>
 All productions will be at Alternative Repertory Theatre, 1636 S. Grand Ave., 
Santa Ana. Information: (714) 836-7929.

A GUARDIAN OF THE WHITE HOUSE TREASURES; ART: LACMA'S LESLIE GREENE BOWMAN 
FINDS SATISFACTION AS A PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTEE TO A COMMITTEE DEDICATED TO 
PRESERVING AMERICA'S MOST VISITED HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House must be the most frequently redecorated domicile in the 
country. From Thomas Jefferson's Federal-style furnishings and James Monroe's 
gilded Empire furniture to Chester A. Arthur's elk-antler chairs and Theodore 
Roosevelt's polar bear pelts, the executive mansion has evolved with the tastes 
and budgets of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ever-changing decor is also a matter of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 1,250,000 people visiting the public rooms of the White House each year, 
things wear out," says Leslie Greene Bowman, head of the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art's decorative arts department and a presidential appointee to the 
Committee for the Preservation of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as America's most visited home -- and the only residence of a head of 
state that is open to the public on a regular basis free of charge -- the White 
House takes quite a beating. The days when Roosevelt used the East Room as a 
wrestling arena and his children turned it into a roller-skating rink are long 
gone, but accommodating the crowds requires enormous effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond routine cleaning and maintenance, the mansion's antique furnishings and 
40,000-piece collection of fine and decorative arts demand professional 
attention, Bowman said. Appropriate replacements must be found for worn-out 
carpets, shabby upholstery and faded draperies. Artworks and other objects need 
conservation. And when gifts are offered to the White House, someone must 
decide if they fit into the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the province of White House curator Rex Scouten and his staff, who 
work in consultation with the First Family and the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is composed of seven ex-officio members and 13 presidential 
appointees -- including interior designers, curators, art historians and arts 
patrons -- and reports to the President and advises National Park Service 
Director Roger G. Kennedy on the maintenance of the White House as a public 
monument. The full committee convenes twice a year, while subcommittees for 
fine art, decorative arts and design meet as needed to address problems in 
their area of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working on the Blue Room now," Bowman said. "It's such a great room, 
but it is sorely in need of a face lift," she said of the oval-shaped reception 
hall that she considers "the most dramatic and elegant of the public rooms." 
The task at hand is to help select new draperies, upholstery, wall coverings 
and carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, a member of the decorative arts subcommittee, has located an 1815 
English carpet design that might be re-created for the Blue Room, while some of 
her colleagues have scoured New York's Cooper-Hewitt Museum for period 
wallpaper. Committee members are appointed because they know where to look for 
answers about White House furnishings, but they are merely advisers, not final 
arbiters, Bowman emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she has emerged from initial meetings with a rush of excitement. "I 
just think it's an incredible honor," Bowman said of her appointment, which 
took effect in November but was only made public in March. "I didn't ever 
think, even in my wildest dreams, that I would play any role remotely involved 
with advising the President on the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason this means a lot to me is that I came to Los Angeles in 1980, 
directly from graduate school at Winterthur (Museum and Gardens in Winterthur, 
Del.), when the County Museum of Art was not known for its decorative arts and 
certainly not for its American decorative arts," she said. "People asked me why 
I was going to Los Angeles. During my 13 1/2 years here I've had the feeling 
that my work doesn't get as much notice as it would if I were in New York or 
Boston, but now I know I haven't been forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee for the Preservation of the White House was established by 
Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 as an outgrowth of Jacqueline Kennedy's work on the 
White House, according to Scouten, who has held his post for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally the members were selected for their ability to give or raise funds 
to refurbish the White House. But now the collection is almost adequate, so we 
have a more professional committee," he said. Fund-raising is done by the White 
House Historical Society, while committee members concentrate on the mansion 
and its collection. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Abigail Adams, the first residents of the White House, moved into the 
executive mansion in 1800, while it was under construction. But the bulk of the 
collection is only 30 years old, Scouten said. The house underwent an extensive 
renovation during the Truman Administration but -- apparently due to a lack of 
funds -- it was furnished with reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
 A privately funded effort has replaced all the reproductions with authentic 
antiques, Scouten said. They include pieces that had been sold off over the 
years, such as gilded furniture from Paris' Belange workshop ordered by Monroe 
in 1817 for the Blue Room. But the holding isn't as big as it sounds, Scouten 
said. The 40,000 pieces include flatware, porcelain and dozens of other 
relatively small objects -- few of which are relegated to storage. 
</P>
<P>
 While Scouten has long since settled into his unusual job, Bowen confesses to 
being awe-struck by her new responsibility. "Both President and Mrs. Clinton 
speak very passionately and evocatively about the power of history that is 
conveyed by the house," she said. "Mrs. Clinton is actively involved in every 
committee meeting, which is very gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the biggest thrill, Bowman said, is entering the house itself: 
"I'm completely in awe of the fact that when you go to the White House, you go 
to the front door. You go to the guard's kiosk, get clearance and walk up to 
the front door. I find that completely overwhelming and awesome."LOS ANGELES

TOM DENIES ROSEANNE'S ABUSE CHARGES; PERSONALITIES: ARNOLD SAYS HE WOULD LIKE 
TO RECONCILE WITH HIS WIFE AND DENIES PHYSICALLY ATTACKING HER OR HAVING AN 
EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The real-life soap opera starring Tom and Roseanne Arnold took another twist 
Wednesday when he said that the charges of abuse leveled against him by his 
wife were untrue but added that he wants to reconcile with her anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love her and would like to reconcile, but these allegations are very 
severe," Arnold said in an interview. "I told her how devastating this all is. 
I don't know what's going to happen, but I know I would like to talk with her 
in a healthy environment with our rabbi or our therapist." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne Arnold filed for divorce Monday, claiming that Tom had been 
emotionally and physically abusive throughout their four-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being one of Hollywood's most high-profile couples, the Arnolds 
were executive producers and stars of ABC's popular "Roseanne" and CBS' 
struggling "Tom." They have several projects in the works under their Wapello 
County production company. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold said he had talked to his wife on the phone during the past few 
days, and that she had told him she signed legal papers detailing her charges 
of abuse without reading them. "She told me she was going to correct the 
charges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom said the couple's various projects together and separately had taken a 
toll on the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a tough year for both of us," he said. "We've both worked very 
hard. I've produced three shows and filmed a movie, and she's done 'Roseanne' 
and wrote a book. We haven't been together like the good old days. My problem 
is that I took on too many projects and didn't spend enough time on the 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "It was something I recognized and was going to correct next year. I 
missed the time we used to have together. She's been going through a lot and I 
wasn't there for her as much as I should have been." 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit filed Monday in support of a temporary restraining order, 
Roseanne Arnold described several incidents in which she said her husband 
attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now realize that I am a classic battered and abused wife who has tolerated 
the conduct of (Arnold) only because (Arnold) has successfully lowered my 
self-esteem and reduced me into the realm of battered wife syndrome," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold denied his wife's allegations that he had moved out of their 
Brentwood home six months ago under a mutual agreement, and that she had fired 
him from his executive producer position on "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that rumors of an affair between him and his assistant, Kim 
Silva, which reportedly was the focus of a bitter argument between the couple 
on the set of "Roseanne" last Friday, were false. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems between me and Rosey have nothing to do with a third party," he 
said. "Rosey knows this. Kim is a close friend of hers." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold added, "We have had a volatile relationship. We're passionate people. 
But we love each other. I think we will resolve this."

 On a precedent-breaking night, ESPN became the first cable network to be the 
top winner of the sports Emmy Awards, and CBS basketball analyst Billy Packer 
stopped John Madden's nine-year winning streak as best commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN took 10 awards in the 15th annual sports Emmy competition, whose winners 
were announced in ceremonies Tuesday in New York City. NBC, last year's top 
winner, was second this time with six, Home Box Office and CBS had five each, 
ABC and NFL Films each had three, and cable's TNT and USA networks received one 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in the 26 categories for work during the 1993 calendar year were 
selected by peer panels under the National Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC continued its dominance over the announcing categories, with Bob Costas 
receiving his fifth Emmy as top studio host and Dick Enberg his fourth as 
outstanding play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN, whose 22 nominations also topped the field, was honored for sports 
journalism for its reports on the University of Houston's scandal-ridden 
football program and allegations of sexual misconduct by then University of 
Florida swimming coach Mitch Ivey, and for Dick Schapp's writing.  
</P>
<P>
 ESPN also won in all three special classifications: technical achievement for 
technology in covering auto racing; individual achievement for its look at 
then-heavyweight boxing champion Riddick Bowe's African relief mission, and in 
program achievement for its "Outside the Lines" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of CBS' awards came for programs and events that it will not have this 
year. Its coverage of the 1993 World Series, which came under fire from some 
critics and viewers, was selected as the outstanding live sports special, while 
its "NFL Today" pregame show was named as the best studio show. CBS lost the 
exclusive rights to cover baseball's post-season last year after four 
money-losing seasons, and it was outbid by Fox Broadcasting for the National 
Football Conference portion of the NFL television package. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's winners also included an eclectic mix of 14 musicians and 
groups who performed in videos to open ABC's "Monday Night Football" telecasts. 
"Monday Night Football" was honored as the best live sports series.

 These special orange and raisin brownies are based on a recipe given to me by 
a good friend and fellow cooking teacher, Kathy Fleegler of Cleveland. A 
combination of melted chocolate and butter combined with flour, sugar, eggs, 
walnuts and raisins soaked in orange juice, the brownies are incredibly moist 
and bursting with flavor. ORANGE AND RAISIN BROWNIES

 "L e dejeuner fait bonne memoire ," claimed the 16th-Century French novelist 
Rabelais: "Breakfast makes good memory." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know whether that is true, but I do know that some of the most 
memorable meals I've had were breakfasts. They weren't great repasts with 
exotic foods. Quite the opposite. They were simple celebratory meals in the 
early hours of the new year, rambunctious times at the table when our family 
was snowed in, and jolly, spur-of-the-moment gatherings when friends dropped by 
on Sunday mornings. The menu was often no more than scrambled eggs, toast and 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had memorable breakfasts alone too, including one in bed at an old 
English inn. Deciding I couldn't face a "full English breakfast," I had ordered 
tea in my room. It was early spring, gray and cold outside. Promptly at 7:30 
a.m., there was a polite tap on the door and my "tea" arrived, scalding hot and 
accompanied by fresh orange juice, croissants (crisp on the outside, tender 
within), marmalade and whole strawberry preserves. All served with snow-white 
napery, gleaming silver and one sun-colored narcissus in a tiny vase. 
</P>
<P>
 The full English breakfast that I passed up included fruit juice, stewed 
fruit, porridge, eggs and bacon, grilled tomatoes, sausages and kippers, toast 
and marmalade, and coffee or tea. However ample, it doesn't compare with the 
breakfasts that Britons served in earlier centuries. The first meal of the day 
-- the "break" of the "fast" for a 16th-Century landed family -- typically 
consisted of bread, five or six kinds of fish, several cold meats, cheeses, 
pates, beer and wine. (Wine was omitted for children in the nursery.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colonial American breakfasts incorporated native foods, such as North American 
game, sweet potatoes, corn and maple syrup, but followed English models. At the 
time of the American Revolution, a wealthy Southerner was likely to toss back a 
julep (bourbon, water and sugar, garnished with mint) and then sit down to cold 
turkey, ham, fried hominy, skillet cakes, cider, bread and butter, tea, coffee 
and chocolate. New Englanders added fish and meat pies to the menu, and from 
the settlers in Pennsylvania came scrapple, a loaf made from cornmeal and pork 
scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast in the 1800s was only slightly less rich. Sarah Rorer's 
"Philadelphia Cook Book" (1886) offered menus for "small and less pretentious 
families." One recommendation was oatmeal mush with whipped cream, broiled 
steak, stewed potatoes, quick muffins, coffee and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 While average Americans were eating more mush than broiled steak, it wasn't 
until late in the century that the grain floodgate opened, when J. H. Kellogg, 
a young Michigan physician caught up in the health-food reform movement, 
invented something he called granola and perfected a method of flaking grain to 
give us cornflakes. Henry Perky developed shredded wheat; C. W. Post made 
grape-nuts. Around the same time, Albert Webster Edgerly attached one of his 
aliases, Dr. Ralston, to Purina Wheat, and the morning meal was revolutionized. 
Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries was only a few billion dollars away. 
</P>
<P>
 There were good reasons to change what we ate for breakfast, including those 
of cost, time and health. Historian John Harvey Young calls the 19th Century 
the "dietary dark ages . . . when overeating was a national habit, an evil 
compounded by a diet stressing starchy dishes, salt-cured meats and fat-fried 
foods." Yet starting every day with cereal from a box, no matter how rushed we 
are, isn't an altogether happy alternative. It probably accounts for Henry 
Beard and Roy McKie, contemporary American spiritual descendants of Rabelais, 
defining breakfast as "a meal without dessert, eaten without wine, and served 
on a table without a tablecloth. It is best slept through." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Not true. Not true. What follows are suggestions for dazzling breakfasts that 
are healthy, different and delicious. Several can be partially prepared the 
night before, leaving you time to believe as many as six impossible things 
before breakfast as well as get a quick start in the morning; others are more 
ambitious, ideal for leisurely weekend feasting. Memorable meals indeed, and 
worth getting up for.

 This is a new twist on strata, a layered dish that has been around for 
centuries. Baked in a springform pan, this lusty version is served in wedges, 
perfect for a weekend brunch. SMOKED SALMON AND GOAT CHEESE STRATA 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter, softened, plus 1 teaspoon 
</P>
<P>
 13 slices firm white bread 
</P>
<P>
 5 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 White pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Dash nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 Dash cayenne pepper 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dried ground green peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup crumbled firm goat cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes (dry, not oil-packed) 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces smoked salmon, cut into strips 
</P>
<P>
 Use 2 teaspoons softened butter to grease 9-inch springform pan. Lightly 
spread remaining softened butter (reserving 1 teaspoon) on both sides of bread 
slices. Cut slices diagonally in half. Line sides of pan with about 9 bread 
triangles, overlapping slightly with long edge down. Line bottom of pan with 
about 8 bread triangles, cutting to fit as necessary. Reserve remaining 
triangles. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk together 3 eggs, 1/3 cup milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon white 
pepper, nutmeg and cayenne in small bowl. Drizzle about 1/3 of mixture over 
bread slices in bottom of pan. Reserve remaining mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk together remaining 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons milk and dashes of salt and 
white pepper in another small bowl. Melt remaining 1 teaspoon butter in small 
skillet over medium heat. Add egg mixture and stir with wooden spoon until eggs 
are softly scrambled. Spread eggs over bread slices. Sprinkle with dill, 1 
teaspoon capers and peppercorns. Top with 1/2 cup goat cheese, tomatoes and 
smoked salmon, reserving some salmon strips for garnish. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover filling with remaining bread slices and drizzle reserved egg mixture 
evenly over top. Sprinkle with remaining goat cheese. Cover and refrigerate 
overnight, along with remaining smoked salmon and capers. 
</P>
<P>
 To bake, place pan of strata on baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees until top is 
golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Remove sides of springform pan 
and transfer strata to serving plate. Garnish with reserved smoked salmon and 
capers. Makes 8 servings.

 Nonfat Yogurt Cheese contains 1/60 as much fat as cream cheese -- reason 
enough for the extra effort required to make this alternative. Three cups of 
yogurt yield about one cup Yogurt Cheese.  
</P>
<P>
 * YOGURT CHEESE 
</P>
<P>
 Nonfat, plain yogurt 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 To make Yogurt Cheese, use nonfat, plain yogurt that does not contain starch, 
gums or gelatin. Line strainer with double thickness of cheesecloth. Set 
strainer over large bowl. Spoon in yogurt. Cover with plastic wrap and 
refrigerate overnight.  
</P>
<P>
 Discard liquid in bowl and transfer thickened yogurt to clean container, 
adding salt to taste. Yogurt Cheese can be stored, covered, in refrigerator up 
to 1 week.

TOPICS / BUSINESS; SALES FLATTEN OUT AT CITY HAUL STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, the city of West Covina's City Haul store at Eastland Shopping 
Center was raking in the bucks: Last Christmas shopping season, the city sold 
about $24,000 worth of new and used city paraphernalia, including street signs, 
manhole covers and parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the city with about $13,000 in profit for its first six weeks in the 
retail business. But since Jan. 1, the store has not turned a profit. It has, 
however, come close to breaking even, officials report. Overhead runs about 
$4,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they had anticipated a post-holiday sales drop and now hope 
that sales will pick up as word of the store spreads among local residents and 
collectors from throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 The store has been stocked with such items as vintage parking meters plucked 
off the streets of Las Vegas, plus items such as West Covina traffic signals 
and fire hydrants. 
</P>
<P>
 City Haul opened in November. The city also recently began selling selected 
City Haul items from a cart at the Plaza at West Covina. New Shop Offers 
Upscale Lingerie 
</P>
<P>
 In the frugal '90s, $2,000 designer suits for women are a tough sell. But the 
owner of a new San Marino store figures that women who sleep in fine silk will 
still fork out a couple of hundred dollars for lingerie stitched in Paris or 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Patricia Soto Lee opened her Patricia's of San Marino lingerie shop 
in Old Town San Marino, 2529 Mission St. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia's also specializes in lounge wear and bedding. Prices range from $50 
for a silk nightshirt to $1,000 for fine bedding from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto, a 35-year-old Alhambra resident, other stores nearby sell lingerie, but 
outlets such as Victoria's Secret tend to cater to younger women and don't 
offer a comparable selection of lounge wear and bedding. Stock Watch

1994 PREP BASKETBALL ALL-STARS; GIRLS' ALL-STARS; FUTURE APPEARS BRIGHT AS 
JUNIORS TAKE CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The level of play in girls' high school basketball is improving across the 
country, and the San Gabriel Valley is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 season featured the continued strength of programs such as Diamond 
Bar, Wilson and Rio Hondo Prep, plus the emergence of other schools, such as 
San Gabriel and Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual performances, too, seem to be improving each season. And they 
figure to get even better in the coming seasons as younger players continue to 
emerge in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the 10 players selected to The Times' 1994 San Gabriel Valley All-Star 
Team are juniors; several sophomores and freshmen figure to earn similar 
recognition next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Every boys' and girls' high school basketball coach in The Times' San Gabriel 
Valley circulation area received a ballot asking for nominations from their 
team and others. They were also asked to nominate a coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The selected players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of 
The Times at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Holiday Inn in 
Pasadena. Winners of the San Gabriel Valley player and coach of the year awards 
will be announced at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Davis (Covina) -- Davis, a 5-foot-8 guard/forward, averaged 16 points 
and seven rebounds and helped lead the Colts into the Southern Section 
playoffs. On their ballots, coaches consistently noted her all-round play. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce-Ann Garcia (San Gabriel) -- Garcia, the Matadors' junior point guard, 
averaged 20.4 points and five assists in leading San Gabriel to the Division 
I-AA semifinals. Regarded as one of the top ballhandlers in the area, she is 
expected to help the Matadors challenge for the division championship next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Gast (Diamond Bar) -- Gast, a junior guard, directed the offense for the 
Brahmas, who advanced to the Division I-AA semifinals. She averaged 13.7 
points, five rebounds and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennie Griffen (Bishop Amat) -- A 6-1 1/2 center/forward, Griffen averaged 17 
points and 12 rebounds for a Bishop Amat team that spent almost the entire 
season ranked No. 1 in the San Gabriel Valley. Griffen's strength was her 
inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 Katy Grubbs (South Pasadena) -- Grubbs, a 6-0 junior center, was named most 
valuable player of the Rio Hondo League after averaging 18.7 points and 12.5 
rebounds. Grubbs led South Pasadena to a 10-0 record in league. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Janos (Los Altos) -- Janos, a 5-8 guard/forward, averaged 13 points, 12.5 
rebounds and three assists for the Conquerors. Opposing coaches consistently 
noted that she was one of the area's top defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Kanegae (Pasadena Poly) -- Kanegae, a senior, led Pasadena Poly to 
its fourth consecutive Division V-AA semifinal appearance. She averaged 12.8 
points and 7.3 assists and was named most valuable player of the Prep League. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Massey (Wilson) -- Massey, who is also an outstanding softball player, 
helped the Wildcats to another successful season by averaging 15 points and 
seven assists. Coaches described her as a leader and one of the best all-around 
players in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Morris (Diamond Bar) -- Morris, a 6-1 senior, was one of the area's top 
inside players. She averaged 14.3 points, eight rebounds and three assists for 
the Brahmas, who advanced to the semifinals of the Southern Section Division 
I-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghenia Pringle (Garey) -- A 5-7 junior guard, Pringle was named most valuable 
player of the Miramonte League after averaging 17.1 points, 8.4 rebounds and 
3.2 assists. A solid ballhandler and good shooter, she is expected to help 
Garey contend for the league title next season. GIRLS' ALL-STAR TEAM

 San Gabriel Valley high schools have produced some outstanding basketball 
talent in past seasons, but the class of players from the 1993-94 season might 
someday be recognized among the area's best ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassett was the only team to win a Southern Section title, but several teams 
advanced deep into the playoffs, including San Dimas, which made its third 
consecutive championship game appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teams and the players in the San Gabriel Valley seem like they're getting 
better and better each year," La Canada Coach Tom Hofman said. "And many 
schools have more than one excellent player." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron Murray of Glendora and Jeremy Veal of San Dimas lead a list of 10 
players selected to The Times' 1994 San Gabriel Valley All-Star Team. The 
players were selected based on nominations from area coaches. Every boys' and 
girls' high school basketball coach in The Times' San Gabriel Valley 
circulation area received a ballot asking for nominations from their team and 
others. They were also asked to nominate a coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The selected players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of 
The Times at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Holiday Inn in 
Pasadena. Winners of the San Gabriel Valley player and coach of the year awards 
will be announced at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Guyton (Pasadena) -- Guyton, a repeat selection to The Times' team, is 
the latest in a line of talented Bulldog guards that includes Michael Cooper 
and Michael Holton. An All-Pacific League selection, Guyton averaged 18.5 
points and 3.2 rebounds. He is being recruited by several NCAA Division I 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Ray Johnson (Wilson) -- The Miramonte League featured a plethora of 
explosive scorers this season. Johnson, a senior forward, often took over games 
with his shooting skills. He averaged 28.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists 
as the Wildcats advanced to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Lesley (Damien) -- The 6-foot-4 forward is a repeat selection to The 
Times' team. He led the Spartans and impressed opposing coaches with his 
versatility, competitiveness and all-around skills. Lesley averaged 24 points 
and 6.8 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron Murray (Glendora) -- Murray, The Times' 1992 San Gabriel Player of the 
Year as a sophomore, makes his third appearance on the team. Generally regarded 
as one of the nation's best guards, Murray averaged 26 points, four rebounds 
and six assists for the Tartans. He will play for USC next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamario Richard (Nogales) -- The only junior on the 1994 team, Richard will 
be considered the top returning guard in the area next season. Richard was 
named Sierra League most valuable player after averaging 27 points, four 
rebounds and nine assists for the Nobles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jecarl Riggins (Blair) -- A three-time All-Rio Hondo League selection for the 
Vikings, Riggins capped his career by averaging 22 points and five assists in 
leading Blair into the playoffs. Ballhandling and shooting skills are Riggins' 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeron Roberts (Charter Oak) -- Roberts made a habit of taking over games last 
season with his shooting and rebounding skills. During some stretches, he was 
literally unstoppable. The 6-4 guard/forward averaged 33.2 points, 10.8 
rebounds and 2.7 assists. He will play next season at Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Sanchez (La Canada) -- La Canada Coach Tom Hofman describes Sanchez, the 
Rio Hondo League most valuable player, as the best player in school history. 
Sanchez averaged 20.7 points and 9.7 rebounds for the Spartans and led them to 
the Southern Section III-A semifinals. He played three seasons of varsity 
basketball and helped the Spartans accumulate a record of 30-0 in Rio Hondo 
League play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Veal (San Dimas) -- Veal, a 6-3 guard, is a repeat selection to The 
Times' team. Veal concluded an outstanding career by averaging 30.5 points, 8.2 
rebounds and 4.4 assists for the Saints, who advanced to the Southern Section 
III-A championship game for the third consecutive season. An outstanding 
shooter and all-around player, Veal will play at Arizona State next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Braden Weber (St. Francis) -- Weber, a 6-8 forward, developed into an 
outstanding front-court player in his final season and helped lead the Golden 
Knights to a 22-6 record, one of the school's best-ever seasons. Weber averaged 
14 points and 11 rebounds. BOYS' ALL-STAR TEAM

GROUNDS FOR SPENDING MORNING AT MILE SQUARE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The area now known as Mile Square Regional Park, once a bean field, was 
acquired by the Navy as a training base half a century ago. The Fountain Valley 
site has had incarnations as a Marine helicopter landing field and strawberry 
fields before it opened to the public as a park in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 8 to 9:30: The park is indeed a mile square, which makes it a four-mile walk 
or jog around the perimeter. Dozens of walkers and joggers were spotted along 
the path in a matter of minutes; one woman wearing roller-skates was speeding 
her baby stroller along. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the park are other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is run by county rangers and patrolled by the Sheriff's Department, 
so it was a surprise to find Earl Tanner in a golf cart with a hand-scrawled 
"Marshal" sign on the windshield. But he was only presiding over the David L. 
Baker Memorial Golf Center parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd had a few break-ins," Tanner said. "Since I've been here, it's just 
boring." 
</P>
<P>
 A triangular airstrip was once used for simulated Navy carrier landings. Now 
it is officially designated the Mile Square Regional Park Hobby Area, and signs 
warn, "No Learning to Drive!" Places within the area are assigned for 
radio-controlled and free-flight model aircraft, land sailing and 
radio-controlled cars. The rocket area has been closed; too many of the 
projectiles ended up on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the hobby area and Euclid Street are an archery range and soccer, 
softball and baseball fields. Two lakes (one three acres, the other seven) are 
occasionally stocked with catfish; bluegill, carp and largemouth bass stock 
themselves. Bring your pole, and don't forget your fishing license. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is not only a place of activity, but also one for potential 
epiphanies. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun beats down early in the morning. A symphony of squawks, honks and 
hoots emanates from an island out in the middle of the larger lake. Only the 
occasional splashing of wings disturbs the placid lake surface. Ducks may be 
ducks, but some are garbed in royal blues and grays, some in drab earth tones; 
the red-headed Muscovy doesn't quack, it hisses. The circled eyes of Egyptian 
geese recall the "Our Gang" dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking back across the carefully manicured grounds, I passed a children's 
playground and spray pool, where a lordly Rottweiler watched over its young 
charge, a page right out of the "Carl" series of children's books featuring the 
same breed. 
</P>
<P>
 9:30 to 10:15: Anybody who has watched ducks under a beating sun for any 
amount of time will be badly in need of some midmorning rejuvenation, and the 
perfect spot is Jugos Vallarta, a Mexican deli featuring Hawaiian fruit salads 
and a variety of shakes and fresh juices. 
</P>
<P>
 I opted for a carnitas tamale and a Vampire ($3), a juice drink of beets, 
celery, apple, pineapple, cucumber, carrots, orange, banana, papaya, cantaloupe 
and honey. Boy, will that rejuvenate you! Next time, "Chick's Beak" salad 
(small, $2.50, large $4): pineapple, papaya, cantaloupe, watermelon, cucumber, 
jicama, orange, chili, salt and lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the juice of natural fruits, shakes made using natural fruits and 
"choco-milks" with natural fruits ($1.75 to $3, and 50 cents more to add eggs) 
are also available. For even more substantial morning fare, among half a dozen 
choices for breakfast ($2.99) are 3 Poisonous Eggs, a not-so-poisonous-sounding 
concoction of spinach, lettuce, onion, ham, chili and Chihuahua cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 The jukebox offers mostly Spanish-language tunes, but also Merle Haggard's "A 
Bar in Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
 10:15 to 11: In the land "a little left of reality," and of Edinger Avenue, 
you'll find limited-edition prints by James C. Christensen (and more 
mainstream, less interesting Americana) at Art Works, Etc. Think of Christensen 
as Hieronymus Bosch with a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think of him as fantasies and fairies, but it goes deeper than 
that," noted Art Works owner Fred Turra. "He's quite a student of mythology and 
religion, and he incorporates that into just about everything. Each of his 
works is a fable; there's always some kind of meaning behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 More impressive Christensen prints include "The Royal Music Barque," an 
embossed and gilt affair set in the skies, but "Lawrence Pretended Not to 
Notice That a Bear Had Become Attached to His Coattail" may offer a better 
example of a fable for our time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the story of (us) average, everyday guys who walk through life and 
ignore our little troubles until they become very big ones," Turra explained. 
"And then we still pretend not to notice."

IF SUPPORT ISN'T PAID, KIDS FEEL THE EFFECTS 
</P>

 Sandra and her three children may live in a five-bedroom, two-story San 
Fernando Valley home with a swimming pool, but their surroundings belie their 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 They burn scrap lumber in the fireplace to keep warm, pick up staples each 
month from a food bank and sometimes rely on neighbors for gifts of shoes and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, 17, skips a lot of activities that many take for granted, such as 
eating out with fellow high school band members after a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get to do things we would if (Dad) had been paying (child support)," 
he says. "When we need new clothes or shoes, we usually have to wait a while." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, who asked that her real name not be used, says she once was the 
one who gave money to the needy. Then, four years ago, her businessman husband 
left home and, six months later, stopped paying monthly child support. He is 
more than $20,000 in debt to his children, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at your house and say, 'Gee, you're rich.' But you can't eat a 
couch," says Sandra, who earns $800 a month as a part-time secretary. "At the 
time he left, I was only making $350 a month. I was able to keep the 
electricity on and that was it." The monthly mortgage payment on the house, 
purchased 17 years ago, is $300. 
</P>
<P>
 About two-thirds of the 12.4 million custodial parents nationwide, the vast 
majority of them women, receive no child support, Census Bureau data show. In 
Los Angeles County, the district attorney's office enforces payment -- via wage 
garnishment, property liens and other methods -- in about 150,000 cases and is 
trying to find absent parents or otherwise begin enforcement in 330,000 more. 
And many cases never reach the office, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies on the effects of non-payment, most of which have focused on families 
headed by single mothers, show that many youngsters are being deprived of the 
chance for a safe, healthy childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The obvious thing we know is that if fathers don't pay, the children are 
poorer," says Irv Garfinkel, a Columbia University professor and author of 
"Assuring Child Support," a 1992 book. 
</P>
<P>
 "(In one-income families) there is a lot of shifting to worse neighborhoods 
and worse schools. That hurts children's chances to succeed in life," he says. 
"They are more likely to drop out of high school, less likely to go to or 
complete college, and a lot of that is due to the difference in income between 
one- and two-parent families." 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the 300 mothers in one 1992 study, for example, reported that 
their children lacked food, clothing or medical care during the first year 
after a marital breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Child support contributes about 10% of the total income of families headed by 
mothers," Garfinkel says. "If all fathers paid what they should, according to 
current guidelines for child support, they would be paying almost four times as 
much. They should be paying $50 billion annually and they are paying between 
$13 and $15 billion." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one parents' advocacy group, however, believes non-payment figures 
are exaggerated. California statistics, for example, are based on court-ordered 
support payments filed with the state Department of Social Services, the 
Coalition of Parent Support says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of cases, where men pay regularly, that have no connection to 
the DSS," says Dave Whitman of Bakersfield, state president of the coalition. 
"But they get very little press." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who do fail to pay inflict emotional and financial stress on the 
child, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It creates a real sense of insecurity," says Sondra Goldstein, a clinical 
psychologist in the San Fernando Valley. "They begin to worry about such basics 
as, will there be food for them to eat, will they be homeless on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other (result) is that the child often personalizes the failure of child 
support and asks, 'What's wrong with me? Doesn't my father feel I'm worth the 
support payment?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Experts who believe in the connection between child support and a child's 
success are trying to determine if an emotional bond is even more important 
than money. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Studies have shown) a pretty strong relation between child-support payments 
and how well children are doing," Garfinkel says. "The question is: Is that 
really the result of payments, or does it reflect a third variable like 
emotional commitment of fathers to children? Fathers paying more support might 
be more emotionally supportive of the children. (The studies) try to address 
that, but the results remain pretty crude." 
</P>

 Ponytailed KeVonna Scott, 9, has felt financial and emotional rejection. She 
is used to being turned down when she asks for new things. Her father owes 
$7,800 in back child support, court documents show, and that prevents her 
mother from buying non-essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll say, 'When can I have them?' or 'When you get paid, can I have this?' 
" says her mother, Loretha Green. 
</P>
<P>
 To make KeVonna feel better, her mother sometimes gives her $10. "But 
sometimes I have to borrow it back," Green says. "She doesn't let me forget 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Green earns $2,250 monthly as a clerk-typist for the city of Long Beach. Her 
monthly bills include $775 for rent, $260 for child care and $200 for clothing. 
She also manages to scrape together $40 for KeVonna's dance lessons and $35 for 
cable TV each month. Occasionally, when the family needs to stretch the food 
budget, KeVonna and her sister go to their grandparents' house for a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-grader feels the financial pressure on her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sad because we don't get very much help," she says in the family's 
two-bedroom Paramount townhouse. She'd like for the family "to get less bills." 
KeVonna is also sad because she rarely sees her father, who has a job and until 
recently lived a few miles away, her mother says. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll get her hopes up to spend the day and, hopefully, the night with him. 
But he'll get her at noon and be back here at 2 p.m. She'll go up (in her room) 
and cry, but doesn't want me to see her. . . . She loves him to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years after KeVonna's birth, Green married another man and had Dezyre, 
now 2. Although the couple is now separated, her husband still helps support 
both girls. KeVonna hopes he will help buy a computer like the one she's been 
working on at school. 
</P>
<P>
 KeVonna won't ask her father for the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he's going to say he doesn't have (the money) and can't do it for me," 
she says softly, swinging her feet as she sits on a chair. "I try to ask for 
less things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting by on less quickly becomes the mission of broken families. Custodial 
parents often turn to myriad organizations for help not only in collecting 
child support but also in making ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra, the San Fernando Valley mother of three, sought help at the Assn. for 
Children for Enforcement of Support (ACES). She has become a master at 
ferreting out opportunities for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son Gavin, 9, participates in a federally funded free-lunch program. 
Charles worked in the school cafeteria in exchange for free meals. Tammy, 13, 
recycles cans and baby-sits to pay for extras. ("I just go out and buy my own 
things," she says.) And because Sandra qualifies under their low-income 
programs, the telephone and gas companies discount her bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But pinching every penny is tiresome. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to be in the situation where you're always saying 'no, we can't 
afford it,' " when your children ask for something, Sandra says. "It's becoming 
an obsession. You're as sick of talking about it as they are of hearing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the children know lack of money from their father contributes to 
their situation, they're reluctant to complain and eager to maintain their 
relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten used to it," Charles says. "I see him about every weekend." 
</P>

 Margaret Magee hasn't seen her father for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 When her parents divorced in 1985, her mother, Mary Ann, had a college degree 
and work experience -- and help from her own mother, who provided day care. 
Because of those advantages, Margaret, now 15, says her father's failure to pay 
court-ordered child support had little effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had a nice home and loving mother and grandmother," says Margaret, a 
poised sophomore at Woodbridge High School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the family had life's necessities, such extras as summer camp or 
vacations were out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought about asking my mom for those things, because I didn't want 
to put her in that position (of having to say no)," Margaret says. "Summer camp 
wasn't such a big thing to me. We never dwelled on what we didn't have. It was 
what we did have that counted." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Magee, who relied on her mother for financial help, built a 
counseling business for laid-off workers. Now, she "does very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The family lives in a comfortable two-bedroom apartment with country French 
furnishings and a white piano for Margaret's lessons. But the question of how 
to pay for college looms. Margaret earns A's and B's and is considering a 
career in law, but a four-year school may not be affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I can support two households," Mary Ann says. "We'll look at 
every avenue and every scholarship in the world to try to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 She worries about college costs because her former husband has made only a 
fraction of his $875 monthly child-support payments and keeps his whereabouts 
unknown. According to court papers, he is more than $35,000 in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
 The father called Margaret for the first time in four years after the recent 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called out of the blue and he called twice," Margaret says. "I think he 
heard about the earthquake and was concerned that I was all right." 
</P>
<P>
 She sometimes misses having a father around -- when friends mention going 
somewhere with their dads, for example. "I guess I would have liked him to 
contact me more," Margaret says. "But it's his decision and it's his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt an absence because I've never known what two parents were 
like," she adds. "His being around would have made our lives more comfortable, 
but we're a lot stronger for having learned to cope. I have memories that are 
just as wonderful as someone with two parents. They're just different."

PERSONAL HEALTH; NEED GOES BEYOND ORGAN DONATIONS 
</P>

 The need for organ donors is well-known, thanks to dramatic stories of lives 
saved because generous people willed their hearts, kidneys or other vital 
organs. Less well-known is the need for other human tissue -- such as bone, 
skin, ligaments, tendons and heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, about 400,000 Americans receive some type of human tissue 
transplant, says Barbara Wilks of the American Red Cross, Los Angeles. Donated 
tissue can correct a variety of problems. In the past year: 
</P>
<P>
 * A bone transplant corrected curvature of the spine in a 15-year-old Pasadena 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 * A heart valve transplant was given to a 22-year-old Torrance man. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 16-year-old girl at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles received a skin graft 
to correct skin loss caused by circulatory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 19-year-old Northridge man received a bone graft after a neck fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 Before donated tissue is used, it is tested for hepatitis, syphilis and HIV, 
according to the Red Cross. It is also screened for cancer or other conditions 
that could put the recipients at risk of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in becoming a tissue donor can get information or a donor 
card from the Red Cross Tissue Services, (800) 272-5287. It's also vital, Wilks 
says, that donors communicate their wishes to family members, who have the 
final say. KATHLEEN DOHENY

MUSIC MAN; 4,000 ADMIRERS TURN OUT TO MARK HENRY MANCINI'S 70TH BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a cake, there were candles and there was "Happy Birthday," but it 
wasn't your garden variety birthday party. Henry Mancini celebrated his 70th at 
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion Tuesday night with some 4,000 friends, collaborators and 
folks who appreciate his elegant music. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a towering cake was rolled in, a musical tribute to the 
multi-award-winning composer/conductor/arranger included appearances by Julie 
Andrews, Quincy Jones, Dudley Moore, Bob Newhart, Andy Williams and John 
Williams, plus a 40-minute performance by Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
 The man variously described as decent, down-to-earth, accessible, aristocratic 
and, simply, lovable, accepted the attention with good grace. "We're not here 
for me -- I'm just a channel -- but to promote the younger talents in our 
town," Mancini said.  
</P>
<P>
 The $2 million raised at the event will be divided between the UCLA Center for 
the Performing Arts and Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. Both 
institutions presented Mancini with awards, and Gov. Pete Wilson all but handed 
him the keys to the state. Mancini's wife, Ginny, and Caroline Leonetti 
Ahmanson and A. Jerrold Perenchio were honorary chairs. Co-chairs were Della 
Koenig and Leah Superstein. 
</P>
<P>
 If there existed a person who couldn't identify a Mancini tune, not to worry 
-- there were plenty of clues. Paw prints ("Pink Panther") directed guests to 
their seats. Tiffany & Co. ("Breakfast at Tiffany's") donated one of the 
favors: a demitasse cup decorated with the notes to "Moon River."  
</P>
<P>
 "The wonders of Henry Mancini will be heard in every corner of the world right 
up to the minute this planet cools and shrinks to the size of an eighth note," 
Andy Williams said, issuing one of many great lines of the evening. If the 
script seemed witty and literate, that's because it was written by Mancini's 
friend, "M*A*S*H" creator Larry Gelbart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank and I made 28 films together, God knows how many TV shows, and we never 
had an argument or disagreement, and except for the lack of sex, I consider 
that a remarkable relationship," said producer/director/writer Blake Edwards, 
who created TV's "Peter Gunn" and directed "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and the 
"Pink Panther" series. Mancini has just completed the score for the Broadway 
version of Edwards' "Victor/Victoria."  
</P>
<P>
 Among those lending glamour were Mancini's longtime collaborator Leslie 
Bricusse, Sen. John Glenn, Gene Kelly, Roger Moore, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, 
Ann Miller, Bob Hope, Sherry Lansing, Sidney and Joanna Poitier, Neil and Diane 
Lander Simon, Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck, Gregory and Veronique Peck, Art 
Linkletter and Jack Haley Jr., who produced the film montage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini, who recently became ill with cancer, informed the crowd that many 
years ago he told his grandson that the one thing he wanted more than anything 
else in life was to be with him and his family at the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think it's going to happen, all of us together as a family. What I 
wish for all of you is exactly that -- let's get to 2000 and worry about it 
from there."

SCHOOLING BY GENDER; SOME TEEN-AGERS THRIVE IN GIRLS-AND BOYS-ONLY 
INSTITUTIONS. OTHERS SAY THEY'D GO CRAZY IN SUCH A SITUATION. ARE THERE SOCIAL 
OR ACADEMIC ADVANTAGES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE MONETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Christine Monette is a junior at 
Rosary High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do students at single-sex schools fare better than those at coeducational 
schools? And by what measure: Academically? Socially?  
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the merits of boys-only, girls-only and integrated schools has 
been going on for decades and seems no closer to resolution than it's ever 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of single-sex schools argue they violate federal law prohibiting 
sexual discrimination in federally subsidized school programs. As a result, a 
number of previously single-sex schools have converted to co-educational 
facilities or merged with opposite-sex schools, and others are considering 
similar moves. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some co-educational schools are experimenting with 
single-sex classes as a way to bolster students' self-esteem and academic 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of all-girls schools cite studies showing that in the classroom, 
boys seem to be called on more frequently than girls, and boys are praised or 
criticized more often. Some boys also tend to interrupt girls, making fun of 
them and their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that upon entering first grade, girls score higher on virtually 
every standardized achievement test and for years after remain superior in 
verbal skills. By the time they graduate from high school, however, girls are 
well behind boys in every area, including verbal. 
</P>
<P>
 Among factors cited as possible reasons for the shift in performance are 
subtle differences in the way teachers respond to male and female students, 
attitudes on the part of students about sexual roles and sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study last year of conversations with 150 high school and middle school 
students in California, nearly all had seen, experienced or participated in 
some form of sexual harassment, according to Elizabeth Kennan, president of 
Mount Holyoke College. School has become a threatening place for many girls, 
who have become afraid to call attention to themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the removal of males as distracters and harassers, many girls believe 
they are at an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Single-sex schools give girls a chance to discover their capabilities without 
the neglect that they receive in the presence of the opposite sex. The 
temporary segregation disallows the many outside influences that have 
interfered with female advancement for years," said Katie Gibson, a senior at 
Rosary, an all-girls high school in Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosary sophomore Shilpa Balan thinks "single-sex schools give girls a chance 
to express themselves and feel good about who they are. These girls can become 
assertive women." 
</P>
<P>
 Other girls believe in a different advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that being in an all-girls school is more comfortable than in a co-ed 
school because you don't have to worry about what you're going to wear or what 
the boys will think of you. You compete against other girls and you don't have 
to worry about the competitive obstacles males put up to be better than you," 
said Lorrie Waldle, a junior at Rosary.  
</P>
<P>
 During adolescence, boys and girls are under tremendous pressure from society, 
friends, family -- you name it. Single-sex schools can serve as a refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosary junior Selene Macias believes this kind of advantage is more important 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer being in an all-girls school, not because I can come to school 
everyday looking like a monster -- I dress nicely for myself. I like being in 
an all-girls school because I can raise my hand and answer a question without 
worrying about some guy yelling it out first." 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Powers, a Rosary English teacher and co-ed high school graduate 
observed, "When girls leave Rosary, they seem more confident and well-spoken 
than students at co-ed schools." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is the improved academic environment for girls seen in female-only schools 
also found to exist for boys in male-only schools?  
</P>
<P>
 Two Michigan educational researchers found that all-boys Catholic schools are 
at least as academically strict as the girls' schools. Yet boys in the 
single-sex schools had no comparable advantage over boys in co-ed schools, they 
said. This does not mean boys' schools have no advantage; it shows that the 
advantages are less tangible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some graduates of boys' schools claim the importance of tradition -- a 
tradition that even boys at first doubtful of the system come to cherish. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' schools share many of the advantages of girls schools: you can remove 
the opposite-sex distraction factor and have fewer boys worrying about being 
"Joe Cool." 
</P>
<P>
 All-male schools are also credited with providing an environment that helps 
form enduring friendships. And boys in this environment can develop a deeper 
"care factor," learning to listen and care for one another in the absence of 
females, who are stereotypically the comforters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue that if girls' schools encourage females to get involved in 
traditionally "male" interests, such as math and science, then boys' schools 
encourage males to get involved in traditionally "female" interests, such as 
theater and art. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Salo, a junior at Servite, an all-boys Catholic school in Anaheim, 
believes "single-sex schools are more beneficial than co-ed schools because 
there are no distractions from the opposite sex and less gossip." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students at all three types of schools point to differences in socialization 
opportunities -- which some see as important to well-being as academic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Single-sex schools are bad because they hinder one's confidence in being with 
members of the opposite sex," said Tony Cardenas, a junior at Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosary junior Gretchen Adams expressed a similar opinion. "People don't know 
how to act around people of the opposite sex when they get together in groups 
and (they) come across as really immature." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some students feel the transition from a single-sex high school 
to a co-ed college can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a single-sex school, you can only hear from the view point of that sex, 
and you are not aware of the other sex's viewpoint. I think that being able to 
see two sides of an issue on an everyday basis is something a co-ed school 
offers," said Jessica Alaniz, a sophomore at Rosary.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lee, a sophomore at Brea Olinda, a co-ed high school in Brea, simply 
says: "Co-ed schools are better because there are males and females and they 
all live in the same world." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, it is just personal preference. Amber Mooney, a sophomore at Brea 
Olinda, said that "being in a school where there is nothing but girls would 
drive me nuts. I also believe it is important for the two sexes to intermingle 
so they will know how to relate to each other later in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Armen, a junior at Rosary admits, "At co-ed schools, the guys are fun 
to have around. Like in class, they tend to add humor and jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Preston Turno, who attended all-male Servite and is now a junior at Brea 
Olinda, said he likes co-ed better because he'd rather look at girls all day 
than boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Olinda senior Cara Henson believes there are definite disadvantages to 
single-sex education. "If a group of kids are in a single-sex school, they 
might be inclined to do their work more. But after a while, they might begin to 
be upset that the other sex isn't around and resent their school and spend more 
time out of school with the opposite sex." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most students interviewed seem to believe in their school's system, whether it 
be coeducational or single sex, which suggests both types of students are 
benefiting from their particular system. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no one answer in the debate over the merits of the types of schools, 
except perhaps that different students benefit from different environments, and 
for that reason there should be a variety of educational paths available.

IN 'TEACHER TRACK,' STUDENTS LEARN ON BOTH SIDES OF DESK; CAREERS: A PROGRAM 
FUNDED BY A CAL STATE FULLERTON GRANT OFFERS TEEN-AGERS A COURSE IN EDUCATION 
AS A PROFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASMINE SHOUKRY, Jasmine Shoukry is a senior at Sunny Hills High School in 
Fullerton. This article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Accolade. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Sunny Hills High School juniors April Taylor, Emily Williams and Linda 
Wechsler were children, they wanted to be teachers. But it was just that -- a 
wish, a consideration -- until they enrolled in the Teacher Track program at 
Sunny Hills in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm sure that's what I want to do," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 While other students flip through college brochures and take job preference 
tests in the career center, Taylor, Williams, Wechsler and 15 other students 
are receiving college credit to explore a future career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teacher Track program, funded by a Cal State Fullerton grant, offers 
students in the Fullerton, Anaheim and Santa Ana school districts a course that 
explains the teaching profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal State wanted to expand their teaching program into high schools to 
encourage and provide knowledge about the profession," said Teacher Track 
adviser Edlynn Zimmerman, who teaches honors English at Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of Teacher Track is to provide students with information about the 
process of becoming a teacher, as well as how to finance their education. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The students) learn that they have to go to college for five years," 
Zimmerman said. "And they look at the diversity of teaching, because you can go 
into many fields." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Zimmerman, the Teacher Track program allows her to act as a public 
relations representative for her profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can talk to the students in a different area than content," Zimmerman said. 
"I can talk to them on a professional level." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman's enthusiasm persuaded some of her initially dubious students to 
continue coming to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Zimmerman) barely knows me, and she was talking to me like we were best 
pals," said Williams, who wants to teach creative writing in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really uncertain about whether I should stay, and she convinced me to." 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching is the only profession where you can help people and learn at the 
same time," Williams said in explaining her attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wechsler started in the program because a friend did, she decided it 
was a profession she'd like to work in. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Wechsler and juniors Joon Kang and Carolyn Lee have been selected by 
college counselor Don Joynt and Zimmerman to apply for a summer teacher 
workshop in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor wants to teach upper-division elementary school because "you get to 
teach everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton provides textbooks, a field trip to its campus and pays 
the $385 tuition to take the class. Zimmerman brings in guest speakers, usually 
Sunny Hills teachers, to share their reasons for pursuing a teaching career. 
She said the speakers have the most impact on the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different to see (their) teachers talking in front of the class and then 
in front of the group about why they teach," Zimmerman said. "They see me as a 
teacher but also as someone who loves to talk about teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 To receive two units of transferable college elective credit, the students 
must attend 20 classes, which meet at lunchtime, as well as complete 20 journal 
entries and tutor for 40 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutoring has been most influential in Williams' desire to teach. Williams 
tutors her 7-year-old cousin and occasionally will tutor in her cousin's 
third-grade class for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I taught (my cousin) her times tables, and she's way above her class," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in last semester's journal entries that Zimmerman said she saw that 
some of her students' goals had evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that the students who had come into the program just wanting the 
college credit left thinking this is a profession (they) really want to 
pursue."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: SPORTS DIVERS SEE SOMETHING FISHY IN REFUSAL TO PROTECT 
GARIBALDIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FISH FOLLOW UP: Garibaldis will have to fend for themselves for a while 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill to place a six-year moratorium on collecting the bright orange fish 
died in the state Assembly's Ways and Means Committee last week.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of taken aback by it," said Dan Chick, an aide for Rep. Bill 
Morrow (R-Carlsbad), who introduced the bill in January. "We thought we had our 
ducks in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports divers argued that the population of Garibaldis has dwindled off 
Catalina Island and other Channel Islands because of the commercial aquarium 
collecting business.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent laws already prevent divers from collecting Garibaldis off Catalina 
Island. In any case, commercial divers denied their trade has diminished the 
number of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not protecting fish; it's simply putting people out of work," Bob Todd, 
a Costa Mesa aquarium collector, said of the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports divers doubt that many people would have been affected by the 
moratorium, given that Garibaldi sales are just a fraction of the aquarium 
business.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just disappointed as hell the Legislature let us down," said Jim Hall of 
Ocean Futures, a sports-diving group. "We will fight another day." 
</P>

 CHEETAHS IN WAIT: Of the $274,000 in artwork that will go into the renovated 
Peninsula Center Library, the bronze cheetahs have struck a chord with critics. 
</P>
<P>
 They use the African animal sculptures as an example of the project's excess 
at a time when the Palos Verdes Library District has been cutting back. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no turning back now. The cheetahs are finished, ready for 
delivery. Los Angeles artist Gwynn Murrill is storing them in her studio until 
the library opens early next year. Another artist will make etched glass, 
gold-leaf treatments and mosaics. 
</P>
<P>
 So why cheetahs? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Murrill, they will complement another piece she is making, a 
limestone column featuring a relief of endangered African animals. She will 
start work on the column in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no philosophical reason," said Murrill, who was commissioned to do 
the work for $115,000. "It's a universal theme."  
</P>
<P>
 The cheetahs will serve a useful purpose as well, library officials said. One 
cheetah will look into the children's room, directly at the other cheetah, 
which will be a focal point for the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to capture the kids' attention and get them to the area," said 
Library Director Linda Elliott.

 YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY: "Hot bodies . . . Cool Fashions!" 
</P>
<P>
 So shouts the slogan to a lunchtime fashion show being held Wednesday in 
Hawthorne. The event: Celebration of Women in the Workplace, also known as 
Hawthorne Plaza's way of marking Secretaries Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Runway models may seem an odd way of celebrating women in the workplace in 
today's politically correct world. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall, which is holding the event at The Proud Bird restaurant to benefit 
the city's Chamber of Commerce, wanted "a fun bonding experience" for bosses 
and their employees, said mall marketing manager Karie Najemnik. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the community reaction, "We caught a little bit of buzz in the 
community," she said. "It was like, 'Whose hot bodies?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: Members of the police and fire department's rank and file, as well 
as Miss Hawthornes of the past and present.

POLLUTION IN THIRD WORLD IS EARTH DAY EVENT'S FOCUS; ENVIRONMENT: CARSON 
CONFERENCE ADDRESSES THE EFFECTS THAT WASTE FROM INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IS 
HAVING ON POOR NATIONS SUCH AS THE PHILIPPINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Philippines, many children in the street breathe through cloth to keep 
out pollution, Joe Pennano told about 150 people at an Earth Day gathering in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, those makeshift masks have thickened from 
handkerchiefs to towels as pollution levels increased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the environmental pollution is due to foreign companies coming into 
the Philippines," said Pennano, president of the Philippine Action Group for 
the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennano was one of several speakers invited by Earth Day organizers to the 
conference Saturday to raise awareness in local communities and ethnic groups 
about the effect that waste from industrialized countries is having on the 
Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists also are concerned about the mountains of plastic dumped in 
Philippine landfills. The United States, Australia and Japan export plastic 
waste to the region, Pennano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippine Action Group estimates that more than 6,000 tons of plastic 
scrap left Long Beach and Los Angeles harbors for the Philippines between 
January and July of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must demand an end to the waste trade in the Philippines," Pennano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is the recycling of car batteries in the Philippines, where 
pollution controls and worker safety standards are not as stringent, said 
Triana Silton of the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-grader Fredrick Trujillo, 14, a member of the Builders Club at Stephen 
White Middle School in Carson, said he learned a lot from the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helping us understand what the Earth is going through," Trujillo said. 
"They're destroying our world -- it's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) told the crowd that people could have a 
great influence on their environment and urged communities to hold businesses 
accountable for their pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this type of groundswell of community involvement, who would be there 
to check even the unintentional acts of industry?" Tucker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Earth Day events this week include:  
</P>
<P>
 * Cabrillo Marine Aquarium: On Saturday, the Sierra Club, Friends of Madrona 
Marsh and the Marine Mammal Care Center will discuss environmental issues and 
distribute conservation information. Guided tours of the adjacent salt marsh 
will be given and kayaking will be demonstrated. Events run from 8 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m. at 3720 Stephen White Drive in San Pedro. Information: (310) 548-7563.  
</P>
<P>
 * Dockweiler State Beach: The beach will be cleaned Friday from 9 a.m. to 1 
p.m. Students who have participated in the Adopt-a-Beach Assemblies program and 
other volunteers will gather at the beach near the end of Imperial Highway to 
begin the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Monica State Beach: Volunteers will meet at 9 a.m. Saturday in front 
of lifeguard towers 15 and 17 for a beach cleanup. Participants should bring 
sturdy gloves. Environmental groups will have information tables on the Santa 
Monica Pier all day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Polliwog Park: From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. the Manhattan Beach Parks and 
Recreation Department will sponsor live music, dance, children's activities, 
displays by environmental groups and tree-planting. The park is at 1601 
Manhattan Beach Blvd.

INGLEWOOD PLANNING VEHICLE-AID EFFORT TO RESCUE ITS IMAGE; TOURISM: THEIR CITY 
HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY PORTRAYED AS A DANGEROUS PLACE, OFFICIALS SAY. THEY HOPE TO 
DEPLOY BRIGHTLY PAINTED TRUCKS TO ASSIST -- AND REASSURE -- VISITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is the Achilles heel of the city: the perception that Inglewood is a 
dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood is home to the Forum -- where the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team 
and Kings hockey team play -- and to the Hollywood Park horse-racing track. But 
for years, especially since the movie "Grand Canyon" in 1991 painted the city 
as a dangerous place, some tourists and Southland residents have been afraid to 
come here for fear of becoming crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce visitors' fears, officials plan to deploy brightly 
colored rescue vehicles to help motorists stranded by a flat tire, a dead 
battery or an empty gas tank. Also in the works is a plan for a city-run radio 
station to give motorists traffic reports and directions to major tourist 
venues in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The three rescue trucks would patrol the areas surrounding visitor attractions 
in the city and would cost about $22,000 to $25,000 to equip. Part-time drivers 
would be employed for another $25,000, including benefits, said Assistant City 
Manager Norman Cravens. 
</P>
<P>
 "These proposals are aimed at making our visitors feel more comfortable and 
safe in Inglewood," Cravens said. "They're primarily designed to (appease) some 
of the negative perceptions people may have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cravens and others acknowledge that Inglewood has crime. But overall, crime in 
the city has declined since 1978. Over 15 years, the number of serious crimes, 
including homicides, rapes, assaults, auto theft and arson, has dropped from 
10,385 incidents to 8,460. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1992 to 1993, crime dropped in every major category except homicide, 
which rose 19% -- from 37 to 44 slayings -- and rape, which rose 5% -- from 65 
to 68 incidents. Auto theft dropped 12%, grand larceny declined 11% and 
aggravated assault was down 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the purpose of the rescue vehicles is to address visitors' fears, not 
police statistics, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor-assistance proposals will be presented first to the Partnership 
for Progress, a consortium of representatives from the Forum, Hollywood Park, 
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, Centinela Hospital and Inglewood Park 
Cemetery. If the consortium approves the plan, it would then go to the City 
Council. Under the proposal, Partners for Progress would buy the vehicles and 
the city would hire the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A proposal like this fits well," Cravens said, "because we don't really think 
people have fear while they're on the properties at the Forum or Hollywood Park 
-- they all have huge security -- and we don't feel people have any real fear 
when they are on the freeways. This would be perimeter patrol."  
</P>
<P>
 Visitors' fear of Inglewood became a headache for city officials after "Grand 
Canyon," with Steve Martin and Danny Glover, was released in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Sinaguglia, president of the Inglewood Chamber of Commerce, discussed the 
movie as though he were a soldier explaining the battle story behind a 
disfiguring scar. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sense of dread, Sinaguglia watched the movie's hero blunder through a 
tangle of blighted streets and into the arms of a menacing gang. Then came the 
actual wound: "When the hero is asked where he is," Sinaguglia said, "He says 
he is lost in Inglewood! Everybody (was) ready to throw apples and oranges and 
tomatoes at the movie screen." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was shot in Los Angeles, but most people do not know that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire L. Rothman, general manager of the Forum, said crime on the property is 
rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep a file of all things that happen," she said. "It's so infrequent that 
we know every single time when somebody reports having a car scratched by a key 
or a mirror broken off or even a missing car." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the officials at Hollywood Park, the Forum nor the city have conducted 
a survey of visitors to determine their perceptions about Inglewood, but they 
say they don't feel they have to. Their colleagues in business associations, 
friends in other communities and people they encounter often ask them if 
Inglewood is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Image problems aside, the rescue trucks would be good idea, said Rick 
Baedeker, vice president for marketing and public relations at Hollywood Park.  
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, even if we weren't addressing this concern, it still makes good 
business sense," he said. "It doesn't matter where you are, people are going to 
feel better about coming to your venue if they know help is not far away."

'MAYBERRY' TURNS TO MAYHEM IN EL SEGUNDO CITY ELECTIONS; POLITICS: AS USUAL, 
THE TRANQUIL COMMUNITY'S SMALL-TOWN CHARM SUFFERED AS TEMPERS FLARED DURING 
CITY COUNCIL CAMPAIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents in tiny, insulated El Segundo affectionately refer to the city as 
"Mayberry," and often praise the town for its tranquil streets and small-town 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Then come the elections. Every two years, rival political camps square off 
over City Council seats. Signs are pilfered, accusations fly, aspersions are 
cast and "Mayberry" transforms to mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's horrible," said Wendy Wallace, owner of Wendy's Place, a gathering spot 
in downtown El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace placed a sign in her cafe's window recently chiding a resident who 
took out a political ad in the local newspaper. The ad suggested that incumbent 
Alan West, whose daughter was stabbed and strangled in February, might be 
reelected in last week's election out of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to walk in here and put a 'for sale' sign in the window," she said. 
Something that personal and painful should not be part of politics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the tame elections in many South Bay cities, El Segundo's politics are 
often down-and-dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 During a candidates' forum several weeks ago, City Councilman Michael Robbins 
sat in the front row of the audience and held up a sign reading "LIAR" when 
incumbent J.B. Wise spoke, many who attended the forum said. Robbins was not 
available for comment. At the same forum, Wise called one of the other 
candidates a "son of a bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Cable Advisory Committee convened an emergency meeting and 
voted to edit potentially slanderous comments from another candidates' forum 
before it aired on the local cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am as thoroughly disgusted as I've ever been," said Wise, a 
third-generation resident who, along with West, lost in last week's election to 
two political newcomers. "For the first time in my life, after that forum, El 
Segundo didn't feel like it was home." 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo's 15,000 residents live in an enclave virtually cut off from the 
rest of the South Bay. Los Angeles International Airport blocks off 
neighborhoods to the north, Chevron's oil refinery seals the southern side and, 
to the east, a cluster of commercial buildings separates the city from 
Hawthorne. On the west it is cut off from the ocean by the Hyperion sewage 
treatment plant.  
</P>
<P>
 The result is a Midwestern-style community that is both "Mayberry," a cozy, 
small town where children still play hide-and-seek in their neighbors' yards -- 
and the self-proclaimed "Aerospace Capitol of the World," where some of the 
world's most sophisticated high-tech machinery is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attribute the often mean-spirited politicking to a heightened concern for 
El Segundo's future. The city has been hit hard by the decline in the aerospace 
industry, and candidates debated how to fill the city's many empty buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say it's just good old, small-town politics, where personality 
conflicts play as big a role in elections as policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Liam B. Weston, 29, said raucous political fights are in his blood. The newly 
elected councilman's mother campaigned for an El Segundo council candidate 
shortly after his birth in a similarly rough election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that helped prepare me for all the nasty business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston said he was questioned by police when he tried to post campaign signs 
near those of a political opponent. "These are the scary things about El 
Segundo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election neared, residents flooded the local newspaper with letters, 
wielding accusations and chiding candidates. When the letters were rejected for 
being too long, some took out ads and crammed pointed words into small boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 One group produced a spot for the city's public access channel spoofing the 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's politically active residents often can be divided into two camps -- 
those who enthusiastically support new business and those who do not. Council 
members and candidates often deny an affiliation to a particular camp and 
maintain that the viewpoints are not mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston campaigned on a pro-resident, pro-business platform. He said he avoided 
nasty campaign tactics by going door-to-door to discuss issues with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Waag Friedkin, who also knocked on residents' doors as she campaigned for 
a council seat, said El Segundo is "cliquish." She said she was frequently 
asked how long she has lived in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be an El Segundoan you have to have practically lived your whole life 
here," Friedkin said. Because she has resided in the city 23 years, Friedkin 
said she believes she passed the test: She won a seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 During her campaign, Friedkin criticized Wise for being argumentative and 
promised voters she would bring unity to a divided council.  
</P>
<P>
 She will have a couple of years to work on it before the next election in 
1996. Then, three council seats will be on the ballot, and the hostile 
campaigning will begin again.

 Betty Grable slept there. And, as legend has it, so did Mickey Rooney, Harry 
James and dozens of other stars from the 1940s, '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cockatoo Inn in Hawthorne used to be a gathering place for the elite of 
Los Angeles. Today, the hotel is trying to rebound after two decades of decline 
that drove away much of its clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place went through a real depression," said Cliff Parks, 70, a used car 
dealer who's been coming to the inn on Hawthorne Boulevard and Imperial Highway 
since 1956. "Now it's coming back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cockatoo opened in 1946 as a chicken-and-rib drive-in restaurant by Andrew 
J. Lococo, a colorful man who later owned the world's largest tuna-fishing 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lococo's business grew as jockeys and horse trainers from nearby Hollywood 
Park frequented the restaurant and attracted a following of celebrities and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember all the limos that used to pull up out front with congressmen and 
councilmen from all over," said Frank Lococo, 69, who worked as a manager for 
his cousin, Andrew, in the '50s and '60s. Today, Frank visits the hotel to 
reminisce with friends about the past, drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really something," Frank said. "Andy would buy 250 to 300 pounds of 
lobster at a time. We went through it pretty fast because a steak and lobster 
dinner was five bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, a fire destroyed the restaurant. Within months, Andrew Lococo rebuilt 
it and added a two-story house so he could live next door. Three years later, 
he opened the first part of what is now a 213-room hotel that resembles an old 
half-timbered English house. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1970, the Cockatoo's owner was in trouble with the law. The U.S. 
attorney general's office identified him as a major organized-crime figure. The 
same year, he was convicted of perjury in connection with testimony during a 
grand jury investigation of interstate gambling and horse-race fixing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he sold the Cockatoo. In 1973, he died after a stroke at age 
55. 
</P>
<P>
 A succession of real-estate companies operated the hotel through the 1970s and 
'80s, but longtime employees said business suffered without Lococo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other owners were very nice to me, but they didn't do much for the 
establishment," said Samantha Bradley, 70, a restaurant employee for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the hotel went bankrupt, said George E. Coult, head of the company 
managing the Cockatoo for its creditors. He said much of the facility was in 
disrepair. In addition, the hotel attracted prostitution and drug activity, 
general manager Craig Andres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after spending $1 million in refurbishments and a security system, Andres 
said the hotel's occupancy rate has doubled to 40% within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some trainers still live at the hotel during racing season, but the Cockatoo 
now attracts mainly tour groups and airline crews who want to stay near Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 And, instead of attracting GI pinups like Grable, the hotel now serves as a 
temporary home for about 100 recruits taking examinations to join the armed 
forces. The government contract accounts for about one-third of the facility's 
business, Andres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes, managers and employees said the Cockatoo's future depends 
on the hotel's ability to draw on its past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of restaurants and places to stay around here," Bradley said. 
"But they're all new and they're all sterile. This place has Old World 
atmosphere. That's why I've stayed here so long."

 Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has awarded a $250 grant to Kentwood

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTINELA SCHOOLS; DISTRICT SETTLES JOB BIAS LAWSUIT FOR 
$425,000 
</P>

<P>
 Former Hawthorne High School Principal Kenneth Crowe, who two years ago 
charged the Centinela Valley Union High School District with racial 
discrimination, has reached a $425,000 settlement with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago this week, Crowe's charges of racism at Hawthorne High School 
sparked two days of student walk-outs and fights.Crowe and another employee, 
Jerome Brown, brought federal suit against the district in Los Angeles in 1991, 
and at least 12 other African American employees filed racial discrimination 
complaints against the district in the months afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate settlement, Brown agreed to $75,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The spate of discrimination suits led to investigations by state and federal 
civil rights and employment agencies, which concluded that the Centinela Valley 
district had maintained a "racially hostile environment" for its students, 
teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Centinela Valley School officials referred questions about the settlement to 
their attorney, Michael Declues, who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 William G. Shaeffer, attorney for Crowe and Brown, said his clients were 
"thoroughly satisfied" and felt vindicated by the settlements. "Everyone who's 
looked at these cases has found race discrimination and race harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 The adverse findings by state and federal investigators swung the odds heavily 
in his clients' favor, Shaeffer said, and the district was eager to avoid going 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Crowe had a trial scheduled to commence April 26 and they had pretrial 
motions that needed to be filed by April 5th -- that's what really caused the 
resolution of this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowe, who resigned in 1990, is principal at Inglewood High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown left the district in 1991 and is working in Las Vegas, Shaeffer said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; SITE, FINANCING SOUGHT FOR ICE-SKATING FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne may be the site of an ice-skating rink by 1996, a Southern 
California rink builder said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Brisson, vice president of Ice Entertainment Specialties, said the 
company, which is co-owned by Los Angeles Kings hockey star Luc Robitaille, is 
considering sites near Rosecrans Avenue and Hawthorne Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at about six weeks to two months to put together a financing 
package and choose an exact site," Brisson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility would be the third ice rink in the South Bay, which has seen 
enrollment in hockey and figure skating programs grow in recent years. The 
company operates the Iceoplex skating center in the San Fernando Valley, where 
the Kings practice.  
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came after company officials spoke Monday with city 
officials. Mayor Larry Guidi said he helped arrange the meeting because a 
friend suggested a skating rink would benefit city youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the City Council said mounting budget problems may force closure of 
the municipal swimming pool and a youth camp this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi said budget woes will prevent the city from funding the proposed ice 
rink, which could cost $2 million to $6 million. But the mayor said Hawthorne 
would support the project through permit approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Iceoplex, if built, would be of benefit for the whole South Bay, not 
just Hawthorne," Guidi said. "It's important for us to help make this happen 
however we can because it would give kids from all over something positive."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CATALINA ISLAND; GROUPS OFFER PLAN TO RESTORE MARINE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Catalina Island consortium has proposed replenishing ocean life in 
Santa Monica Bay by declaring it the country's first marine "economic 
enterprise zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Catalina Island Conservancy and the island Chamber of Commerce want to restock 
fish, squid, abalone and other marine species that have been depleted by 
overfishing and killed off by high levels of DDT in the water.If sea life were 
replenished, the area would draw more tourists, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The groups laid out the proposal for Assistant Interior Secretary George 
Frampton and Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) during a recent tour of the 
island.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tourism is a clean, renewable resource . . . and it has only declined because 
what people have been coming here for has been depleted," resident Randall 
Bombard told them.  
</P>
<P>
 Frampton said the timing for such a project is good because public awareness 
of the reduction or extinction of marine species is high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have suggested that the federal government might focus its 1996 budget on 
rivers, fisheries, coastal and estuary restoration," Frampton said. "There are 
opportunities here if we can develop strategies for governments to work 
together in a way that hasn't been done before."  
</P>
<P>
 Harman said it is time to apply conservation and restoration techniques to 
marine environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes all the sense in the world to find a plan with community and 
government support to restore and regenerate marine resources, starting with 
all the food fish eat -- the kelp beds -- and moving up to the fish and other 
species that used to be here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalina Conservancy President Chuck Olson said it is not clear whether the 
bay can recover. "I've never seen an ecosystem so devastated as the water 
here," he said. "It's been harvested beyond belief. SUSAN WOODWARD

 An interim City Council member has been appointed to fill the seat vacated 
when Ralph J. Morrow Jr. was elected mayor last week, but Avalon voters will 
return to the polls in the fall to fill the seat permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Nelson, 40, who came in third in a race for two City Council seats, will 
fill the position until the Nov. 8 statewide election, when voters will elect a 
council member to serve the remaining two years of Morrow's four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a businessman, was selected unanimously after the new council was 
seated Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The council) did a lot of research around town and the majority of opinion 
was (to) just appoint the third-highest vote-getter," City Clerk Shirley Davy 
said. SUSAN WOODWARD

<P>
 Residents packed the City Council chambers Tuesday to see Michael I. Mitoma 
sworn in as the city's first directly elected mayor.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Peter D. Fajardo was unanimously reelected mayor pro tem. The 
council also said farewell to Councilwoman Sylvia L. Muise-Perez, whose term 
expired this year. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mitoma leaving his council seat to become mayor, the City Council now has 
only four members. The council has 30 days to decide whether to appoint someone 
to fill the vacancy or hold another election. 
</P>
<P>
 Because ethnicity became an issue in the campaign between Mitoma, a Japanese 
American, and James H. Peoples, an African American, the council has felt some 
pressure to appoint a black person to fill the position.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitoma said he favors appointment because it would save the city money and 
staff time. Although he said he does not have a candidate in mind, his main 
criterion for selection is public service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never appoint somebody (who) has never done anything for the 
community," Mitoma said. "I don't give a darn whether they are black or purple. 
They have to have served the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith McDonald, an African American who came in second in a race for the open 
council seat in the April 12 election, said he thinks residents are tired of 
the divisiveness that comes with elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need some type of cooling period," McDonald said. He acknowledged 
that he would like to be appointed to the seat but said it is important that 
the council member represent more than just one part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't appoint just for color. . . . The council members are going to 
have to step up to the plate and show leadership," McDonald said. "I think that 
all the communities and all areas of the city need to feel that they are 
represented." 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Helen Kawagoe said the city could hold an election that would 
coincide with the statewide elections Nov. 8. She estimated that adding the 
council election to that ballot would cost the city about $15,000. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; CITY PINS HOPES FOR CARD CLUB ON SPORTS FIGURES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Inglewood's hopes for a timely opening of Hollywood Park's new card club 
casino -- and the millions of dollars in revenues it would bring the city -- 
rest with a group headed by a former Los Angeles Rams executive and an 
ex-Washington Redskins quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 In an agreement with Hollywood Park Inc., Don Klosterman, general manager of 
the Rams football team in the 1970s, and Eddie LeBaron, a Redskins quarterback 
in the 1950s and chief operating officer for the Atlanta Falcons in the 1980s, 
would lease the 200-table club. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood and Hollywood Park officials had hoped the card club would open in 
early January, but the state attorney general's office denied a gambling 
license to a group that included Edward Allred, a partner in the Los Alamitos 
Race Course. In denying the license, the state cited Allred's previous stock 
ownership in out-of-state gambling businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's action infuriated Inglewood officials, who said the attorney 
general's office was finding excuses not to approve the license. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been able to understand their position at all," said City Manger 
Paul D. Eckles. "One of the things we don't think they've been sensitive to is 
the magnitude and the importance of this project in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Klosterman and LeBaron still must apply for a state license and pass a series 
of background checks by Inglewood officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd never suggest to the attorney general that he not do the same kind of 
due diligence that we intend to when we get the application, but I can tell you 
we're going to expedite our reviews, and we hope we can approve it," Eckles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckles estimated that the card club could produce about $10 million a year for 
the city and employ about 2,500 people. Based on the hope that it will be 
opened soon after July 1, Eckles is including about $4 million in revenue from 
the card club in the fiscal 1994 budget. LISA RICHARDSON

COVER STORY; COMMERCIAL APPEAL; PUBLIC-ACCESS TV WAS BORN AS A MARKETPLACE OF 
IDEAS. BUT 25 YEARS LATER, IT'S MORE MARKETING THAN PHILOSOPHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 On one channel, two women bare their tattoos for a captivated talk-show host. 
On another, an out-of-work twentysomething moons a South Bay mayor. Flip on 
down the dial, and a chiropractor peddles a sure-fire cure for whiplash. 
</P>
<P>
 A trash-TV nightmare? Nope. Such fare is probably available on your tube right 
now. And it's not coming from Geraldo Rivera and Montel Williams, but from your 
next-door neighbors. The shoulder of the "information superhighway," it turns 
out, is dotted with the billboards and Burma Shave signs of public-access cable 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed 25 years ago as an "electronic soapbox" that would put mass media in 
the hands of the masses and invigorate democracy, public access has become 
something not quite as heady: A latter-day Schwab's drugstore for aspiring 
talk-show hosts, "Wayne's World" wanna-bes and hawking hairdressers. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the strictly non-commercial world of public-access TV has 
proven susceptible to creeping commercialism, especially in entertainment-savvy 
Southern California. And while the medium has long been ridiculed for its 
self-indulgent content and amateur productions, community programming is 
getting a bit more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Terry Anfuso, a fitness instructor from Rolling Hills Estates who 
hopes to join the growing ranks of talk-show hosts such as Oprah Winfrey and 
Phil Donahue. Her half-hour show, "Terry's Topics," has aired for four years on 
various public-access channels in the South Bay and Westside while Anfuso has 
tried to cross over to network TV or syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say people want to watch the sensational things," said Anfuso, whose 
show has tackled such issues as belly-dancing, female boxing and celebrity 
look-alikes. "I would like to make it big; to do the show big-time." 
</P>
<P>
 In true Oprah style, Anfuso recently booked two young women with tattoos and 
body piercings. During a Tuesday night taping at a studio in Rolling Hills 
Estates, she gingerly queried the women as they revealed tattoos of animals and 
flowers on their backs and legs. "Did getting your nipple pierced hurt?" Anfuso 
asks. (Yes.) "Will a suntan fade the tattoos?" (Yes, again.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Anfuso's director, Edd Linskey, gave instructions to three amateur 
cameramen from a small control room. "Focus, (camera) three, focus," he says 
into the microphone. "No, no . . . don't cut off her head. Higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Linskey, who has done production work on Hollywood TV shows and now works full 
time at Dimension Cable in Rolling Hills Estates, acknowledges that some hope 
public access will be a springboard to something better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry's trying to find her niche," he said during a break in taping. "She 
definitely would like to go national. That's been her dream for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are even bolder about using public access as a public-relations tool. 
Entrepreneurs have used the medium to run barely disguised infomercials for 
chiropractic, hairstyling and dentistry services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Chiropractic Society, a trade association, uses 
public-access facilities throughout the metropolitan area to produce the series 
"Chiropractic Today and Beyond," featuring member doctors. At the end of each 
show, viewers are advised to call an 800-number to get more information. 
Callers are then referred to a practitioner in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 For such users, the chief advantage to public access is that it costs nothing. 
In most cases, even the training and materials are free. The tab is picked up 
by cable companies, who collect their revenue from -- you guessed it -- their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Public-access channels are governed by franchise agreements between cable 
companies and each city or town. Most communities require users and producers 
to get training, but otherwise they take a hands-off approach to production and 
distribution of videotapes. The lack of oversight has made it easier for users 
to edge closer to commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
 In most communities, as long as a program is not explicitly obscene or 
commercial, public-access administrators must air it unedited. Censoring a 
program, administrators say, would violate cable franchise agreements and the 
1st Amendment, though some programmers admit they practice a form of censorship 
by putting undesirable shows on very late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Public-access promotion is "really a gray area," said Patty King, production 
supervisor at MultiVision Cable, which serves Hermosa Beach and Manhattan 
Beach. "Some people are not aware of the freedom on public access. Others are, 
and they'll take advantage of it . . .. If you're slick about it, you can get 
away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone who uses public access has a product to plug or a 
career to advance. Skip E. Lowe is a retired stand-up comic who uses a Beverly 
Hills facility to produce a talk show with aging stars such as Shelley Winters, 
Stella Stevens and Virginia O'Brien. He has been doing the show for 14 years 
with no compensation other than his own self-fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do I do it? I like to keep myself busy," Lowe said. "I'm enjoying what 
I'm doing, even though I'm not getting paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe said he spends 30 to 40 hours a week working on his show, mostly lining 
up guests and sending tapes to various public-access channels in Southern 
California, New York and elsewhere. He often arranges guest appearances by 
going to Hollywood parties and chatting up celebrities who have seen his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm basically a one-man operation," Lowe said. "I've had many people try to 
syndicate, but they want me to sign everything over to them, and I can't do 
that. I work too hard on this for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Other, less-devoted amateurs simply appreciate the chance to blow off steam on 
camera. While experts say off-the-cuff programming rarely makes for good TV, it 
does match the original intention of public access. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cole, director of the UCLA Center for Communication Policy, recalls an 
area public-access show on which the host expressed disappointment that few 
people read books anymore. "So he used to sit in the studio and read a book. 
But not out loud," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that's most of public access -- cheap, easy, sort of odd," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public access "gives each and every citizen the opportunity to express ideas 
through mass communications," said Michael Smith, Torrance cable-television 
administrator. "It's free speech. We're operating the facility 
content-neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that approach is precisely what enables some users to bend the system for 
personal gain. Because programmers have severely limited power to censor, 
creative producers can beam a pitch to a large TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, is not how cable companies pitched public access in the late 
1960s and early 1970s. Early operators were eager to negotiate franchise 
agreements with sometimes reluctant cities and towns. So to sweeten the pot, 
the companies agreed to devote one or more channels to public, educational or 
government (PEG) access, with no cost to the user. 
</P>
<P>
 Communities often use government-access channels to air city council meetings 
and local promotional pieces. In Hawthorne, for example, Mayor Larry Guidi 
hosts a government-access show, "A Taste of Hawthorne," featuring local 
restaurants. Some communities separate government and public access on 
different channels, some don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was that cable companies would compensate the city for the use of 
the taxpayers' (electronic) right of way," said Susan Herman, general manager 
of the Los Angeles Department of Telecommunication. "The companies would 
provide public-benefit services, like free (hook-ups) for schools, hospitals 
and so on. They would also provide access for governments and the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike network broadcasters, public-access channels are governed not by the 
media companies or the Federal Communications Commission but by franchise 
agreements with each town. The resulting lack of broad oversight has made it 
easier for ingenious users to edge closer to commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, the UCLA professor, reports that the selling of public access happens 
more often in the Los Angeles area, mainly because it is the home of major 
entertainment companies. Users will produce a tape in a facility near their 
homes -- the Torrance studio, for example -- and then "bicycle" or export the 
tape to towns where it stands a chance of being seen by a channel-surfing media 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the type of opportunity that Torrance resident and UCLA graduate Brian 
Ormsby relishes. Ormsby, 24, and his housemate, Brad Dodge, 25, are the hosts 
of "Too Much Free Time," an hourlong talk and variety show bicycled all over 
the South Bay, Westside and San Fernando Valley. They estimate their potential 
audience is 670,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 Ormsby said that "Too Much Free Time" trades on the trend toward "real-life 
TV" pioneered by such shows as MTV's "Real World" and popularized by the 
fictional "Wayne's World." Political correctness is evidently shelved during 
taping. One show featured a chat with lesbian strippers. Another featured 
Ormsby saluting outgoing Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert by dropping his trousers 
and baring his backside for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just a post-college prank. Ormsby said he would like to take the 
program national and is looking for sponsors -- a ploy which, if effective, 
would bar the program's distribution on public access. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to make it big and make a lot of money," said Ormsby, who says 
he lost his job at a car-rental company last year after a manager saw the show, 
found it offensive and told him to stop doing it. He refused and now is 
unemployed. Dodge is a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to syndicate the program ourselves," Ormsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many question whether public access is seen by enough people to be an 
effective crossover tool. Even the free-advertising benefit is overrated, some 
say, because viewers skip over public-access stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody watches public access, because a lot of the programs are not well done 
and are rather boring," said Torrance resident Steven Morris, who produced an 
eight-part lecture series promoting atheism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some programmers disagree, however, arguing that public access will become 
even more important as cable companies offer hundreds of channels and 
desperately seek all kinds of programming, whether they are amateur, 
professional or somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman, Los Angeles' chief spokeswoman on cable issues, points out that the 14 
franchise areas served by her department cover most of the county and reach 
520,000 households. The public-access facilities churn out an average of 720 
original half-hour shows every month, Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The question isn't whether public access is being used, but how. Even its 
staunchest supporters admit that the direction the medium has taken over the 
years isn't exactly what its inventors had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public access," said UCLA's Cole, "is an extraordinary resource that hasn't 
been used very effectively. That doesn't argue against it. It's there to be 
used, stupidly or effectively." On the Cover

 Torrance resident Brad Dodge, 25, left, and his housemate, Brian Ormsby, 24, 
are the hosts of "Too Much Free Time," an hourlong talk and variety show that 
is filmed free at the Torrance public-access channel and exported throughout 
the South Bay, the Westside and the San Fernando Valley. The duo, like many 
others with shows on public access, hope to make it to commercial television 
some day. South Bay Public-Access Channels 03,23,09,15 CITY CHANNEL CABLE

COMMUNITY SPLIT OVER PROPOSALS FOR EAST WILMINGTON SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal by Habitat for Humanity to build 13 duplexes on an abandoned 
railroad right of way in east Wilmington has split the community. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether a park would be preferable to affordable housing on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents the harbor 
area, has met twice with Habitat representatives and with several community 
groups, but has not been able to forge an agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to find some consensus on this because we want to support 
whatever it is that the majority of Wilmington residents support," Svorinich 
said. "But so far there's no consensus." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Wilmington Homeowners want the land used for a park. Banning Park 
Neighborhood Assn. is undecided but leans toward a greenbelt, while many 
residents in east Wilmington favor the Habitat proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilmington North Neighborhood Assn. also favors the housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that 80% of our members were in favor of it," said WNNA President 
Gertrude Schwab. "But we would like to sit down with them before anything 
happens and see whether they're willing to mitigate some existing conditions."

FINANCE COMMITTEE SET FOR ALAMEDA CORRIDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority has elected a seven-member 
finance committee to oversee funding of the $2-billion commerce superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will be headed by Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich 
Jr., who represents San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The other members are Long Beach City Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg; Carson 
Mayor Michael I. Mitoma; Los Angeles County representative Burke Roche; 
Caltrans representative Jerry Baxter; Steve Dillenbeck of the Port of Long 
Beach, and Executive Director of the Port of Los Angeles Ezunial Burts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alameda Corridor Project, expected to be completed by 2000, will run from 
the Port of Los Angeles to shipping centers on the city's Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 It will divert heavy trucks and train traffic carrying ship cargo away from 
burdened freeways onto a designated six-lane highway and railway line. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to immediately create more than 10,000 construction 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic impact of the Alameda Corridor to the local economy, the harbor 
area, and to the rest of our nation will be tremendous," Svorinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first $107 million for construction is expected from the federal 
government in the next fiscal budget. SUSAN WOODWARD

THE NATURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Yates, a junior at West Torrance High, is having the kind of year most 
athletes dream about. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning All-Southern Section honors in football and soccer, Yates 
appears destined for more accolades this baseball season. He leads West in 
virtually every offensive category, and in the past three weeks has elevated 
his game to another level. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on fire," Warrior assistant Mike Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wednesday's Pioneer League game against North Torrance, Yates had 
driven in 22 runs in seven games. He batted five for five with a two-run homer 
and four runs batted in Saturday to lead West to an 18-1 victory over Carson in 
the quarterfinals of the Redondo tournament. Tuesday, he was three for four 
with a home run and four RBIs in a 9-2 nonleague victory over Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 That performance left Yates with a .576 average (30 for 52), six home runs and 
29 RBIs for the Warriors, who were 13-3 and 1-1 in league play before 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's helped us out a lot," said Jenkins, alluding to the fact that Yates has 
picked up the slack for an injured Derek Nicholson, the team's senior leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson, The Times' 1993 South Bay Player of the Year, has been restricted 
to designated hitter in recent weeks because of a pulled calf muscle. The 
infielder sat out a game last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates, a good runner, normally plays center field but has also played third 
base and first base because of West's lack of depth in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a good athlete that we can move him around," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 200-pound Yates had already demonstrated his versatility in 
other sports. Last football season, he played tight end and free safety, and 
was a kicker and punter. He was named to The Times' South Bay All-Star team and 
the Southern Section Division IX team as a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 A forward in soccer, he was named to the Division II third team. PIONEER 
STUNNER 
</P>
<P>
 It figured to be a routine victory. But when West opened Pioneer League play 
last week, perennial doormat Centennial came away with an 8-5 upset at home to 
break a seven-game Warrior winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those games," Jenkins said. "Everything went right for them, 
and nothing went right for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said West committed four errors, all of which led to Centennial runs. 
The Apaches scored only one earned run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our players were overconfident," Jenkins said. "They figured we'd go 
over there and hammer them. We kind of went through the motions." 
</P>
<P>
 West atoned for the loss with an 18-0 victory over Centennial in Friday's 
rematch at West. AWARD WINNERS 
</P>
<P>
 It was a big day for Inglewood High at The Times' South Bay All-Star 
basketball breakfast Sunday at the Guest Quarters Hotel in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood forward Paul Pierce was named boys' player of the year and Sentinel 
Coach Pat Roy was coach of the year. The girls' awards went to Peninsula guard 
Mimi McKinney and Banning Coach David DeLaby. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, a 6-foot-6 junior, led Inglewood (30-4) to the Southern Section 
Division II-AA title and the Division II regional final, averaging 23 points 
and 11 rebounds. He was named the state's top junior by Cal-Hi Sports and is 
being heavily recruited by major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy coached the Sentinels to their most successful season since 1979-80, when 
they went 29-0 and won the national championship. In two seasons, the former 
Inglewood player has guided his alma mater to a 50-14 record, two Bay League 
titles and a Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney, a three-time South Bay all-star and two-time All-American, led 
Peninsula (25-5) to the Division I-AA final and the regional semifinals. The 
5-9 senior averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds. She signed a letter of intent 
with Virginia last week. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLaby coached Banning (16-11) to the City Section 3-A Division title in his 
seventh season. The Pilot girls were successful despite a lack of senior 
leadership. Their top eight players were juniors, led by guard Jenille Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Olive of Loyola Marymount was the guest speaker and addressed the 
all-stars. EXODUS 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula Coach Wendell Yoshida has helped put Southern California girls' 
basketball on the map by building one the nation's top programs. But rarely 
have Southland colleges reaped the benefits of that talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida's best players have almost always picked schools outside of Southern 
California, dating to his days as coach at Palos Verdes. McKinney didn't even 
consider a local college. She chose Virginia over Arizona, Auburn and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they don't stay local," said Yoshida, a three-time winner of 
the South Bay coach of the year award. "I think one of the main reasons is that 
(other areas) get bigger crowds for women's basketball. Out here, it's just 
another thing." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney is the fourth player coached by Yoshida who will attend Virginia. 
Six-foot-5 twins Heather and Heidi Burge, former Palos Verdes standouts, had 
successful careers for the Cavaliers, and 6-5 Jeffra Gausepohl, the center on 
Peninsula's national championship team in 1991-92, was a sophomore reserve at 
Virginia last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Yoshida-coached players who left the area include Palos Verdes graduate 
Hillary Recknor, who played at Washington, and current Auburn players Monique 
Morehouse and Kristen Mulligan, both former Peninsula standouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local schools don't seem to recruit that well," Yoshida said. "More 
people from out of state are recruiting in California, and they do a heck of a 
job." GIRLS' SIGNINGS

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jo Ellen McDermott says her husband was tired of eating meatloaf all the time, 
so he gave her $5 (this was 1961) to take a weeklong cooking class. When the 
class was over, she started trying out her own creations on him and their 
friends. John McDermott declared that fiver the best investment he ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 This was just the beginning, though. Jo Ellen McDermott went on to earn an 
associate of arts degree in food services at El Camino College, and today she 
owns the 9-year-old Lemon Tree Cafe in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cozy little place, with the feel of the dining room at a bed and 
breakfast (although it's only open for lunch). Flowery cloths cover the tables, 
oak shelves display a teapot collection and the windows are covered by ruffled 
white curtains on a thick brass rail. With the arrival of spring, there's also 
limited seating at a small patio filled with geraniums and impatiens. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is really just an outline for the daily specials, which appear on a 
chalkboard. One of the most popular items is chicken sesame ($7), diced chicken 
breast in a sweet-and-sour sauce with sesame seeds, roasted almonds and green 
onions. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott's version of shepherd's pie ($7) contains ground leg of lamb, sweet 
Italian sausage, celery, carrots, onions and parsley, topped with garlic mashed 
potatoes baked to a golden brown crust. All entrees include salad or soup of 
the day, which might be cream of carrot or vegetable bean. A soup and salad 
combination is $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Often there's quiche, such as a mushroom quiche heady with fresh tarragon 
($7). If quiche isn't offered, crepes will be; for instance, crepes Florentine 
with spinach and eggs ($7). 
</P>
<P>
 The Lemon Tree Cafe is at 24416 Crenshaw Blvd. in Torrance. (310) 530-3194. 
Open Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: COMPTON; JUDGE ALLOWS GREEN TO RETAIN COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine months after he was appointed to the City Council, Ronald Green was told 
by a Superior Court judge last week that he can keep his seat, even though the 
council maneuvering that originally put Green in office was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Green's appointment in June, 1993, was contested by former City Councilwoman 
Patricia A. Moore, who complained that the move amounted to political shuffling 
by Mayor Omar Bradley to shore up his council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to Moore, started when Bradley had himself appointed to 
the open mayor's seat three weeks early last June after winning a citywide 
election against Moore. The mayor's chair had been vacant since January, 1993, 
when then-mayor Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) left for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley and the council majority voted to appoint him mayor before the July 1 
inauguration, declared his 1st District seat vacant and appointed political 
unknown Green. Moore filed suit last November in an effort to have Green 
removed, and Attorney General Daniel E. Lungren joined the complaint. Moore 
argued that Bradley's early elevation to mayor was invalid. As a result, she 
contended, his council seat was never open for Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Judge Enrique Romero of Compton Superior Court ruled that Bradley's 
early appointment to the mayor's seat was invalid. But Romero said Bradley 
abandoned the council seat, creating the vacancy for Green. The three remaining 
council members constituted a legal quorum, and their 2-1 vote to appoint Green 
was valid, the judge ruled. Councilwomen Bernice Woods and Jane D. Robbins 
voted to appoint Green. Moore was opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Bradley would have occupied the mayor's office July 1 by virtue of his 
election, the judge's decision does not affect his mayoral status. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SIGNAL HILL; COUNCIL OKS ORDINANCE TO FIGHT GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved an anti-graffiti ordinance with more than a 
dozen measures to limit tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will expand the definition of graffiti tools from spray paint to 
"any implement capable of marking a surface" wider than one-eighth of an 
inch.Under the plan, minors could be arrested for carrying items such as felt 
tip pens, paint sticks, adhesive labels and etching tools on school grounds and 
public and private property without consent of the owner. It will be against 
the law for an adult other than a parent or guardian to give these items to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Michael McCrary said the new restrictions were prompted by 
changes in the implements used by taggers, rather than an increase in graffiti. 
"It's not strictly a spray-paint business anymore," he said. Signal Hill has 
spent about $22,000 a year on graffiti cleanup since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance requires the parents of underage vandals to pay for cleanup. 
Retail stores will be required to keep graffiti implements in locked 
compartments or face civil suits if the implements are used in a crime.  
</P>
<P>
 People who report an act of vandalism from their cellular telephones could 
receive reimbursement under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A violation of the ordinance would be a misdemeanor, officials said, with a 
maximum punishment of $500 or six months in jail, or both. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; COUNCILMAN, 2 OTHERS CITED IN CITY HALL SCUFFLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local pastor, a city employee and City Councilman Robert Henning have been 
cited by Sheriff's Department deputies following a scuffle in the City Hall 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning said the Rev. Charles Floyd attacked him in the lot after a tense 
planning commission meeting.The councilman said Floyd knocked a cigarette out 
of his mouth and yanked his tie, and that Isadore Hall, a city administrative 
assistant, had to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd said he was walking with Henning, lost his balance and reached toward 
Henning. The councilman then grabbed Floyd's arms and Hall locked the pastor in 
a bearhug and threatened to beat him up, Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall supported Henning's version of the incident.  
</P>
<P>
 Henning called sheriff's deputies, who issued misdemeanor battery citations 
against Floyd, Henning and Hall, based on their accounts of what happened. 
Bystanders gave conflicting accounts, according to a deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal hearing at the district attorney's office in Compton has been set 
for May 5 to interview the participants and witnesses and attempt to resolve 
the dispute out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident took place last week after Henning appeared at a planning 
commission meeting to support a permit request to allow a local church 
congregation to move into a building once owned by Floyd. JOHN D. WAGNER

ABC BOARD DEFIES COUNTY, OKS BONUSES; EDUCATION: CRITICS SAY THE $1.3-MILLION 
ACTION THREATENS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S SOLVENCY. THE VOTE MAY BE NULLIFIED BY A 
FISCAL ADVISER WHO WAS APPOINTED MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A divided ABC school board has approved bonus pay for teachers in defiance of 
county education officials, who warned that the action could worsen financial 
woes that threaten to bankrupt the school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus pay was included in a controversial teachers' contract that the 
school board approved 4 to 3 near the close of a five-hour meeting punctuated 
by finger-pointing among trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, in a letter to the district, had directed the school board 
not to approve the contract before knowing if there is money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees' action at Tuesday's meeting could be nullified by a county 
fiscal adviser who has the authority to veto district spending decisions. The 
county education office appointed a fiscal adviser Monday to resolve months of 
budget wrangling between staff and school board members of the ABC Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The board majority said that the district could afford the contract and that 
teachers and students would benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children deserve to have the best learning conditions available to them," 
board member David Montgomery said. "That is the main reason I'm voting tonight 
for this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery's remarks drew mostly cheers from an audience of 200, primarily 
teachers and their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers contract calls for a one-time bonus of 1% plus a slight reduction 
in class sizes. The agreement essentially restores pay cuts and eliminates 
larger class sizes imposed on teachers last fall by the previous school board. 
A new board majority, backed by teachers, took the reins following November's 
school board election and an 11-day teachers' strike over the imposed contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the new contract, including three board members, warned that 
approving the pact, which has a $1.3-million price tag, could break the 
district's $69-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be fiscally irresponsible to support the tentative agreement," board 
member Dixie Primosch said before voting against the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone from one of the most respected districts in the state to one 
that's got a fiscal adviser," said board member Robert Hughlett, who also 
opposed the contract. "I lay the blame at the feet of the majority." 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the contract and district finances ultimately rests with the 
county office of education, said Kenneth Shelton, an assistant county school 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiscal adviser appointed by the county would have broad powers to alter 
ABC's current spending plan, including the authority to veto decisions that 
would normally be made by the seven-member board or its administrators.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said the county education office has not decided whether to void the 
teachers contract. He said the fiscal adviser, who has not yet been named, will 
first study whether the district can afford the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton added that the county's intervention should not be viewed as a hostile 
takeover. It's a "friendly" effort to help the district remain solvent, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 County and district staff members have said that ABC is spending more money 
than it is receiving, and that the spending deficit, if it continues, will 
approach $2.8 million at the end of the next school year. Such a deficit would 
consume nearly all of the district's reserves, leaving the school system of 
21,000 students on the brink of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Cecy Groom has questioned the gloomy financial assessment. She 
said the board plans to ask county education officials to reconsider their 
appointment of an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Unified, which serves Cerritos, Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens and parts of 
Lakewood and Norwalk, is one of six school districts statewide to be assigned a 
fiscal adviser in the last 18 months, said Patrick Keegan, an assistant 
superintendent with the state Department of Education. Three of the other 
districts are in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigning a fiscal adviser is one of a series of steps that the state has 
established to help districts resolve financial problems. Districts that become 
insolvent fall under state control. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby Compton Unified School District, for example, a state-appointed 
administrator took over in July after the state granted the district about $20 
million in emergency loans. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's ABC school board meeting, some teachers and parents protested the 
county intervention.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the board of education stands up to the county," said Laura Rico, 
co-president of the ABC Federation of Teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Others welcomed the county's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of relieved," said Wendy Wald, a parent of two Cerritos High School 
students. "I feel like now we can straighten out the mess."

MERCHANTS CLEAR AWAY THE SMOKE; ORDINANCE: RESTAURANTS, BARS MUST COMPLY WITH 
LONG BEACH'S NEW SMOKING RESTRICTIONS. BUT THOSE WHO STILL WANT TO LIGHT UP ARE 
HOT UNDER THE COLLAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The reddish glow of cigarettes went out in Long Beach restaurants, bowling 
alleys and employee lunchrooms this week as the city's toughest no-smoking law 
to date went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance became effective Tuesday morning as City Council members 
validated last week's citywide election in which voters approved the 
anti-smoking law by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city, restaurateurs put up no-smoking signs and swept ashtrays 
off tables -- marking the end of a three-year battle to eliminate smoking in 
public areas and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters spoke loud and clear. The ordinance passed by a healthy margin in 
every single district," said Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, who introduced 
the anti-smoking proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 After voting to accept election results, Braude went out to lunch with 
colleagues, he said. "I did notice that nobody was smoking that I saw or 
smelled. It was a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law prohibits smoking in any eatery or workplace, including attached 
bars, hair salons, bowling alleys, health-care facilities and business offices. 
Puffing is limited to a third of the seating area in separate bars that do not 
share a ventilation system with a restaurant, and in a third of the patio area 
of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The law does not cover any buildings under control of another governmental 
body. But agencies that are exempt, such as the Veterans Administration or 
school district, have no-smoking policies or expect to implement similar 
restrictions within the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A provision allows the council to review the law within 18 months of passage 
and to banish the remaining smokers from bars and patio restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the council has been trying to enact a no-smoking policy in public 
areas, but has twice came up against well-financed campaigns by the tobacco 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 That year, council members backed away from an ordinance to ban smoking after 
a petition drive forced them to rescind their new law or put it to a public 
vote. They passed a watered-down version requiring restaurants to set aside 
two-thirds of their space for nonsmokers. Last year, council members tried 
again. They passed a no-smoking ordinance in July, then voted to put the issue 
on the April 12 ballot in the wake of another successful petition campaign 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, council members have repeatedly warned businesses 
that nonsmoking was the wave of the future and stricter laws were inevitable. 
Still, some restaurateurs are bristling under the law, or seeking ways to dodge 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Americana Restaurant -- a downtown haven for retirees who linger for 
hours over a bottomless cup of coffee and endless cigarettes -- customers and 
employees spoke angrily about their constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarettes are not illegal, waitress Loretta Miller said while she had a 
lunchtime burger 24 hours before the no-smoking law took effect. Three 
chain-smoking customers, seated at the table with Miller, grunted their 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take away (smoking) is to take away our freedom of choice, constitutional 
rights," Miller declared. "This doesn't feel like the United States anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 In Belmont Heights, Aimee Jarrels, owner and manager of the Reno Room bar, 
which features a neon sign out front proclaiming "Open at 6 a.m," said she 
hasn't decided how to react. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time believing they will have the money or manpower to enforce 
it," Jarrels said. She has considered making her narrow, dark bar into a 
private club and charging customers 25 cents to get in, in hopes of 
circumventing the law. 
</P>
<P>
 But that won't work, said Judy Ross, health promotion coordinator with the 
city's Health Department, which is charged with enforcing smoking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Private clubs are exempt from the law, but only if they declared themselves as 
such by July 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Department won't be sending out officers to check for compliance, 
Ross said. No city employees will be counting chairs to ensure that two-thirds 
of the seating in taverns is for nonsmokers. But if citizens complain about a 
certain eatery, the law does have teeth: Scofflaw business owners will be 
referred to the city prosecutor and could be charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 The first offense carries a minimum $50 fine, with penalties being raised 
incrementally for subsequent violations, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross doesn't foresee a serious problem with the no-smoking laws, however. 
Since the 1991 law gave nonsmokers the majority of restaurant seating, there 
have been violations, she said. But none of those cases went as far as the 
prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to comply; some of them are just unaware of the law," Ross 
said. "In the past, we've found that 85% of the businesses complied after the 
first time we called them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses that strongly opposed the tougher ordinance when it was 
introduced in July have since accepted -- even embraced -- their nonsmoking 
fate. Formerly a vocal opponent to new restrictions last year, management of 
one of downtown's fancier restaurants, L'Opera, was cheerful this week as the 
smoke cleared.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first we were opposing it," said Sonia Woodruff, one of L'Opera's 
managers. "We have a large Italian and Japanese clientele and we worried that a 
ban would change their minds about coming here. But we're a well-established 
restaurant and I feel it won't change our clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'm really happy about it because I'm pregnant," Woodruff said. 
"And before, no matter where you sat, you could smell the smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the smoking ordinance took effect Tuesday, the council passed a 
resolution asking citizens not to sign a statewide petition, backed by the 
tobacco industry, that supports a bill that would invalidate local smoking 
ordinances and would institute more lenient smoking restrictions.

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK; LOCAL ELECTIONS' FINAL DAYS MARKED BY FRICTION, FLYERS -- 
EVEN FIGHTS

 Everybody wants the last word. Last week's Long Beach mayoral election was no 
different, with candidates stuffing mailboxes all over town with last-minute 
appeals, using everything from photos of simulated carjackings to baby pictures 
to awkward acronyms in search of voter support. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral hopeful Ray Grabinski's last campaign piece featured a black-and-white 
photograph of an apparent carjacking, depicting a thug in a ski mask holding 
his gun to a blond woman's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? A nearly identical picture was used on controversial 
billboards around Los Angeles during recent labor disputes involving that 
city's police. The message: Without police, crime would become rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski's brochure urged voters to cast their lot with him, then offered 10 
tips to avoid a carjacking. The piece seemed to feed on residents' fear of 
violence and referred to "our city's tragic epidemic of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "We did get a couple of complaints about that one," Grabinski said. But the 
only complaint he could remember specifically was from a photographer who 
pointed out that the gunman's finger wasn't on the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski, a city councilman, made the runoff for the June election, trailing 
top vote-getter Beverly O'Neill by 1,251 votes. Her last flyer was entirely 
different, featuring photographs of her childhood in Long Beach and a personal 
history -- including the story of first date with husband, Bill -- in a glossy 
eight-page brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ernie Kell, who finished a distant fifth, spent weeks defending himself 
against challengers' contentions that he was out of touch in a changing city. 
Then he sent out a four-color glossy newspaper called "Long Beach Today." The 
feature headline: "Kell Honors WASP Pilots." Voters had to search the smaller 
print under the photo to discover that Kell was referring to Women's Air Force 
Service Pilots rather than white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

 MEAN STREETS: Politicians in Bellflower regularly promise to clean up crime 
and gang activity. But in the hours before the polls opened last week, 
politicians themselves were causing a ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before midnight April 11, three council candidates were squaring off on 
city streets in what seemed like the prelude to a rumble. Hours later, another 
candidate and a worker from another political camp were trading insults and 
missiles from moving cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first incident, City Council candidate Joseph Cvetko, 67, was cruising 
the streets about 11 p.m., looking for last-minute political hit pieces that he 
heard were being distributed. On Faywood Street, a red truck pulled up behind 
Cvetko, according to a report filed with sheriff's deputies. The group of men 
who leaped from the truck and surrounded Cvetko under the street lights 
included fellow City Council candidates Ray T. Smith and Randy Bomgaars, and 
Ron Schnablegger, stepson of Councilman Ken Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Bomgaars walked up and put his chest against Cvetko's, Cvetko told deputies. 
Cvetko accused Bomgaars of distributing the hit pieces. Bomgaars began 
swearing. Cvetko shoved Bomgaars away. Bomgaars was restrained by his buddies, 
and Cvetko swore out a complaint alleging Bomgaars had assaulted him.  
</P>
<P>
 Bomgaars offered a similar version of the confrontation, emphasizing that the 
only shoving was done by Cvetko. 
</P>
<P>
 About three hours later, council candidate Art Olivier was driving his van 
south on Woodruff Avenue when Jason Marquez, 21, stepson of Schnablegger, 
pulled alongside. Marquez said he hurled a bottle at Olivier's van. Olivier 
threw a claw hammer at Marquez's car, according to police reports. Then they 
drove to the sheriff's station and swore out complaints against each other. 
According to Marquez, the dispute actually started hours earlier, when Olivier 
was distributing last-minute campaign flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez says he noticed Olivier that afternoon riding a bicycle on lawns and 
dropping papers. When Marquez attempted to intervene, he said, an irate Olivier 
threw a traffic cone on Marquez's car and kicked him. Olivier was unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, Bomgaars and Olivier were elected to the council. The complaints have 
been turned over to county prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BOLD STRATEGY: In Signal Hill, some of the most heated debate centered not on 
words or messages, but the way they were printed. 
</P>
<P>
 When incumbent Mayor Carol Churchill's statement for the sample ballot rolled 
off the presses, several sentences and words were in bold type or underlined, 
even though election rules dictate all statements must be in uniform type.  
</P>
<P>
 Gordon L. Forester Jr., a supporter of rival candidate Tina Hansen, one of the 
eventual winners, complained to city officials. Churchill was found to be in 
violation of Elections Code Section 10012, according to a report by City Atty. 
David J. Aleshire. But when some suggested changing the ballot statements, 
Churchill threatened to sue the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the complaint was filed in late March, it was too late to make a 
change without interfering with the elections, Aleshire said. Churchill's bold 
statement was allowed to stand, but it apparently didn't help sway voters. She 
lost her bid for reelection, finishing third behind incumbent Gerard Goedhart 
and challenger Hansen in the race for two seats.

 FINAL COUNT: A final tally of votes in the Santa Fe Springs City Council race 
last week boosted newcomer George Minnehan over incumbent Councilman Ronald S. 
Kernes as the top vote-getter. The new count didn't change the fact that both 
men made it to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Judy Chavez had postponed counting 81 ballots that were questioned 
on election night until after signatures were checked against voter 
registration lists. After careful scrutiny Wednesday morning, workers decided 
to toss out 10 ballots, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A final count showed Minnehan receiving 1,109 votes to Kernes' 1,092. 
Incumbent Councilman Al Fuentes lost his council seat, receiving 1,064 votes 
and finishing third in the race for two seats. There was no change in the order 
of other candidates who ran. Former Santa Fe Springs City Clerk Hazel Fields 
received 947 votes; Hilda Zamora received 614 votes, and James Hogan Jr. 
received 530 votes.

NEIGHBORHOODS; DEPUTIES CRACK DOWN ON CLEANING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department Sgt. Mike Pippin called it the neighborhood Addams Family 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 It had six abandoned cars and overgrown grass in front, a swamp-like swimming 
pool in back, no carpeting and a non-functioning toilet. The residence on 
Honeysuckle Lane in unincorporated South Whittier was "horrible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was among dozens of houses and apartments in unincorporated areas near 
Whittier that Pippin and two other deputies have been inspecting for violations 
of health, building and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies have been assigned to the department's new Community-Oriented 
Problem Solving Team (COPS) to try to improve living conditions for the 
estimated 110,000 people in unincorporated areas east and south of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "County services have been minimal here for the last 10 to 20 years," Pippin 
said. "A broken window can lead to more broken windows, tagging and overall 
blighted conditions. It causes property values to go down and it leads to gang 
members and drug dealers coming in. They don't deal out of the $300,000 to 
$400,000 homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies told the owners of the Honeysuckle Lane home that they had three 
weeks to correct the violations or face misdemeanor charges that could result 
in fines or jail time. Pippin emphasized, however, that the team's main 
objective is to have residents fix up their properties. "We want compliance," 
he said. "We aren't looking to take people to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies have issued dozens of citations to owners of houses and 
apartments since being assigned to the team in early March. 
</P>
<P>
 They found a 54-unit apartment building on Norwalk Boulevard with gaping holes 
in its ceilings. Occupants had been without hot water for weeks, Pippin said. 
Rats and cockroaches scurried around the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners were given 21 days to correct the violations. County health 
officials will accompany the deputies on reinspections, Pippin said. 
</P>
<P>
 A partner of RTI Properties, a Gardena-based firm that manages the building, 
said the deputies' description of the conditions was exaggerated. "We had a 
water heater go out for two weekends, not for weeks," said the partner, who 
refused to give his name. "And we have regular pest spraying every month. Any 
problems we have, we take care of. We do not run a slum of any sort."  
</P>
<P>
 The team has also checked on homes that are suspected sites of drug 
trafficking, served search warrants, rousted illegal sidewalk vendors selling 
food items and have made arrests for a variety of illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies discovered that a yard sale was featuring stolen power tools and 
generators. The people who were selling the items were arrested and more than 
$30,000 in equipment was confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion the three deputies checked a home known for narcotics 
trafficking and detained a man whom they learned later was wanted for 15 armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is patterned after a Sheriff's Department task force in East Los 
Angeles that concentrates on such community problems as substandard residences, 
gang activity, drug dealing and illegal vendors. In addition to Pippin, 
deputies Victor Ibarra and Tom Ctibor are assigned to the team. Officials plan 
to add two more deputies.  
</P>
<P>
 The Norwalk Sheriff's Station, which covers South Whittier, has urged County 
Supervisors Gloria Molina and Deane Dana to use $115,700 of their discretionary 
budgets to fund COPS for a six-month trial period. So far, the team has been 
funded by stations in Norwalk and Pico Rivera, which provide the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Gurian, 29, who lives near the Honeysuckle Lane home that the team has 
cited, praised the effort. "I think (what the deputies are doing) is great," 
she said. "I don't like looking across the street and seeing junk staring at me 
in the face."

HEALTH; BILL SEEKS TO LURE DOCTORS TO UNDERSERVED SOUTHEAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Health-care providers could be wooed to the medically underserved Southeast 
area through incentives similar to those used to attract business to 
economically troubled areas, according to an Assembly bill.  
</P>
<P>
 The bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park), 
would create 10 "medical enterprise zones" throughout the state and offer tax 
credits and other incentives to health professionals who practice in the zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical enterprise zones would exist within some of the 25 existing 
business enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the bill could help reduce long-term and emergency health care 
costs by making preventive care readily available to needy residents, Escutia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My constituents are classified as the 'working poor' who earn an average 
income of $7,500 per year," Escutia said. "Many are in desperate need of health 
services but lack the financial resources or insurance to pay for the 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Bureau of Primary Health Care has designated the cities of 
Commerce, Bell, Huntington Park and Maywood as "health professional shortage 
areas," poor regions where the ratio of residents to full-time doctors is about 
3,500 to 1, and where there are high rates of birth and infant mortality, 
according to a bureau report. MARY HELEN BERG

ENVIRONMENT; FIRM TO PAY $485,000 FOR TOXIC CHEMICAL EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Toyota subsidiary in North Long Beach has agreed in an out-of-court 
settlement to pay $485,000 to the federal government for releasing toxic 
chemicals into the air in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 TABC Inc., which assembles and paints truck beds, was accused of using paints 
and primers from 1984 to 1988 that violated Environmental Protection Agency 
emissions codes under the federal Clean Air Act, officials said.TABC, at 6375 
Paramount Blvd., is owned by Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, the company had been releasing an excessive amount 
of volatile organic compounds, which are byproducts of the painting process. 
EPA officials said the chemicals contribute to greater ground-level ozone, 
which has been linked to impaired breathing, irritated mucous membranes in the 
nose and throat, and may harm the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the fine, TABC will be required to certify compliance with 
air-quality regulations, which company officials said they have done since 
learning of the violations in 1988. EPA and Toyota officials said they agreed 
the company did not knowingly violate the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota spokesman Michael Rouse said TABC assumed it was not breaking the law 
since it complied with California Air Quality Management District rules, which 
are usually stricter than EPA regulations. JOHN POPE

COMMUNITY NEWS: ANTI-CRIME ACTIVISTS' TARGET FILES COUNTERSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betsy Bredau, a community activist whose Safe Streets Now! organization uses 
lawsuits as a weapon to clean up neighborhoods, has been sued by one of her 
group's targets. 
</P>
<P>
 A Long Beach hotel owner alleges that most of his tenants moved out after 
Bredau and her watchdog group sent threatening letters, denounced the property 
in news conferences and encouraged neighbors to file lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanmalibhai Galal, owner of the Arcade Hotel at 1097 Long Beach Blvd., is 
seeking unspecified damages for lost business and an injunction barring Bredau 
or her nonprofit group from pursuing further action against the hotel, 
according to a lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her actions have seriously affected his business and jeopardized his 
reputation in the community," said Frank Weiser, Galal's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau said a lawsuit was not unexpected in light of her organization's 
confrontational strategy. "This is pretty common for anyone who's an activist," 
she said. "You have to take those kinds of things and you have to be able to 
deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Streets Now!, which started in Oakland five years ago, tries to help 
neighborhoods root out drug dealers and troublemakers by taking owners of 
problem properties to Small Claims Court. Bredau started Long Beach program in 
August and recently received a $20,000 city grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arcade Hotel, which Long Beach officials describe as one of the city's 
most troubled, has been the most recent target. Police have been called to the 
site about 200 times in the last two years, and the Police Department has sent 
letters to Galal condemning an ongoing drug problem at the hotel, said Sharon 
Diggs-Jackson, drug abatement coordinator with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau described her organization's strategy to the hotel's neighbors during a 
January workshop. Neighbors have kept logs of alleged criminal activity in or 
near the hotel. A summary of these logs was included in a Feb. 24 letter to 
Galal warning the 15-year owner of the hotel that he faced legal action unless 
the alleged crimes ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau held a news conference recently in a parking lot near the hotel, and 
denounced Galal's management of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign came to a head Tuesday, when Galal appeared in Small Claims Court 
in Long Beach to defend himself in separate suits filed by 14 neighbors, who 
are seeking $5,000 each from Galal for mental and emotional distress that they 
say they have suffered while living near the hotel. They describe the hotel as 
a haven for criminal activity, including drug sales and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on the suits is expected within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Galal's son, Mahesh, who manages the hotel, said the allegations are 
unfounded. "This is a high-crime area," he said. "There are problems in 
adjacent buildings, but not in ours. We don't allow anything like that on our 
property. Why are they coming after us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mahesh Galal said eight of the hotel's 10 tenants have moved out since the 
neighborhood campaign began. 
</P>
<P>
 Galal's attorney, Weiser, also disputed city allegations about the property. 
"If, in fact, the city had all these complaints, why hasn't the city instituted 
an action all this time?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a legitimate allegation against my client, there are direct 
remedies under health, safety and penal codes. We've got an organization that's 
putting the cart before the horse."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA FE SPRINGS; NEW HOMES TO REPLACE FLORENCE APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN GRIFFITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Demolition crews have begun to tear down apartments with conditions so 
deplorable they prompted a law requiring the annual inspection of all apartment 
units -- one of the strictest such ordinances in the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The Florence Fountain Apartments, a nine-building complex on a 2.78-acre lot 
on Florence Avenue, will be replaced by a tract of 19 new houses built for 
first-time home-buyers. The new development will reportedly be the city's first 
affordable-housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the apartments were the worst-maintained in Santa Fe 
Springs. The 80-unit complex was declared unsafe and evacuated in 1992 after 
rain leaking through roof caused structural damage, and some ceilings fell in 
first- and second-floor units, said Jim Turba, assistant director of planning 
for Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints from residents and neighbors of the complex prompted the city to 
pass an ordinance requiring a yearly inspection of all 4,000 apartments in the 
city to check for compliance with city regulations, Turba said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if there are problems, the city inspector notifies the tenant and 
owner, who usually has 35 to 40 days to fix problems, which are usually minor, 
such as a torn rug or broken toilet. Health hazards, however, must be corrected 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The city purchased the deteriorated Florence Fountain complex for $1.9 million 
in 1993. Demolition was approved March 24 by the Community Development 
Commission, which at that time also approved designs for 19 houses on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes in the new development would be available only to Santa Fe Springs 
residents who are first-time buyers with low to moderate incomes. A family of 
four, for example, could not earn more than $60,000 a year. The three-bedroom 
homes are expected to sell for about $165,000 and should be completed by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is financing the development, expected to cost slightly less than $5 
million, through a 30-year housing bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment complex had been abandoned for more than a year, said Turba, who 
toured the complex this winter. "It looked like you were in a futuristic 
science-fiction movie where people were coming back to Earth, and they found 
all these old buildings with weeds growing in them," he said. "It was pretty 
scary." ANN GRIFFITH

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; SMOKING BANNED ON SCHOOL PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Long Beach school board has approved a ban on smoking in schools and on 
other district property, including cars in school parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban, scheduled to take effect Sept. 1, will bring the school district in 
line with state requirements that school campuses be smoke-free by mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are simply going along with the public mood," said board member Mary 
Stanton. "(The policy) is not saying you cannot smoke, it's just saying you 
cannot inflict your smoke on others in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The only vote against the ban came from board member Edward M. Eveland, who 
likened the policy to Prohibition. "They (school employees) will smoke and they 
will break the law doing so," Eveland said. "Why place them in a position of 
illegal activity?" 
</P>
<P>
 The district currently allows smoking in designated lounges.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WHITTIER; 5-POINT SCALE APPROVED FOR ADVANCED COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students in advanced classes in the Whittier Union High School District will 
be graded on a higher scale for their work, the school board has decided.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, which will take effect at the start of next school year, a 
student in an advanced class will receive 5 points for an A, 4 points for a B 
and 3 points for a C. A student with a B average in the advanced classes, for 
example, would receive a 4.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonly, grading systems are based on a 4.0 scale, with an A grade receiving 
the highest, 4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Marina Anaya said the district wanted to acknowledge the 
tougher academic classes and encourage more students to enroll in them. She 
said the new grades will give advanced students a higher standing in class 
rankings and honor societies.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; RULING ALLOWS CITY TO CLOSE NUDE THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge this week upheld the city's efforts to shut down Body Parts, a 
controversial establishment that featured nude dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Richard Gadbois denied owner Thomas Shelley's request for 
a permanent injunction that would have allowed Body Parts to continue to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gadbois agreed with the city's contention that Body Parts violates an 
ordinance prohibiting adult businesses within 500 feet of a church. City 
officials maintained that Body Parts, at 12403 E. Carson St., is within 500 
feet of the Korean Presbyterian Church at 21732 Verne Ave., but attorneys for 
the theater owner had disputed the measurement. 
</P>
<P>
 Gadbois also ruled that Shelley was not a victim of discrimination. Shelley 
had accused the city of unfairly singling out his business because of its adult 
nature and contended that the attempts to close it were unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Jon Diamond, attorney for Body Parts, said he plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Hawaiian Gardens refused to grant Body Parts a business license, 
but Gadbois allowed the theater to open in January pending this week's 
decision.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county Office of Education has agreed to pay $4,000 each to nine 
special-education teachers who claimed they were underpaid, and is considering 
similar claims of at least $100,000 from 85 other teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers, who instruct physically, mentally or emotionally handicapped 
students in schools throughout the county, requested compensation for such 
activities as overseeing recess, helping students on buses and escorting 
students between classes. The teachers contended that such responsibilities 
should be counted as paid instructional time.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Joseph Semitian, who represents the Office of Education in Downey, 
said an administrative review procedure will be established to reconcile future 
differences over instructional pay.

LANDMARK COCKATOO INN STRIVES TO RECAPTURE THE GLORY OF ITS PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betty Grable slept there. And, as legend has it, so did Mickey Rooney, Harry 
James and dozens of other stars from the 1940s, '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cockatoo Inn in Hawthorne used to be a gathering place for the elite of 
Los Angeles. Today, the hotel is trying to rebound after two decades of decline 
that drove away much of its clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place went through a real depression," said Cliff Parks, 70, a used-car 
dealer who has been coming to the inn on Hawthorne Boulevard and Imperial 
Highway since 1956. "Now it's coming back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cockatoo opened in 1946 as a chicken-and-rib drive-in restaurant by Andrew 
J. Lococo, a colorful man who later owned the world's largest tuna-fishing 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lococo's business grew as jockeys and horse trainers from nearby Hollywood 
Park frequented the restaurant and attracted a following of celebrities and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember all the limos that used to pull up out front with congressmen and 
councilmen from all over," said Frank Lococo, 69, who worked as a manager for 
his cousin, Andrew, in the '50s and '60s. Today, Frank visits the hotel to 
reminisce with friends about the past, drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really something," Frank said. "Andy would buy 250 to 300 pounds of 
lobster at a time. We went through it pretty fast because a steak and lobster 
dinner was five bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, a fire destroyed the restaurant. Within months, Andrew Lococo rebuilt 
it and added a two-story house so he could live next door. Three years later, 
he opened the first part of what is now a 213-room hotel that resembles an old 
half-timbered English house. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1970, the Cockatoo's owner was in trouble with the law. The U.S. 
attorney general's office identified him as a major organized crime figure. The 
same year, he was convicted of perjury in connection with testimony during a 
grand jury investigation of interstate gambling and horse-race fixing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he sold the Cockatoo. In 1973, he died after a stroke at age 
55. 
</P>
<P>
 A succession of real estate companies operated the hotel through the 1970s and 
'80s, but longtime employees said business suffered without Lococo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other owners were very nice to me, but they didn't do much for the 
establishment," said Samantha Bradley, 70, a restaurant employee for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the hotel went bankrupt, said George E. Coult, head of the company 
managing the Cockatoo for its creditors. He said much of the facility was in 
disrepair. In addition, the hotel attracted prostitution and drug activity, 
general manager Craig Andres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after spending $1 million in refurbishments and a security system, Andres 
said the hotel's occupancy rate has doubled to 40% within the last year.

LIFT A STEIN, MUNCH A STRUDEL AT ANNELIESE'S BAVARIAN INN 
</P>

 In 1961, Karl's Little Bavaria opened in Long Beach and quickly became a 
favorite with college students for German beer and an occasional sausage. 
Karl's has evolved into Anneliese's Bavarian Inn, where some of those former 
college students are bringing their grandchildren. There's still a good beer 
list, but the emphasis is on German food. 
</P>
<P>
 Anneliese Kohlbrecher runs the show, from cooking to bringing the hot plate to 
your table as soon as it's done. She bakes the restaurant's flaky, buttery 
apple strudel and is never too busy to whip up a special remedy when a 
neighboring merchant doesn't feel well. 
</P>
<P>
 Anneliese got acquainted with the restaurant business early, starting in the 
kitchen of her parents' restaurant when she was 9. That was in 1939. Five years 
later Allied bombing runs destroyed most of the German village where they 
lived, including the restaurant (the family survived). Years later, Anneliese 
met her husband, Wilson Kohlbrecher, a famous German boxer and wrestler, and he 
brought her to America. 
</P>
<P>
 A good way to begin a meal here, and a good foil for such German brews as 
Dortmunder or Ritterbrau, is the assorted sausage plate ($5.75): thick slices 
of sauteed bratwurst and weisswurst ("white sausage"), made with veal, cream 
and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular main course is sauerbraten ($12.95), tender slices of a pot 
roast that has simmered for hours after being marinated in vinegar for two 
days. The beef is served with carrots, dumplings and a large mound of steamed 
red cabbage given a boost with cloves and apples. Like all entrees, it comes 
with salad or soup. A thick, smoked pork chop is accompanied by (surprise!) 
your choice of sausage. Anneliese's is no place for dieters, but the food is 
full of flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 For lunch, the potato pancakes ($5.25) and a sandwich piled high with Black 
Forest ham ($7.75) are big sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anneliese's Bavarian Inn is at 5730 E. 2nd St., Long Beach. (310) 439-4089. 
Open Monday, and Wednesday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 5 to 9 p.m., 
and Saturday and Sunday 4 to 10 p.m.

THE WORLD IS NO CAMELOT AS SEEN THROUGH THIS METAPHORIC 'MERLIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Merlin has arrived in Long Beach, but he's not in Camelot anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the magician-master of King Arthur's court, and you are likely to 
conjure up images of a kindly old man in a long gown, casting a glance over the 
kingdom as the subjects sing a Rodgers and Hammerstein tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, you might think of the more violent and mystical world of John Boorman's 
film "Excalibur." 
</P>
<P>
 You might even think -- if you had the unlucky chance to catch it before its 
quick Broadway demise -- of "Merlin," the Doug Henning version. 
</P>
<P>
 Wipe all of those images away, urges Ronald Allan-Lindblom, director of the 
"Merlin" that arrived last week at Cal State Long Beach's Studio Theatre, care 
of California Repertory Company. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no conventional visit to the Round Table, but German playwright 
Tankred Dorst's massive treatment of the Arthurian legend as a metaphor for 
world history. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an epic concept at an epic length of seven hours divided into two parts. 
They can be viewed on successive evenings or together in a marathon Saturday 
afternoon-and-evening performance. By any measure, "Merlin" is the most 
ambitious production by the campus's resident professional company in its 
four-year life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorst, who is 68 and still a dominant playwright in German theater, took the 
basic tale, as told by Sir Thomas Malory in "Le Morte D'Arthur," and expanded 
it into a sprawling vision embracing a kaleidoscope of styles from cabaret to 
theater of the absurd to the operatic. 
</P>
<P>
 His version, with his frequent collaborator Ursula Ehler, ran 9 1/2 hours in 
its 1981 premiere at the Dusseldorf Schauspielhaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent Dorst versions ran longer or shorter, but in whatever form, the 
epic gained a legendary status even in a national theater scene accustomed to 
the grand gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was visiting Germany in 1988," says Cal Rep artistic director Howard 
Burman, "I would ask what the most interesting play was. Other titles were 
mentioned, but the one people always came back to was 'Merlin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although this marks "Merlin's" American premiere in full production, it first 
crossed the ocean in a 1990 workshop production by director Pavel Cerny at 
Hollywood's First Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The First Stage workshop was when Howard and I first heard the play," 
Allan-Lindblom recalled, "and we found it to be remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Rep has assembled its staging "from the ground up," said Allan-Lindblom, a 
graduate of Boston University and of the first class of the Pacific 
Conservatory of the Arts in Santa Maria-Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
 Working from a 229-page script supplied by Dorst's German publisher, 
Allan-Lindblom said: "Such a text, with 265 roles and 97 scenes done in 
completely different styles, can be, well, very intimidating. But I know this 
group -- our pros like Greg Mortensen and Richard Gang and Ashley Carr -- and 
can gauge their emotions. And right now, after nine weeks of rehearsal, the 
cast is on a real high." 
</P>
<P>
 But how to contend with a story that envisions, among other things, Merlin 
fathered by the Devil himself, a pair of dragons bursting from below onto the 
stage, and crowd scenes calling for hundreds? "By metaphor," Allan-Lindblom 
stated calmly. "Everybody keeps saying that this is an impossible script. Nah, 
it's not impossible. Remember, we're doing this on a budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan-Lindblom, though, is well acquainted with the theater of spectacle both 
as an actor and collaborator with Josef Svoboda, founder of the revered Czech 
theater, Laterna Magika. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is my hero," said Allan-Lindblom, "and I would say that our 'Merlin' is 
Svoboda-inspired to the extent that he's devoted to metaphors, and not any sort 
of realism, on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you need a real grounding to either direct or sit through a seven-hour 
play," he added. "For me, it's the theme of idealism: how it grows and how it 
collapses. That was a theme in 'Camelot,' too, but with Dorst, it's much, much 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to make this sound impossibly difficult," Allan-Lindblom said. 
</P>
<P>

 If you already miss high school basketball, you can still see some of the top 
underclassmen in the Southland compete every weekend through late May in the 
Slam N' Jam Development League. 
</P>
<P>
 The league plays its games at Compton Community College and Dominguez High 
every Saturday and Sunday beginning at 9 a.m. Some of the participating area 
players include James Brown from Long Beach Poly, Brian Johnson from St. John 
Bosco and Chris Funderburk and Jonathon Nelson from Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The games draw large crowds, including some familiar faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get roughly over 200 different scouts or coaches every weekend," said 
Kenneth Miller, the league's director of publicity, who listed Lorenzo Romar, 
George Raveling, Rollie Massimino and Seth Greenberg as recent coaches to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that more than 500 players have received scholarships in the 
league's 15-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to offering basketball, the league helps prepare players for the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a tutorial program that is called 'Athletes for Academic Success,' " 
Miller said. "It provides free tutors to help kids in the league who are 
studying for the college entrance exam." SIGNINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Dayron Harris, a two-time All-City player at Washington High, signed a letter 
of intent to play basketball at Long Beach State in the fall. Harris, a 
6-foot-6, 235-pound center, averaged 23 points and 10 rebounds a game as a 
senior. Tawana Grimes, a Southern Section Division I basketball selection from 
Lynwood High, has signed with UCLA. The 5-foot-10 forward-guard averaged 20 
points and 12 rebounds a game and helped lead the Knights to a 32-2 record and 
their second consecutive Southern Section and Southern California Regional 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Martin, a 5-foot-6 volleyball player from La Mirada, signed with Concordia 
College. Mayfair right-hander Dan Harkey has been offered a scholarship to Long 
Beach State. His coach, Barry Liebert, said Harkey will probably sign with the 
49ers, but is also looking at USC and Arizona State. The Long Beach State 
women's basketball team signed Sarah Davis, a 5-foot-6 point guard from Tustin 
High. Cerritos' 5-9 point guard Ryan Brass signed with San Francisco. Brass' 
348 career assists is a school record. Kate Larrabbe, a 6-3 center from 
Cerritos, signed with Michigan State. Larrabbe set five school records, 
including most points in a game (35), most points in a season (660), most 
rebounds in a season (317), most career rebounds (571) and highest 
single-season field goal percentage (.590). RESIGNING 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Tereschuk resigned last week after six seasons as Mayfair boys' basketball 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to go back to school and get a degree and look for a job in Oregon 
teaching and possibly coaching," Mayfair Athletic Director Merlin Driggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tereschuk led the Monsoons to the CIF quarterfinals in 1992. This season was 
highlighted by a victory over Artesia, the defending State Division II 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals interested in applying for the job can call Driggs at (310) 
925-9981. LIGHTNING 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Poly girls' track team dominated the Mt. San Antonio College 
Relays on Saturday in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing out was the school's 800-meter relay team, which raced to the 
third-fastest time in national prep history in 1 minute 36.77 seconds. The 
national record is 1:36:46. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing Morningside substantially after the first leg, the Jackrabbits didn't 
take the lead until Andrea Anderson powered ahead on the anchor leg. Other 
members of the 800-meter squad include Rashida Green, Aminah Haddad and Pam 
Simpson. All will return next season. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Anderson won the 100 meters in 11.86 seconds, and Haddad won 
the 200 meters in 24.11. In sprint relays, the Poly girls won the 400 (46.61) 
and 1,600 (3:49.67). 
</P>
<P>
 The Poly boys won the 400 in 42.22. Poly freshman Kenyon Rambo finished second 
in the 300 hurdles in 38.09 seconds, a tenth of a second off the national 
freshman record. LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 It looked so promising after the eighth-ranked Long Beach State baseball team 
won two of three games from then-No. 1 Cal State Fullerton on April 8-10 at 
Blair Field. But since then, the 49ers' Big West Conference title hopes 
drastically diminished after they lost three of four games, including two of 
three last weekend at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cal State Fullerton's three-game sweep of Nevada Las Vegas last weekend, 
the 49ers (27-11, 7-5 in the Big West) moved two games behind the Titans (31-8, 
9-3). Tuesday night's 5-1 nonconference victory against Pepperdine began an 
eight-game home stand, including a three-game Big West series against UC Santa 
Barbara Friday and Saturday nights at 7:05 and Sunday at 1:05. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 49ers' 3-1 loss Friday to San Jose State, Spartan right-handed pitcher 
Dave Sick (7-0) scattered four hits and struck out eight. The 49ers broke loose 
Saturday for 17 hits in a 12-4 victory. Sophomore right-hander Scott Rivette 
(8-1) gave up six hits and three earned runs in eight innings. In Sunday's 
game, the 49ers lost, 3-2, in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the road, the 49er softball team (23-19, 8-8 in the Big West) swept Arizona 
State, 7-5 and 3-0, in a Friday doubleheader. Stacy Van Essen (8-9) won the 
first game despite giving up 10 hits. Christy Tucker (6-2) scattered four hits 
in 4 1/3 innings to win the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers lost at Arizona, 7-0 and 9-1. Arizona is ranked No. 1 in the 
country. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos baseball team is 24-8 and in a first-place tie with Harbor in the 
South Coast Conference with a 13-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Falcons edged host Mt. San Antonio, 12-9, in 10 innings, won a 
home game over Long Beach City College, 12-7, and then won at Long Beach, 9-3. 
During the week the team batted .389. Cerritos leads the conference in team 
earned-run average at 3.03. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's tennis team (8-4, 8-1 in the South Coast) is tied for the league 
lead with Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach women's tennis team clinched a tie for first place in the South 
Coast Conference by defeating Mt. San Antonio, 8-1. In a 5-4 loss at Cerritos, 
the Vikings' No. 1 singles player, Yvette Ralph, was upset by Denise Wilson, 
7-5, 6-2. It was Ralph's first loss in conference play in 10 matches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach softball team improved to 33-5 and 9-1 in South Coast 
Conference play with a 3-0 victory at Mt. San Antonio and a 5-1 victory at El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Mt. SAC, the Vikings' Susan Lamb, Chris Benyak and Wendie Aguayo hit 
home runs. Freshman Lisa Balbirnie (20-1) pitched a three-hitter and lowered 
her ERA to 0.25. MISCELLANY 
</P>
<P>
 The La Mirada Community Services Department is having a track and field meet 
Saturday at La Mirada High. Check-in begins at 5:30 p.m. and the event starts 
at 6. The meet is for boys and girls born between 1979 and 1986. The top four 
finishers in each age division will advance to the Southeast Municipal Athletic 
Assn. Championships May 14. The entry fee is $3. Information: (310) 943-7277.

HARBOR: DEVELOPMENT OF ALAMEDA CORRIDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our goal, and that of the Port of Los Angeles, has always been and continues 
to be the development of the Alameda Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost three years of negotiations, we recently finalized our agreement 
to purchase Southern Pacific's right of way between the ports and Downtown Los 
Angeles in order to consolidate the traffic from all three railroads onto this 
one rail corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated development cost of $1.8 billion, the ports have committed 
to contribute $200 million each and issue bonds for another $600 million to be 
repaid through fees assessed on the cargo moving over the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Except possibly some railroad people, I know of no person who does not feel 
the economic and environmental benefits of this project would be immense. Along 
the three existing rail lines serving the ports, there are currently 159 
intersections where trains over a mile long block traffic. With the Alameda 
Corridor, there would be none. Thousands of trucks would be removed from the 
highways with many more containers being shifted to double-stack trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both Southern Pacific and Santa Fe have agreed to utilize the Alameda 
Corridor and pay the fees necessary to repay one-third of its cost, Union 
Pacific claims that such fees would put them out of the market. As our Port 
feels we cannot move forward without a use agreement from all three railroads, 
we feel we are at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific's offer to break this impasse is that the ports pay them a 
substantial sum of money to offset fees that either they and/or their customers 
would be expected to pay. Also, we recently learned that they were looking into 
plans to double-track their line, which runs through our city and into Los 
Angeles. Our port views this as being totally contrary to the Alameda Corridor 
concept, and we will join forces with our city to do whatever is required to 
prevent this expansion. While it is true that both ports have provided some 
funding for mitigation along UP's line, they were always aware that these 
measures were considered interim only. Union Pacific had indeed committed to 
fully utilize the Alameda Corridor when completed, and we sincerely hope they 
will see the necessity of honoring these prior commitments.

CATCHING KILLERS USED TO BE EASIER. THIRTY YEARS AGO, MORE THAN 90% OF HOMICIDE 
CASES WERE SOLVED. BUT THAT WAS BEFORE DRUGS AND GUNS FLOODED THE STREETS AND 
BEFORE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE SLAIN BY STRANGERS. TIGHT POLICE BUDGETS AND FEARFUL 
WITNESSES MAKE A TOUGH JOB EVEN TOUGHER, LEAVING MANY VICTIMS' FAMILIES . . . ; 
LONGING FOR JUSTICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly five years have passed, and Joy Turner is still waiting to see her 
son's killer behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of May 2, 1989, Henry Harrison II, 19, was gunned down as he 
stood outside a house in Compton, an innocent victim felled less than a mile 
from his family's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators identified two suspects -- both gang members -- but the 
key witness refused to testify after he was beaten up. To this day, Turner 
lives in a pained limbo, furious with police for failing to catch the killer 
and for filing the case away. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's case underscores a growing trend: Police are cracking fewer murder 
cases than ever. Three decades ago, authorities throughout the U.S. solved more 
than 92% of homicides. Today, the rate has dropped to 65%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southeast area, the situation is worse: Just 46% of homicides were 
cleared with an arrest in 1992, the latest year for which figures are 
available, according to statistics from the State Department of Justice. Police 
cleared 76% of their cases in 1971, the earliest year with complete statistics 
for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the increase in unsolved cases is due largely to the changing 
nature of murder. In the past, detectives spent their time investigating 
"smoking gun" murders, in which victim and assailant knew one another and the 
killer often left ample evidence, such as weapons and fingerprints, at the 
crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more people are being killed in drive-by shootings, drug deals and 
carjackings. Arguments between strangers, which years ago would have been 
settled with words or fists, also are more likely to end in gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 At crime scenes, investigators are left with few clues beyond a body and a 
handful of bullet casings. Even when there are witnesses, they are often too 
afraid to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide units, meanwhile, can't keep up with the increasing number of new 
cases crossing their desks. Investigators are forced to prioritize murders, 
pursuing those with solid leads, setting aside others that offer little promise 
of an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murders are like puzzles," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Sgt. 
Stanley White, who has hit dead-ends on a number of murders in the Southeast 
area in recent years. "When we can't solve the puzzle, we can't get to the 
district attorney. No arrests, no convictions, nothing is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say many random killings result from escalating gang violence, 
with rival sets retaliating in an unending string of drive-by shootings that 
often occur at night when no one is around. In Long Beach, a bloody turf war 
between Asian and Latino gangs accounted for about half of the record 137 
murders last year, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, innocent victims have been caught in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 On a warm evening last August, Choi Binh Trinh, 30, was gunned down as he 
chatted with friends on the front porch of an apartment building on East 20th 
Street, a block from Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
 According to eyewitness accounts, two Latino men approached the group of 
Asians, called out the name of a gang and opened fire, killing Trinh and a 
second man, Noub Anthony Hov, said Long Beach Detective Dennis Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Hov, 23, apparently was involved in gangs but Trinh was not. Trinh 
lived with his wife and 1 1/2-year-old son in an apartment next to the building 
where he was shot. He left his native Vietnam for the United States more than a 
decade ago to avoid serving in the army. Fluent in Vietnamese, Khmer and 
English, Trinh was self-employed, helping other immigrants get disability and 
unemployment benefits, said his brother, Con Trinh. "He told me he was going to 
buy a house just a couple days before he was killed," Con Trinh said. "He was 
too young to die." 
</P>
<P>
 More than seven months after the shooting, police have few leads: They know 
only that the suspects drove off in a blue car that resembled a late 1970s 
Pontiac Ventura without hubcaps. Detectives say they are willing to continue 
their investigation, but have nothing to go on. They believe that witnesses 
know more, but are afraid to talk or don't care enough to get involved. Trinh's 
wife has since moved from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To Robbins, the obstacles in the Trinh case are all too familiar. Robbins and 
his partner have yet to solve four other Asian-Latino gang killings that 
occurred in the past eight months within a mile of the Trinh shooting. In those 
cases, witnesses offered vague descriptions of suspects but few hard leads, 
such as the name of the shooter or a license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
 White of the Sheriff's Department also knows how easily an investigation can 
be stumped. White has failed to solve a double homicide in Hawaiian Gardens, 
although a witness told him what happened and police recovered two 
semiautomatic handguns used in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the witness told him that two victims -- Jose Trinidad Meza, 27, 
and Jesus Martinez, 37 -- were shot several times during a drug deal last 
August in Meza's apartment in the 21800 block of Belshire Avenue. Five suspects 
escaped with 4 1/2 pounds of cocaine -- worth about $30,000, White said. Both 
victims were illegal immigrants and drug dealers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meza's wife, who was away from the apartment at the time of the shooting, 
refused to talk and has since fled, White said. Meza's nephew, a college 
student visiting from Mexico, survived the shootout inside the apartment and 
told investigators what happened. But he has since returned to Mexico and 
authorities have lost contact. White also has been unable to trace the handguns 
to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's talking, no one's cooperating," a frustrated White said. "I have a 
series of these cases. The fact is, they (witnesses and family members) refuse 
to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 White said that cases which involve illegal immigrants rarely are solved. 
Often, detectives have trouble tracking down the true names of victims and 
assailants who have no legal identification. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Language also creates barriers between investigators and witnesses who speak 
languages other than English. And undocumented immigrants are reluctant to 
speak up for fear of deportation, veteran detectives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses are reluctant to get involved, particularly those in gang-plagued 
neighborhoods who may face retaliation. Some have been known to recant their 
initial statements after being threatened, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell us, 'I can't testify. I've got kids. They'll shoot up my home,' " 
said Sgt. John Swanson, who investigated the five-year-old Henry Harrison 
murder in Compton. "If you put yourself in their place, you can understand. If 
I didn't know the guy who got killed, why would I risk my life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Police attempt to relocate witnesses whose lives may be in jeopardy. But 
funding from the state is limited. The county spent about $1,550 per case in 
1992 to relocate witnesses -- barely enough to cover first and last month's 
rent in many cases.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the money to do anything more extensive," said Sandi Gibbons, 
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, which administers state witness 
protection funds. "Sometimes, we'll put food on their table if they don't have 
any money. But then they're on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even when there are witnesses, cash-strapped police departments often lack the 
resources to fully investigate cases. Funding in many departments has been 
diverted from investigative units to substations and patrols as city officials 
respond to public demands for community policing, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, the number of homicides has more than doubled in the last 
decade, but the number of homicide investigators has gone from seven to 10. 
Meanwhile, the police department has opened six storefront community police 
centers in the last 18 months.  
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's homicide bureau, which serves 13 Southeast cities, also has 
shrunk. In 1982, the bureau's 93 investigators handled 320 murders throughout 
Los Angeles County. A decade later, 78 investigators handled 565 killings. 
Sheriff's investigators are dispatched from a central office in Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Overworked and frustrated, detectives must tackle numerous murders at once. 
Promising cases receive attention while others go untouched for months or 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good investigator has to play God with his cases," White said. "He only has 
so many hours in a day. Every new case he gets takes away from another." 
</P>
<P>
 As time passes and new cases pile up, old ones are set aside, police concede. 
Swanson, the Compton investigator who originally handled the Henry Harrison 
murder, has since been promoted to a supervisor's job in the patrol division. 
The detective now assigned to the case referred inquiries to Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of homicides that have leads, but we are so far behind we 
don't have time to follow (up)," said Lt. Joe Flores, who supervises Compton's 
homicide division. "I would like to have five more investigators down here, but 
then you'd have to shut down the helicopter unit and get rid of a few 
motorcycle units." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many investigators say their workloads create tremendous stress, and some have 
been known to leave their jobs temporarily. Sheriff's Sgt. Jacque Franco has 
seen her blood pressure rise in the nine years she has been working the 
Homicide Bureau. She tries to relax by spending time with family and friends 
outside of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide can consume your life," Franco said. "You have to pull back and try 
not to let it bother you so much if you can't solve a case or get anybody to 
cooperate. You have to accept that you're not going to solve all the cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' families aren't interested in hearing about budget problems or high 
blood pressure. They want to see killers behind bars. Some families accuse 
police of ignoring cases in poor and minority communities, focusing instead on 
sensational incidents that make headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Turner and others say they resent the international attention on the 
recent carjack slayings of two Japanese exchange students in San Pedro, while 
similar cases elsewhere go unnoticed. In the San Pedro case, Los Angeles police 
mounted an all-out investigation that ended with charges being filed against 
two suspects within a week of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have this sense of frustration and rage," said Turner, who described her 
son as a churchgoing youth and Compton High School graduate who planned to 
enlist in the Navy to escape the violence around him. 
</P>
<P>
 She has turned her living room into a makeshift shrine, with family photos 
scattered throughout. The display is dominated by an enlarged prom photo of her 
son. Turner is all the more indignant because her son's father was a Compton 
police officer at the time of the shooting. Turner said she called the 
department every week for two years to inquire about the status of the 
investigation, but stopped when police continually said they had nothing new to 
report. "I feel like nobody's interested," she said. "They (Compton detectives) 
have no sensitivity to the victim's family. They're apathetic."  
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who oversees Compton's homicide division, said he sympathizes with 
Turner, but said investigators have done all they can to solve the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Swanson, the Harrison case has been particularly unsettling. He is a 
friend of Harrison's father, who now lives in Las Vegas. Although Swanson 
believes he knows who committed the crime, he hasn't been able to close the 
case. Two suspects were arrested soon after the May, 1989, shooting, but were 
released after witnesses refused to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I failed my friend," Swanson said. "But there's nothing more I 
can do. This case would have been solved if we had witnesses coming forward. 
They told me what went down but they didn't want to (testify)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he no longer works in the homicide division, Swanson keeps a file on 
the case and hopes that new leads will surface. But he doubts the case will be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with police, relatives of several murder victims in the Southeast 
area have launched their own informal investigations. They comb neighborhoods, 
talking with youths, copying gang graffiti from walls, taking pictures of crime 
scenes -- anything that might help open new leads. While police do not 
encourage the homespun investigations, they often rely on the tips that family 
members provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Few have gone as far as Teresa Wheel, whose 19-year-old son, Kevin, was gunned 
down in an apparently random drive-by attack in Hawaiian Gardens nearly three 
years ago. Sheriff's investigators, having exhausted their leads, are no longer 
searching for the killers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wheel continues to investigate. She has interviewed gang members in Hawaiian 
Gardens and stapled more than 1,000 reward posters on telephone poles. She will 
appear on a segment of the television series "Unsolved Mysteries" next month in 
hopes the airing will help shake loose new leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Franco said that Wheel, who has supplied the names of witnesses 
and three possible suspects in the shooting, has provided key information. But 
without witnesses who are willing testify in court, the case cannot move 
forward, Franco said.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wheel won't give up. Her family is offering a $10,000 reward for 
information leading to the conviction of the killers, who are believed to be 
Artesia gang members. Several times a year, Wheel goes to the intersection of 
183rd Street and Pioneer Boulevard, a few blocks from where she believes the 
killers live, and stands for several hours with a cardboard sign that reads 
"Please help me find Kevin's murderers." 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent afternoon, a young man in his early 20s approached Wheel and, 
anonymously, told her the name of the driver involved in the shooting and the 
make of the vehicle. The information, which Wheel passed along to Franco, 
confirmed anonymous tips investigators had received in the past. "I don't know 
what else I can do to help this along," Wheel said. "Hopefully, someone will 
come up and tell me they'll testify. I'll tell you one thing, the people in 
Hawaiian Gardens and Artesia won't forget about Kevin." The National Trend

1994 PREP BASKETBALL ALL-STARS; GIRLS' ALL-STARS; LYNWOOD, VALLEY CHRISTIAN 
PLAYERS DOMINATE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The girls' basketball teams at Lynwood and Valley Christian high schools have 
been dominant forces in their respective Southern Section divisions the past 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Christian has won three consecutive Division IV-A titles; Lynwood is 
the two-time defending I-AA champion after finishing second in the 1991-92 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools also dominate The Times' 1994 Southeast All-Star Team. Lynwood had 
three players selected and Valley Christian two. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood, which saw its bid for back-to-back state titles end in a 59-53 loss 
to Atherton Sacred Heart in the Division I final, has placed forward Timicha 
Kirby and guards Tawana Grimes and LaKhesha Johnson on the team. Valley 
Christian, which lost in the state Division IV regional, is represented by 
forward Aisha Veasley and center Jodi Parriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Veasley and Kirby are repeat selections from the 1993 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches and a poll of Times 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The Times 
at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Sheraton Long Beach, 333 E. 
Ocean Blvd. The area player and coach of the year will be announced at the 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Camacho (Pioneer) -- Although she is the youngest member of the squad, 
Camacho displayed the poise of a veteran. A 6-foot sophomore center, Camacho 
was a dominant force around the basket. She averaged 15.8 points and ranked 
third in the state in rebounding at 16.5. Camacho, who was named Del Rio League 
most valuable player, had 20 or more rebounds in seven games and double-doubles 
in 19 of 24 games as Pioneer finished 18-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Carll (La Mirada) -- Another powerful inside player was Carll, the 
tallest of the all-stars at 6-3. The center averaged 16.3 points, 12.8 rebounds 
and 2.5 blocks to lead the Matadores to the Suburban League title. She was 
named the league's most valuable player. Carll has been recruited by NCAA 
Division I schools Oregon, Oregon State and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Carreon (El Rancho) -- Although Carreon is only 5-8, she managed to 
make her presence felt around the basket. She averaged 16.2 points and 11.3 
rebounds and was selected to the Del Rio League first team. Carreon, a forward, 
also excels in volleyball and softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Tawana Grimes (Lynwood) -- In a well-balanced offense, the 5-9 Grimes was 
Lynwood's top outside scoring threat. She averaged 16 points, three rebounds 
and three assists to help the Knights return to the State Division I final. A 
preseason honorable mention All-America selection by Street and Smith magazine, 
she was named to the Division I and San Gabriel Valley League teams. She has 
signed with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 LaKhesha Johnson (Lynwood) -- Johnson earned the respect of opponents with her 
quickness and leadership. The 5-7 guard averaged 10 points, eight steals and 
seven assists and sparked the Knights on defense. A San Gabriel Valley League 
selection, she has been recruited by Long Beach State, Cal State Northridge, 
Houston and Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Timicha Kirby (Lynwood) -- The most heralded of the Big Three for Lynwood, the 
5-11 Kirby demonstrated her versatility by averaging a team-leading 22 points, 
12 rebounds, four assists and three blocked shots. She was named Southern 
Section Division I player of the year, state Division I player of the year by 
Cal-Hi Sports and a prep All-America by Street and Smith and USA Today. She 
will attend Iowa in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Jodi Parriott (Valley Christian) -- Perhaps the most imposing center in the 
Southeast area was the 6-2 Parriott. Her strong play around the basket helped 
her average 22.9 points, 12 rebounds and six blocked shots. An Olympic League 
choice in basketball and volleyball, she also made the Division IV team chosen 
by Cal-Hi and has been recruited by UCLA, USC and Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Ridge (St. Paul) -- The top three-point shooter on the squad might be 
Ridge, who used her exceptional touch to lead the Southeast in scoring with a 
24.3-point average. The 5-8 guard also averaged 5.6 rebounds and 2.5 assists. 
Ridge was named Del Rey League player of the year and made the Division IV 
first team. She has been recruited by Azusa Pacific, Redlands and Concordia 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey Sollie (La Serna) -- The catchword has been consistency for Sollie, a 
5-9 forward. She has ranked among her team's scoring leaders three seasons in a 
row and made all-league each season. As a senior, she averaged 14.8 points, 
11.2 rebounds and 2.4 assists and filled in when the team's point guard was 
injured late in the season. She is considering attending Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Aisha Veasley (Valley Christian) -- The 5-10 forward averaged 16.6 points, 
seven rebounds and 3.5 assists. She also ranked among the state leaders in 
field-goal percentage and Coach Eleanor Dykstra said Veasley was Valley 
Christian's best defensive player. A three-time Southern Section selection and 
Olympic League most valuable player, she will attend UCLA. GIRLS' ALL-STAR TEAM

1994 PREP BASKETBALL ALL-STARS; BOYS' ALL-STARS; DOMINGUEZ, POLY FLEX MIGHT 
WITH THREE SELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominguez and Long Beach Poly, two high school basketball programs that always 
seem to rank among the best in the area, were in familiar positions last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly won the Southern Section Division I-AA title with a 71-60 win over 
Crescenta Valley and Dominguez, ranked No. 1 in Division II-A most of the 
season, settled for second place after a heartbreaking 55-54 loss to St. John 
Bosco in the championship game at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the schools is reflected in The Times' 1994 South Coast 
All-Star Team. Dominguez and Poly each have three players on the 10-member 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly placed forwards Zerrick Campbell and James Brown and guard Damion Dawson 
on the team. Dominguez was represented by guard Jamie Gillin and forwards 
Thomas Prince and Daryl Todd. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillin, who led Dominguez to back-to-back berths in Southern Section finals, 
and Campbell are the only repeat selections from the 1993 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches and a poll of Times 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The Times 
at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Sheraton Long Beach, 333 E. 
Ocean Blvd. The area player and coach of the year will be announced at the 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Batiste (Long Beach Wilson) -- Opponents can consider the play of the 
6-foot-7 forward as a warning: Batiste is expected to be one of the premier 
front-line players in Southern California next season. He offered a preview by 
averaging 17.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists as a junior. He made the 
Southern Section Division I and Cal-Hi Sports News All-State Underclass team 
and is already being recruited by NCAA Division I schools such as Duke, Kansas 
and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 James Brown (Long Beach Poly) -- One big reason why the Jackrabbits should be 
successful again next season is the return of the 6-6 Brown. He played a 
pivotal role in Poly's title run, averaging 16.8 points, six rebounds and three 
assists. He shared Moore League most valuable player honors with teammate 
Campbell and was named to the Division I first team. He also made the All-State 
Underclass team and is being recruited by Division I schools such as 
California, Stanford, USC and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Zerrick Campbell (Long Beach Poly) -- He is not the most boisterous player on 
the court, but the 6-6 Campbell has excelled with his workmanlike approach. He 
is especially strong around the basket and averaged 15.2 points and 12.3 
rebounds. In addition to being Moore League co-MVP, he was named to the 
all-state team by Cal-Hi Sports and the Southern Section Division I team. He 
has signed with the University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Dawson (Long Beach Poly) -- Last but not least in a talented trio for 
Poly is Dawson, a 6-3 guard who helped the Jackrabbits in their title run with 
his outside shooting. He averaged 12.2 points, 6.2 rebounds and four assists 
and was named to the Moore League team. Only a junior, he is regarded as a top 
prospect and his early recruiting list includes Boston College, Wake Forest and 
Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquis Flemons (Compton) -- Among the top outside shooters on the team is 
Flemons, a 6-3 guard. He averaged 20 points to lead the Tarbabes to the second 
round of the Division II-AA playoffs. Flemons was a Moore League selection and 
a Division II second-team pick. He expects to play at a community college next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Gillin (Dominguez) -- One of the most touted seniors on the squad is 
also an exceptional outside shooter. A 6-4 guard, Gillin averaged 20 points, 
five rebounds and three assists for the Dons. Also regarded as a solid 
defender, Gillin was an all-state selection by Cal-Hi Sports and made the 
Division II first team. He signed a national letter of intent with Tulsa after 
also considering Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Hankins (St. Anthony) -- When it comes to all-around athleticism, the 6-3 
Hankins fits the bill. He made the all-league first team in football as a 
defensive back and basketball as a forward. He averaged 21.5 points, ranking 
among the top scorers on the South Coast team, along with 12 rebounds and four 
assists. Hankins is undecided about what college he will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kohlhaas (Lakewood) -- The leading scorer on the team was Kohlhaas, a 6-6 
forward who averaged 22.3 points. But Kohlhaas didn't earn recognition only for 
his offensive skills. He demonstrated his all-around ability by averaging 10.2 
rebounds and 4.5 assists. A Moore League first-team selection, Kohlhaas is 
undecided about his college plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Prince (Dominguez) -- In an excellent season for underclassmen in the 
South Coast, the 6-5 Prince also ranks among the best. He is regarded as one of 
the top juniors in the state, having been named to the All-State Underclass 
team by Cal-Hi Sports and the Division II first team. Last season, he averaged 
18 points, nine rebounds and four assists. Prince has already been recruited by 
UCLA and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Todd (Dominguez) -- The 6-4 Todd, a forward, was the team's 
third-leading scorer with a 15-point average and also averaged eight rebounds 
and five assists. A San Gabriel Valley League selection, he is undecided about 
his college plans. BOYS' ALL-STAR TEAM

<P>
 It will not be remembered as a championship season for girls' high school 
basketball teams in the South Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest any area teams came to a Southern Section title were Cerritos, 
which advanced to the Division I-A semifinals before losing to Mater Dei, and 
cross-town rival Gahr, which lost to Hemet in the Division II-AA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although area teams didn't shine, it was a good season for players. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Perry of Cerritos and Blanca Loza of Millikan were named to the 
all-state team by Cal-Hi Sports. The two also lead the selections to The Times' 
1994 South Coast All-Star Team. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second year in a row that Perry has made the team and the first for 
Loza. There are three other repeat selections from 1993: forward Shannon Gale 
of Gahr, center Amy Heaton of Lakewood and guard K.K. Johns of Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches and a poll of Times 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The Times 
at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Sheraton Long Beach, 333 E. 
Ocean Blvd. The area player and coach of the year will be announced at the 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Aburee Duggan (St. Anthony) -- The 6-foot center was one of the top rebounders 
in the area, averaging 12 a game, along with 17.5 points, three blocked shots 
and 2.1 assists. She helped lead the Saints to the Division IV-A quarterfinals. 
A first-team Del Rey League selection, she is also student body president at 
St. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherilyn Frazier (Cerritos) -- Cerritos benefited from the 5-7 guard's outside 
shooting, quickness and leadership. A San Gabriel Valley League selection, she 
averaged 12.8 points, 5.3 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 4.2 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Gale (Gahr) -- Gale, a 5-9 forward, has the lowest scoring average, 11 
points, of any player on The Times' team, but she provided steady leadership 
for the Gladiators. A three-time Division II selection, Gale also averaged 
seven rebounds. A versatile athlete, she also excels in track, cross-country, 
water polo and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Heaton (Lakewood) -- Among the area's most talented inside players is 
Heaton, a 6-1 center who will play at Long Beach State in the fall. She was a 
three-time Moore League selection. Heaton averaged 20.2 points, 14 rebounds, 
three blocked shots and was also among team leaders in steals. 
</P>
<P>
 K.K. Johns (Long Beach Poly) -- A junior, she has a reputation as one of the 
top underclassmen in the state. Johns has made the Moore League team three 
times, Division I team twice and Cal-Hi Sports All-Underclass team. The 5-6 
guard averaged 14.6 points, 5.2 assists and four rebounds and is being heavily 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Loza (Millikan) -- At the start of the season, the 5-11 Loza wasn't 
among the area's most highly regarded players, but her brilliant senior season 
changed a few minds. She averaged 18.7 points, 16 rebounds and three assists. 
Her play earned her Moore League most valuable player honors and berths on the 
Division I and all-state teams. She is undecided about her college plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Perry (Cerritos) -- The 6-foot Perry signed with national power Iowa 
in November, then averaged 20 points, 12.5 rebounds and 2.1 blocked shots for 
Cerritos. Perry was named to the San Gabriel Valley League team four seasons in 
a row and Division I team twice. She was also an all-state selection by Cal-Hi 
Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Suggs (Gahr) -- Suggs averaged 16 points, eight rebounds and two 
steals to help the Gladiators reach the Division II-AA semifinals. A two-time 
San Gabriel Valley League selection, she has been recruited by several schools, 
including Division I Idaho State and Cal State Northridge and Division II Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Reta Sula (Long Beach Jordan) -- The basketball program at Jordan appears to 
be on the rise and a big reason was the emergence Sula. The 5-6 freshman guard 
averaged 18 points, 5.5 rebounds, 4.2 steals, 3.4 assists and made 42% of her 
three-point shots. She also made the Moore League first team. 
</P>
<P>
 April Williams (Lakewood) -- The 5-6 point guard was the floor leader for the 
Lancers and averaged 18.6 points, seven steals and six assists. Williams has 
also made the Moore League team twice and was an All-Southern Section selection 
in 1993. She has been recruited by Long Beach State, Florida State, Oregon and 
Cal State Fullerton. GIRLS' ALL-STAR TEAM

 It was nothing short of a dream season for St. John Bosco boys' basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Braves won the Del Rey League title and advanced to the Southern 
Section Division II-A semifinals in the 1992-93 season, Bosco topped itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves not only repeated as league champion, they went on to win the 
Division II-A championship by defeating top-seeded Dominguez, 55-54, in the 
title game at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first basketball championship for the school, which opened in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosco is well represented on The Times' 1994 Southeast All-Star Team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves placed 6-foot-6 point guard Jelani Gardner, regarded as one of the 
nation's best senior players, and 6-0 guard Kevin Christian, on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, who signed with California on Friday after ruling out national 
champion Arkansas and UCLA, is one of two repeat selections to The Times' team. 
Warren's Erik Kennady, a 6-7 forward, is the other. He played at El Rancho two 
seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The only junior on the team is 6-7 forward Troy Collins of Pius X, considered 
among the top juniors in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches and a poll of Times 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The Times 
at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Sheraton Long Beach, 333 E. 
Ocean Blvd. The area player and coach of the year will be announced at the 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Austin (Lynwood) -- The shortest player on the team at 5-foot-9, Austin's 
future may be in football. He has signed a national letter of intent to attend 
Kansas and is expected to play defensive back. It would be difficult to 
convince his opponents that his basketball days are numbered. He was one of the 
top guards in the talent-rich San Gabriel Valley League, averaging 18.1 points, 
six assists and six steals. An all-league first team selection in basketball, 
he was also a Times' South Coast selection in football. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Chaney (Artesia) -- With the departure of Charles O'Bannon and Avondre 
Jones, a lot of people expected the talent pool to run dry at Artesia. But 
Chaney's presence on the all-star team is evidence to the contrary. A 
three-year starter, the 6-1 Chaney stepped forward last season and averaged 
18.3 points, 5.2 assists and was named Suburban League most valuable player. He 
has been recruited by NCAA Division I schools Long Beach State and Sacramento 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Christian (St. John Bosco) -- Christian played an integral role in the 
Braves' championship season. He was named to the Southern Section Division II 
second team by the Amateur Athletic Foundation board of sportswriters. The 6-0 
guard averaged 11.6 points, 4.3 assists and 3.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Collins (Pius X) -- When top juniors in the state are discussed, Collins 
is usually one of the first mentioned. He is already being recruited by 
national powers such as Purdue, Syracuse and California. The 6-7 forward 
averaged 18.3 points and ranked among state leaders in rebounding with an 
average of 16.5 and blocked shots with 4.1. He made the Del Rey League first 
team and Southern Section Division IV second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jelani Gardner (St. John Bosco) -- Gardner has been heavily touted since his 
freshman season at Bishop Amat. As a senior, his play exceeded expectations. An 
excellent outside shooter and floor leader, he averaged 26.7 points, 6.8 
rebounds and 7.1 assists to lead the Braves to the Division II-A title. Gardner 
has earned a slew of postseason honors, including state player of the year by 
Cal-Hi Sports News, and berths on the Parade magazine and USA Today All-America 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Gorini (La Mirada) -- The 6-1 Gorini, an excellent three-point shooting 
guard, averaged 18.7 points and 3.2 assists. Perhaps even more impressive was 
his average of 6.1 rebounds. That hasn't attracted many college recruiters, 
although he has earned All-Suburban League honors two seasons in a row and made 
three all-tournament teams as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Kennady (Warren) -- It doesn't seem to matter what school Kennady 
attends. With back-to-back selections to the Southeast team, he has proven to 
be one of the area's top players. After a standout junior season at El Rancho, 
he excelled for Warren last season with an average of 18 points and 12 
rebounds. Kennady, who led Warren to the Division I-A quarterfinals, earned 
All-San Gabriel Valley League and All-Division I honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Reynolds (St. Paul) -- Like Austin, the future for Reynolds appears to 
be in football. A preseason Times' Terrific 22 selection at linebacker for 
Tustin, Reynolds will play football at Arizona State in the fall. After 
transferring to St. Paul, Reynolds averaged 15 points and 12 rebounds to lead 
the Swordsmen to the Division IV-AA finals. He was named to the Division IV 
first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Shade (La Serna) -- On a team that did not have a starter taller than 
6-1, Shade played like a giant. He averaged 17 points, five rebounds and 3.1 
assists to pace the Lancers to an undefeated Del Rio League season. A two-time 
all-league selection, he was named Del Rio player of the year as a senior. Also 
an outstanding baseball player, he plans to attend Whittier College in the 
fall. BOYS' ALL-STAR TEAM
