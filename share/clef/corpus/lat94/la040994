JOHN VENTURELLO; WORLD'S OLDEST BOWLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Pappa" John Venturello, 105, world's oldest bowler. Recognized for his 
longevity by the American Bowling Congress, Venturello bowled for nine decades 
before his eyesight failed last year.When he reached his 100th birthday, he 
appeared on "The Tonight Show" and was profiled in People magazine. A shepherd 
from Salerno, Italy, Venturello immigrated to New York City with his family in 
1903. Appropriately, his first job in the United States was tending pins in a 
bowling alley. He bowled his only 300 game in 1907 but did not get serious 
about bowling until retiring to Florida in 1966. He maintained an average in 
the 140s, always bowling with young men and claiming he was too young to join 
senior leagues. On March 31 in Plantation, Fla.

blindness. Born in New York City, Wolfe earned degrees at Brandeis University

New York, Seattle and San Francisco. In the 1980s, he created dance for his own

recalled Beethoven's ability to compose when deaf. Each could work, he said, 
through extensive knowledge of the craft and the ability to imagine the work.

 And the Oscar for heavy-handed litigation goes to . . . The Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences! 
</P>
<P>
 We'll wait for the applause to subside. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the academy has sued North Hollywood candy maker Frank Sheftel for 
violating its copyright by selling pieces of chocolate that were "strikingly 
similar to the 'Oscar statuette.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought the Heidi Fleiss scandal was big. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheftel contends that he stopped making the edible awards after he was warned 
by the academy, but was sued anyway. He agreed to turn over his statuette molds 
but balked at paying the academy a royalty as well as legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also wanted a list of all my (chocolate Oscar) customers," Sheftel 
added.  
</P>
<P>
 And you thought Fleiss' customer book was controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the academy say that they are only protecting the image of Oscar 
and claim that Sheftel was "continuing to manufacture and sell" the chocolate 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the dispute arose after it was learned that Sheftel's Candy 
Factory had made 300 figurines for a party of Columbia and Tri-Star executives, 
many of whom no doubt are academy members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only that," Sheftel said, "but Columbia still owes me $225."

 Talk about full disclosure: Stephen Schertzer of Hawthorne was a bit taken 
aback by the personal information asked of candidates for the United Defense 
Federal Credit Union. "Should I go all the way in my biological sketch?" he 
asks. "You know -- kingdom, phylum, class, order, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Say it again, Sam?Virgil Levy of Downey sent in an addition to our list of 
malapropisms attributed to movie mogul Sam Goldwyn. The quotation involved an 
aspiring young actor who wanted to change his name to Rock. Goldwyn is supposed 
to have responded: "Every Tom, Dick and Harry in Hollywood is called Rock!"

 Bring me the head of Josie Bruin: Sad to report that the head of the UCLA 
mascot disappeared several weeks ago and still hasn't turned up.  
</P>

 The Daily Bruin, however, received a note that said, in part: "To whom it 
concerns . . . I've got Josie! If you ever want to see her again, you'll 
cooperate with me. I'll contact you soon with further information." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was nearly a month ago and no further contact has been made. The 
note, by the way, was signed "Troche," which hints of possible involvement by a 
Trojan of the USC variety.

 Nearly two years after the Los Angeles riots, local religious leaders are 
still hard at work healing the wounds and treating their underlying causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interfaith Coalition to Heal L.A. will hold its Religious Leaders Summit 
II on Friday, at which more than 400 clergy and lay leaders of all faiths are 
expected to gather at a Mormon church in Los Angeles to compare notes and hear 
the advice of experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the conference will be children's advocate Marian Wright Edelman, 
founder of the Children's Defense Fund, and cultural historian Kevin Starr, a 
professor in USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning. The summit's theme is 
'Future at Risk: Our Children, Our Families and Our Faith Communities.' 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 invitations to the summit were sent out by Harvey J. Fields, 
senior rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, who has headed the coalition since 
he founded it under the aegis of the Interreligious Council of Southern 
California when he served as that group's president. The current president is 
the Rev. Vivian Ben Lima, chairman of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese Commission 
on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields is proud of the coalition's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a task force very successfully working with private and public 
schools on teaching about stereotypes, prejudice, self-respect, and tolerance 
of religious and ethnic differences," he said. Interfaith covenant 
relationships between congregations, which is the province of another task 
force, have resulted in a joint voter-registration drive, painting, planting 
and refurbishing projects and many group dialogues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields is especially enthusiastic about task forces evaluating the ways that 
religious organizations can increase citywide volunteerism and examining the 
possibility of shared economic opportunity -- making jobs and some business 
loans available that might not be obtainable from a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the enormous flow of people to Southern California over the past 
25 years, we have greater diversity than nearly any other place in America," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our greatest challenge is to tear down the walls that this city has, 
unfortunately, built separating one community from another," he said. "And that 
requires cooperation and collaboration between the various religious 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The summit will be held from 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday at the Wilshire Ward 
of the Los Angeles Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
1209 S. Manhattan Place, Los Angeles. Advance registration is required. The

Loyola Marymount, Chapman University and UCLA. She wants to go to Loyola 
because its program best suits her intended major. Loyola told us that no 
scholarships are available to our daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I are elementary schoolteachers, and I work a second job. We live 
in a 25-year-old house in a mid-middle-class neighborhood. We have low home 
equity and our mortgage payment alone is 35% of our income. We have no 
significant discretionary income or savings. So, our daughter will likely end 
up going to a junior college. With her intelligence, talent and determination, 
she will probably stick to her career plans, but the road to that realization 
is not certain, given the economics of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities do deserve special opportunity because our society still practices 
hidden and overt racial discrimination. And junior colleges and state 
universities are excellent institutions. Yet, something is wrong when 
scholarship monies are not available to top scholars like my daughter. Our 
society and economy will pay a price for that, too.

TOKYO MUST STICK TO ITS PROMISES; FACING THE U.S. TRADE ISSUE IS NO LESS 
CRUCIAL NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden decision to resign should not be 
used by Tokyo as an excuse to back away from his promise to have a package of 
measures to open Japan's markets soon. But the unexpected political turmoil 
will understandably make it more difficult to deliver such a plan before July, 
when the Group of Seven leading industrial countries holds its annual summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to fulfill that promise -- with or without Hosokawa -- is more 
pressing than ever as the world, not just the United States, watches. Reformist 
Hosokawa unfortunately fell short in delivering bombshell changes during his 
eight months in office, but he did manage to set Japan on a course of change, 
politically and economically. A slide back to the status quo could further 
derail U.S.-Japan efforts to create a new framework for trade. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that Hosokawa could not get out from under the taint of the 
money scandals that brought down three of his predecessors. In his surprise 
announcement Friday, Hosokawa said he was leaving office to take responsibility 
for the controversy surrounding his personal finances, in particular 
accusations that many years ago he received an illicit $952,000 payment. The 
Liberal Democratic Party, which in last July's elections lost power after 38 
years, was demanding greater disclosure. Hosokawa admitted to no wrongdoing but 
he acknowledged that "legal problems" had been discovered recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The LDP, long criticized for its cozy relations with rich supporters and 
business, suddenly and conveniently became a champion of rooting out 
corruption. Interesting that Hosokawa's finances posed no problem to the LDP 
until after he secured passage of political reform, opened the rice market, 
pushed deregulation and earned praise in Japan for standing up to recent U.S. 
trade demands.  
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Hosokawa had much to do with internal Japanese politics. But 
should the political turmoil spill over into stalling Japanese trade 
initiatives, Japan's economic and global interests might suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata are 
scheduled to meet next week in the highest public contact since U.S.-Japan 
trade talks fell through in February. The meeting, if it is held, could take on 
more significance because Hata has been discussed as perhaps the leading 
candidate to succeed Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa has been an agent of change in a time of real, if unspectacular, 
political transition. Can Japan continue in that direction?

GOODWILL IN A TIME OF TENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If our community is ever to rise above the racial divisions that plague us, we 
are going to have to learn from our mistakes. If we cannot do that, the much 
feared Balkanization of Southern California so glibly predicted by one 
commentator or another could become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment we are nowhere near that point: People of goodwill continue 
to work hard to keep tensions down and promote understanding throughout this 
region of a hundred cultures and many languages. And that precisely is the 
picture now emerging from Lynwood, where last Saturday a shooting incident with 
special overtones took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred three blocks from a grocery after its owner chased down 
a 14-year-old boy who had fled the store allegedly without paying for a bag of 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 The store owner, Michael Kim, says that when the boy reached for what he 
thought was a weapon, he shot him. The grocer then carried the wounded youth to 
his car, drove him back to his market and telephoned paramedics. The boy 
appears to be recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the grocer is a Korean American and the victim is a Latino, 
comparisons were instantly drawn to the 1991 fatal shooting of a 15-year-old 
African American by a Korean grocer after, the grocer said, she thought the 
girl was trying to steal orange juice. A physical confrontation occurred in the 
store, and Latasha Harlins was killed, shot in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 That tragic incident blew up into a huge political row -- and added to 
tensions between the African American and Korean communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this new incident have a comparably corrosive effect? There have been 
irresponsible reactions; reputed gang members threatened Kim. But also there 
have been laudable efforts to keep tensions down and to avoid painting this 
story in racial colors. Kudos should go to Lynwood Councilman Armando Rea and 
Benjamin Miranda of the Concerned Citizens of Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 All that it takes for a community to keep control of its destiny and help 
different ethnic groups get along is hard work, communication and goodwill. But 
without that, every incident can be blown into a racial or ethnic one. Then the 
fighting would never end. It doesn't have to be that way, and some leaders in 
Lynwood appear to be proving that.

HEALTH WATCH; SMART MANEUVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Smoke if you've got 'em," said generations of sergeants to generations of 
GIs, and smoke they would, the cigarette break soon becoming for countless 
Americans in uniform an event of only slightly less importance than payday or a 
three-day pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass addiction seems to have begun with World War II, when millions who had 
never taken a puff prior to taking their induction oath almost overnight were 
transformed into confirmed smokers.It didn't just happen. The tobacco companies 
were quick to see the long-term market potential in the masses who were 
mobilized for the war effort. A lot of cigarettes were given away free on 
military posts and included in field ration packages. When the freebies ran 
out, smokes could be bought for next to nothing at the PX. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, blessedly, the old order is finally passing. Men and women in uniform 
and the civilians who work with them throughout the military may still light 
up, but not any place they might feel like it. A new ban prohibits smoking in 
all workplaces, stairwells, hallways and outside building entrances on U.S. 
military bases worldwide, although it's still allowed in designated areas in 
base clubs and in all living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the new rules reduce smoking in the military? Probably, to some extent, 
if only because of the inconvenience now involved in finding a place to fire 
up. Most immediately it will significantly cut exposure to secondhand smoke, a 
known killer. As in more and more civilian workplaces, so now in the military: 
Smoke if you've got 'em, but go somewhere else to do it.

RECYCLING TRITIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial (March 26) noting that the California Department of Health 
Services may have overestimated the amount of tritium to be buried at the 
proposed Ward Valley nuclear waste dump to conceal the amount of nuclear power 
plant waste going to the dump leads to a very simple conclusion -- the best way 
to deal with waste tritium is to recycle it, not bury it. 
</P>
<P>
 As The Times has noted in its articles and editorials, because waste tritium 
is an isotope of hydrogen, it bonds with oxygen and spreads, just like plain 
water, as radioactive water.In fact, tritium has leaked out of storage 
facilities in South Carolina and Washington. Tritium manufacturing is where a 
vast majority of the waste is produced, and recapturing and recycling that 
waste is both feasible and economical. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed AB 3798 (Katz), which required California 
tritium manufacturers to recapture and recycle 95% of the waste tritium 
generated in the manufacturing process. Last year, Wilson vetoed AB 1786 
(Bowen), a scaled-down version of the Katz bill, despite evidence that 
recycling waste tritium makes both economic and environmental sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing tritium from the waste stream wouldn't have affected plans to build 
the Ward Valley dump. However, it would have focused the debate on the real 
issue -- whether nuclear power plant waste should be buried at the site.

NAVY DOWNSIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article ("Budget Cut Blues Hit the Ranks," March 22) about the drawdown 
in the armed services requires some factual updating and perspective. Your 
readers need to know that while we face an enormous challenge, undertaking the 
largest reduction in the history of the all-volunteer force, the Navy is 
keeping faith with its officers and sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 From my perspective, as chief of naval personnel, we have worked to make human 
reductions in a humane way, without negatively affecting the Navy's combat 
readiness capabilities. People have always been at the forefront of every 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 A few points your readers should know about the Navy's drawdown strategy: 
</P>
<P>
 * In November, 1993, we were halfway to our 1999 goal of less than 400,000 
officers and sailors. In fact, since 1989, when the drawdown began, we have 
reduced the active-duty force by more than 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 * But even with these large reductions, we have not forced one career force, 
non-retirement-eligible person out of the Navy. Incentive programs have been 
used to reduce our mid-career force personnel while ensuring we kept people 
with the right talents to man the current Navy and that of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your article discusses ships being decommissioned. That's correct: 115 
ships, submarines and aircraft squadrons will be decommissioned or 
disestablished this year alone, directly affecting lives of about 36,000 
officers and sailors. But thanks to advance planning by the Navy, all of these 
men and women are being individually assisted in the selection of their next 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year was our slowest year for promotions and advancements during the 
drawdown, but even then over 80,000 people were promoted or advanced (almost 
one out of every six in the Navy) and all advancement rates for sailors will go 
up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * In addition, during this period of decreasing budgets, the Navy has spent 
more money on quality-of-life issues for our sailors, such as better housing 
and child-care facilities. There have been real increases in spending in this 
critical area during each of the past three fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, and most importantly, the Navy continues to offer career 
opportunities, with more than 56,000 new job openings this year alone, and we 
will bring over a quarter-million new people into our force before the turn of 
the century. We are hiring!

PROS AND CONS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Perspectives on Electric Cars," Commentary, March 28: 
</P>
<P>
 We should also consider that on hot summer days, with air conditioners 
operating, existing power plants already run at their maximum capacity, a 
hairbreadth from a brownout. Thus with a multitude of electric cars we 
certainly will need more power plants. While electric cars do not pollute, 
conventional power plants do. Unless the environmentalists are thinking of 
atomic power plants? 
</P>
<P>
 We would also need to upgrade electric power distribution systems to handle 
the heavily increased demand for power. This would be good for manufacturers 
producing the necessary components as well as for the construction contractors 
installing them. Of course money is no object. 
</P>
<P>
 BRUNO LAAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * The column by Sen. Barbara Boxer concerning electric vehicles seems to 
overlook two significant factors: cost and free market choice. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm aware that a dedicated production program for any manufactured product can 
result in major cost reductions as a function of units produced but the demand 
for these EVs must be there for the free market forces to operate. The 
California mandate is "that in less than five years, 40,000 EVs must be sold in 
California. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose that nobody wants to buy them? Or, further, nobody can afford to buy 
them? What then? 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect Detroit, having an opportunity to produce state-of-the-art EVs on a 
sound financial basis, will respond. But, a government mandate is not the way 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN J. CORCORAN 
</P>
<P>
 Playa del Rey 
</P>
<P>
 * Directors of the Michigan-based Study of Automotive Transportation think 
that the mandates for electric vehicles in California are premature.  
</P>
<P>
 David Cole and Michael Flynn are right about several things. On entry into the 
market, electric vehicles will cost more, and loud trepidation about buyer 
acceptance of limited range and long charging time is understandable.  
</P>
<P>
 I own a 1971 Mazda powered by 18 lead-acid batteries. It cost me $6,000 used. 
It has a 50-mile range on freeways, doing 60 miles per hour in the slow lane 
when traffic is moving. It has a 60-mile range on surface streets. My car is 
called a "conversion" and conversions have been going on for over 30 years.  
</P>
<P>
 From-the-ground-up electrics, with their advanced motors, give nothing away in 
performance to gasoline models. Requiring their production will work to bring 
down the cost and increase range. A lead-acid battery that could double the 
present range of electrics is in the works and will probably be in production 
before the 1998 when 2% of the cars sold in California must be non-polluting. A 
stationary charging system has been developed and demonstrated that reduces 
charging time to 18 minutes, and an affordable on-board version is on the 
drawing boards which will do the same in an hour or so. With some commitment to 
infrastructure (such as charging stations at work and low rates for off-peak 
night charging), electric vehicles could be a viable alternative to more of the 
same. That is if the Big Three do not succeed in lobbying the state to postpone 
or rescind the mandates.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JANET JACKSON: SEE HER ROAR; FORUM SHOW THROBS IN POMP AND 
CIRCUMSTANCE

 Janet sings. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet cries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cries? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, sobs was more like it at the Forum on Thursday night, the start of a 
three-night engagement postponed from last month because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 We've all seen singers who can shed a tear or two during a particularly tender 
number -- and it sometimes touches you even if you suspect that it is really 
just crocodile tears, employed at precisely the same time on every other night 
of the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But Janet Jackson cried a virtual river while singing her own particularly 
tender number, the Oscar-nominated song "Again." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a chance it was a moment of genuine revelation -- but the odds of that 
were slim in a show that was so carefully staged in every detail that you were 
even tempted to think the steamy routine with the male "volunteer" from the 
audience was choreographed ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the video-age, spectacle tradition of her brother Michael and Madonna, 
Jackson spares no expense nor theatrical imagination in putting together a 
lavish production that clearly delighted Thursday's audience: dancers, 
musicians, exploding fireworks, costumes, video screens, loving portraits of 
the star high above the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson continues to gain authority as a singer and fluidity as a 
dancer, the constant emphasis on gala production and role-playing (from steamy 
seductress to social-conscience monitor) undercuts her individuality as an 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 We sense in the polished show what Jackson can do as a performer, but little 
about who she is . 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the most affecting moments was when Jackson returned for 
the encore in just a flannel shirt and jeans to sing "That's the Way Love 
Goes," one of the most endearing pieces of romantic pop confection of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 The song is a highlight of Jackson's latest and best album, "janet.," a silky 
collection of contemporary R&B/pop that explores questions of sexual awakening 
and desire with a classy sense of pop craft and convincing passion. 
</P>
<P>
 The album was a major advance, creatively, over Jackson's earlier work -- and 
some of the material, especially the sensual synthesizer pulse of "Throb," was 
performed with equal energy and style. 
</P>
<P>
 But other numbers of merit from the album were turned into side shows. The 
intimacy of "Again" seemed violated by the parade of tears; the legitimate 
social message of "This Time," a song about domestic abuse, was smothered by 
elaborate staging that was more ludicrous than affecting. 
</P>
<P>
 By emerging from the shadow of brother Michael and the early public skepticism 
that her record success was based simply on the family name and the skills of 
her record producers, Jackson is one of the most surprising pop stories of 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But she needs to choose now between the grand statement (the safest route to 
commercial success) and the intimate revelation (the primary path to artistry). 
</P>
<P>
 Mint Condition, the opening act, performed contemporary R&B ballads and 
bounced with confidence and energy but with little distinctiveness in either 
its music or manner. 
</P>

Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at the Forum, 3900 W. Manchester Blvd., Inglewood. (310)

MUSIC REVIEW; LEONTYNE PRICE IN RECITAL: A DIVA FOR ALL SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are sopranos and there are sopranos. Then there are divas. Leontyne 
Price is a diva. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't make them like that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch her sweep onstage in regal splendor, flashing a devastating push-button 
smile. Watch her elevate the simple practice of semaphore to a high, complex 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch her cultivate that disarming if not disingenuous 
what-all-this-love-for-little-me? gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch her clutch her heart. Watch her emote with bigger-than-life bravado. 
Watch her choreograph her own ovations. Watch her model two gowns, something to 
drape her statuesque form in spangly blue before intermission and something to 
create a softer effect in shocking, flowing pink afterward. Watch her deflect 
some of her birth-right cheers, with grandiose generosity, to her faithful, 
eloquent and ever-supportive accompanist, David Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who helped Ambassador Auditorium celebrate its 20th anniversary 
Thursday night, knows what she is doing. And she has been doing it quite 
splendidly for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may not seem altogether gallant to mention just how long, the 
statistics are no secret. Check the reference books. Mary Violet Price, a.k.a. 
Leontyne, was born in Laurel, Mississippi, on Feb. 10, 1927. Los Angeles first 
heard her in concert 38 years ago at Hollywood Bowl. In these pages, Walter 
Arlen took appreciative notice of her "dramatic stature" and "especially 
impressive silvery pianissimo." 
</P>
<P>
 Some things have not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Price's position in history is secure. She took, and held, a proud place in 
the lonely procession of great lirico-spinto sopranos at the Metropolitan 
following Rosa Ponselle and Zinka Milanov. She bridged the gap between 
Gershwin's Bess and Verdi's Leonora, making the world of opera blissfully 
color-blind in the process. She retired from theatrical challenges, with 
dignity, in 1985, but continues to stimulate delirium among her ever-vociferous 
fans with recital programs that make no concession to the passing years. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was at Ambassador. The agenda was broad in scope -- an old-fashioned 
mixed-grille menu -- and demanding in matters of range, style and technique. It 
was, in fact, exactly the sort of agenda Price would have chosen 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Arduous arias of Handel and Mozart served as warm-up exercises, followed by a 
set of introspective Lieder by the relatively obscure Joseph Marx and some 
heroic signature-piece Verdi. Then, in the pink period, came sensitive melodies 
of Poulenc, Duparc and Hahn, followed by a contemporary American group (Hoiby, 
Bonds, Dougherty) and the inevitable spiritual mock-finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The real finale -- presented amid de rigueur standing ovations, tons of floral 
tributes and raucous choruses of bravo , not to mention an occasional 
sophisticated brava -- came with the four encores. So did some of the most 
memorable vocalism of the evening: in Butterfly's death scene, in the same 
"Summertime" Price introduced at the Bowl in '55, in "This Little Light of 
Mine" ("a favorite," the diva announced, "of my mother's") and, most notably, 
in "Io son l'umile ancella" from Cilea's "Adriana Lecouvreur." 
</P>
<P>
 The last aria told everything. Her voice sounding warm, poised and sensuous, 
Price traced the long, arching contours with extraordinary tenderness and 
purity. She offered an object lesson in the lost art of legato phrasing, and 
even capped the ultimate ascending line with an ethereal diminuendo. She 
mustered far more freshness, in fact, and far more subtlety than one heard at 
the Met a couple of weeks ago when Mirella Freni, a comparative youngster at 
59, attempted the same challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other moments that recalled past glories: the other-worldly 
downward glissando that climaxed an oddly free-and-easy "Summertime," the 
exquisite caress of Poulenc's "C" the insinuation of his "Violon," the wicked 
parody of Hoiby's "Serpent," the arching pathos of Cio-Cio-San's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be less than realistic to pretend that everything went this well. The 
almost-impossible coloratura of "D'Oreste, d'Ajace" from Mozart's "Idomoneo" 
was merely approximated. The classic torment of Handel's Cleopatra sounded 
labored. Harsh register breaks marred "Pace, pace mio Dio." Much of the singing 
early in the evening seemed explosive, the tone raw and unresonant, the 
interpretations mannered. 
</P>
<P>
 Even here, however, one had to marvel at the extraordinary preservation of the 
singer's resources. The top range is still in tact. There is no wobble. The 
only serious signs of strain involve sporadic problems of breath support. 
</P>
<P>
 At 67, Leontyne Price often sings better than many a soprano half her age, and 
she always sings better than any soprano anywhere near her age. In her own 
stubbornly independent way, she remains a diva for all seasons.

POP NOTES: BLOCKBUSTER CAN NOW SEAT 35,000

 The Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in San Bernardino County can now seat as 
many as 35,000 concert-goers, more than doubling last year's opening-season 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials restricted the Pavilion's capacity to 16,800 in 1993. The 
limit has been eased following $750,000 in traffic improvements near the 
amphitheater, according to Stuart A. Zanville, a Blockbuster Pavilion 
spokesman. The additional capacity -- all of it on a vast lawn overlooking the 
Pavilion's 10,500 permanent seats -- is expected to come in handy for the 
Eagles' show June 3. Zanville said that when further improvements to a freeway 
interchange are finished in 1995, the Pavilion's capacity will rise to 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, local bands interested in playing outdoors to a substantial crowd 
might want to send a tape to the Blockbuster Pavilion. A second stage will be 
set up in the amphitheater's plaza before each concert, with local acts 
featured there before the big guns go on inside. Pavilion officials are looking 
for talent in a range of styles in hopes of matching amphitheater headliners 
with compatible Southern California acts on the second stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested performers should send a demo cassette tape, a photo and a bio to 
Angie Diehl Jacobs, director of marketing, Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion, 
2575 Devore Road, Devore, CA 92407.

 HEAD-BANGING: Roxbury South in Santa Ana has launched "Skull Grind," a weekly 
hard-rock concert series. Electric Love Hogs play Tuesday, with Mind Over Four 
staging a reunion show in the opening slot. Also booked are Spirit Tree 
(featuring former members of Lixx Array) and H.E.D. on April 26, and Aversion 
on May 3. The club is at 2 Hutton Centre Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 662-0880. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hardie, the promoter booking the "Skull Grind" series, is also continuing 
to promote occasional shows with former Bogart's booker Steve Zepeda at the 
Foothill, an old-time dance hall at 1922 Cherry Ave. in Long Beach. Frank Black 
plays April 21 and the Cadillac Tramps on April 29, with tickets at $10 for 
both shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Hardie said the Tramps insisted on playing the Foothill, a former haunt for 
the likes of Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, after checking out a recent show 
there by the Reverend Horton Heat. (310) 984-8349.

 VEGETARIANS NEED NOT APPLY: Ever dream of going to bat, so to speak, for Team 
Ozzy? To nobody's surprise, heavy-metal graybeard Ozzy Osbourne has decided not 
to retire from the stage after all, and is seeking recruits for a new band to 
back him on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Via press release, Osbourne has put out a cattle call for guitarists, drummers 
and bassists. No word of wages, benefits, working conditions or experience 
required. If you're interested, send a demo tape and photo to Ozzy Osbourne, 
9044 Melrose Ave., Third Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90069. The deadline is April

 SURF'S ORANGE: A new Rhino Records compilation of instrumental surf-rock 
classics acknowledges the Orange County contribution to the genre's early-'60s 
heyday. Rhino devotes the fifth volume of its five-disc series, "Rock 
Instrumental Classics," to surf music, and of the 16 tracks, four are by bands 
that hailed from Orange County. "Pipeline," by the Chantays, leads off the 
album, and Dick Dale & the Del-Tones' quasi-hits "Miserlou" and "Let's Go 
Trippin' " are included. 
</P>
<P>
 More obscure is "Surf Rider," by the Lively Ones, whose guitarist and bassist 
met while students at Garden Grove High School. The only track on the 
compilation to exceed three minutes, it holds up well in company that also 
includes such classic surf bands as the Bel-airs, the Ventures and the 
Surfaris.

 What's Up, Pete?: Animation director Chuck Jones and "Bugs Bunny on Broadway" 
creator George Daugherty are combining forces to produce an interactive 
animated version of Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf." Jones will supply designs 
for the characters; Daugherty will direct and co-write the script with Janis 
Diamond ("Sesame Street," "Electric Company"). Kirstie Alley will provide the 
voices of the characters. "Peter and the Wolf" will enable children to interact 
directly with the characters, play a variety of computer/video-styled games and 
see mini-documentaries on Jones and composer Serge Prokofiev. A Time Warner 
Symphony Orchestra performance of the score will be released as an audio 
compact disc with the CD-ROM disc. IBM and Apple versions of the game will be

 Not So Funny: A lawsuit filed by comedians Robert Shimmel and Carol Siskind 
last summer against management of the Los Angeles Improv comedy club has been 
expanded to include longtime Improv owner Budd Friedman and the Performers 
Workshop, from which Friedman received profit. The suit concerns two sets of 
cassette recordings, which the comics say contain their stand-up material and 
were recorded and distributed without their consent, and for which they were 
not paid any royalties. "We have learned that (Friedman) is directly and 
intimately involved in the recording," said Ian Imrich, the comics' attorney. 
Friedman could not be reached for comment. In addition, comics Susie Loucks and 
Nick DiPaulo have joined Shimmel and Siskind in the federal court case, which 
has been upped from $2.5 million to $5 million.

 Howard Who?: Bad news for Howard Stern's supposed gubernatorial aspirations. 
In a Quinnipiac College Poll of 584 New York state voters, of the 82% who had 
heard of the shock jock, 15% viewed him favorably, 70% unfavorably. By 
comparison, Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo had a 41%-36% 
favorable-unfavorable ratio among the 97% of those familiar with him. The only 
good news for Stern: He was far better known than the four Republican 
candidates included in the poll. The survey was conducted between March 23-30 
and has a margin of error of 4%. Stern said last month he would seek the 
Libertarian Party nomination for governor. QUICK TAKES

musical remake of the 1964 fantasy film "The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao," starring 
Jackson. The 1964 original starred Tony Randall and was directed by George Pal. 
The remake would emphasize special effects. The rights are owned by Turner 
Pictures. . . . Singer Percy Sledge, best known for "When a Man Loves a Woman," 
pleaded guilty to tax evasion for failing to report more than $200,000 in 
performance income. He admitted Thursday that he underpaid his 1987-88 taxes by 
more than $95,000. DAVID J. FOX

READER SAYS, 'FORGET IT' TO TICKET PRICES

 Holy price-gouging, Batman!

<P>
 When I read that tickets for Barbra Streisand's concerts at the Anaheim Pond 
were starting at $50 and going as high as $350, I felt sick to my stomach 
("Tickets for Streisand Dates in O.C. Go on Sale Sunday," March 23).I mean, 
come on, we're talking about a simple concert, not the Second Coming. Granted, 
Babs' concert tour is a big event, and I was looking forward to seeing one of 
her shows at the Pond. However, at those prices, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 Concert promoters are on the supply side of a supply-and-demand business, and 
they hold the cards when it comes to the prices for concert tickets. That, 
however, doesn't give them the right to price the average concert-goer right 
out of the market. All I have to say to them is thanks for nothing.

DESMARAIS' DISMISSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Laguna Art Museum Dismisses Director" (March 30): 
</P>
<P>
 As a past president of the Affiliates of the Laguna Art Museum, a longtime 
member, contributor and volunteer, I was interested in the recent events. 
Certainly, over the years, the museum's board of trustees has been made up of 
outstanding community leaders who have given freely of their time and financial 
backing. This year's board is no exception; and the (gratis) time, expertise 
and interest they have given cannot be measured in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite (museum director Charles) Desmarais' accomplishments, there has been 
serious attrition of volunteers. A museum's viable growth depends equally on 
the enthusiastic endorsement and support of its members and volunteers -- Mr. 
Desmarais did not appreciate, encourage or honor volunteers' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 During Mr. Desmarais' tenure, funds have been raised. However, there were 
already in place endowments and commitments. Despite the rather continual 
turnover of personnel, Mr. Desmarais has enjoyed excellent curatorial and staff 
help with regard to the exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Art Museum is a great asset to Laguna Beach and surrounding 
communities and will continue to grow -- with the right direction. In the 
meantime, I wish Mr. Desmarais success in his chosen field. 
</P>
<P>
 JOSEPHINE L. DOMINICK 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Your reporting on the recent dismissal of Laguna Art Museum's director has 
properly emphasized the growth and achievement of the institution during his 
tenure but has somehow created the impression that this was all the work of a 
single person rather than the collaborative effort of a very capable board and 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the board that set the tone of wanting to put the institution on the 
map in artistic circles when curator Bolton Colburn and then-director Charles 
Desmarais were hired in 1988. A show in 1989 that Colburn had planned before 
Desmarais joined the institution was the one that attracted my wife and me to 
become passionate supporters of the museum. And the board clearly has continued 
to provide the support essential for the institution to make this move to the 
cutting edge of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing staff has received little attention in your recent articles, 
just as it was overlooked when you interviewed Desmarais about the "Kustom 
Kulture" show ("Car Art Stops Traffic at Laguna Museum," Nov. 5) -- it seemed 
inappropriate at that time that you did not even mention Colburn, who had first 
conceived of bringing in artist/curator Craig Stecyk for this exhibition and 
then was the co-curator with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kustom Kulture" went on to become the most popular show in the museum's 
history, and it is the depth and talent of all the staff that has made this 
kind of show possible. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I were not privy to the decisions that brought on the present 
situation, but, given the intelligence, energy and support that the board has 
provided over the last five years, it is hard to believe that it has acted now 
as capriciously as the newspaper accounts seem to imply. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not feel that the prospects of the institution are diminished by the 
board's willingness to make difficult management decisions, and both my wife 
and I are looking forward to continuing our enthusiastic support for the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 I have been a member of many museums in Southern California throughout the 
years. I am currently a new member of the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Every museum has gone through a certain amount of change and turmoil, but they 
have always emerged stronger and better. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel confident that Laguna Art Museum will have a bright and exciting 
future.

ART REVIEW; CRUIKSHANK'S WORK FINDS HUMOR IN LIFE'S INEQUITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Isaac Cruikshank were alive today he could be in a lot of trouble. He lived 
mainly in the 18th Century and always in Britain, where he was a popular 
satirical draftsman. By present standards he was politically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 A very fine spread of his work on view at USC's Fisher Gallery shows his pen 
needled just about everybody in sight. Pretty young women were gold diggers, 
old men were sexist satyrs. Everybody got it, the fat, the foreign, the 
disabled, the righteous and the damned. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Isaac Cruikshank and the Politics of Parody" this is the most 
comprehensive exhibition of Cruikshank's yet done, presenting more than 100 
little watercolors on loan from the fabled holdings of the Huntington Library 
and Art Gallery in San Marino. Organized by its art gallery director Edward J. 
Nygren in collaboration with the university's museum studies class of 1995, the 
exhibit is handsomely hung, professionally presented and fleshed out with a 
fully illustrated catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The century was a great one for satire. Apparently the Enlightenment's quest 
for objective understanding coupled with the rococo's urge to fun resulted in 
the realization that humanity, rationally examined, in fact, does not make 
sense. The insight created a paradoxical backlash to a medieval notion that the 
secular world is a dung-heap of vanity and folly. Since reality was vicious and 
God was going out of fashion, the only sensible way to deal with life was to 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 In England the urge to parody first bit James Hogarth and went on to infect 
Cruikshank and such colleagues as James Gilray and Thomas Rowlandson, not to 
mention Cruikshank's own son George, who outstripped him in fame. In Spain Goya 
turned the idea of satire into a searing denunciation of the Inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cruikshank's gifts were more modest. Whimsy, drollery and burlesque were his 
forte. As Nygren's catalogue essay points out, the theater, with its broadly 
drawn comic types, was his main inspiration. Like his fellow comedians, he made 
his drawings as studies for prints intended for popular consumption. Unlike 
them he was not into the bile of full-blown caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 His drawing line is crisp and fresh with a slightly eccentric edge of 
diffident awkwardness. His watercolor tints capture Gainsborough's lightness of 
touch. He keeps his figures in the middle ground like actors on stage. This 
objective distance creates a gentle, shrugging detachment that feels more 
bemused than bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is divided into thematic categories such as "Wheel of Fortune," 
"Love and Marriage" and "Fools for Fashion," echoing the Enlightenment's 
passion for types and categories. At a glance it looks like this pigeonholing 
practice shrinks the individual down to a one-dimensional stereotype. That 
makes for bad art as well as unfair discrimination. But look again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rabbits" shows a vendor of color kneeling before a white woman, offering 
his wares. The subservient pose offends us today, but the real story is more 
complex and decidedly funnier. The woman is actually a domestic servant putting 
on airs. When she complains the proffered rabbit does not smell fresh, the 
vendor's slightly obscene rejoinder proves he feels free to take no guff from 
anyone. Cruikshank actually shows characters departing from stereotype, making 
them fully rounded humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "None But the Brave Deserves the Fair" depicts two old duffers fighting over a 
beautiful courtesan. Despite its trappings as a genre piece it alludes to 
Milton's "Paradise Lost" recasting the three comic characters as Satan, Sin and 
Death. Stereotypes become archetypes reflecting the universal condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Doctor Snatching at the Guinea After His Patient Is Dead" could be 
enlisted in today's wrangle over health-care reform. Maybe not. The gouging 
physician may not be the only villain in the piece. He is tussling with two 
domestics who could be trying to steal the money from him. Cruikshank 
undermines class prejudice in both directions. He introduces a sense of modern 
ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 The real butt of Cruikshank's larger joke is less the individual than the 
inequities of life. The villain of the piece is the hypocrite who exploits 
inequity under the guise of idealism.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, humor is always on the side of tolerance. It functions 
cathartically to remind us that, in the end, we are all slightly absurd. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEW; SALONEN LEADS STRAVINSKY / HAYDN COMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the decades, certain symphonic repertory combinations have proved not 
only viable and complementary, but also illuminating. Mozart and Mahler, for 
instance. At Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts, Haydn and Stravinsky have been 
scratching each other's backs, musically speaking, for years, often to the 
enlightenment of listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 These composers did so again Thursday at the first of four Philharmonic 
performances of Stravinsky's two small-orchestra suites and his "Capriccio" for 
piano and orchestra, and Haydn's Keyboard Concerto in D and Symphony No. 98. 
</P>
<P>
 These four works -- the two, brief suites benefit from being given in tandem 
-- seemed to belong together; they certainly resonated clearly off each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, under the sharp leadership of Esa-Pekka Salonen, they 
became handsomely performed. The Philharmonic's music director may not always 
choose to savor the flavors he sets before his subscribers, but he does coax -- 
perhaps allow is the better word -- the orchestra toward careful detailing. 
This time around, he got splendid results. 
</P>
<P>
 From the years around 1920, the two little suites show Stravinsky mixing 
mordancy and melodiousness in an irresistible froth. With the Philharmonic in 
its more transparent mode, Salonen here began this program in buoyant readings 
of smile-causing music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He had a smaller success in the same composer's 1949 revision of "Capriccio," 
in which Emanuel Ax was the technically solid, musicianly astute soloist. 
Textures here failed to become clarified; inner voices tended to dominate; 
diligence never turned into affection. The notes all appeared, but seldom, 
until the finale, made strong sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The same perspective -- a tendency to hurry rather than to linger -- also 
afflicted the Salonen/Ax reading of Haydn's ever-wondrous D-major Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 All the elements seemed brought together, yet they never quite coalesced, 
never progressed from terrific efficiency into musical revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the evening, such a plateau was approached in Salonen's 
performance of the Symphony No. 98, a masterpiece by any standard and a virtual 
embarrassment of symphonic riches. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the conductor's genuine probing, the work's kaleidoscopic emotional 
range emerged natural in rhetoric, careful in articulation, fluent in 
discourse. It also sang. Among the excellent soloists were concertmaster 
Alexander Treger and guest fortepianist Ax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Philharmonic, tonight at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center, 135 N. Grand Ave., (213) 
850-2000). Tickets, $6-$50.

THE BROADWAY COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suzanne Muchnic's recent coverage ("Remapping the Local Art Scene," March 9) 
of the ever-changing, nomadic nature of the Los Angeles art world was 
extensive, but not encompassing. 
</P>
<P>
 We are all delighted at the prospect of another strong cultural center in 
Santa Monica, as Bergamot Station promises to be.However, we feel it in the 
best interest of your readers to make them aware of a longstanding arts mecca 
where many changes have occurred in the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway Gallery Complex in the 2000 block of Broadway near Cloverfield 
was established in 1988 when Venice Artwalk co-founder Ruth Bloom and partner 
Jeanne Meyers opened Meyers/Bloom Gallery. Robert Berman arrived shortly 
thereafter with his own gallery and his Santa Monica Auctions, which presents 
its eighth staging May 21-22. The newest addition is Ruth Bachofner, who 
recently left her space on Colorado Avenue after six years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the growing cluster of galleries allied on cooperative events and 
have hosted "L.A. Art Night for Life," benefiting AIDS Project L.A.; several 
Democratic Party fund-raisers; and numerous musical performances, lectures and 
symposiums. 
</P>
<P>
 To better serve all its constituencies, The Complex has extended its hours 
Thursday evenings to 8 and Sundays from noon to 4 p.m.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MIGUEL BOSE MIXES OLD WITH THE NEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Miguel Bose decided to bury forever the sexy, teen-oriented image he's 
been carrying for the last 21 years, he knew it would be tough to please the 
old die-hard fans of his above-average but still lightweight pop and the new 
fans attracted by his latest and most serious album, "Bajo el signo de Cain."  
</P>
<P>
 His show Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre, a hot-cold affair that 
accurately reflected the lights and shadows of an unpredictable career, proved 
that it may be an impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, despite entertaining staging, a solid five-piece band of young 
Spanish musicians and Bose's own underrated vocal skills and stage presence, 
was an uneven hodge-podge of the old and the new -- two radically opposite 
sides of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bose was at his best during the new material, the loud but 
intermittently appreciative crowd only stood up when he performed his 
best-known songs, including "Bandido" ("Bandit") and "Los chicos no lloran" 
("Boys Don't Cry"). 
</P>
<P>
 Happy and aware that he'll probably never repeat his success, 37-year-old Bose 
seemed more preoccupied with making a statement than performing a dynamic show. 
And that was enough for his credibility to stay intact. ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; PUNK, BLUEGRASS WITH KILLBILLY CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though punk rock and bluegrass seem like musical styles that would only meet 
in the confusing clamor of a stereo store, Dallas' Killbilly have made a career 
off the unlikely combination. The six-piece band, which has released two indie 
albums in its eight-year career, picked and strummed twangy versions of 
punk-rock and pop classics Thursday at Club Lingerie, charming the sparse 
Hollywood crowd with its tight delivery and rollicking attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Flamboyant singer Craig Taylor shuffled his bright white cowboy boots like an 
Appalachian David Lee Roth, while the band played bluegrass versions of songs 
by the Dead Kennedys, Violent Femmes, Bow Wow Wow and Deep Purple. They kept 
the speed and edge of the originals while adding their own definitive 
back-porch feel. Killbilly was just as adept on straight bluegrass classics, 
including genre founding father Bill Monroe's "Little Maggie" and a 
150-year-old ballad about Jesse James. 
</P>
<P>
 The mismatched band members -- from the grungy stand-up bassist to the 
countrified mandolin player -- played original material as well from their new 
album, "Foggy Mountain Anarchy." The songs leaned toward a traditional country 
feel with tongue-in-cheek lyrics. A favorite was "Pass the Whiskey Round," 
where each member declared his favorite way to drink the spirit and 
demonstrated on stage. A fitting grand finale for such a down-home show.

TV REVIEWS; 'DAVID'S MOTHER' HIDES BEHIND JOKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's known to refer to him as a moron. It's her jokey way of dealing with her 
son's mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 In "David's Mother," Mom (a withering, caustic Kirstie Alley) delivers a 
stream of snappy one-liners in order to conceal her guilt and 
self-sacrifice.Trouble is, her rapier shield drives all her loved ones away, 
including a husband, a shop-happy sister (Stockard Channing) and a sensitive 
new boyfriend (Sam Waterston). A social worker (Phylicia Rashad) hardly fares 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Randall initially wrote "David's Mom" for the stage (it was produced at 
the Pasadena Playhouse in 1992) prior to becoming producer and head writer of 
"Kate & Allie." But his teleplay, instead of enlarging on the characters or 
illuminating them in a different light, essentially approximates the play. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine as far as adhering to the play's integrity but we're still stuck 
with a mom who wears thin. As in the play, too much of the mother's pain is 
buried under Alley's arch patter and her defense structures. You tend to 
observe the hurt more than feel it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the TV production provides flashes of penetrating drama, and the 
actors playing the mentally impaired son are hard to forget. Michael Goorjian 
as the teen-age youth and 9-year-old Steve Ivany, who is autistic, as the small 
child in the flashbacks, contribute a wealth of physical and emotional detail 
that underscores the familial havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatergoers may be reminded of another play with similar aims, Peter Nichols' 
"Death of Joe Egg," which also shut out reality by joking about it but did it 
with more savagery and starkness. 
</P>
<P>
 * "David's Mother" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

TV REVIEWS; BBC BRINGS GEORGE ELIOT'S 'MIDDLEMARCH' TO PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Eliot, the great Victorian novelist, comes to PBS Sunday with the first 
of a six-part dramatization of her teeming, passionate, psychologically rich 
novel "Middlemarch." 
</P>
<P>
 The study of provincial life in 1830s England, the miniseries reasserts what 
the BBC does uniquely well -- the re-creation of classic English novels. 
"Masterpiece Theatre" has done Eliot before ("Adam Bede" and "Silas Marner") 
but "Middlemarch," which took 30 weeks to film in locations from Rome to 
Lincolnshire, is the most costly production the BBC has attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 As host Russell Baker says in one of his concise introductions, "Humdrum 
Middlemarch is not as simple as it seems." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the town of Middlemarch is big enough to offer up a picture of a whole 
society. The production, in its bruising depictions of idealism clashing 
against materialism, is the antithesis of an antique costume picture of merry 
olde England because it mirrors jealousy, hypocrisy and greed in any age. 
</P>
<P>
 Autobiographically speaking, the title stands for Coventry and that part of 
England from which the early feminist Mary Ann Evans fled (and took the name 
George Eliot because she felt she would be taken more seriously as a novelist 
if she adopted a man's name). 
</P>
<P>
 Like her fat 1872 novel, the miniseries dovetails two stories that are central 
to the sprawling tapestry. One is that of the idealistic, well-bred young 
Dorothea Brooke (Juliet Aubrey), who marries an aging bachelor (Patrick 
Malahide); the second is that of the earnest, reform-minded Dr. Tertius Lydgate 
(Douglas Hodge), whose life is compromised by a shallow, greedy wife (Trevyn 
McDowell) and his own weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapter Andrew Davies and director Anthony Page underscore what Baker aptly 
calls Brooke's "velvet cage," as our heroine strives to free herself of the 
Victorian ideal of womanhood (although she never ventures as far as did Eliot 
herself, who openly lived with a married man for 24 years). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Middlemarch" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24; it begins April 10 at 8 p.m. 
on KOCE-TV Channel 50.

TV REVIEWS; HOCKNEY DESIGNS BRIGHTEN 'TURANDOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Hockney's lavish sets for Puccini's "Turandot" by all reports made a 
dominant impact when seen at the San Francisco Opera in October. They look a 
little less impressive squeezed onto the little screen, but television director 
Brian Large still allows sufficient appreciation of them by judiciously 
balancing long shots with close-up views of the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The zig-zag angles and vistas of the palace walls still meander with 
insouciance into the distance. The witty imitations of traditional hanging 
scroll-art can still be properly apprehended. The final scene continues to 
evolve mysteriously from blue grotto to symbolic cut-out heart, glowing 
incandescent with opulent golds and reds as love finally triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the visual interest, however, the musical values are not always happy 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Marton sings the title role with squally attack and unsteady support, 
especially when singing under pressure in the heights, as the role so often 
requires. Apart from some awkwardly stiff cross-armed cliches, however, she 
acts with sensitive detail, signaling the icy princess' potential capitulation 
as early as the riddle scene and rendering Alfano's completion of the score 
uncommonly involving. Michael Sylvester brings bright, big and warm vocalism to 
the role of Calaf, and acts with a sympathetic, wide-eyed naivete. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucia Mazzaria makes a coppery-toned, small-voiced Liu. Kevin J. Langan brings 
authority and detailed characterization to Timur. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Baerg, Dennis Petersen and Craig Estep make a hoarsely-blended trio 
of court ministers. Joseph Frank enacts a compassionate Emperor and sings with 
gentle clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Runnicles projects propulsive energy in the pit, even in the lyrical 
passages, sometimes overwhelming the singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Peter McClintock makes sure the principals attend to realistic 
details, but his lock-step postures for the proletarian-style chorus tend to 
disappear at the boundaries of the television screen. Ian Falconer created the 
heavy, elaborate court costumes. Thomas J. Munn's moody lighting helped focus 
the action and the transitions. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; NEW THEORIES ON THE 'LUSITANIA' MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SCHEIDERER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the hardly remembered mysteries of the early 20th Century gets the 
"National Geographic Explorer" treatment Sunday night in "Last Voyage of the 
Lusitania," an interesting mix of the usual TV documentary elements: 
present-day exploration, historical footage and eyewitness testimonials. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known to history is that on May 7, 1915, the Cunard liner Lusitania 
was hit by a single torpedo from a German submarine and quickly sank off the 
coast of Ireland with the loss of 1,195 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 What has always puzzled students of such disasters was a huge second explosion 
aboard the liner (it was thought to be carrying wartime munitions) and the 
speed with which it sank: 18 minutes. The Titanic, by contrast, stayed afloat 
for many hours despite the huge rip in its hull. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying Cunard records of the ship's cargo and computer models, noted 
undersea explorer Robert Ballard examined the Lusitania's remains (it sits in 
300 feet of water) with television cameras mounted on a robot submarine. 
Ballard found a new theory for the second explosion in a trail of lumps of coal 
that led to the ghostly hull. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard's search is intercut with historical footage of the Lusitania's 
sailing and with the often touching recollections of its survivors. Especially 
heart-wrenching is one survivor's story of trying, vainly, to save her sister 
in the frigid water. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Last Voyage of the Lusitania" can be seen on cable station TBS Sunday at 6 
p.m. , with repeat broadcasts Monday at 9:05 p.m. and next Saturday at 7:05 a.m

GOLDEN STATEMENT; THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT FROM THE TURN OF THE CENTURY 
GAVE US A DISTINCT DESIGN IDENTITY, AND THE STYLE HAS GAINED FAVOR IN RECENT 
YEARS. THE LAGUNA BEACH HOUSE OF THE ELIEL FAMILY REFLECTS THIS CALIFORNIA 
HERITAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the turn of the century, California design meant cozy bungalows on large 
yards that complemented this area's incredible climate and natural resources.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were Craftsman bungalows, as well as Mission Revival, Spanish Colonial 
and other styles that used references from other lands but still created a 
house that was particular to California. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time the California Arts and Crafts movement was in full swing, 
with artisans creating furniture from oak, lamps from copper and pottery from 
natural clay. 
</P>
<P>
 The intervening 90-plus years have taken their toll on true California home 
design. There are few houses remaining that exemplify those original Craftsman 
ideals; those that remain are found largely in older neighborhoods in 
communities such as Tustin, Santa Ana, Orange, Huntington Beach and Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Orange County's housing since has turned to Europe for inspiration, 
but the home of Alan Blake Eliel, his wife, Lynda, and daughter Joanna 
deliberately takes its inspiration from the Craftsman era in the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside and out, their home in a secluded canyon in Laguna Beach is a 
reflection of things Californian: The structure itself is a simple wood-frame 
house; the furnishings and paintings are from the Arts and Crafts movement; the 
plantings are indigenous to this area. 
</P>
<P>
 "A feeling of homogeneousness is missing in architecture locally. When you're 
in a village in France, you know you're in France. When you're in Switzerland, 
Italy or England, you know where you are. Here, you're not quite sure where you 
are architecturally," Eliel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep looking past our great California heritage that some of the original 
architects in the area used." 
</P>
<P>
 From the street, the Eliel home is unimposing and blends into the natural 
surroundings. The home, built in 1976, is not unlike many other small, 
single-family dwellings in the county. What is different about the house is the 
way Eliel has applied the principles of the California Arts and Crafts movement 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliel, who is a landscape designer, has made a few structural changes to the 
home -- such as adding a wooden staircase -- and has surrounded it with 
drought-tolerant plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The yard, primarily full of plants indigenous to California or native 
compatible, is in the best tradition of the Arts and Crafts movement, which 
believed that nature is an integral part of our lives.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Arts and Crafts movement was steeped in philosophy," Eliel said. "It was 
all about learning to live in harmony with nature. This 100-year-old movement 
was a reaction against both the excesses of the Victorian Age and machine-made 
objects from the Industrial Revolution.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons for the re-emergence of this movement is the very same. 
People are searching again for meaning in life and looking to nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arts and Crafts practitioners went even further. They believed that the 
honesty of the materials used would promote honesty in the people who used 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This house in the canyon has had a profound influence on everything I've done 
since I've lived here," Eliel said. "I believe a relationship with nature is 
like a relationship with people. The closer you are, the better the 
relationship. In my own humble way, I've tried to use California's heritage in 
both the house and the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Eliel has been collecting Arts and Crafts furniture and lamps, as 
well as California plein-air paintings, Craftsman pottery, antique Spanish 
serapes and Native American blankets. 
</P>

 "I put my collection together because I thought it would be nice to have items 
that reflected California's art heritage. I'm not a heavy-duty collector. I've 
really emphasized good decorative art, landscapes and flowers that reflect my 
love of nature," Eliel said. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought his first Arts and Crafts piece in the early 1970s at a used 
furniture store. It was a Morris chair and he paid $150 for it. "At that time 
it was hard to find good, big, comfortable chairs. I liked the design, and I 
liked the fact that it was so sturdy and comfortable." (Last summer, an oak 
Morris chair and ottoman by Gustav Stickley sold for $3,450 at an auction at 
Christie's.) 
</P>
<P>
 Eliel has left the walls of the house white so that the artwork is shown to 
its best advantage, giving the home a light and airy feeling.  
</P>
<P>
 In the small entry hall, Eliel has placed a Gustav Stickley quarter-sawn fumed 
oak server with hand-hammered pulls that was originally meant to be used in a 
small dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop the server are a hammered-copper pot executed at Roycroft Shops, an Arts 
and Crafts candleholder, a hand-colored photograph of Mt. Whitney from the turn 
of the century, a gold-tone image of the redwoods painted on glass and a Dirk 
Van Erp hammered-copper lamp with a parchment-like stained mica shade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lamp was marketed in San Francisco at the turn of the century as a 
boudoir lamp. Its purpose is to create a glow. It's not for any kind of direct 
lighting," Eliel said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall is a watercolor of yellow roses and bees by Paul de Longpre. "He 
is Los Angeles' first noteworthy watercolorist. He was originally from France 
and painted mainly flowers," Eliel said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The home's dining room perhaps best exemplifies the Arts and Crafts movement's 
philosophy, which valued simplicity of style rather than lavish expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is furnished with an oak Stickley table and chairs, a James 
Swinnerton desert painting, a Stickley sideboard, copper owl candelabrum and 
Hampshire art pottery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly I think that some of the Craftsman pieces are too heavy and clunky 
looking for California, so I try to use the simpler pieces and give the rooms a 
more minimalist look," Eliel said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Craftsman pieces, he uses Native American blankets and Spanish 
serapes, which add color, informality and a particularly California feeling to 
the rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Among items in the living room are a plein-air painting of Indian Wells and a 
Gustav Stickley hammered-copper oil lamp that was converted to electric. The 
lamp has a shade made of mineral mica that was crushed and then had resin added 
to it to harden it into a block. The pressed mica was then cut into thin sheets 
with a band saw and fitted into the templates of the shade. 
</P>
<P>
 The couch in the living room was inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, but 
it is a contemporary piece that doubles as a bed for guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Original Stickley furniture can be quite expensive. (In 1988 Barbra Streisand 
paid $363,000 for a 1903 Stickley sideboard, although prices have gone down 
since then.) 
</P>
<P>
 More affordable is new Stickley furniture, which is still manufactured at L. & 
J.G. Stickley Inc. Using the original plans, this New York company continues to 
make the furniture almost the same way it was made at the turn of the century, 
but it sells for a fraction of the cost of an original piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell the difference immediately because we use three guides on each 
drawer, whereas the original ones had one," said Aminy Audi, who bought the 
Stickley Co. with her husband, Alfred, in late 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stickley furniture and the items from the Arts and Crafts movement really 
took off in 1988, and the market continues to grow." Audi said. (The firm's 
furniture is available locally at Homestead House Inc. in Laguna Hills and at 
Baker Knapp & Tubbs at the Design Center South.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's also possible to achieve the pared-down, natural look with items from 
other time periods. Eliel, for example, has combined the Arts and Crafts pieces 
with native textiles that enhance the Craftsman feeling but are highly livable 
and keep the house from looking like a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying principles of the Arts and Crafts movement -- respecting 
nature, conserving materials and getting rid of unnecessary ornamentation -- 
can still make themselves very much at home in California.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Those interested in a closer look at California style can visit the Gamble 
House in Pasadena. Completed in 1908 by the architectural firm of Greene and 
Greene, it is a monument to the Arts and Crafts movement.  
</P>
<P>
 The house at No. 4 Westmoreland Place is open to the public Thursday through 
Sunday, from noon to 3 p.m. Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for seniors, $2 for 
students; under 12 free. Groups of 10 or more need to make advance 
reservations. Call (818) 793-3334.

IT'S THE PEST OF TIMES FOR THE WORST OF APHIDS; ALONG WITH SPRING'S FIRST FLUSH 
OF NEW GROWTH, YOU CAN EXPECT THOSE LITTLE DICKENS TO COME FEASTING ON TENDER 
GREENERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chances are you'll go into the garden one day soon, if you haven't already, 
and find a little army munching on your plants. Along with spring's flush of 
new growth in Southern California often come aphids, which consider young, 
tender foliage a delicacy.  
</P>
<P>
 These voracious critters can devour greenery at an alarming rate and are among 
the most common garden pests. At last count in the United States in the late 
1980s, there were 1,350 species of aphids, says entomologist Nick Nisson of the 
county Agricultural Commission office in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you probably envision a little green predator when you think of 
aphids, there are actually many different colors of aphids found in the back 
yard. Aphids can be pinkish purple, black, brown, red, white, cream-colored and 
brilliant yellow. The good news is that only a tiny fraction of aphids are 
considered pests that will bother plants in your garden, Nisson says.  
</P>
<P>
 The type of aphids most commonly encountered in the back-yard garden are 
small, soft-bodied, stationary insects that congregate at the tips of new 
growth on plants. If you see a gathering of small insects on young, tender 
foliage, there's a good chance they're aphids, Nisson says.  
</P>
<P>
 Some aphids will eat just about any plant, while others are more particular 
about their meals and stick to certain types of vegetation. During their 
lifecycle, aphids often change what they are feeding on and will move to 
different plants as they mature.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the pesky aphid types don't really create a problem if there aren't too 
many of them. Aphids can be an important part of a healthy ecosystem, because 
aphids are food for many "good" insects such as ladybugs and praying mantises, 
says Geoff Smith, a horticulture instructor at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are many larger insects that dine on aphids, the aphids fight 
extinction by reproducing rapidly through parthenogenesis, the development of 
an egg without fertilization. This process allows aphids to create a population 
explosion in a short period of time.  
</P>
<P>
 Problems occur for the back-yard gardener when aphids multiply unchecked and 
begin damaging plants. Most aphids feed on plants by piercing tender foliage 
with a beak and sucking on the plants. Damage from this sucking occurs when the 
leaves, flowers or fruits mature. The scar tissue the aphids created by sucking 
when the plant parts were young causes leaves to tightly curl and wrinkle and 
fruit to become disfigured. While none of this causes long-lasting harm, it can 
make the plant look unsightly long after the aphids have left, Smith says.  
</P>
<P>
 Aphids can also cause serious harm to plants. "Some aphids will carry virus 
diseases from one plant to another, which can kill plants," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 As they eat, aphids also secrete a honeydew onto plant foliage, which creates 
problems. A fungus known as sooty mold will begin growing on and eating the 
honeydew.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sooty mold is very unsightly," says California certified nurseryman and 
master gardener Bohn Dampier, who works at the Nurseryland Garden Center in San 
Juan Capistrano. "It looks like you cleaned out your fireplace and threw the 
ashes on your plant," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 If you notice more than a handful of aphids or sooty mold in your garden, 
experts suggest dealing with the problem immediately -- before the aphids have 
a chance to take hold and do damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Because aphids are generally soft-bodied small insects that often don't fly, 
it's usually fairly easy to get rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the easiest, least expensive ways to deal with them is to spray the 
plants with a strong blast of water, which should knock the aphids off. You 
will have to repeat this procedure several times because aphids often spring 
back. Water is often a chosen method in organic gardening, because it doesn't 
harm other friendly organisms such as bumble bees and ladybugs, Smith says.  
</P>
<P>
 Other mild alternatives include snipping off affected plant parts and spraying 
the plants with a soap solution, which you can buy or make by mixing a mild 
dish-washing soap with water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another nontoxic way to deal with aphids is through the natural process of 
biological control, which refers to introducing aphid predators such as 
ladybugs, praying mantises and green lacewings into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best-known beneficial insect in the garden is the ladybug, which 
is also known as the ladybird beetle. While most often identified as being red 
with black dots, ladybugs can be black, gray, red with no spots and black with 
red spots. One ladybug can eat hundreds of aphids every day, and a ladybug 
larvae eats even more.  
</P>
<P>
 Ladybugs can be purchased at a nursery. It's best to let them out of their 
carton at nightfall, because they are less active when temperatures are cooler 
and more likely to hang around. Let out in the middle of the day, they are more 
apt to fly away.  
</P>
<P>
 The praying mantis is another aphid catcher that can also be purchased at the 
nursery. They come in egg cases containing hundreds of eggs. Hang the egg 
casing on a bush and, when the temperatures warm up, hundreds of quarter-inch 
mantises will hatch. Although they are small when born, they grow quickly. Some 
people prefer praying mantises to ladybugs, because while ladybugs usually 
leave the garden once they're done feasting, praying mantises tend to stick 
around.  
</P>
<P>
 Lacewings can also sometimes be found in the nursery. As adults they eat many 
pests, including aphids, but lacewings are especially good at eating aphids 
when they are in the pupal stage, when they are actually called aphid lions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you use any of the above methods and are still plagued by aphids, chances 
are that you have an army of ants tending to and protecting the aphids.  
</P>
<P>
 The Argentine ant, found locally, loves eating the honeydew that aphids 
produce and will do anything to guard it, including protecting the aphids from 
ladybugs and lacewings. The ants also enable the aphids to make more honeydew 
by herding them, much like we herd cattle, from one plant to another. Some ants 
will even harbor aphid eggs in their nests over the winter to protect them and 
place them back on plants when the weather warms up, Nisson says.  
</P>
<P>
 In order to deal with the ant/aphid connection, you must eliminate the ants' 
access to the plants. This can be done by applying a sticky ant barrier to a 
strip of paper and then encircling the base of the plant, trunk or container 
with this strip.  
</P>
<P>
 Another way to prevent the spread of aphids is to keep weeds in check, because 
many aphids love fast-growing weeds, which are always full of tender tissue.  
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding monoculture planting is another good form of prevention. This refers 
to growing all of the same crop in a concentrated area. In such a situation, 
aphids will move rapidly through the entire crop, Smith says. Instead, it is 
best to interplant with many different plant types, which will tend to stop 
aphids in their tracks.  
</P>
<P>
 Keeping plants healthy is also good protection. Sickly plants are likely aphid 
targets.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; SHARPEN YOUR SKILLS ON FIXING BROKEN PANES 
</P>

<P>
 Replacing a broken pane of window glass is a relatively simple task and, for 
most homeowners, an inevitable one. However, if it's performed carelessly, it 
can result in injury. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the job easier, it's advisable to remove the window sash from the 
frame and repair it on a workbench. Lay the sash on the bench with the exterior 
side up. While wearing heavy-duty work gloves and safety goggles, pull free any 
loose shards of glass from the shattered windowpane. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, remove the old putty from around the pane. If the putty hasn't become 
too hard, you can pry it off with an old chisel or rigid-blade putty knife. 
Otherwise, you'll have to first soften the putty with a heat gun and then 
scrape it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Also remove the glazier's points that you'll find under the old putty stuck 
into the wood sash and muntins. The small metal points secure the window glass 
to the sash. 
</P>
<P>
 After removing the old putty, pull free all of the remaining glass from the 
broken pane. Now scrape down the sash and muntin rabbets to the bare wood using 
a chisel held perpendicular to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Apply a liberal coat of linseed oil to clean the rabbets with a small brush. 
The linseed oil will prevent the bare wood from absorbing any oil out of the 
new glazing putty. Oil in the glazing putty helps keep the putty flexible and 
crack-free longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although glass cutting is very easy, if you'd rather, you can custom-order 
pre-cut glass from most hardware stores and glass shops. 
</P>
<P>
 It you do it yourself, cut the pane from single-strength glass with a standard 
glass cutter. Measure the opening and subtract one-eighth inch from the overall 
width and length. 
</P>
<P>
 Nail a straightedge board to the workbench and butt the replacement glass 
against it. Lubricate the cut line with kerosene and, while using a framing 
square as a guide, score the glass with the cutter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing gloves and goggles, hold the glass with the cut line on the edge of 
the bench. Push down firmly and the glass will break cleanly on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 After your glass is cut to size, apply a one-eighth-inch-thick bead of glazing 
compound (not putty) in the rabbets around the opening. Compound is preferred 
over putty because it doesn't dry brittle and it resists cracking and 
shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Position the pane in the opening and press down gently to eliminate any air 
pockets that may appear in the compound. Then, using a rigid-blade putty knife, 
push glazier's points in the rabbets to secure the glass. Space the points 
about four inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll glazing compound between your hands to form three-eighths-inch-diameter 
ropes. Lay the ropes around the edges of the pane and press them into place 
with your fingers. Be sure to conceal all of the glazier's points. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a flexible-blade putty knife, compress the compound to form a smooth, 
triangular-shaped bead. Clean off the excess compound from both sides of the 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow the compound to dry for about a week before repainting it. Then apply 
the paint so that it extends about one-sixteenth inch onto the glass to form a 
moisture seal. This little trick will help to protect the compound and seal the 
glass from excessive moisture.

GARDENING; SOME ROSES SING PRAISES OF COUNTRY MUSIC LEGENDS

<P>
 Many entertainers have sung about roses, but now there's a new twist: roses 
named for country stars.  
</P>
<P>
 Hybrid tea roses have been named in honor of Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline and 
Lynn Anderson, whose recording of "Rose Garden" has sold more than 16 million 
copies since its release in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Nashville Rose Society asked Lynn Anderson to select a new rose to be 
named in her honor, she chose a white rose with raspberry edging. Tired of 
life's prickly side, Anderson says, "I personally requested mine have no 
thorns. It's absolutely incredible to be in the same 'bouquet' with the women 
that have earned this honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnie Pearl was the first country star to have a rose named in her honor. Her 
miniature rose made its debut in 1982 at an American Rose Society national 
convention in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Other miniature roses also have been named after country music legends Barbara 
Mandrell and Brenda Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolly Parton rose fits her well, says its breeder, Joe Winchel. "It's the 
color of Dolly's lipstick," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has big blooms, lots of perfume, excellent form and it likes the hot 
weather."

 Environmentally correct products and new mechanical devices promise to make 
lawn care a little easier this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latest yard goods are a natural garlic spray that repels insects; a 
copper tape that gives snails and slugs a little electric buzz to keep them off 
plants and trees; Teflon barrier tape or spray that keeps insects at bay, and a 
nontoxic lure to attract pest-eating ladybugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tool department, a new mower attachment lets you fertilize as you mow, 
and a super-powered vacuum/blower picks up everything from aluminum cans to wet 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Insects, Take This: Garlic Barrier Insect Repellent, distributed by Garlic 
Research Labs, smells when first sprayed on plants and trees, but the odor 
lingers only a few minutes. But insects can apparently still smell it -- and 
don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to spray before infestation, says Bill Anderson of the Los 
Angeles firm. The repellent doesn't kill bugs; it discourages them from 
attacking treated plants. "The garlic spray is absorbed by the plant and when 
whiteflies come by, they will go on to the neighbor's," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic Barrier, available in garden centers nationwide, is made from garlic 
oil and water and biodegrades rapidly. It's harmless to people, pets and ground 
water. Just mix one part repellent to 10 parts water and spray plants, 
including vegetables, fruit trees and vine crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Garlic Barrier can be found at Armstrong's garden stores. A pint is 
$9.95; quart, $16.95. It also comes in large drums for agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Jolt of This: SureFire Products, manufactured by Consep Inc. in Bend, 
Ore., is introducing three new bug barriers without pesticides. Two consist of 
adhesive-backed tapes, the third is a spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Due out next month is Slug & Snail Copper Barrier Tape, a 15-foot roll of 1 
1/2-inch copper tape that gives off a minor electrical charge. It can be placed 
around trees, plants, planters, patio furniture, raised flowers and garden 
beds. The tape surface should be kept clean with an occasional wiping. 
</P>
<P>
 Already on garden store shelves nationwide are Teflon Insect Barrier Tape and 
Teflon Insect Barrier Spray. Each creates a surface too slippery for insects to 
climb. The two-inch tape comes in a 30-foot roll for use on trees, bird 
feeders, trash cans, doghouses, etc. The spray, in a two-ounce can, may be 
applied to dog or cat food dishes to keep out ants and other crawling insects. 
</P>
<P>
 If either the tape or the sprayed object gets wet, it is ineffective until it 
dries. Fortunately, both seem to dry quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggested retail price for the copper tape, the Teflon tape and the spray 
is $6.99 each. The copper tape will be sold at True Value hardware stores. The 
Teflon products are available at True Value and Ace Hardware outlets and 
selected lawn and garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling All Ladybugs: SureFire has renamed its Bug Charm lures -- now Ladybug 
Lures -- but they still attract beneficial bugs to the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 According to K. Curt Rymer, director of consumer products for Consep Inc., the 
lures are designed to release a synthesized chemical simulating the scent of 
aphids. Ladybugs and other aphid-eaters pick up the scent from the lure, which 
hangs on a tree branch, and hang out in the area. One lure lasts about two to 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladybug Lures, three to a box, cost $6.99 and can be found at lawn and garden 
and hardware stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow Time: Mulching mowers, the kind that return lawn clippings to the turf, 
have been out for several years. Now, Toro has introduced an accessory, the Mow 
and Feed Fertilizer Spreader, that simultaneously mows and fertilizes. 
</P>
<P>
 A plastic hopper mounts on the handlebars of Toro or Lawn-Boy mowers, and the 
rear mower wheels power the spreader. A clutch system automatically stops the 
flow of fertilizer when the mowers stops or backs up. The hopper is lightweight 
(about 10 pounds) and holds enough fertilizer to cover 8,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mow and Feed, with a suggested retail price of about $50, is available 
nationwide at Toro or Lawn-Boy dealers or at Home Depot stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A Real Blowhard: Gator Vac, a vacuum/blower from Weed Eater, is some cleaner. 
It can pick up pine cones, aluminum cans and wet leaves along with grass and 
hedge clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-pound Gator Vac, with a long green gator-like snout, converts from a 
blower to a vac with the twist of a dial, requiring no tools or additional 
parts. Debris is sucked into a transparent, bottom-mounted collection bag so 
the operator can easily see when it is full. The bag snaps on and off for easy 
emptying. 
</P>
<P>
 The vac/blower has a 1.5-horsepower electric motor and may be used with an 
extension cord up to 100 feet. It also comes with a detachable shoulder 
harness. 
</P>
<P>
 Gator Vac, with a suggested retail price of $89.99, is available nationally at 
all Weed Eater dealers, Wal-Mart, Coast to Coast and True Value hardware 
stores.

 It's your choice: turn left to see "America's Most Unwanted Painting." Turn 
right for "America's Most Wanted Painting." 
</P>
<P>
 The two options are being presented by Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid in 
their "People's Choice" show at the Alternative Museum in Manhattan. The 
installation reflects the two Russian emigre artists' attempt to answer a 
simple question: What kind of art do the American people want? 
</P>
<P>
 Komar and Melamid used an authentic, above-board polling service to find out. 
The Boston-based research firm of Marttila & Kiley, whose clients have included 
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the American Civil Liberties Union and the 
NFL Players Assn., tabulated the aesthetic preferences of 1,001 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the average American living room. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular painting won't clash with the couch, provided blue is 
somewhere in the color scheme. Since blue was voted the most popular color -- 
by 44% of those surveyed -- it is fitting that a powder-blue VIP carpet leads 
up to the Most Wanted painting, which is kept at a respectful distance by a 
blue velvet security rope. 
</P>
<P>
 By popular demand, America's Most Wanted Painting is a bucolic, restful scene, 
with mountains in the distance, a lake in the foreground, George Washington and 
the Native Americana walking along the shore, deer cooling off in the calm 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for historic figures was substantial, enough (56% of all voters) 
for Komar and Melamid to include Washington, clothed, thank you very much (68% 
prefer non-nude subjects). It's a restful scene, as 77% agree that art should 
be relaxing to look at. (Kind of like a Norman Rockwell painting. Rockwell 
scored highest in popularity. Despite Hollywood's recent interest in filming 
the life of Jackson Pollock, that artist was the favorite of a mere 4% of those 
surveyed.) All in all, it is an uplifting tableau, by popular demand; 60% of 
all respondents said "yes" to the statement: "I only want to look at art that 
makes me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can't please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even from a distance, I knew it was George Washington, and I find that 
disturbing," said Brian Keith Jackson, a young writer. "This painting is so 
dull, so predictable. It's like something you could buy at K mart." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson preferred America's Most Unwanted Painting. "It has an evasive quality 
that allows me to determine what it is. It's not all spelled out." 
</P>
<P>
 America's Most Unwanted Painting hangs in a much simpler room, with no rope, 
no American flag, no carpet and on a backdrop composed of America's least 
favorite colors: gold, orange, peach and teal. All orangy edges, inscrutable, 
it looks like an abstract painting of a burnt macaroni and cheese dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 A journalist from Russian television stands before the Most Unwanted Painting, 
microphone in hand, addressing her camera crew, interviewing Lea 
Checroni-Freid, director of Arts and Media programs for Citizen Exchange 
Council, who serves as a liaison between American and Russian artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Americans like abstract paintings," she says. "Because abstract 
paintings are not emotional enough for them. I think Americans are obsessed 
with decorative work, with kitsch, with things that have emotional ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Komar and Melamid do it the best because they're from Russia," she says, then 
reconsiders. "Actually, it should be larger." (Sorry, survey says only 44% of 
Americans prefer large paintings.) 
</P>
<P>
 Taking an additional poke at data-frenzied Americans, Komar and Melamid 
constructed life-size graph sticks for the show, standing multicolored pieces 
of wood in column rows, laying pie charts down on the floor in colorful wood 
wedges. (Gallery revelers watched as Melamid's wife, Katia, picked up one of 
the pie chart slices and handed it to a delighted infant.) 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate the evening's most favored color, Komar, Melamid and the gallery 
owners wore blue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had discussions for years about doing the show," says a navy-suited Andres 
Perchuk, the Alternative Museum's curator. "We were going to split the gallery 
into sections reflecting the opinions of America's various socioeconomic 
sectors. But amazingly, the survey showed that Americans have pretty much the 
same tastes, across the board. Plus Alex Melamid said that Americans want to 
see the painting, not a series of paintings. That would be too complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Lest Komar and Melamid suffer financially on this limited edition project, 
Komar says he has a plan. "We are going to do this same study in England, in 
Germany and many other countries," he said with a chuckle. "And then we'll 
repeat this experiment in America all over again, five years from now. Tastes 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 The "People's Choice" exhibition will continue through April 23 at the 
Alternative Museum in Manhattan.

HOME MAINTENANCE; TO KEEP A REFRIGERATOR HUMMING ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's natural to ignore a refrigerator. It sits, humming quietly from time to 
time, keeping its cool. But a neglected refrigerator often runs poorly and is 
unsanitary, and a breakdown can be a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how to give your appliance the periodic care it needs: 
</P>
<P>
 Wash the outside weekly to keep it from becoming so dirty that it is difficult 
to clean. Use an all-purpose spray cleaner or, for heavy cleaning, dissolve 
1/4-cup of automatic-dishwasher detergent in a gallon of hot water. Wear rubber 
gloves to avoid irritating your skin. Sponge with clear water to rinse. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut through sticky, greasy dust that sometimes accumulates on top of a 
refrigerator, mix one part household ammonia with 10 parts hot water. Leave the 
solution on the surface for about 10 minutes to break down the grease, then 
wipe it away with paper towels. Consider applying a coat of appliance wax to 
make cleaning easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Once or twice a year, clean the condenser coils located either behind or 
underneath the refrigerator. Dirty coils interfere with cooling and cause the 
refrigerator to run longer than it should. 
</P>
<P>
 First unplug the refrigerator. Pull it away from the wall if the coils are in 
the back or remove the front grille beneath the door if the coils are 
underneath. Vacuum the coils if you can reach them; otherwise, dust them with a 
dampened sock slipped over the end of a yardstick and secured with a rubber 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 To remove odors and spills inside a refrigerator, wash surfaces with a 
solution of one tablespoon baking soda in a quart of warm water. Regularly 
clean the drain system in a self-defrosting refrigerator. To do this, remove 
the plug from the drain hole under the bottom drawers and in the freezer, 
insert a piece of stiff wire to unclog the drain and then flush the system with 
hot water from a basting syringe. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, slide the drain pan out from beneath the refrigerator. Wash it and 
sprinkle it with baking soda before sliding it back into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Defrost a refrigerator when ice in the freezer is a quarter-inch thick. Never 
scrape ice with a sharp utensil that can damage surfaces; instead, wait for the 
ice to melt and use a dull plastic windshield scraper. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rubber gasket on a refrigerator door does not seal tightly, first make 
sure the refrigerator is level and that the door does not sag. To level a 
refrigerator, prop it up in front with a wood block; turn the roller-adjustment 
screws or the leveling legs to alter their length, then remove the block. 
</P>
<P>
 To adjust a sagging door, remove any cap from the hinge at the top, then use a 
nut driver or screwdriver to loosen the hinge screws. Reposition the door and 
have someone hold it in place while you tighten the screws. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gasket still leaks or is torn, replace it promptly to avoid overworking 
the refrigerator motor and creating excessive frost. Buy an exact 
manufacturer's duplicate gasket and soak it in warm water for a few minutes to 
soften it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unplug the refrigerator and loosen the screws across part of the top and the 
upper half of a side. (Do not loosen all the screws at once; if you do, the 
door may come apart.) Pull the loosened part of the old gasket out of the way 
and attach the new one by pushing its lip under the metal retainer and 
tightening the screws. 
</P>
<P>
 Replace the other top corner section and then the bottom half of the gasket 
the same way. Close the door and check your work. If necessary, readjust the 
door to correct any warp.

GARDENING; EASY WAYS TO GIVE AN EDGE TO LANDSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A well-manicured yard is a pleasure to look at, but it takes a lot of work. 
So, most of us opt for a simple landscape that we can keep in shape without 
daily care. 
</P>
<P>
 One easy way to give a crisp look to lawn and planting beds is to make a clear 
separation between them with edging. Edging helps keep creeping plants in place 
and defines planting areas even when plants are dormant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunk so that its top surface is nearly flush with the ground, it serves as a 
lawn-mower base. You can wheel your mower over it and eliminate hand-trimming. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many different types of edging made of wood or masonry. Although it 
cannot be used as a lawn-mower base, strip-edging of metal or plastic combined 
with a bed of tree bark or stone aggregate also looks neat and requires minimal 
maintenance. In selecting an edging material, weigh appearance, cost and ease 
of installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood-edging is a very easy material to install. Redwood is the most readily 
available wood that is naturally decay resistant. When wood is in contact with 
the ground, use all-heart redwood (solid colored with no light streaks of 
sapwood in it). All-heart cedar is also naturally decay resistant, although it 
may be a little more difficult to find in lumberyards. 
</P>
<P>
 To install 2x4 edging, first drive stakes into the ground at each end of your 
run. Then, stretch a string taut between the stakes for use as a guide in 
excavating. Use a straight spade to cut a 5 1/2-inch deep, clean-sided trench. 
Shovel in a two-inch bed of sand. 
</P>
<P>
 This helps level the edging. Install 2x4s, top edge flush with the ground, and 
secure them with 1x2x18-inch stakes positioned every four feet. Nail to the 
edging with hot-dipped, galvanized nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Softwood timbers that have been pressure-treated with preservative make 
excellent edging. Be sure to get stock designated for ground-contact use, as 
not all treated wood serves this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Sink large wood timbers directly into the ground or on a two-inch bed of sand. 
To determine your needs, multiply length by width by depth in feet or fractions 
of a foot to work out the number of cubic feet of sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Log rounds, cut two or more inches thick and four inches in diameter, make a 
rustic edging that can be used as a mower base when embedded in the ground, and 
larger rounds can serve as a raised border. 
</P>
<P>
 Masonry edging such as brick, tile, stone or concrete does not rot like wood 
and can be installed in much the same way or cast in place. If you plan curved 
lines, lay them out with a garden hose to see how they will look before digging 
the installation trench. Masonry edging should also be installed on a bed of 
sand or, in wet areas, on sand laid over a two-inch bed of gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brick is the most commonly used masonry edging. Install bricks flat on a 
two-inch bed of sand over two inches of gravel. Make the trench 6 1/4 inches 
deep so the top of the bricks will be flush with the grade level.

COLUMN ONE; REWARDS OF JOINING FORCES; AFTER YEARS OF ISOLATION, THE SERVICES 
LEARN TO WORK TOGETHER. AIR FORCE PILOTS TRAIN ON NAVY SHIPS. THE CENTRAL 
COMMAND GAINS CLOUT. 'JOINTNESS' CUTS COSTS AND MAY AVERT SUCH GAFFES AS FAILED 
'79 HOSTAGE RESCUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Usually the nerve center of this cavernous warship is strictly a Navy affair. 
Naval officers and enlisted personnel bend over their radar screens, straining 
to keep tabs on nearby ships. They leave bombing to the Air Force and 
ground-fighting to the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this deployment -- a special four-service training exercise off the 
North Carolina coast -- all that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the sailors, the ship's computer-filled air-control center is crammed 
with Army, Air Force and Marine Corps officers. And the Mt. Whitney has become 
a command post for coordinating everything from high-level bombing raids to 
tank and artillery attacks on a make-believe Third World country. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes are becoming common as the four armed services, whose isolation 
and rivalries once were legendary, turn more to integrated operations as a key 
to survival in the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates say that "jointness" -- the Pentagon's catch-phrase for such 
interservice collaboration -- uses defense dollars more efficiently, improves 
the effectiveness of military operations and avoids some of the planning and 
communications gaffes that led to earlier fiascos such as the attempt to rescue 
U.S. hostages from Iran in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the concept has become deeply imbedded in today's military. "It's 
the new way of doing business," says Capt. Tom Scolarici, a 33-year-old Air 
Force tanker pilot who is serving as fuel-delivery coordinator aboard the Mt. 
Whitney. "We're all working as part of a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Snider, a former Army colonel now at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington, agrees. "The military is much more joint 
than it was even a few years ago," he says. "It's becoming deeply accepted by 
officers at all ranks." 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution includes these developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Joint Chiefs of Staff, once merely a forum for the heads of the four 
services, now runs the entire military. Its chairman, who is the principal 
military adviser to the President, may present his own views without reflecting 
those of individual services. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pentagon's Joint Staff, which hammers out doctrine for all four 
services, has evolved into the most influential staff organization in the 
military. Including the Joint Staff, there are 9,100 joint billets throughout 
the military and no officer can make general or admiral without serving in one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joint doctrine -- how to operate in conjunction with other services -- is 
part of the curriculum at all the military and naval command and staff 
colleges. And the services are working together to develop aircraft, missiles 
and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than ever, the military is organized into joint commands, in which 
elements of all four services take orders from a single admiral or general. And 
almost every major combat action is a joint operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last summer, the Pentagon established a joint U.S. Atlantic Command, 
designed to train, package and deploy U.S.-based forces from all services for 
overseas operations including Somalia and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Paul David Miller, who is in charge of the operation, has already 
proposed restructuring U.S. military forces overseas using "adaptive joint 
force packaging" -- in which units from all services are assigned to joint task 
forces to be ready for action at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The change has been dramatic. Former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, who 
served in the Defense Department in the 1960s as one of then-Secretary Robert 
S. McNamara's whiz kids, says that jointness has significantly improved the 
quality of the Pentagon's military staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that all the hot-shots from the services never went into a 
joint assignment because it was looked (upon) as a sidetrack," Aspin says. But 
today "the quality of people on the Joint Staff is a lot higher now than it 
was. . . . (It's) a very impressive pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Military experts say that the change has come for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Army Col. C. Kenneth Allard, a strategist at the National War College, says 
that the advent of sophisticated technology "has speeded up the pace of combat 
operations and blurred the differences among the individual services." 
</P>
<P>
 An example: The new J-Stars aerial reconnaissance system uses an Air Force 
plane equipped with state-of-the-art electronics to pinpoint enemy vehicles and 
armor for Army ground troops and Navy ships. All three services must know the 
others' needs and use compatible gear. 
</P>
<P>
 * Budget cuts and force reductions are prodding each of the services to share 
its workload, rather than using large parts of its budget to perform tasks that 
the other services can do. 
</P>
<P>
 * Congress has been explicitly pressuring the services toward more jointness. 
It passed legislation in 1986 elevating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs to be 
the de facto head of the entire military. The trend has intensified steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, lessons learned from previous snafus have prompted the services to 
make their operations more compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Vietnam War, Navy and Air Force warplanes often crossed signals -- 
and complicated entire operations -- because they were under separate commands 
that acted autonomously. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert One, former President Jimmy Carter's disastrous effort in 1979 to 
rescue U.S. hostages in Iran, failed largely because the equipment, doctrine 
and training that each of the four services used were not compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine helicopter pilots were not accustomed to working with Army special 
forces hostage-rescue teams. And the refusal of the services to combine the 
operation left important gaps in planning that doomed the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 During the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983, Army and Marine ground forces 
were under separate commands and used different communication equipment so were 
were unable to communicate with each other. That led to delays -- and excessive 
U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there'd been real opposition, we'd have had a disaster," one officer says. 
</P>
<P>
 And during the Persian Gulf War in 1992, the Navy found that its computers and 
communications equipment were not compatible with those used by the Air Force, 
effectively preventing its aircraft carriers from receiving daily air tasking 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the elaborate daily air operations plan, drawn up by the Air 
Force each day and distributed to the other services, had to be flown to Navy 
aircraft carriers by special messenger plane -- at considerable effort and 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Desert One debacle really blew up in our faces," says Robert W. Gaskin, a 
former Air Force strategist. Special operations for all four services now are 
under a single command. 
</P>
<P>
 Military personnel in joint billets now even have their own nickname. They are 
called "purple-suiters" -- an allusion to a mix of Army and Marine Corps green 
and Air Force and Navy blue. (Fortunately, one officer says, no one actually 
has to wear a purple uniform.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the push toward more cooperation has not been easy. To begin with, 
each of the services is deeply imbued with its own cultural mores. In the Navy, 
for example, a ship captain has far more autonomy than his Air Force or Army 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 And strategists say that the armed services need to retain some of their 
interservice rivalry to help build spirit and morale. "To a certain degree, you 
want to instill that," says retired Adm. David Jeremiah, former vice chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how far the services have come can be seen in one of the joint training 
exercises for which the Mt. Whitney serves as floating command headquarters.  
</P>
<P>
 The situation: A Third World government has been toppled, and the local 
capital is in chaos. The U.S. military's mission is to secure the city and 
restore the rightfully elected administration to power. 
</P>
<P>
 As the operation begins, heavily camouflaged soldiers from the Army's joint 
special-operations task force scout the potential battlefield. Three days 
later, B-52s from the 12th Air Force make long-range bombing runs to soften up 
enemy positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, members of the 75th Ranger Regiment from Ft. Benning, Ga., 
launch a parachute assault to seize the country's major airport and seaport, 
followed 30 minutes later by the 18th Airborne Corps from Ft. Bragg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, infantrymen from the 28th Marine Expeditionary Unit make an 
amphibious landing on nearby "Blue Beach" -- actually a neighboring island. 
Over the next three days, the Army and Marines link up in a joint assault and 
evacuate key civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 20,500 soldiers, sailors, Air Force personnel and Marines take 
part -- along with about 400 aircraft, 17 ships and dozens of tanks and armored 
vehicles. The Mt. Whitney carries three Navy admirals and four generals -- two 
Army, one Air Force and one Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Adm. William J. Flanagan Jr., who served as commander of Joint Task Force 
140, which conducted the operation, says that exercises such as this are 
rapidly becoming standard. "The key is in putting packages together that make 
sense," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Col. David Hall, a 45-year-old B-1 bomber pilot now on his third 
such exercise aboard the Mt. Whitney, says that joint operations give members 
of one service a keener appreciation of the problems and capabilities of the 
others -- a must for combat operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force and Navy, for example, have had to overcome differences in 
everything from doctrine to operating procedures. Even the acronyms -- the 
alphabet-soup of names given to organizational divisions and nomenclature -- 
are different. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes about two days to get that common language down and trust each 
other," Hall concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaskin, a major force behind the entry of the Air Force into joint operations, 
recalls commanding a joint military operation in which he was searching for 
ways to mark infantry positions for air support when a Marine volunteered that 
his unit would be able to do it from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never imagined they had that capability," says Gaskin, who is now a vice 
president of Business Executives for National Security, a research group. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, jointness has its limits. Except for the joint exercises and a few of 
the more senior billets, the individual armed services undertake day-to-day 
training and exercises largely on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cooperation at the top, interservice rivalry remains alive as the 
services vie ever more intensely for declining defense dollars. "There's no 
love lost among us at budget time," one top admiral concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the U.S. military still is a long way from the total unification that 
Canada tried in the 1970s, when it essentially combined its armed services 
under a single command and rank structure and a single (forest green) uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that Canada's experiment fizzled because it undermined the 
specialization that had been the core of each service's effectiveness and 
because it shattered the professional cohesion that had kept esprit de corps 
high. The move was abandoned in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are those who object that U.S.-style jointness has already gone 
too far. Some officers argue that the hours spent on jointness come out of the 
time that each service has to train and equip for its own individual mission. 
</P>
<P>
 They also warn that taking on some of the role traditionally played by another 
service can give a unit a false belief that it can do that service's job as 
well. "People can get the impression that they can do things that they really 
aren't prepared for," one critic says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Atlantic Command's experiment with "adaptive force packages" ran 
into trouble earlier this year as battle groups carefully deployed with the 
precise mix of personnel and equipment to handle one set of problems found 
themselves ill-prepared to deal with others. 
</P>
<P>
 Many military planners say that such difficulties are all part of the growing 
pains that inevitably occur when any new concept is tried. And those who have 
had the opportunity to serve in a joint billet seem to emerge convinced that 
"jointness" is worthwhile and probably the way of the future for the post-Cold 
War military. 
</P>
<P>
 Military analysts say that jointness is only at about a third of its full 
potential. There is room for more joint staffing and more interservice 
expertise about other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaskin, for one, believes that much will depend on the military's new role 
after the Cold War. If future operations turn out to involve mainly regional 
conflicts, as is expected, "jointness" will spread. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept may also be propelled by the growing pressure to revamp the roles 
and missions assigned to the individual services to help eliminate duplication 
and eventually save money. The services are already gearing up to merge their 
basic flight-training schools into a single operation, and they are studying 
other ways to consolidate operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a new, independent commission began looking for more ways that the 
services can pool their resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Air Force Capt. Brent Baysinger, a 27-year-old B-1 bomber pilot -- 
is learning more about the Navy than he cares to. Like many of the officers 
visiting from other services (and like some naval personnel as well), he got 
seasick when the Mt. Whitney left port.

PARTIAL FISHING BAN IMPOSED TO SAVE SALMON

 Hoping to ensure that enough salmon survive to perpetuate the species, a 
federal agency Friday banned salmon fishing off Washington state for the first 
time and imposed tough limits on commercial and recreational fishing off 
California and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the Pacific Fishery Management Council places the strictest 
limits ever on salmon fishing off the West Coast. The salmon population is in 
steep decline because of the steady degradation of its freshwater habitat.  
</P>
<P>
 The council, which is responsible for overseeing the West Coast fishing 
industry, said the chief reason for the decline of salmon is the destruction of 
spawning grounds -- in some cases hundreds of miles from the ocean. But the 
agency is powerless to protect salmon except by limiting fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishing is not the primary cause of the decline, and (restricting fishing) is 
not the answer to rebuilding," said Larry Six, executive director of the 
council. "The actions we take here are only a small measure and one that by 
itself will not do the job to restore these stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, the fishing restrictions will go largely unnoticed, because 
salmon farming and the salmon catch in other parts of the world will continue 
to supply California markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision comes nearly two decades after fishermen and 
environmentalists began urging protection of salmon's inland spawning grounds 
and predicting that the West Coast's multimillion-dollar commercial fishery 
would be lost if action was not taken. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the salmon fishing industry from Morro Bay to Eureka is facing 
collapse, with many fishermen predicting that they will be unable to make a 
living from the limited season adopted by the council Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, 13 members of California's congressional delegation urged 
President Clinton to provide emergency aid to fishing communities that have 
been devastated by the decline in salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 And the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees the survival of 
marine species, is considering whether to list the coho salmon as endangered, 
which could lead to changes in water use and logging practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year a dwindling number of salmon are hatched in freshwater streams 
throughout the West. The young fish, or fry, swim downstream to the ocean. 
Several years later, at the end of their lives, the salmon return to spawn in 
the same streams in which they hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Pacific Fishery Management Council has concluded that 
salmon are jeopardized primarily by human activities on land: construction of 
hydroelectric dams, diversion of streams and rivers, logging, ranching, mining, 
pollution, road construction and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Dams have blocked the migration of salmon upstream. Gravel beds where the fish 
spawn have been smothered in silt. Diversion of water to agriculture and cities 
has reduced the flow of rivers and caused water temperatures to rise to levels 
that are lethal to salmon eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't keep destroying rivers and forests and have salmon," said Zeke 
Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's 
Assns. "We've been telling them for the past 18 years this was going to happen. 
Now it's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The only major river system producing enough salmon to provide much of a 
fishing season is the Sacramento River, which has been plagued by a dwindling 
salmon population. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sacramento River species -- the winter-run chinook salmon -- is critically 
endangered, but hatcheries on the river have produced enough salmon to allow a 
limited harvest this year outside San Francisco Bay and to the south. As a 
result, recreational fishing will be permitted all season from the Mexican 
border to Point Arena, 100 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sacramento's not at the peak of production by any means, but compared to 
the disastrous situation we find elsewhere, it's about the only bright spot," 
Six said.  
</P>
<P>
 The council's action, which is expected to be ratified by Secretary of 
Commerce Ron Brown, for the first time prohibits commercial fishing for coho or 
silver salmon anywhere off the West Coast. It also restricts fishing for other 
types of salmon to a much shorter season to protect fish that are returning to 
spawn. The restrictions vary along different sections of the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the northern coast of California, for example, commercial salmon fishing 
is restricted to August and September. South of San Francisco, such salmon 
fishing is prohibited during most of June and all of July -- the heart of the 
season for some fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 State governments usually model their fishing restrictions for inland waters 
on the council's action. As a result, restrictions on river fishing are likely 
to match the coastal limits. 
</P>
<P>
 During Friday's hearing, commercial and recreational fishermen appealed for 
action to save the salmon habitat and to preserve as much of this year's salmon 
season as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Novak, representing fishermen from Morro Bay, said this year's 
restrictions will cut their commercial harvest in half, putting many of the 100 
boats harbored there out of business. "It's going to be economic disaster," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ft. Bragg's Noyo Harbor, fishermen anticipating the restrictions have been 
selling off seaworthy boats for as little as $1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishermen are struggling just as surely as the salmon are struggling for 
survival," Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah) told the council.

 Over the objections of its own experts and outraged environmentalists, the 
Southland's air quality board Friday adopted an industry-authored version of a 
measure designed to protect residential neighborhoods from fumes linked to 
cancer and other serious health dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote by the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
culminated nine months of acrimonious debate and delays over how stringently to 
control toxic chemicals that industries release into Southern California's air. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came despite a stern warning from the AQMD staff that the 
downscaled measure "will result in risk reduction for very few people" and 
admonishments from environmentalists that the public would be better off with 
no regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dark day for public health and unfortunately a very bright day for 
toxic emitters," said Dennis Zane, executive director of the Coalition for 
Clean Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Most AQMD board members said they are not convinced that the health risk to 
people inhaling the chemicals is great enough to justify the high cost of more 
stringent controls. A staff-written measure rejected Friday by the AQMD board 
would have been 10 times more protective of public health but would have cost 
industries at least $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd cause more economic damage with our good intentions than we would 
benefit public health," AQMD board member Stephen Albright said of the tougher 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland industries -- battered by the recession and subject to some of the 
nation's most stringent smog rules -- hailed the vote as a prudent move, given 
the scientific uncertainty of cancer risk from toxic chemicals. Los Angeles 
attorney Robert Wyman, who represents four aerospace firms and several oil 
companies, said the new regulation "strikes the right balance" between 
protecting public health and the economy. More stringent controls might have 
driven businesses out of the region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the regulation, if the health risk in a community exceeds a certain 
threshold for cancer and other diseases, a company must alter its manufacturing 
techniques to reduce emissions of benzene, chromium, arsenic and 114 other 
chemicals. Companies have five years to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to set the threshold was what stirred up so much debate and anxiety. The 
AQMD board is required by state law to reduce toxic air pollution, but the law 
gives it great leeway in deciding how much risk is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The program adopted Friday will affect only companies posing the most severe 
health risk. An estimated 250 businesses -- ranging from aerospace concerns to 
metal-plating shops -- in the four counties will be affected. About 7,000 
businesses were targeted in the AQMD's original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD estimates that the new rule will cost the 250 industries $1.2 million 
a year, about one-eighth as much as the tougher proposal. Industry officials 
say the cost will be 10 times higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling toxic emissions produced by industries has been one of the most 
volatile issues faced by the AQMD in recent years. It delayed making its 
decision on five occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they could not reach agreement with the AQMD staff, several major 
industries decided to craft their own plans. The standard approved Friday was 
written by aerospace companies, including Northrop, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas 
and Hughes Aircraft and oil refineries such as Chevron and Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year industries in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties emit an estimated 68 million pounds of pollutants into the air that 
have been linked by medical experts to cancer, birth defects and other serious 
diseases. The AQMD estimates that more than 10,000 residents of the four-county 
region will develop cancer in their lifetimes as a result of exposure to air 
toxics from industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the largest emitters are in Los Angeles County, mainly the 
Wilmington-Carson and Burbank areas, which have large numbers of industrial 
plants close to residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials say the regulation will reduce industrial air pollution for 
about 70,000 people living in toxic hot spots in the four counties. Another 1.3 
million residents who are exposed to a risk many health experts deem 
significant remain unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
 Most state and federal pollution regulations are based on a standard that 
allows between one and 10 cancer cases among every 1 million people. The new 
AQMD standard is 100 cancer cases in every 1 million people. The U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency has generally considered that level "an 
unacceptable risk" when setting most rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rule does favor big business, AQMD Executive Officer James Lents said 
after Friday's vote. "I do think the board has become extra-sensitive to the 
economy. We've certainly been beat up enough about that issue and that is being 
reflected in their decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lents said the action was better than none at all because people living 
near the largest sources of toxic pollution will get some protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental activists charged that the air quality board is creating "human 
sacrifice zones." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the weakest standard in the country for air toxics. It is sending the 
wrong message, and the public needs to know they are not being protected," said 
Gail Feuer, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is worse than nothing," she said, "because this will be held up as a 
model for other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the board's debate focused on the inexact science of estimating the 
health risk of toxic pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming up with the estimates, actual cases of cancer are not counted. 
Instead, the assessments reflect the odds of cancer based largely on what is 
known about workers who use toxic chemicals and laboratory experiments on 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD Board member Norton Younglove said he was "very, very nervous" about 
imposing a costly rule grounded on risk assessments that are "not based on the 
real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Although three board members -- Marvin Braude, Leonard Paulitz and S. Roy 
Wilson -- favored a more stringent rule, they voted with the majority after 
failing to persuade the eight other members. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the standard set by the board "way out of line," Braude said "the 
public generally will look at this as not a serious effort to face up to the 
problem."

GRUNGE ROCK'S KURT COBAIN DIES IN APPARENT SUICIDE; TRAGEDY: A SHOTGUN BLAST TO 
THE HEAD CLAIMS LEADER OF NIRVANA. HE WAS SEEN AS VOICE OF A GENERATION ADRIFT. 
</P>

<P>
 Kurt Cobain, who with his band Nirvana shaped modern rock music from the 
restless alienation of today's youth, was found dead Friday, an apparent 
suicide from a shotgun blast to the head. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's body was found about 8:30 a.m. by an electrician at the musician's 
Seattle home. Authorities said he had been dead about a day; the Seattle 
medical examiner confirmed Cobain's death. 
</P>
<P>
 A single-page suicide note was found next to the body. Authorities would not 
release its contents, but the electrician, in an interview with KNBC-TV news, 
said that the note was covered in dirt from a potted plant and written in 
ballpoint pen -- ending with the words: "I love you, I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after learning of Cobain's death, fans in this town -- 
which he helped propel into the vanguard of '90s rock 'n' roll -- gathered 
outside the home to mourn. A steady drizzle fell from chilly gray skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's death came while he was struggling with drug use and the kind of 
deep, personal turmoil that made his music so gripping to his generation. Just 
last month, Cobain was hospitalized in Rome in a drug-and-alcohol induced coma. 
And this week Nirvana pulled out of a headliner's spot in the upcoming national 
"Lollapalooza '94" tour amid reports that the band was breaking up and concerns 
about his health. 
</P>
<P>
 With his shaggy blond hair and slight physique, Cobain brought his style of 
edgy, blasting, rock known as grunge into the mainstream of pop music -- and 
his influence spread into the trendy fashion of shabby flannel shirts and 
granny dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, he had come to define the very attitudes of the alienated young 
and was acclaimed as the voice of a generation adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the band was best known for its 1991 album "Nevermind" and the 
sarcastic anthem "Smells like Teen Spirit." The album sold 10 million copies 
worldwide. The follow-up album, 1993's "In Utero," also was a critical and 
commercial hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol Records CEO Gary Gersh -- who signed Cobain's trio to Geffen Records 
during his tenure there in the late 1980s as an artist and repertoire executive 
-- said he was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terribly sad day for the music industry," said Gersh, who guided 
the recording and release of "Nevermind" and has known Cobain since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people look back over the years at the industry, I believe there will be 
a pre-Nirvana business and a post-Nirvana business. The group's 'Nevermind' 
album will be looked back on as a seminal record in the history of rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Cobain's death first spread Friday morning when the electrician called 
a local radio station and described showing up at the musician's wooded home to 
work on a security system. The electrician said he looked into the large glass 
windows of a cottage above a detached garage and saw a body. He called police 
and then the radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a statement from the King County medical examiner's office said, in 
part, "An autopsy has shown Kurt Cobain died of a shotgun wound to the head and 
at this time the wound appears to be self-inflicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain previously had admitted difficulties with heroin use, but insisted he 
conquered them in 1992 after he and his wife, rock singer Courtney Love, became 
the parents of a girl, Frances Bean Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 But rumors of periodic relapses persisted. Then last month in Rome, the singer 
was hospitalized in a coma apparently brought on by mixing prescription 
sedatives and champagne. He recovered, but Nirvana's successful European tour 
was in tatters.  
</P>
<P>
 There were rumors at the time that the episode was a suicide attempt, but they 
were dismissed as the ghoulish speculation that always seems to surround rock 
star tragedies.  
</P>
<P>
 Privately, however, those closest to the singer were deeply concerned. His 
condition was apparently so bad that sources said his friends confronted him 
about the problem and tried to persuade him to seek treatment. A few days later 
Cobain was believed to have entered a Los Angeles drug recovery program, but 
soon checked himself out. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, of the band Hole, was in Los Angeles when the body was found Friday and 
reportedly was being comforted by her attorney. She could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's mother, Wendy O'Conner, told reporters from her home in Aberdeen, 
Wash., that she had not heard from the singer in six days and had been worried 
for his life. She said she warned him of the troubled lives and early deaths of 
rock stars. "I told him not to join that stupid club."  
</P>
<P>
 His wife and management company had not known of his whereabouts for days, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics compared Cobain's musical influence to that of Bob Dylan and John 
Lennon. On Friday, many here drew another tragic parallel -- with the great 
guitarist and Seattle native Jimi Hendrix, who died at age 27 in a London flat 
in 1970, the result of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain put to music not the anti-Establishment rage of the '60s but the 
malaise of a '90s generation, many of them products of broken homes who were 
denied the promise of a better life and who found themselves questioning the 
meaning of life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-age Angst has paid off well / Now I'm bored and old," was the opening 
line of Nirvana's last album. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Donald Cobain was a native of the rural logging community of Aberdeen, 
about 100 miles southwest of Seattle. Himself the product of a broken family, 
Cobain lived an unhappy, drifting childhood, experiences that when translated 
into music touched millions of youths like him. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday with The Times' Robert Hilburn, Love tried to describe 
her husband's lost youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this sweet Jimmy Stewart, 'Mayberry, RFD' side of him. His favorite 
TV shows are 'Dragnet' and 'Mayberry, RFD' and 'Leave it to Beaver.' To him 
they represent his lost boyhood," she said. And she spoke of the future: "I'm 
just glad I had a girl, but I want to have a son with him too. Just so I can 
help him make up for the relationship he never had" with his father.  
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Nirvana, followed by Pearl Jam and other Seattle bands, this city 
became the capital of contemporary rock, erasing the line between alternative 
and mainstream music and breathing new life into a style of music that had, in 
the eyes of many, gone flabby and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth, Cobain told interviewers, he was influenced by the Beatles, then 
Led Zeppelin. It was the punk revolution of the late '70s and early '80s that 
proved to be the catalyst for his career. With another Aberdeen musician, 
bassist Krist Novoselic, Cobain formed Nirvana in 1986. Living on food stamps 
and working odd jobs, they joined with a series of drummers. Success was quick. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's first album, "Bleach," was released by Sub Pop, the groundbreaking 
label that was responsible for launching the Seattle sound. With drummer Dave 
Grohl, the group signed with Geffen Records' DGC label in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the group was recognized for best new artist and best alternative 
video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Four times Nirvana was nominated for 
Grammys but never won. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's lyrics were sometimes sexual and often flirted with dark themes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final chant of Nirvana's most famous song, "Teen Spirit," Cobain sings 
this: "With the lights out / It's less dangerous. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Correspondents Steve Hochman and Chuck Philips in Los Angeles contributed to 
this story. 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORY: F1 Deadly Fate 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of Kurt Cobain, troubled lead singer of the rock band Nirvana who 
apparently shot himself to death Friday, said she had told her son "not to join 
that stupid club" of rock stars who have died early, often because of drug or 
alcohol use. Some of those musicians are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Janis Joplin: A charismatic and influential performer, Joplin died in 1970 
at age 27 of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elvis Presley: Died in 1977 in Memphis, Tenn., at the age of 42 of an 
apparent overdose of prescription drugs. The cause of death was listed as heart 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jimi Hendrix: One of rock's most important guitarists, died at age 27 in 
1970 of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donny Hathaway: The singer and songwriter fell to his death from the 15th 
floor of a Manhattan hotel in an apparent suicide in 1979 at the age of 33. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Morrison: Lead singer for the Doors, died in 1971 of an apparent heart 
attack in Paris. He was 27.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sid Vicious: Bassist for the punk-rock band the Sex Pistols, died of a 
heroin overdose in 1979 at the age of 21.

PREMIER'S ABRUPT RESIGNATION LEAVES JAPAN IN SHOCK; ASIA: MORIHIRO HOSOKAWA'S 
MOVE SETS OFF A SCRAMBLE FOR A SUCCESSOR. FOREIGN MINISTER TSUTOMU HATA AND 
FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER MICHIO WATANABE ARE TOP CONTENDERS.

<P>
 Japan's political world reeled Friday from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
bombshell announcement that he is resigning amid mounting questions about a 
suspect stock deal, a loan from a gangster-linked trucking company and possible 
illegalities over the management of his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as supporters expressed shock that the man they lionized as the 
symbol of a new era of clean and open politics himself was felled by scandal, 
they say the political revolution Hosokawa started cannot be turned back. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fragile, eight-party coalition scrambled to find a successor and 
debated whether the unwieldy alliance itself could last, people ranging from 
executives to homemakers made one thing clear in interviews: They do not want a 
return to the closed network of shady deals and back-room politics symbolized 
by the Liberal Democratic Party's 38-year iron rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once big change starts, no one can stop it, like a rolling stone," said 
Yoshiko Hayakawa, a writer and political activist who has been working to break 
open the old boys' network. "The fresh breeze brought by the coalition has to 
keep blowing -- at least, I really hope it does." 
</P>
<P>
 So stunned, however, were the Japanese that politicians, pundits and analysts 
were slow to speculate who might succeed Hosokawa, who resigned abruptly early 
Friday, beleaguered by persistent controversies over his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The most attention seemed to focus on Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata of the 
Renewal Party; there also was a growing buzz about former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe of the LDP. Both would-be candidates, however, have their own 
political liabilities; Watanabe, for example, would have to bolt his current 
party to possibly become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear exactly how long the intricate process for picking Japan's next 
political leader might take. Possible Successors 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll by the Nihon Keizai newspaper showed that 42% of respondents 
would still vote for a coalition candidate in an election held today, compared 
to 22% for the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Hata was most often supported as the next prime minister in 
the poll, and his name still heads the list of most likely successors to 
Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, the boyish-faced leader of the Renewal Party, is a close ally of Ichiro 
Ozawa, the brilliant policy strategist whom many view as Japan's most dynamic 
political leader. Hata would be likely to espouse many of Ozawa's proposals, 
which range from a 10% consumption tax and an income tax increase to stimulate 
the economy to greater participation of Japan's Self-Defense Forces in 
international peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But rumors are mounting that Watanabe, the former foreign minister, might bolt 
the Liberal Democrats to join the coalition with his followers -- possibly even 
heading it as prime minister. Watanabe, blunt and colorful, would not be 
expected to espouse radical reform as an entrenched LDP insider but would bring 
the experience the coalition badly lacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the eclectic, increasingly unwieldy coalition, which ranges from 
leftist Socialists to conservative former LDP heavyweights, itself can last was 
much debated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama urged that the coalition remain intact 
and select a new leader. But Koshiro Ishida of the Buddhist-backed Clean 
Government Party said partners must first agree on policies -- a remark that 
indicated a willingness to recast the coalition, perhaps to accommodate 
Watanabe and his group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the choice of Hosokawa's successor may shatter the coalition. The 
Socialists, Renewal Party and Democratic Socialists oppose the choice of Hata. 
Some believe that the coalition may simply appoint a caretaker prime minister 
and call an election after the 1994 budget is passed to seek the voters' will. 
</P>
<P>
 A successor may be named early next week, but it could take as long as a few 
months. Once a successor is decided, the entire Cabinet would resign and a new 
prime minister would be elected by the lower house of Parliament. Hosokawa, 
Reform 
</P>
<P>
 The LDP rule was shattered last summer after the arrest of its kingpin, Shin 
Kanemaru, on tax evasion charges. His arrest threw the party into chaos, led to 
renewed public disgust over corruption and thrust into power Hosokawa, a former 
governor and political aristocrat from the southern island of Kyushu. Hosokawa 
pledged sweeping political reforms and a new populism to bring government 
closer to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his dynamic start, Hosokawa fumbled badly in the last two months, 
showing a marked inability to effectively deal with problems -- trade 
relations, especially with the United States; a stubborn economic recession 
across Japan, and the growing conflicts within his shaky coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics faulted his relative inexperience; supporters claimed that the fault 
belonged to the coalition itself, whose excessive policy differences paralyzed 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa is now likely to be relegated to the sidelines of Japan's political 
world. No postwar prime minister has ever resumed office after resigning, and 
his Japan New Party is too small to merit significant political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not in danger of arrest, since the statute of limitations has passed for 
all of the incidents in question, including a suspect stock purchase of Nippon 
Telegraph & Telephone shares in 1986 and a $952,000 loan from the shady Sagawa 
Kyubin Co. that opponents argue might have been an illegal political donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa also said in his news conference Friday that new revelations of 
possible illegalities regarding his personal finances had surfaced, but the 
incidents in question occurred several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hosokawa declined to provide details pending completion of the 
investigation by his office, the Japanese press reported that money he lent to 
a friend might have been used in illegal loan-shark operations without his 
knowledge. A Political Legacy 
</P>
<P>
 If Hosokawa's image as a clean and idealistic reformer is forever tarnished, 
however, his legacy as a symbol and catalyst for change is likely to last, 
people here say.  
</P>
<P>
 Already, the populist politics he represented is starting to take on a life of 
its own. As more people take an active interest in politics, they are tuning 
into political debate shows such as the popular "Sunday Project," whose ratings 
have increased more than 10% in the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are snapping up political books such as Ozawa's "Blueprint for a New 
Japan," making heavyweight policy tomes a surprising publishing trend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scramble to define their policies and images in the new era of personal 
politics, several politicians are now writing books with a bemusing variety of 
slogans: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ozawa's "normal nation," meaning a Japan that can properly assert its own 
national interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * New Party Harbinger leader Masayoshi Takemura's "a small but sparkling 
nation," meaning one that plays a more modest global role. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's somewhat obtuse "a nation 
proportionate to its height." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, if you became the head of the top LDP faction you could become the 
prime minister, so there wasn't much need to appeal to the public directly," 
said Shigenobu Tamura, chief aide to Hashimoto, who says he now spends half his 
time on "media tactics" to get his boss's message out to the public. "Now you 
must be able to articulate policy . . . and those who can appeal to the public 
are the ones who become top leaders, such as (LDP President Yohei) Kono," 
Tamura said. 
</P>
<P>
 To establish better contact with common voters, the once-lofty LDP is going to 
such lengths as opening fax lines to solicit public opinion and even holding 
matchmaking parties to lure young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Populist politics made their first appearance in a symbolic gubernatorial 
election last week in conservative Ishikawa prefecture, a coastal area known 
for lacquerware, industrial equipment and, until now, rock-solid support for 
the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In a close contest, voters rejected the LDP candidate and elected a deputy 
governor backed by the Hosokawa government after the coalition sponsored the 
area's first-ever town hall meeting -- giving citizens a chance to air their 
views -- and participated in a local television debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fear that the recently passed political reform bill will squelch the 
fledgling populism by centralizing power in the hands of party bosses. But 
others say the public's expectations of a more open and responsive political 
system raised by Hosokawa will not change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfortunate that Mr. Hosokawa is resigning, because he's the 
best person in Japan to bring about the new wave of politics," said Minoru 
Omukai, a lacquerware seller in the wind-swept town of Wajima, who supported 
the coalition candidate in the Ishikawa governor's race. "But the wave of 
change is advancing, and whoever succeeds him will have to follow it because 
this is what the people want." 
</P>
<P>
 Toshio Kanekura, 52, an executive with a plastics firm in Kawasaki near Tokyo, 
lamented Hosokawa's intent to resign. He said the LDP had no politician with 
the potential to change the system as Hosokawa did -- particularly to liberate 
business from the shackles of regulation that Kanekura believes are destroying 
Japan's competitive strength. Deregulation was one of Hosokawa's major pledges 
and political mantras. 
</P>
<P>
 "The LDP was involved in the iron triangle with industry and corrupt political 
donations," Kanekura said. "But Japan is now in an era of change. As long as 
there are voters, we will not go back to the old LDP ways." 
</P>
<P>
 LDP President Kono admitted as much Friday. "Support for the Liberal Democrats 
has been lower than support for the Hosokawa coalition," he said, acknowledging 
there was no public clamor for the party to return to power even though it 
successfully forced Hosokawa's resignation by relentlessly pressing him on his 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hosokawa -- a man said to be obsessed with his own political legacy 
-- will undoubtedly leave a significant mark on history despite his brief, 
eight-month tenure, said Mitsuru Uchida, a Waseda University professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his last two months were a study in policy paralysis, Hosokawa 
ushered in the coalition government, oversaw the passage of a landmark 
political reform bill, presided over the opening of the rice market and issued 
the boldest apology yet for Japan's wartime aggression.

WILSON SIGNS BILL RESTRICTING GIFTS TO OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson announced Friday that he had signed a bill that would toughen 
limits on gifts and perks collected by local government officials statewide, a 
measure sparked by revelations last year of excessive spending and gift-taking 
at an Orange County water district. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) began pushing the bill after reading 
accounts in The Times about gifts and extravagant expense accounts rung up by 
two top officials at the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will make a big difference," Umberg said, after learning that 
his bill would become law. "It will dramatically reduce taxpayer-funded 
limousine rides. . . . It will also hopefully eliminate instances where we see 
public officials receiving $40,000 in gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor signed the measure late Thursday, but did not notify Umberg or 
announce it to the public until Friday. The bill, which takes effect Jan. 1, 
did not receive a negative vote in either the Senate or the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Wilson said the measure will hold local officials to 
the "same tough standards" required of state lawmakers for gifts and perks. 
Citing the Santa Margarita scandal, Wilson said "all elected officials must 
remember who they work for -- the citizens who put them in office." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Santa Margarita Water District, where officials had enacted a virtual 
ban on gifts to district officials and workers last year, board members said 
they were pleased with the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's long overdue, very appropriate and a long time coming," said Sean 
Barrett, who joined the board shortly after the scandal erupted. "This is 
something that has been happening throughout private industry so there's no 
reason it shouldn't be happening in the public sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill, gift restrictions and other laws that currently apply to state 
lawmakers will be extended to include elected officials and employees at a 
special district or local government such as a city, county or school district. 
</P>
<P>
 All honorariums are banned. Gifts will be restricted to a total of $250 or 
less each year from any single donor. Currently, there is a $1,000 restriction. 
In addition, the bill requires that local officials report all gifts worth more 
than $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's measure also would add tough disclosure requirements for special 
districts such as Santa Margarita. Special districts will be required to make a 
public report if an employee or elected director were reimbursed with taxpayer 
dollars totaling $100 or more for meals, lodging, travel expenses or other 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts also would be required to publish a tally of all reimbursements 
of $100 or more in a document published at least annually. Umberg contends the 
disclosure statements, which could be perused by the public and press, should 
curtail abuses as much as anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Assemblyman Umberg and Gov. Wilson should be congratulated for enacting 
this into law," said William R. Mitchell, chairman of Orange County Common 
Cause. "Unfortunately, it takes a political scandal for politicians to remedy a 
situation like this. It should put municipalities on notice that they should 
adopt a total gift-ban ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bill did not attract any significant opposition, groups 
representing special districts raised concerns with Umberg about the disclosure 
statements, suggesting they represented an onerous task that would not prove 
particularly enlightening to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Special districts typically handle water, sewer or waste disposal duties, 
often in unincorporated regions. In California alone, there are more than 3,000 
special districts. The bill would also apply to air pollution control 
districts, maintenance districts and redevelopment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is the second effort undertaken by an Orange County lawmaker to 
contend with the type of problems that came to light because of the Santa 
Margarita Water District scandal. Last year, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy 
(R-Orange) pushed through a new law that changed how the water district's 
directors were elected, making them more accountable to the public instead of 
large landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of two surviving "landowner districts" in Orange County, the directors 
of the Santa Margarita and Los Alisos water districts have been elected under a 
system that awarded votes exclusively to landowners on the basis of one vote 
for each dollar of the land's value on county property tax rolls. Conroy's 
legislation changes the election system to a one-person, one-vote system open 
to all registered voters living in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The two legislative actions were prompted by stories in The Times which 
revealed that the district's two top managers, Walter W. (Bill) Knitz and 
Michael P. Lord, accepted more than $40,000 in meals, fishing trips, golf 
games, and other gifts and entertainment from companies that relied on their 
help in securing contracts from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper articles also triggered an investigation by the Orange County 
District Attorney's Office, which last month filed 38 misdemeanor criminal 
charges against Knitz and Lord, alleging that they repeatedly failed to 
disclose gifts from business people and then took actions on their behalf in 
violation of state conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are still trying to decide whether to file charges against former 
board chairman Don B. Schone and district engineer William B. Dye, who also 
accepted gifts in excess of state-mandated limits from companies they 
recommended for contracts.

FALLOUT LIKELY IN U.S.-JAPAN TRADE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is likely to make 
the roiling trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo even more intractable in 
the near future, U.S. experts cautioned Friday. But over time, it could be a 
catalyst for significant progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hosokawa's weakened political position was common knowledge, Friday's 
resignation announcement caught Washington by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton expressed concern that the effort to open commercial markets 
and reform the government, which began with Hosokawa's arrival in office, not 
end with his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hosokawa assumed office last July, the Clinton Administration was 
optimistic that his coalition, taking over after 38 years of rule by the 
Liberal Democratic Party, would lead Japan on a new economic course. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the Administration's policy toward Japan is an effort to get 
Tokyo to buy more products from foreign countries and reduce a trade surplus 
that soared to $120 billion last year, about half of it at the expense of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's hopes for steady progress were dashed in February, when 
American and Japanese negotiators, on the eve of Hosokawa's visit with Clinton 
at the White House, broke off talks intended to give U.S. businesses a toehold 
in key Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's resignation was prompted by his political weakness and by doubts 
raised over his personal financial dealings dating back more than a decade. 
Even so, the repercussions could be felt in the trade arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of U.S. experts closely following developments in Japan, this 
could happen in two steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * The shake-up that is likely to occur in the upper ranks of the Japanese 
government, regardless of who succeeds Hosokawa, will force political leaders 
to focus on more pressing domestic matters and will weaken their ability to 
pressure the powerful bureaucrats in the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry into making concessions to U.S. negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bureaucrats are more powerful now. No senior, heavyweight politician can 
force a decision at this point," said Doug Paal, who was President George 
Bush's White House adviser on Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the longer run, the turmoil could lead to approval of a new Japanese 
budget. The difficulty in gaining approval of a budget has kept political 
leaders from resuming their earlier focus on the U.S.-Japan trade dispute. 
Settling the budget dispute could clear the decks for resolution of the trade 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Paal said, if the coalition that Hosokawa put together last 
summer begins to fracture, the trade talk delays could be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke with Hosokawa for about 12 minutes by telephone Friday morning. 
He said later that he had told the prime minister that he was "personally very 
sorry to see him step down." 
</P>
<P>
 The President told reporters during a visit to Minneapolis that the change in 
Japanese leadership would produce no change in the United States' position on 
the trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should stick with our policy and be firm about it," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But plainly, the Japanese are going to need a little bit of time to 
reconstitute their government." 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing hope for a renewed effort to reform the Japanese political and 
economic systems, Clinton said, "I wouldn't write the epitaph for change too 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The course of economic reform in Japan, he said, "will not suffer an 
irrevocable setback as a result of the government shake-up." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials expressed confidence that they could work well with those whose 
names have surfaced as possible Hosokawa successors, including Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hata was finance minister in the Liberal Democratic Party government, "we 
had a good relationship with him," a Treasury official said. He characterized 
Hata as "more on the reformers' side," despite his role in the government that 
the Hosokawa coalition threw out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the official said, the likelihood that Hata could push ahead with the 
reforms favored by Hosokawa would depend "on the politics of the situation" and 
the strength he would bring to the office rather than any policy preferences he 
might hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, said Chalmers Johnson, professor emeritus at the University of 
California, the dispute between the United States and Japan will not be 
resolved until Washington shifts from its insistence that Japan make radical 
changes in its way of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 What should be brought home to the Clinton Administration, Johnson said, "is 
that the problem is not going to be solved by the Japanese. The Japanese will 
never open their markets in any sense that we understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 * ECONOMIC BOOST: Hosokawa's resignation could help Japan's economy in the 
short run. D1 Reign Doesn't Last a Year 
</P>
<P>
 Main developments in the Hosokawa administration: 
</P>
<P>
 * July 18, 1993: Parliamentary elections deprive the scandal-ridden Liberal 
Democratic Party, which had held power for four decades, of its lower-house 
majority. The defeat paves the way for the resignation of Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 6, 1993: Lawmakers elect Hosokawa prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 18, 1993: The lower house passes a package of anti-corruption 
legislation, including a ban on corporate contributions to politicians and a 
change in the way the lower house is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 21, 1994: The upper house rejects the anti-corruption bills. Hosokawa 
had hinted he would resign if the bills failed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 29, 1994: Both houses pass a compromise that permits limited corporate 
donations to politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 3, 1994: Hosokawa suddenly announces a plan for a $57-billion tax cut 
combined with a hike in the national sales tax from 3% to 7% in 1997. Key 
parties denounce the plan; Hosokawa withdraws it a day later. 
</P>
<P>
 * March, 1994: The Liberal Democrats declare they will refuse to discuss the 
fiscal 1994 budget until Hosokawa allows a former secretary to testify about a 
$952,000 loan Hosokawa took from a trucking magnate. Hosokawa rejects the 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 30, 1994: An investment consultant says Hosokawa lied to Parliament 
about a large stock purchase in 1986. Hosokawa says his father-in-law made the 
purchase; the consultant says it was actually Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 8, 1994: Hosokawa says he will resign. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Five Japanese prime ministers have resigned in the last five years, and money 
scandals -- or failure to pass legislation to stop them -- have often been to 
blame: The Hosokawa Scandal 
</P>
<P>
 Centers on a $952,000 loan Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa received in 1982 
from a mob-linked trucking company executive. Opposition lawmakers say the loan 
was actually a political donation. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also grilled about a profitable stock deal, supposedly made by his 
father-in-law, that produced a nearly $500,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
 He also disclosed a new potential scandal over personal investments entrusted 
to a close friend. Hosokawa said laws may have been broken but refused to give 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 His Biggest Success: Passing a sweeping set of political reform bills aimed at 
fighting the corruption that has become endemic to Japanese politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Is Next?: Though no clear successor had emerged, speculation centered on 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 His Approval Rating: In a national poll in Japan: 
</P>
<P>
 March, 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 Approve: 53% 
</P>
<P>
 Disapprove: 31% 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 September, 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Approve: 70% 
</P>
<P>
 Disapprove: 16% Other Recent Resignations of Premiers 
</P>
<P>
 Noboru Takeshita (resigned April 25, 1989): Was forced to quit after admitting 
he received donations from the Recruit Co., the company at the center of 
perhaps Japan's biggest postwar scandal. Recruit sold stock at cut-rate prices 
to major politicians or their aides, who later resold the stock for large 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousuke Uno (resigned July 23, 1989): Had barely taken office when it was 
reported that he paid a geisha to be his mistress and mistreated her when they 
broke up. Uno quit when the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party did poorly in 
July elections for Parliament's upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiki Kaifu (resigned Oct. 5, 1991): A little-known politician with a clean 
reputation, Kaifu promised to pass anti-corruption legislation. But when bills 
were introduced, LDP powerbrokers withdrew their support from Kaifu, and he was 
forced to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiichi Miyazawa (resigned July 22, 1993): Had been one of the recipients of 
Recruit's favors, but he too promised to pass anti-corruption legislation. When 
push came to shove in June 1993, however, he lost his resolve under pressure 
from LDP powerbrokers.

IT'S 'JUDGMENT' DAY FOR UNVEILED SISTINE CHAPEL; VATICAN: THE POPE PRAISES THE 
RESTORED MICHELANGELO MASTERPIECE. GONE IS CENTURIES OF GRIME -- AND MODESTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "The Last Judgment" is at hand. Good news, unless you are a fan of the 
16th-Century prude Biagio da Cesena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican unveiled Michelangelo's restored masterpiece Friday, revealing the 
Sistine Chapel unfettered by scaffolds for the first time in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the world's most famous room was, in a word, breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the altar, the huge fresco of the risen Christ dispensing eternal 
justice vibrates with recovered color and life. Above, the vaulted ceiling, 
another Michelangelo treasure, completes the restored glory of the Renaissance 
chapel where Popes are elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ranges of colors are similar to ones Pope Paul III saw (in 1541) when he 
saw the finished 'Last Judgment' for the first time," said Fabrizio Mancinelli, 
who headed the four-year restoration that followed a decade's work on the 
ceiling. "The colors Michelangelo used don't fade; they have remained in good 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II celebrated the completion of the $11-million restoration 
financed by Japan's Nippon Television with a thanksgiving Mass before the 
fresco Michelangelo undertook at papal instruction "to show in the story 
everything that the art of drawing could achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sistine Chapel is the place which, for every Pope, embodies memory of a 
singular day in his life. For me, it was Oct. 16, 1978," John Paul reminisced. 
He was Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow. Just before the last ballot that would 
elevate him to the papacy, a fellow Polish cardinal startled him with a 
whispered, "If they elect you, I beg you, do not refuse," John Paul recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in flowing gold robes of joy at Mass on Friday morning, John Paul 
hailed the chapel as "the sanctuary of the theology of the human body. In 
rendering homage to the beauty of mankind created by God as man and woman, it 
also expresses . . . the hope of a transfigured world." 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration of the 66-by-33-foot fresco has stripped away centuries of 
dust, candle soot and bad glue from previous attempts to preserve the painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Reborn, the painting explodes with swirling movement: Against a backdrop of 
heavenly blue, there are saints and devils, angels and sinners, agony and 
ecstasy. On the left, figures rise toward paradise. On the right, they plunge 
miserably toward the anguish of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancinelli called "The Last Judgment" a more mature painting than the ceiling. 
Its colors are warmer, thanks principally to blues derived from expensive lapis 
lazuli that Michelangelo couldn't afford when he painted the biblical story of 
the creation on the ceiling 25 years before beginning "The Last Judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the ceiling, we see the colors of his native Florence. The altar wall, 
however, is more influenced by the colors he had later admired in Venetian 
painting," Mancinelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he worked on "The Last Judgment" high on the chapel scaffold between 1536 
and 1541, Michelangelo dressed Christ and his mother, her eyes averted from the 
anguish and exaltation of judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 But he left many figures, including a pair of saints, one he, one she, as 
nature created them. That sent future papal censors scurrying for paint-on fig 
leafs, girdles and other modesty garments. Renaissance Pope Paul III, who paid 
hefty painting bills to Michelangelo, loved the painting. Not Biagio da Cesena, 
his master of ceremonies, the head of the papal household. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesena objected -- too strenuously, as it turns out. As historian Giorgio 
Vasari recalls, Cesena complained that "it was a very improper thing to paint 
so many nude forms, all showing their nakedness in that shameless fashion . . . 
such pictures were better-suited to a bathhouse or a roadside wine shop than to 
the Pope's chapel." 
</P>
<P>
 Some later Popes would defend the masterpiece, but others shared Cesena's view 
that its display of saintly pulchritude was offensive to the religion it 
portrayed. Neither did they welcome the commanding figure of a 
justice-dispensing Christ as a beardless young man, although none dared change 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Inquisition Pope Paul IV, (1555-59) called the painting "a stew of nudes" and 
wanted it destroyed. During the reign of his successor, Pius IV, the Council of 
Trent censured the painting, decreeing that it must be "mended." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelangelo himself scornfully dismissed censors. But in 1565, with the old 
master safely dead the year before, one of his students, Daniele da Volterra, 
began draping nude forms with what became known as modesty breeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Volterra covered barely enough to assure the painting's survival. Clement 
VIII, 1592-1605, wanted to whitewash the whole wall. He didn't. But cover-ups 
and helter-skelter touch-ups continued deep into the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, restorers said they had removed the 17 most recent breeches, 
leaving Volterra's and a few others -- 23 in all -- that would have damaged the 
painting if removed. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul gave his imprimatur to the finished work Friday, but it came with a 
warning that "the splendor and dignity of the human body" must be viewed in the 
light of its creation by God. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you remove it from this dimension . . . it becomes an object that can 
easily be debased. Only before the eyes of God can the human body remain nude 
and uncovered and keep intact its splendor and beauty," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little splendor and less beauty about Biagio da Cesena. Michelangelo 
repaid his criticism by painting him into "The Last Judgment." And there, 
freshly restored, he writhes in misery in the bottom right-hand corner. Replete 
with ass's ears and a Michelangelo-painted serpent coiled tightly around his 
loins, Biagio suffers on the altar wall as Minos, the cruel judge of souls in 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasari says that seeing himself so humiliated in the painting, Biagio begged 
Paul III to have him painted out. "I might have released you from purgatory, 
but over hell I have no power," the Pope replied, siding with his favorite 
painter.

MAJOR S. AFRICAN LEADERS FAIL TO REACH COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This country's three major political leaders and the Zulu king failed to reach 
any significant compromises or agreements in a make-or-break summit Friday, 
dimming hopes for a peaceful election this month and long-term stability after 
the dawning of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In an indication of the rising tension, African National Congress leader 
Nelson Mandela openly bickered with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi 
during an acrimonious late night news conference. It followed daylong meetings 
at a secluded game lodge among the two, President Frederik W. de Klerk and the 
Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini. 
</P>
<P>
 A somber-faced Mandela was the most openly pessimistic of the four, telling 
reporters that he holds little hope that the Zulu leaders' anti-election or 
other intractable demands can be met and the deepening crisis defused before 
the April 26-28 balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot see a political solution before the elections," said Mandela, who is 
expected to become the first black president in a post-apartheid government. 
"We are unable to place before you any tangible results of these discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 The only "achievement" he could cite, he said later, was that the contentious 
group met at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the last-ditch, high-level attempt to forge an accord that 
would bring Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party into the campaign is likely to 
spark further factional fighting in the bitterly divided Zulu strongholds of 
Natal province, where a week-old state of emergency has been unable to stop 
record levels of political and ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 12 hours of talks, the four leaders issued a terse, one-page 
statement that said nothing about the two burning issues on the agenda: whether 
the elections would be delayed, as Buthelezi and the king demand, or whether 
the defiant Zulu leaders would guarantee to allow free campaigning and 
balloting in their areas, as Mandela and De Klerk insist. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the statement pledged only to form a task force to "deliberate 
further," to use still-unformed plans for international mediation and to appeal 
to supporters to "end the killing." 
</P>
<P>
 "You might say, 'Oh, another task force,' " De Klerk said, hoping to cast a 
positive light on the day. "This one is different. . . . It has a task." He 
said it would report back by next Thursday on proposals to accommodate the Zulu 
king within the interim constitution to guarantee his property, wives and some 
form of sovereignty within the new South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mandela clearly didn't agree that another task force would make much 
headway. He warned three times that no one should have "exaggerated 
expectations of what this task force is likely to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mandela and De Klerk have made unsuccessful overtures to the king in 
hopes of luring him from the tight control of Buthelezi, his uncle and prime 
minister. Their close relationship was apparent when Buthelezi repeatedly 
whispered into the king's ear as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't advise my people to go to elections," the king said as Buthelezi 
leaned over and whispered. "I won't advise them to go if this matter is not 
settled." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela virtually ignored Buthelezi except for a bitter exchange between the 
two longtime rivals after the Zulu chief read a statement that repeated his 
grievances and appeared to blame the ANC and government for the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela complained the statement "comes to me as a complete surprise" and then 
rejected Buthelezi's points. Buthelezi, in turn, argued back twice, 
illustrating the deep gulf that has developed between the two former friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides have said Mandela was furious after he and Buthelezi last met on March 1 
in Durban and the fiery Zulu chief finally promised to register for the 
elections, drawing headlines around the world. His party did so, but then was 
disqualified for the ballot because it failed to provide a list of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere for the long-awaited summit has been soured by the clash on 
March 28 in Johannesburg between the ANC and Zulu demonstrators loyal to the 
king, which led to a day of conflict that claimed 53 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The four leaders and their aides met in small thatch-roofed huts at the 
secluded Jakkelsbessie game lodge along the Sabi River. It lies deep in the 
vastness of the Kruger National Park, one of Africa's most spectacular reserves 
of lions, elephants, giraffes, hippos and other majestic animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by their delegations, Mandela first joined the king for 4 1/2 hours, 
more than twice as long as originally scheduled. It was their first meeting 
ever after several failed attempts in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen said the four leaders ate lunch together at 2 on a patio beside a 
hippo pool, then met without their aides for an hour. They then joined the 40 
or so lawyers, politicians, princes and other aides in a plenary session that 
lasted past 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 reporters and photographers were flown at midafternoon from Pretoria 
to this remote airport in a South African air force C-130 transport plane, and 
emergency landing lights were brought in to allow a nighttime departure. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC offered a formal proposal that would give largely ceremonial powers to 
the king but stopped far short of his demands for full sovereignty within the 
South African state. The proposal, for example, would have allowed the king a 
formal coronation, let him open the democratically elected provincial 
legislature, appoint someone to represent him at the assembly and even rename 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
 But it left the king's budget and police -- and, indeed, most of his official 
powers -- under direct control of the provincial assembly. And that is almost 
certain to be dominated by the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial, rambling statements of Buthelezi and the king to Mandela and De 
Klerk, released to the press before the news conference, gave little reason to 
expect a breakthrough. Both men said their demands were non-negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, for example, insisted that elections be postponed, that the new 
interim constitution not go into force until their demands could be written in 
and that registration of parties be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence is escalating, the possibility of political accords recede into the 
background, and the ANC and the South African government still regard fixed 
election timetables to be more important than averting the escalation of the 
present civil war and eventual total disaster," Buthelezi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is chief minister and police chief of KwaZulu's repressive 
one-party government, Buthelezi claimed he had "no authority" to arrange for 
voting booths to be placed in schools or tribal buildings or even to allowing 
telephones to be installed at voting sites, as the nation's independent 
electoral commission has asked. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a remarkable diatribe, the king chastised Mandela in his 12-page 
opening speech -- which he read in Zulu -- for alleged slights "to my person 
and to my dignity" over the last four years. He seemed especially irritated 
that Mandela had not followed what he called proper protocol for seeking 
meetings. "A Zulu king is not just another black leader who should be 
approachable by just anybody," he complained.

KOON'S PROFITS FOCUS OF FEUD IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if he hasn't been in enough controversies already, former Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon is now at the center of a political dispute between 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and a ranking Democratic assemblyman over a law barring 
criminals from profiting from their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg of Sacramento called on Lungren nearly three 
weeks ago to use the state's so-called "Son of Sam" law to block Koon from 
making money off the sale of his autobiography and a related fund-raising 
campaign that has attracted nationwide support. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg argued that they are based on illegal deeds for which Koon is now in 
prison -- violating the civil rights of Rodney G. King in the police beating 
that eventually led to the riots of April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren waited until late Thursday to respond, Isenberg said, and then said in 
a letter that since the constitutionality of the Son of Sam law has never been 
tested, he wants to wait until a better case comes along, but that he will 
"continue to review" the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Isenberg accused Lungren -- a staunch law-and-order advocate 
running for reelection -- of ducking the issue, due to what Isenberg said is 
Koon's popularity among those conservatives and police associations that make 
up Lungren's potential base of electoral support. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren has heretofore been a vocal supporter of the Son of Sam law and is 
leading the campaign to amend it so it can be used more broadly, after a 
controversy erupted recently over whether convicted murderer Charles Manson 
could collect royalties from T-shirt sales and a song he wrote that was 
recorded by the rock band Guns N' Roses on an album released last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that if the law means anything at all, everyone has to be 
treated equally -- the crooks you like and the crooks you don't," said 
Isenberg, a member of the Assembly's Criminal Justice Committee and chairman of 
the powerful Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to believe you want an expansion of the law if you are 
unprepared to apply the existing law equally to everybody who is convicted of a 
felony and makes money off their crime," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional law expert agreed, saying legislators enacted the law to 
prevent felons from profiting from their crimes and so their victims could be 
reimbursed, and that it clearly applies to the Koon case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Convicted felons who happen to be Los Angeles police officers should not be 
treated differently from any other convicted felons with respect to applying 
the law," said Robert Pugsley, a professor of criminal law at Southwestern 
University School of Law in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As for why Lungren hasn't given a definitive response, Pugsley said: "I can 
only assume his motivations are political, that it would be unpopular for the 
state's top law enforcer to go against law enforcement personnel, even though 
(Koon) has been convicted of a felony. To be evenhanded, Lungren should 
definitely consider applying this law." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which has been on the books for about a decade, Lungren would 
petition a civil court judge to set up an involuntary trust for the benefit of 
Koon's victim -- in this case, King, who was beaten by police officers under 
Koon's supervision after a car chase in 1991. The proceeds also would be used 
to pay legal bills associated with the case. Such trusts under the law could be 
used to collect profits from the sale of books, movies, T-shirts and even 
interviews and TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 In his March 21 letter to Lungren, Isenberg asked the attorney general to set 
up such a fund immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are a strong and vocal proponent of anti-crime measures and I assume you 
object to Mr. Koon exploiting the commercial value of his felonious conduct," 
Isenberg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I acknowledge the sensitive nature of this subject. However, the fair and 
uniform application of our laws requires your office to fully investigate Mr. 
Koon's activity . . . and make a public pronouncement on your decision of 
whether to proceed against Mr. Koon." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Isenberg sent another letter to Lungren, reminding him of his 
previous vocal support for the Son of Sam law and its proposed expansion. "As 
we attempt to expand," he wrote, "it is critical that we aggressively enforce 
the existing law." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren responded in a letter, also dated Tuesday, which Isenberg said he 
received late Thursday. Assistant Atty. Gen. Carole Ritts Kornblum, who wrote 
the response, said the state Justice Department is still taking the matter 
under consideration, but doesn't plan to spend time or resources going after 
Koon's book profits or fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon's publisher said Friday that the book, published about 18 months ago, has 
sold at least 28,000 copies, and that the letter in which Koon asks for 
financial help is still bringing in money from supporters around the nation. 
Isenberg said the fund-raising money would be fair game under the law, because 
Koon promises to send a free copy of the $19.95 book to anyone who sends $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon's publisher, Alfred S. Regnery, would not say how much money Koon has 
made from the sale of the book, but that most of the profits were made soon 
after the book was published. He said Koon had a common publishing arrangement 
that gave him as much as 15% of book sales income, and that the fund-raising 
campaign continues to generate donations as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If the book has sold 28,000 copies at $19.95, each, 15% would amount to more 
than $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to think Stacey Koon got a very raw deal and that he has been 
punished for something he's not guilty of," Regnery said. "A lot of people 
would disagree with that. But this politician (Isenberg) seems to want to 
please those people who want to perpetuate this case and the glorification of 
Rodney King." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren aides said the attorney general is not hesitating for political 
reasons, but that he is simply wary of testing the California law because a 
similar New York state law was struck down by the U. S. Supreme Court in 1991 
as violating constitutional guarantees of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren spokesman Dave Puglia said an effort is under way to amend the law, 
and that should be completed before it is used, to make the law 
"constitutionally bulletproof." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there have been other cases in which the Son of Sam law could have 
been used in California. A Los Angeles gang member and convicted felon named 
Monster Kody, for instance, has received more than $100,000 for his 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornblum said that even though the California law is more narrowly written 
than the New York one, it remains "highly susceptible" to a constitutional 
challenge, which would involve "long and expensive litigation" that should be 
confronted only with a strong test case. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the law provides that the state's legal fees be paid from any 
profits made by the convicted felon in question, she said, there would be 
little or no money left for King. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lungren and his staffers have insisted at other times -- including in 
legislative testimony just a few weeks ago -- that the law is constitutional as 
it is now written, because it does not suffer from the same weaknesses as the 
New York law. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon, convicted last year on federal charges of violating King's civil rights, 
is in a federal prison in Dublin, Calif., serving a 30-month sentence. His 
book, "Presumed Guilty, The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair," focuses on 
events the night King was beaten in 1991. As the top-ranking officer at the 
scene, Koon was ultimately held responsible for violating King's civil rights, 
after he and three officers were acquitted of police brutality charges in a 
Superior Court case that set off the Los Angeles riots of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg and his aides also challenged Lungren's decision not to pursue the 
case because of the expense involved, citing the attorney general's 
often-stated conviction that legal principles should be protected no matter the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chase down street criminals for a small quantity of marijuana," said 
Isenberg aide Gene Erbin. "But we don't go after this guy for hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in profits?"

LATIN AMERICA; BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES LINK LOTTERY TO POLITICAL CORRUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAC MARGOLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late last month, on a tip from a prisoner, Brazilian federal prosecutor 
Antonio Carlos Biscaia led police investigators to a handsome mansion tucked 
away in Bangu, a poor suburb west of downtown Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 There they found a small arsenal of guns and ammunition, video poker machines 
and five sealed jeweler's vaults. Then they stumbled on a wealth of 
incriminating documents, including some 50 log books and more than 100 computer 
diskettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Biscaia and his team concluded that the house was headquarters for an illegal 
lottery known as the jogo do bicho , the animal game. Moreover, he claimed, the 
cache and paper trail were proof of what had long been whispered here: that the 
animal lottery was a thin front for a vast underworld of crime including drug 
trafficking, arms running and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, he concluded, leading Brazilians not only knew about the misdeeds but 
profited directly from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also linked the Rio crime bosses to the international drug trade, 
tracing regular payments from the animal game to Cali, Colombia, home of the 
world's biggest cocaine ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sure we will be able to prove that the money was used to finance drug 
trafficking," Biscaia told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The headlines that trumpeted the scandal shocked but did not surprise many 
Brazilians, who have seen plenty of thieving by public officials in recent 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, President Fernando Collor de Mello was caught with his hand in the 
public till and came tumbling down in an impeachment trial. The next year, 
senior members of the Congress were found to have helped themselves to about 
$100 million of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest scandal threatened even wider damage. The prosecutor had dared to 
shake the rug where this city's underworld had long treaded, exposing a 
parquetry of crime that extended from Rio's ragged shantytowns to the stately 
chambers of the federal courts and the National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Biscaia turned up a log book registering regular payoffs from the bicheiros , 
or lottery dons, to more than 100 people, including figures as high up as 
Collor and as unlikely as Herbert de Souza, a sociologist widely hailed for his 
courageous fight against hunger, unemployment and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Souza admitted that taking the money -- for an AIDS prevention campaign -- was 
a "political error." 
</P>
<P>
 Payoffs also went to Rio's mayor, Cesar Maia, said to have received $100,000 
during his 1992 campaign for office, and to Rio state Gov. Nilo Batista, who 
confirmed that he negotiated a $58,000 donation from the lottery to Souza's 
AIDS group when he was lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressmen, judges and prosecutors were also on the lists, along with former 
federal police Supt. Edson de Oliveira -- the man who arrested Paulo Cesar 
Farias, Collor's former campaign treasurer and alleged partner in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Biscaia allowed that some politicians, such as Maia, may not have known of 
campaign donations taken in their names by aides. But he was unsparing with the 
civil police, the investigating arm of the state police. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil police corps is "permeated by corruption," he told reporters in Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rio state secretary of police, Jorge Mario Gomes, also named in the 
payoffs, resigned last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal lottery, dating to the late 1800s, was a favorite pastime for 
millions of Brazilians. The bicheiros were tolerated and even revered for their 
charitable works. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, authorities suspected the bicheiros of involvement in 
more nefarious activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, state Judge Denise Frossard sentenced 14 of them to jail for 
conspiracy to commit a crime and maintaining armed bands. But until the recent 
raid, there was no solid proof of more serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police got their tip after a longtime bookie for Castor de Andrade, a leading 
bicheiro , decided to become an informant. When the bicheiro 's son-in-law was 
arrested for bribing a police officer with a suitcase of money months before, 
Andrade had fingered his bookie as the bagman.

BALKANS; U.N. REPORT ON BOSNIA MISSION DETAILS PROBLEMS; SECRETARY GENERAL 
BOUTROS-GHALI CITES LACK OF PEACEKEEPERS, RESOURCES AND COMPROMISED 
IMPARTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Should the United Nations have peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Critics 
deride them. Snipers attack them. U.N. members lag in paying their costs. Many 
countries -- especially the United States -- refuse to let their troops take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent philosophical overview of the difficulties of operating in the 
Bosnian quagmire, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali concluded that since 
a settlement of the war may "at last be within reach," it is best to soldier 
on. But his enthusiasm is muted. 
</P>
<P>
 The overview -- a report to the Security Council on more than two years of war 
in the former Yugoslav federation -- has not received much notice. But it is a 
remarkable analysis that reflects the secretary general's personal feelings 
about what went wrong with the U.N. mission there. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last month, the U.N. had more than 30,000 peacekeepers in the former 
Yugoslav federation: 14,600 in Croatia, 14,400 in Bosnia and 1,050 in 
Macedonia. Since establishing the force known as UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection 
Force) in 1992, the Security Council has adopted 54 resolutions and issued 39 
statements that, in one way or another, have redefined or added to the work of 
the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 A frustrating theme runs through the report: The Security Council has piled on 
missions for UNPROFOR without giving it the necessary troop strength and 
resources. On top of this, Boutros-Ghali believes that the Security Council, by 
assigning the United Nations the task of repelling Serbian aggression in 
certain areas, compromised the United Nations' impartiality -- "which remains 
the key to its effectiveness in fulfilling its humanitarian responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 In his assessment, the secretary general reaches these conclusions:

 * Although they never completely secured Sarajevo's airport from antiaircraft 
fire, the peacekeepers managed to keep it open enough of the time so that 9,200 
flights carrying 95,000 tons of relief supplies could reach the area in a 
little more than a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks on convoys, roadblocks and warfare hampered the distribution of food 
throughout Bosnia, but these relief efforts -- combined with two mild winters 
and "the resilience of the population" -- prevented widespread malnutrition and 
"mitigated the worst effects of the breakdown in essential services." 
</P>
<P>
 * Through warnings and the shooting down of four Bosnian Serb planes Feb. 28, 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization almost entirely stopped the flights of 
combat planes over Bosnia. But noncombat planes have violated the "no-fly" zone 
with impunity, defying the United Nations more than a thousand times in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * The presence of U.N. peacekeepers deterred Bosnian Serb forces from mounting 
major assaults on those towns declared "safe areas" by the Security Council, 
but the "living conditions in the safe areas remain appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the safe area of Sarajevo, Boutros-Ghali said the Bosnian capital 
until recently "suffered heavy shelling and sniping, some of it provoked by 
offensive actions undertaken by forces" of the Bosnian government. Relative 
peace finally came to Sarajevo only after NATO threatened to bomb the Serbian 
forces if they did not stop their siege. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boutros-Ghali, clearly frustrated, said the United Nations cannot defend 
the other safe areas of Bosnia without more troops "equipped adequately to 
counter the besieging forces and defend UNPROFOR positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he concluded that "the tragedy that provoked UNPROFOR's 
involvement remains an affront to the world's conscience. Abstention is not an 
acceptable option for the international community at such a time." 30,000 on 
Duty

 The United Nations had more than 30,000 peacekeepers in the former Yugoslav 
federation as of mid-March.

SCHOOLS CHIEF RESIGNS IN N.Y. BUDGET BATTLE; EDUCATION: CHANCELLOR SAID HE 
REFUSED TO FIRE TWO STAFF MEMBERS TO AVOID NAMING OF FISCAL MONITOR. GIULIANI 
DENIES CHARGE THAT HE URGED THE FIRINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 The head of the nation's largest school system, accusing New York's Mayor 
Rudolph W. Giuliani of "nothing short of blackmail," resigned suddenly Friday 
in what appeared to be a classic political struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, in a bitter letter, announced that he 
would step down in June after Giuliani appointed a special monitor Friday to 
oversee the Board of Education's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's new mayor, who faces a $2.3-billion budget deficit in the next 
fiscal year, had been pressuring Cortines to fire 2,500 administrators. He had 
called Cortines a captive of the board's "bloated bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 But in his letter of resignation, Cortines, who served as San Francisco's 
school superintendent before coming to New York last year, accused Giuliani of 
motives other than pure budget management and educational concerns in his 
appointment of former Rep. Herman Badillo (D-N.Y.), a Giuliani ally, to examine 
the school system's finances. The city contributes more than $3 billion to the 
schools, Giuliani said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The appointment of the fiscal monitor was conditioned instead on my firing 
two senior staff members of the school system," the chancellor charged. "They 
told me that if I fired them by noon, no fiscal monitor would be appointed. If 
I did not fire them, the fiscal monitor would be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very simple for me -- my integrity is not for sale . . . " Cortines 
declared. "Board of Education staff must be free to do their duty on behalf of 
New York City's schoolchildren and the school system. Neither of these 
employees did anything other than defend the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the employees was identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am frankly shocked that anyone in the mayor's office would think that I 
would even consider firing anyone who was doing good work in good faith on 
behalf of the school system," he said. "It is nothing short of blackmail, and 
obviously I could not succumb. It would have been morally wrong to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani and Cortines met last night to discuss budget cuts. At that meeting, 
Cortines charged, Giuliani and Deputy Mayor Peter Powers demanded the two staff 
terminations in return for not naming the fiscal overseer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristyne Lategano, Giuliani's press secretary, denied the charge. She said 
that the mayor had only suggested to Cortines that there were untrustworthy 
members of his staff and did not say who he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources indicated, however, that particular unhappiness existed within the 
Giuliani administration over the employment by the chancellor of an assistant 
press secretary who reportedly had worked for former Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
Giuliani defeated Dinkins in a bitter election in November. These sources said 
that the former Dinkins appointee had been particularly critical of New York's 
new Republican mayor as he discussed the school system's budget position. 
</P>
<P>
 But Giuliani firmly denied Friday that Cortines had been urged to fire members 
of his senior staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not telling the truth about it . . . " Giuliani said.

CHINA DETAINS DISSIDENT DURING FRENCH PREMIER'S VISIT; HUMAN RIGHTS: PRIME 
MINISTER BALLADUR, ON FENCE-MENDING MISSION, DECLINES TO COMMENT ON INCIDENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Chinese police detained a veteran pro-democracy activist Friday as visiting 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur called for improved economic ties with 
China but refrained from commenting on Beijing's human rights situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police detained Xu Wenli at his Beijing home early Thursday, interrogated him 
overnight and took him into custody again Friday five minutes after he was 
released, his wife told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The detention of Xu, 50, comes one week after authorities rearrested the 
country's most prominent political dissident, Wei Jingsheng. The two men edited 
underground journals promoting democratic reform during the Democracy Wall 
Movement of 1978-1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei served nearly 15 years in jail before his release last September. Xu, 
considered one of China's more moderate dissidents, was released last May after 
12 years in solitary confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has repeatedly criticized China for its human rights record. 
Under an executive order issued by President Clinton last year, China must show 
"overall, significant progress" in seven human rights areas for its 
preferential trading status to be renewed this June. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei was one of several dissidents picked up by authorities last month during a 
visit here by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Chinese officials were 
defiant in the face of Christopher's calls for human rights improvements, and 
Beijing has yet to make good on the few promises it made toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday, Balladur, who had come to mend fences with 
Beijing, was asked four times to comment on the detentions of the two 
dissidents. He declined each time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not wish to add anything on the subject, having said in private what I 
wished to say," he told reporters. "You can accomplish more by being discreet." 
</P>
<P>
 When Western journalists tried to find out from Xu's wife, Kang Tong, why he 
had been detained, one of the police officers around Xu's home dragged her away 
with his hand clasped over her mouth, according to David Schlesinger, a 
reporter for the British news service Reuters who was present. The journalists 
were accused of breaking the law and questioned for about 45 minutes before 
they were allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told reporters after Balladur's 
meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng that there had 
been no discussion of either Xu or Wei. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu also attacked the United States as the only country in the world that 
continues to link China's trade privileges to human rights. Such links do not 
exist between China and European countries or between China and Japan, he said. 
He added that he was not aware of Friday's detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur said France's goal was to raise its profile in Asia, and increased 
trade with China is a central element of that plan. Relations between Paris and 
Beijing have been chilly since France sold Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan, 
China's archenemy, nearly 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fighter plane sale, China closed the French Consulate in the 
southern city of Guangzhou in late 1992 and shut many French businesses out of 
the Chinese market. Estimates of the resulting lost sales are as high as $1 
billion. The ban on French deals was lifted in January when France agreed to 
curb its arms sales to Taiwan.

JAPAN SEEMS READY TO LET GO OF STATUS QUO, LEADERS SAY; POLITICS: HOSOKAWA'S 
SUCCESSOR WILL STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ECONOMIC FRUSTRATIONS, BUSINESS 
EXECUTIVES SUGGEST. 
</P>

 In all the biting American criticisms of Japan's economic practices, nothing 
matches the bitter language of Ichiro Ozawa in his book "Blueprint for a New 
Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers are owned like pets by their companies, and housing is offered as the 
equivalent of dog food," Ozawa declared. "Workers receive notices of transfers 
to distant places in a single memo; families are divided. . . . Promises of 
shorter working hours never materialize . . . people even die from overwork. . 
. . An economic and social framework that emphasizes cooperative, long-term 
relationships seems nothing more than a closed society, one that bars foreign 
companies or any other outsiders from entering." 
</P>
<P>
 These words come not from a cynic on the fringes of Japanese society but 
rather from the heavyweight leader who helped bring Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's reformist coalition to power last August after 38 years of 
conservative rule. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Hosokawa, embroiled in a personal scandal, suddenly announced that 
he will resign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the frustration that precipitated Ozawa's outburst in the book he wrote a 
year ago remains. Not only trading partners abroad -- especially the United 
States -- but also business leaders and the general public here are growing 
increasingly aggravated with the Japanese status quo. And not since the 
post-World War II U.S. occupation has Japan appeared so ripe for reform -- 
which Hosokawa's successor will have to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reform of Japan is a general idea of the Japanese people, not just 
Hosokawa," said Kenji Mizutani, vice president of Tokai Research & Consulting 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunio Miyamoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Life Research Institute, added, 
"Nobody can go against this movement for reform if they want to survive as a 
political leader." 
</P>
<P>
 The vision offered by Ozawa is of a Japan that would put more value on 
individuals and innovation; the economy would be freed of the shackles of 
bureaucratic controls and would grow not through exports but by providing the 
Japanese with bigger homes and higher living standards. This is also a Japan 
that the Clinton Administration would like to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa drew his vision, however, not merely in response to the huge Japanese 
trade surpluses that the United States wants reduced. Instead, he was reacting 
to his nation's own situation: Battered by the country's worst postwar 
recession, Japan's entire system is groaning under multiple strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations face plummeting profits or even losses. Stocks have recovered 
only half of their peak value in 1989. Banks are loaded down with bad loans 
that are still climbing. Real estate prices, already slashed in half, are still 
falling. The aging of the population is undermining this nation's lifetime 
employment and seniority pay systems as companies become overloaded with highly 
paid older workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the yen is so strong that an export-based recovery is virtually 
impossible. Last year, despite a record global trade surplus of $120 billion, 
the economy went flat with a bare 0.1% growth. And almost $300 billion worth of 
pump-priming measures have failed to get Japan moving again. Only faint signs 
of a recovery in consumer spending have appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, many economists warn that a cyclical recovery may be incapable of 
resurrecting the healthy growth of the past. The Industrial Bank of Japan 
recently warned that potential growth through the rest of the century would 
barely exceed 2% a year if business investment remained at current levels. By 
comparison, between 1985 and 1990, the economy grew by an average of nearly 5% 
a year in real terms. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed, Ozawa and many economists insist, is a sweeping overhaul of 
government regulations that prevent new entries into established industries, 
restrain competition, stifle innovation and even block development of entirely 
new businesses. Unleashing pent-up demand is the key. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. demands for an opening of Japan's markets, backed up by threats of 
retaliation, spurred Hosokawa into setting a June deadline for developing a 
plan to accomplish that task. 
</P>
<P>
 That pledge will remain in place no matter who becomes the next prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, due to be presented to President Clinton when he meets with the 
Japanese prime minister at the Naples summit of advanced industrialized 
democracies in July, promises to set the course of future U.S.-Japan economic 
relations -- either toward cooperation or collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor scorned the first-stage, 
market-opening plan that Hosokawa's government announced. Kantor called it a 
"half-finished work" that did not satisfy U.S. concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real battle in Japan over reform lies between now and June, and "it's 
going to be a bloody fight," predicted Yoshiji Nogami, deputy of the Foreign 
Ministry's policy division. "Housing, regulation of land, telecommunications, 
the distribution system, transport -- these are the major areas" for 
deregulation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what to do, but no one is daring to do it," Nogami added. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing government regulations that preserve price-gouging, for example, 
could slash by about half the differential that Japanese pay in higher prices 
compared to the United States, said Iwao Nakatani, a professor at Hitotsubashi 
University outside Tokyo who is a member of a government commission to promote 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings from lower prices could add a consumption-led expansion of 2% to 
Japan's GNP over a five-year period, he said. But the Catch-22 would be a loss 
of 6.88 million jobs in industries stripped of regulation, Nakatani admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Radical restructuring is difficult because many of the good things about 
Japanese society are the flip side of its problems, said T. W. Kang, a business 
consultant here. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fundamental shift in Japan's tightly coupled 'village society' -- where 
everyone shares the pains and the fruits -- must occur if the Japanese economy 
is to be globalized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a major crack appeared in the village as the end of 38 years of 
rule by the Liberal Democratic Party brought to power Hosokawa's coalition. 
That shattered the cozy relations in which LDP powerbrokers acted as lobbyists 
with the bureaucracy on behalf of interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Keidanren (Federation of Economic Organizations), the nation's most powerful 
business group, which supported only the Liberal Democrats for nearly four 
decades, no longer collects funds for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Masaya Miyoshi, Keidanren president, even described their fall as "part of 
necessary social reform. Excessive political stability held back necessary 
social change and was politically, economically and socially stifling," Miyoshi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a new electoral system enacted under Hosokawa will reduce the 
inflated clout that rural voters have enjoyed until now. Eventually, new 
single-seat districts in the lower house could force the 10 parties, which the 
former multi-seat constituencies had nurtured, to merge into two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa, for one, envisions that Japanese politics in the future will be marked 
less by pork-barrel promises than real debate over policies and the reins of 
government passing back and forth between two major parties. 
</P>
<P>
 While political reform has enjoyed strong public support, many Japanese are 
uneasy about letting deregulation go so far that individual and corporate 
competition becomes as harsh as it is in the United States. Japanese must not 
"let American criticism blind ourselves to the system's basic strengths," 
warned commentator Yusuke Fukada. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms should maintain their employee-first philosophy, rejecting the 
shareholder-first principle of the United States as "hopelessly unstable," he 
wrote in the magazine Sansara. They also should not only preserve but 
strengthen long-term keiretsu (business group) ties with suppliers, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession and fears about unemployment have stirred unprecedented 
uncertainty about the future and uneasiness about change. A government poll 
released last month found that a record 46.4% of the people surveyed feared 
that Japan was heading in "a bad direction." 
</P>
<P>
 For every 100 people looking for work, only 60 jobs are available. 
Unemployment is still below 3%, but if the number of "excessive" workers 
carried on payrolls for the sake of maintaining lifetime employment is counted, 
potential unemployment is about 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloated payrolls are blamed, in part, for spurring manufacturers to increase 
exports during periods of sluggishness to keep factories operating. 
</P>
<P>
 While the high growth in the past sustained a seniority pay system, now, with 
an outlook for only stable or reduced production, "we can't help but revise our 
seniority system," said Kazuhide Watanabe, Mazda's director of personnel and 
human development. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a labor federation that includes department store workers has proposed 
dropping seniority pay in favor of merit-based wages and "revising" lifetime 
employment by increasing part-time staff. 
</P>
<P>
 And Honda has announced a program under which managers who are not promoted 
will be transferred to non-managerial jobs and suffer pay cuts of up to 30%. 
Junior managers will be permitted to stay in their jobs no longer than 12 
years; senior managers for up to nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most corporations are actively paring payrolls by dismissing temporary 
workers, reducing the regular work force through attrition, cutting 
recruitment, encouraging early retirement, dispatching surplus workers to 
affiliated firms with low pay scales and slashing bonuses and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Belt-tightening has taken a toll on workers' income. At Mazda, workers won a 
3.8% pay increase for 1993 but actually wound up with 6.6% less income than in 
1992 because of cuts in overtime and bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Japanese consumer habits are changing in ways that help boost 
imports. The old quality-at-any-price consciousness is giving way to 
bargain-hunting. Discount stores such as Aoyama Trading Co. are buying men's 
suits made in China and selling them for as little as $95, compared to prices 
eight times as high at department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, price cuts by U.S. firms produced an upheaval in the personal 
computer market. Apple gained a 13.4% share, consolidating its position as 
Japan's No. 2 best-seller. Overall, U.S. makers held a 23.8% share, up from 
15.1% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Yen appreciation, which lowers the cost of imports, is forcing manufacturers 
to seek their own form of bargain-hunting overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a historic turnabout, Japan for the first time last year imported more 
television sets than it exported, thanks in large part to "reverse imports," or 
purchases from Japanese plants overseas. Similarly, Japanese auto makers were 
importing from their own plants in the United States more American-built cars 
than all of Detroit's Big Three put together. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas investment in manufacturing, although down from an annual peak of 
$16.3 billion in 1990, is still running at about $10 billion a year. Yet 
manufacturing still accounts for 28% of Japan's economy -- 10% higher than in 
the United States -- and Japan's biggest industries remain heavily structured 
toward exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem, however, continues to lie in the mind-set of bureaucrats, 
businessmen and even ordinary Japanese. The people here know that change is 
needed to revitalize their system. But their fundamental instincts still 
gravitate toward the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than a decade of administrative reforms, the number of national 
government regulations actually has grown -- to about 11,300, with 300 added 
just last year. And even now the Fair Trade Commission allows 159 cartels to 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese are taught from childhood that Japan lacks natural resources and must 
export to survive by adding value to imported raw materials through 
manufacturing. Even the tiny number of grass-roots movements that have 
developed under the name of "consumer organizations" seldom question prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there are market rigidities in Japan that work against the 
interests of the consumers, but there are no real consumers. They are producers 
because they are employed by producer companies . . . and they are most 
concerned about their jobs," said Kazuo Nukazawa, managing director of 
Keidanren. "When they are buying things, they want to buy cheaply. But when 
they are afraid of keener competition and the probability of bankruptcy, they 
resist (deregulation) along with the companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a stronger leader emerges as Hosokawa's successor, implementation of 
reforms will be "very difficult, because the obstacles come from Japanese 
society itself," Mizutani said. "Every society has its own habits and customs 
coming from its long history."

U.S. ENVOY TRIES TO RESCUE BOSNIA TALKS; BALKANS: DIPLOMAT WARNS MUSLIMS AND 
SERBS TO STOP FIGHTING AND START NEGOTIATING. HE SEES 'POSSIBILITIES' IN THE 
CURRENT CLIMATE.

 U.S. special envoy Charles Redman appealed to Bosnia's warring factions Friday 
to accept a cease-fire and begin negotiations expected to result in an ethnic 
partitioning of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. diplomat's visit followed a week of contradictory signals from 
Washington about the United States' willingness to use air power to halt the 
latest Bosnian Serb rebel offensive, which is disrupting negotiations aimed at 
ending the 2-year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman joined the U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, in 
warning Bosnia's Muslims and Serbs that fighting should stop immediately if 
either expects Western assistance in working out an overall peace settlement 
and rebuilding war-ravaged cities such as Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Redman and Rose spoke of positive signs that a cease-fire could be 
reached soon but also cautioned that more time is needed to bring together the 
government and Serbian rebel commanders, who refused again Friday even to meet 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Another round of shuttle diplomacy was set for today.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're continuing the talks. They're still going in a positive way," Rose told 
reporters as he left a meeting with Bosnian government leaders and headed for a 
Bosnian Serb military base in nearby Lukavica. 
</P>
<P>
 Redman described the atmosphere as offering "some possibilities" but conceded 
that it might take a few days to explore them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told reporters, "I don't think there is 
an agreement yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government had agreed late Thursday to a 24-hour halt in 
fighting as a goodwill gesture while considering Rose's plan for a permanent 
truce; Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic reciprocated by 
declaring that his forces would also hold fire. 
</P>
<P>
 While Serbian shelling of Gorazde appeared to have subsided somewhat Friday, 
there were later reports that it had resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Rob Annink said fighting continued in many areas of Bosnia, and 
the situation in Gorazde remained "unstable and tense." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman was dispatched to the Balkans to try to rescue the stumbling peace 
process after Clinton Administration critics and Bosnian government officials 
accused the United States of encouraging the Serbian assault on Gorazde by 
saying that no threat of North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes would 
be made to deter it. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said such an intervention was not 
being contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Secretary of State Warren Christopher and National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake have since suggested that U.S. air power might be used to protect 
U.N. peacekeepers if they are deployed to protect Gorazde, one of six U.N. 
"safe areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources involved in Redman's talks here said he had come with a message that 
the Sarajevo government should resign itself to a restructured Bosnia that 
would include about half the former Yugoslav republic's territory and give up 
the notion that more land could be recovered on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs account for 31% of Bosnia's population but claim the right to rule over 
all conquered land.

 A judge has thrown out five of the six charges against a man accused of 
conspiring to ship explosives detonators to the Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John Roll dismissed all but one charge against Patrick 
Moley, 30, at the close of the prosecution's case against him and five other 
co-defendants Thursday. Roll rejected a defense motion to dismiss charges 
against the other five defendants.

 Moley still faces a conspiracy charge for allegedly aiding in the purchase of 
2,900 mining detonators in Tucson in 1989 and attempting to purchase a $50,000

CRIMEA-UKRAINE TENSIONS RISE WITH DUELING DECREES; POLITICS: KRAVCHUK STRIKES 
BACK AFTER PRESIDENT OF INDEPENDENCE-MINDED REGION ISSUES ORDERS ON DRAFTEES, 
TIME ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government and the separatist-minded Crimean region have launched a battle 
of decrees, and the tit-for-tat volley is causing concern that the paper war 
could escalate into a real one. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with what he considers a popular mandate to make the Black Sea peninsula 
independent, Crimean President Yuri Meshkov ordered Crimean draftees in the 
Ukrainian armed forces to serve their duty on the peninsula. Then he put Crimea 
on Moscow time, one hour ahead of the rest of Ukraine; defied Kiev by holding a 
referendum on expanding Crimea's autonomy as well as his own powers, and fired 
the Kiev-appointed head of Crimean television, who had refused to give 
Meshkov's legislative candidates more than equal time. 
</P>
<P>
 After what his critics called too long and tolerant a silence, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk fired off his own decrees. While the Crimean leader 
was traveling with his family in Cyprus this week, Kravchuk rescinded Meshkov's 
ukase on the draft and reinstated the television executive. He dispatched a 
trouble-shooter to keep an eye on the increasingly volatile peninsula. Crimean 
clocks, however, remain on Moscow time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine's leadership is willing to give the Crimea the widest economic 
autonomy," Kravchuk said. "But we will not agree to increasing its military or 
political powers." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning home Wednesday, Meshkov dismissed the counter-decrees as "political 
provocations." One of his aides said Friday, "We will do what we promised." 
</P>
<P>
 Meshkov's real power is limited. He has no direct control of troops or police 
-- no way to enforce his decrees with muscle. But popular support for 
independence could work to his advantage. For example, a Ukrainian army that 
already has trouble conscripting Crimean men might be persuaded to let them 
serve on the peninsula if the alternative is a higher rate of draft-dodging and 
desertion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crimean president, elected over a pro-Ukrainian candidate Jan. 30, seems 
to wield a powerful mandate. Almost 80% of those who took part in his March 27 
referendum voted "yes" on a constitutional question that, in effect, declared 
Crimea independent. Candidates favoring independence and closer ties with 
Russia led in Crimean legislative elections on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the referendum is not legally binding, Oleksandr Kulyk, editor of the 
peninsula's only Ukrainian newspaper, predicts that "within six months, the 
forces that have seated Meshkov on his throne will use this 'innocent' poll to 
push him into more separatist exploits." 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics point out that because the voter turnout was 60% of those 
eligible, the 80% of voters who supported independence amount to less than half 
the Crimean electorate. They say that Meshkov's radicalism could polarize the 
peninsula between the urban, Russian-dominated south and the agricultural, 
Ukrainian-leaning north. "No one wants to be another Yugoslavia, but this is 
leading to confrontation," said Vasyl Bohutsky, who also works for the 
Ukrainian newspaper. "We are all alarmed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the tinderbox of Crimean-Ukrainian relations, even a comedy of errors can 
have ominous overtones. So when Adm. Eduard Baltin, the Russian commander of 
the Black Sea Fleet, was shot in the thigh last weekend, Crimea was abuzz with 
rumors of assassination plots by Ukrainian nationalists. That is, until the 
fleet's press office revealed that Baltin's gun went off accidentally while he 
was at his dacha. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when a Ukrainian military delegation visited the convalescing admiral in 
his Crimean hospital room, Russian television reported that Ukraine was beefing 
up its forces on the peninsula. Taking the report seriously, Meshkov's chief of 
staff accused Kiev of trying to block Meshkov's return from Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 Meshkov was, indeed, having problems getting home. Turkey refused permission 
for his chartered flight to cross its airspace. But Ukrainian officials say 
there was hardly a plot afoot. In his zeal to prove Crimea's independence, 
Meshkov ignored the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and traveled without a proper 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohutsky, the Ukrainian journalist in Crimea, believes the episode is just a 
taste of things to come. "Just watch, no matter what goes wrong in Crimea, 
Meshkov will blame it all on Kiev and Kravchuk," he said.

RUSSIAN LOSES ROUND, GETS IN FIGHT; MOSCOW: AFTER BILL THAT WOULD HAVE EXPELLED 
PARTY DEFECTORS FROM THE DUMA FAILS, ZHIRINOVSKY ACCOSTS A ONETIME ALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky suffered a setback Friday with the defeat of a 
proposed law that would have forced the growing number of high-ranking 
defectors from his neo-fascist party to give up their seats in Russia's 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The bully boy of Russian politics reacted in typical fashion. During a recess 
of the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, he accosted one of the defectors in 
a hall and got into a fistfight. Witnesses said two Zhirinovsky bodyguards 
grabbed the arms of the defector, Vladimir Borzyuk, while the neo-fascist 
leader smashed Borzyuk's head against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky attacked another lawmaker, Valery Borshchyov, who tried to 
intervene. "You scum, I'll have you rot in jail!" Zhirinovsky was heard yelling 
at him. "I'll tear your beard out hair by hair!" 
</P>
<P>
 Before lawmakers and security guards restored order, Zhirinovsky snatched and 
destroyed the tape recorder of a Moscow magazine reporter who was trying to 
capture the sound of the fray. The journalist's glasses were also broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Zhirinovsky's party stunned the world with its strong showing in the 
December parliamentary elections, there has been little relief from his 
extremist statements and outrageous behavior, which Russians are coming to 
regard as his natural manner of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind Friday's fistfight -- Zhirinovsky's second at the Duma this year -- 
was his frustration over a steady trickle of defections that have undermined 
his considerable power to shape the country's laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling for a revival of Russia's empire and a brutal crackdown on crime, 
Zhirinovsky's misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party won 24% of the vote 
in the December elections. It holds the second-largest bloc in the 450-seat 
Duma, after the reformist Russia's Choice movement. Members of the extremist 
party head five of the Duma's 23 committees. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Duma first convened, Zhirinovsky could do something no other 
political leader could do -- deliver every vote from his bloc on every issue 
before Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 But then cracks appeared in the Liberal Democratic facade. Viktor Kobelev, who 
ran the party's election campaign, launched an effort in February to oust 
Zhirinovsky as party leader. He was later joined by Anatoly Kashpirovsky, a 
well-known television hypnotist, and four other Duma members outraged by their 
leader's rude behavior and imperialist statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky reacted by holding a party congress last weekend, expelling the 
dissidents and having himself declared party chairman with dictatorial powers 
until the year 2004. Then in the Duma, he introduced a bill that would expel 
from that body any lawmaker who breaks from the party whose ticket he was 
elected on -- and replace him in the Duma with another member of the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was defeated Friday after it gained little support outside 
Zhirinovsky's party, and Kobelev predicted that other Liberal Democratic 
lawmakers will soon quit and become independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's setback in the Duma is only one sign of his waning fortunes. The 
party gained little support in recent local elections across Russia and is so 
poor that it has appealed to the government for 1 billion rubles (about 
$575,000) in annual subsidies. Public opinion polls continue to show that most 
Russians don't trust Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Among opponents of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, he has been upstaged in 
recent weeks by former Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi, leader of last 
October's armed anti-government rebellion. Rutskoi and other hard-liners walked 
out of prison in February thanks to an amnesty pushed, ironically, by 
Zhirinovsky.

U.S. RESCUE MISSION IN RWANDA WOULD POSE HIGH-RISK PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States would face high-risk tactical and logistic problems in 
trying to mount a military rescue operation to evacuate about 255 Americans 
trapped in Rwanda, defense analysts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest difficulty would be determining how to get a sizable enough 
contingent there quickly. The only U.S. military forces near Rwanda are about 
2,200 Marines aboard the amphibious assault ship Peleliu now sailing off the 
coast of Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rwanda, which is inland and several hundred miles from the Indian Ocean, 
cannot be reached by means of an amphibious landing and is too far from the 
coast for the Marines to get there by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, analysts said, the most likely option would be to send Army 
special forces units, flown in either from Nairobi or Mombasa, to staging areas 
in neighboring Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 But that kind of operation might not be as simple as it sounds, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it remained unclear whether the airport at Kigali, the Rwandan 
capital, is secure enough for U.S. troops to land. If it is not, the operation 
could require an advance assault by parachute-borne Ranger troops, who would 
have to be deployed from somewhere in Europe, to seize the airport forcibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the airport is secure, regular Army units could be flown in. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Harry Summers, a former Pentagon strategist, suggested that U.S. rescue 
forces might not meet any opposition. "Normally, these people wouldn't want war 
with the U.S.," he said. "They'd probably just let us go." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Rwandans decided to mount a defense -- or if guerrilla troops chose 
to impede U.S. forces with sniper fire -- it could add substantially to the 
difficulty, military experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the U.S. special forces troops could be facing house-to-house 
fighting in a city that is unfamiliar to U.S. units. "It could get really 
nasty," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no U.S. military forces in Rwanda. By agreement between the two 
countries, the American Embassy in the capital city of Kigali is guarded by 
Rwandan troops, not U.S. Marines. Complicating the situation, dozens of 
non-Americans have taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that any rescue operation probably would be carried out by light 
infantry units, using only Humvee vehicles and perhaps some light trucks. No 
tanks or artillery would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States could also send AC-130H Spectre gunships, equipped with 
precision-guided cannon that are especially effective in supporting ground 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Pentagon probably would coordinate its moves with French 
and Belgian military commanders, with whom it was consulting late Friday. 
Military forces from both countries have broad experience in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 If Belgian or French forces were used, the U.S. military almost certainly 
would provide the long-range airlift to transport them to Rwanda. Neither 
Belgium nor France has sufficient airlift power to do the job, military 
analysts said.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said a rescue effort in Rwanda would contrast sharply with other 
similar operations in recent years. In the 1990 evacuation of Americans from 
Liberia, for example, the job was handled easily by a Marine Expeditionary 
Unit, which was able to stage an amphibious landing because Liberia is on the 
African coast. In Grenada, in 1983, the rescue effort was made simpler because 
Grenada is an island and because it was easy to secure the airport, enabling 
the Army to send troops en masse.

CANADIANS TROUBLED BY OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE; CRIME: A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AND A 
KILLING DURING A RESTAURANT ROBBERY ARE FUELING FEARS. 
</P>

 Four young gunmen crash into an upscale Toronto cafe to rob and pistol-whip 
the customers; one inexplicably fires a blast from his sawed-off shotgun, 
killing a 23-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 A British engineer, who recently moved to Ottawa, is murdered in the city's 
first-ever drive-by shooting. Three boys -- two aged 16 and one 17 years old -- 
are charged with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in the Niagara Falls area prepare for the trial of a self-employed 
accountant accused, with his wife, of the sex slayings of two teen-age girls. 
There may be at least one more victim -- the wife's 14-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
 A deadly new brand of heroin starts selling on the streets of Vancouver, 
followed by a surge in fatal overdoses. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this peaceful, orderly, crime-free Canada? That's the question more and 
more Canadians are asking themselves these days. Although overall crime rates 
here are relatively stable -- and far below those in the United States -- 
recent outbreaks of high-profile violence are leading to fears that Canadian 
cities are headed the way of their crime-plagued U.S. counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest example was the murder Tuesday night of Georgina Leimonis, a 
telephone operator shotgunned while having cake with friends at Just Desserts, 
a crowded restaurant in this city's trendy Annex district. The bloody deed 
tapped into the Toronto psyche as much as the recent murders of two students 
from Japan and the 1988 gang killing of Karen Toshima have in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no arrests as yet, and the murder is the No. 1 topic in the 
city's three daily newspapers, on news broadcasts and on radio talk shows, 
pushing aside such favorite topics as the upcoming Stanley Cup playoffs and the 
seemingly endless winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mindless violence belongs to New York, to Los Angeles, to Miami -- not to 
Toronto and Ottawa. Our robbers and our teen-agers aren't supposed to behave 
that way," wrote columnist Michael Valpy in Thursday's Toronto Globe & Mail, 
the nation's leading newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto Police Chief William McCormack called the murder a "filthy act of . . 
. urban terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 The department's top homicide detective urged residents to clip the fuzzy 
front-page photos of the suspects taken off the cafe's video surveillance 
camera and "tape them to your car's visor, so that you will recognize them when 
you see them." 
</P>
<P>
 A cartoon in Friday's editions of the Toronto Star depicts a local couple 
watching televised footage of U.S. crime while muttering "Crazy Americans!" 
Meanwhile, their own front door is being kicked in by someone firing a bullet 
into their ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Local and provincial politicians and callers to local radio talk shows have 
voiced the predictable calls for tough new legislation: further tightening of 
Canada's already restrictive gun laws; a crackdown on youthful offenders 
(although the age of the killers has not been released); some even have 
suggested a return to capital punishment, abolished here in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time this sort of thing happens in Canada it's such a shock to the 
system that a lot of the questions we thought we had the answers to are brought 
back into focus," said radio talk show host Andy Barrie, who has fielded calls 
on the murder for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime rates in Canadian cities remain startlingly low by U.S. standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in metropolitan Toronto, population 2.27 million, there were 58 
homicides reported, down from 65 the year before. In greater Montreal, 
population 1.77 million, there were 71 homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare that to Los Angeles, population 3.6 million, where 1,058 homicides 
were reported in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics for other violent crimes are much the same. The exception would 
seem to be gun-related robberies in Toronto, which have risen from 270 in 1989 
to 1,072 last year, according to a Globe & Mail report. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how low the crime numbers are, they are still profoundly 
disturbing to Canadians -- after all, noted Barrie, "if we have one more 
drive-by shooting in the country, it would be twice as many as we had before." 
And Valpy observed that the recent violence strikes at the Canadian self-image 
of an orderly, peaceful people. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened at Just Desserts and in Ottawa goes so far beyond our 
experience of predictable behavior in Toronto or Ottawa or Canada for that 
matter . . . that it pushes all the buttons," Valpy said in an interview 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four young men entered Just Desserts around 11 p.m. There were about 30 
customers present, including a 7-year-old boy. Although some customers resisted 
turning over their valuables to the robbers, Leimonis did not, and it was still 
unclear Friday what prompted the fatal gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the killing was also strong because it occurred in The Annex, a 
gentrified area just blocks from Bloor Street, Toronto's version of Beverly 
Hills' Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Doob, professor of criminology at the University of Toronto, citing 
Canada's low crime rates, said the "it can happen to anyone" rhetoric is blown 
vastly out of proportion: "What's special about this (case) is that it's 
unusual. That's why people are still talking about it three days after it 
happened. But the fact that it is unusual seems to have been lost in the 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 What is not unusual, he added, at least from a historical standpoint, is 
complaints that U.S.-style crime is creeping northward. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an undertone of racism has been evident in some comments. 
Leimonis was white, her assailants black. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Canada, by law, does not compile criminal statistics by race, one 
white member of the local police commission suggested Thursday that "a very 
large percentage" of violent crime was committed by blacks. He was immediately 
repudiated by some other board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the closed restaurant has become a shrine of sorts. There were so 
many floral tributes, some with handwritten messages, piled in the window 
Friday morning that it looked like a florist shop. Read one of the notes: "In 
memory of innocence lost."

TREATY BINDS MOSCOW TO HELP NORTH KOREA, RUSSIAN OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior Russian official said Friday that Moscow would be bound by a treaty 
with Pyongyang to help North Korea, which is at the center of a dispute over 
its nuclear program, if it were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have informed North Koreans as well as South Koreans and the United States 
that Russia, as the country which is a legitimate successor of the Soviet 
Union, is carrying obligations from treaties which are still in force," said 
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Panov, a former ambassador to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is natural that if we say tomorrow that we will not follow our obligations 
taken from the Soviet Union, there will be (a) mess. . . . Russia will always 
help North Korea if North Korea is unprovokedly attacked. This we say by 
ourselves. This is our own decision; it will be taken according to our 
legislation, our constitution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council, including Russia and China, last week issued a 
mildly worded statement calling on Pyongyang to allow unhampered inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Panov proposed an international conference to resolve the issue.

CLINTON MAKES PERSONAL PLEA IN CANING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has made a new personal plea to Singapore President Ong Teng 
Cheong for clemency in the case of Michael Fay, an American youth who has been 
sentenced to be caned with a rattan rod for vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides said Friday that Clinton wrote to the Singapore president 
Tuesday urging that Fay not be caned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay was sentenced March 3 to six strokes of the cane, four months in jail and 
a fine of $2,000 for spray-painting cars and other offenses. Clinton previously 
called the sentence "extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 The intensely painful punishment, a common one in Singapore for crimes ranging 
from rape to vandalism, is administered with a split rattan rod that leaves its 
victims bleeding and scarred for life.

FROM VOTING TO RAISE PAY FOR FEDERAL JUDICIARY JOBS, THEN MOVING ON TO FILL 
THEM. SENATOR VOTED TO HIKE SALARIES.

 Signaling rising concern, the White House Friday asked Justice Department 
lawyers for a formal opinion on a constitutional issue that could complicate a 
nomination of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Special Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler, who in recent days has sought to 
minimize the issue, asked the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel for 
its view on whether a sitting U.S. senator who voted to raise the pay of the 
federal judiciary can later sit on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arises because of a section of the Constitution called the 
"emoluments clause" that was intended to keep lawmakers from creating 
comfortable federal jobs, then moving on to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials, citing precedents in executive branch appointments, 
insisted that they remain confident of their view that such a move can be made 
constitutional if the judge's salary is lowered to where it stood before the 
lawmaker's tenure in Congress. But they acknowledged that a contrary Justice 
Department opinion, issued in 1987 on the possible nomination of Republican 
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah to the court, had raised points that needed to be 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a constitutionally frivolous question," said Joel Klein, deputy 
White House counsel. "There has been no court to rule on it (and) thus it is an 
issue that needs to be fully and carefully considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell emerged as a leading candidate when 85-year-old Justice Harry A. 
Blackmun announced Wednesday that he plans to retire after 24 years on the high 
court. While White House officials have denied publicly that there is a 
front-runner, one senior Administration official said Friday that the Maine 
senator almost certainly will be Clinton's choice unless serious complications 
arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a few congressional Republicans began to join conservative 
activists and a small number of academic constitutional experts in questioning 
the constitutionality of Mitchell's possible selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently fracturing the Senate's solid support for its most powerful member, 
Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said that the emoluments clause makes such a 
selection unconstitutional. He said that, while a similar problem with the 
appointment of Justice Hugo Black had been cured by a congressionally ordered 
reduction in Black's salary, "such a legislative cure has never been 
adjudicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the third ranking House Republican, cited the 1973 
opposition of Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd to the attorney general nomination 
of then-Sen. William Saxbe, a Republican, for the same reasons. Saxbe 
ultimately was confirmed after the attorney general's salary was lowered to 
where it stood before he entered Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some legal experts have faulted this so called "Saxbe fix" as an 
end-run around the Constitution's intent. Another complication arises from 
Article 3, Section 1, of the Constitution, which provides that federal judges' 
pay "shall not be diminished" during their terms in office. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have discussed the possibility of lowering the salary 
for the new justice before Mitchell would be sworn in. But critics assert that 
this too is an evasion of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Armey, a leader of the Republicans' conservative wing, said that Byrd's 
"eloquent speech" in opposition to Saxbe's nomination in 1973 "seems to be a 
definitive foreclosure of (Mitchell's) nomination." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Republican nor Democratic aides in Congress said that they believe the 
issue is important enough to prevent a majority of Democrats from voting for a 
Mitchell nomination if it comes before them. 
</P>
<P>
 But some speculated that the prospect of a bruising controversy could affect 
President Clinton's choice for the court if he has several attractive 
candidates before him. Such a controversy might, for example, cause him to 
decide instead in favor of a Latino candidate who could help lure Latino voters 
to the Democratic ticket in the mid-term and 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the next few days will be crucial in White 
House calculations on whether to ignore the issue or move to other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative activists in Washington insisted that the clause absolutely bars 
Mitchell's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as clear as it can possibly be. The Constitution on its face flatly 
prohibits the appointment of Sen. Mitchell to the Supreme Court in 1994," said 
Tom Jipping, legal director for the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative 
group that monitors the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a minor matter. It is the Constitution and those who have taken 
an oath to follow it, including Bill Clinton and George Mitchell, should not 
play games with the Constitution to put somebody on the Supreme Court," Jipping 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The emoluments clause arose from a lengthy debate during the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787 over how to prevent lawmakers from creating cushy, 
good-paying jobs for themselves. They were aware that in England, the members 
of Parliament often voted to establish high-paying government jobs, which they 
then took for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, they wrote a provision in the U.S. Constitution which says: "No 
senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be 
appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, which 
shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased 
during such time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court salaries were made significantly better-paying during 
Mitchell's Senate term. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1991 measure, Congress voted a 25% pay raise for the federal judiciary. 
The salary of an associate justice of the high court jumped from $118,600 to 
$148,300. Since then, cost-of-living raises have lifted the pay to $171,500 for 
the chief justice and $164,100 for the associate justices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which has assigned three 
lawyers to analyze the issue, has responsibility for researching legal 
questions and advising Administration officials on the state of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has not yet been fully briefed about the details of the legal 
arguments, an aide said.

Lauter in Minneapolis contributed to this story.

TAX STATUS OF KAHANE CHAI GROUP PROBED; FUND RAISING: A TASK FORCE IS TRYING TO 
DETERMINE IF THE JEWISH RADICALS OUTLAWED BY ISRAEL CAN CLAIM EXEMPT STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal task force is investigating the fund-raising practices of the 
radical Jewish group Kahane Chai, which praised Hebron mass killer Baruch 
Goldstein as a "true hero," it was learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The interagency task force composed of representatives of the State 
Department, Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service is trying to 
determine whether the group, which he supported, has violated U.S. tax laws and 
the Foreign Agents Registration Act in connection with its fund-raising 
efforts, officials told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the principal question arising in the case is whether a 
group said by the Israelis to promote terrorism can legally set itself up in 
the United States as a tax-exempt organization by claiming that the money it 
raises is used for charitable purposes abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both federal investigators and the state of New York are trying 
to determine whether several fund-raising organizations related to Kahane Chai 
have failed to register and report on their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahane Chai was outlawed in Israel last month after the Feb. 25 massacre of 
about 30 Muslims at a mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron by Goldstein, a 
militant Jewish settler and follower of the late radical Rabbi Meir Kahane, for 
whom the group was named. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahane himself was assassinated in a Manhattan hotel in 1990. Federal 
prosecutors have charged that the killing was part of an Islamic conspiracy 
that included last year's bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahane Chai leaders have called the United States their principal source of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the federal investigation, New York State Atty. Gen. Oliver 
Koppel is investigating possible violations by at least four associated 
fund-raising groups that have failed to register with the state as tax-exempt 
entities. 
</P>
<P>
 Koppel aide Richard Baar said that the apparent infractions were called to his 
attention Friday by Jewish Week, a New York publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not yet made our own determination," Baar said. "But we plan to be in 
contact with these groups."  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Guzofsky, head of Kahane Chai in the United States, said that, "to the 
best of my knowledge, we have not violated any tax laws or other laws." He said 
that the organization is the victim of "an anti-democratic witch hunt" inspired 
by its enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in Kahane Chai was ever convicted of committing an act of terrorism," 
Guzofsky added. 
</P>
<P>
 State Departmemt supervisor Michael Kraft said that the interagency group 
investigating Kahane Chai is being directed by the department's Office of 
Counterterrorism. "Fund-raising by groups associated with terrorism is a 
complicated issue," Kraft said. "It's questionable whether you can prevent it 
unless there are violations of tax laws or the foreign agents act, which is 
being examined here. There are always First Amendment concerns in this country 
because people can contribute money to any cause." 
</P>
<P>
 At the federal level, the foreign agents act generally requires groups or 
individuals representing a foreign country or "principal" to register with the 
Justice Department and file periodic reports of their activities. Kahane Chai 
once filed reports with the department but has abandoned the practice in recent 
years, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a fund-raising ad published in New York, one group closely associated with 
Kahane Chai informed potential donors that their contributions would be "fully 
tax deductible." However, the group known as American Friends of Yeshiva Harav 
Meir is not registered with either the IRS or New York state authorities as a 
tax-exempt organization, as required by law, according to Jewish Week.  
</P>
<P>
 Another recent ad on behalf of American Friends of the United Yishuv Movement 
carried the heading, "Give Arafat and Rabin a real bone to choke on: adopt a 
settlement." It urged readers to give donations up to $100,000 to a settlement 
of Kahane Chai members on the West Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Owens, an IRS official who monitors tax-exempt organizations, said that 
he is prohibited from commenting on specific cases under review. But Owens said 
that "in past years we have revoked the tax-exempt status of organizations that 
have failed to file reports or to maintain records of substantial contributions 
sent overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens added that any organization claiming tax-exempt status "must be able to 
substantiate that money sent overseas was indeed used for an appropriate 
charitable purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Binyamin Kahane, Kahane's son and the current head of Kahane Chai, has 
made at least four speaking tours to the United States in the last 18 months. 
During a three-week visit last November, which included appearances in New York 
and Los Angeles, he raised an estimated $250,000, according to a report in 
Jewish Press, a Brooklyn-based weekly that focuses on the Orthodox Jewish 
community.

EX-PROSECUTOR CONVICTED OF RACKETEERING; TRIAL: AMID MOVIE-DEAL FEVER, ATLANTA 
ATTORNEY FREDRIC W. TOKARS IS FOUND GUILTY OF EIGHT COUNTS INVOLVING A DRUG 
RING AND HIS WIFE'S MURDER. 
</P>

<P>
 Ignoring allegations that greed and Hollywood overzealousness had corrupted 
the legal process, a federal jury Friday convicted an Atlanta attorney of 
racketeering in connection with drug charges and the murder of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredric W. Tokars, a former Fulton County prosecutor and part-time municipal 
judge, was found guilty on eight counts, including racketeering, money 
laundering, kidnaping and using a telephone to arrange a murder. Four of the 
counts carried mandatory life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in shock," said Jerome Froelich, Tokars' attorney, as he left the 
courthouse in Birmingham, Ala., where the trial was held. He said that he would 
file an appeal based on trial errors, including the judge's allowance of what 
Froelich termed inadmissible evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokars, who has yet to stand trial on state murder charges, sat stoically 
while the verdicts were read. Afterward, he turned toward his mother and 
briefly smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Wilmer Parker had portrayed Tokars as a seemingly 
strait-laced pillar of society -- a "wolf in sheep's clothing" -- who had his 
wife killed to keep her from disclosing his criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokars and co-defendant James Mason, a former nightclub owner, were accused of 
participating in a major cocaine ring that laundered its proceeds in offshore 
bank accounts and nightclubs and used kidnaping, torture and murder to protect 
its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason was convicted of nine counts and faces life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-week trial was dominated by talk of movie deals. The two leading 
investigators of Sara Tokars' murder, Cobb County police detectives Ron Hunton 
and Pat Banks, were fired Monday after it was learned that they had signed a 
movie contract two months after the murder -- and eight months before Tokars 
was arrested. They were paid $4,500 each and would have received $200,000 if 
the case were made into a four-hour movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys alleged that the police, members of the media and Sara 
Tokars' family had worked tirelessly to convict her husband because they lusted 
after movie money and fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The camera can be as seductive as any drug," Froelich said in closing 
arguments last week. "Justice is not supposed to start out by saying, 'I want 
this person and how do we get him?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which has held much of Atlanta transfixed since Sara Tokars was shot 
down in front of her two young sons just after Thanksgiving in 1992, sparked 
intense Hollywood interest. 
</P>
<P>
 While the officers' firings came after the jury had begun its deliberations, 
one of the policemen admitted on the stand that he had lied to his supervisor 
about the movie deal. And there was testimony that Sara Tokars' sisters and 
parents had agreed to participate in a made-for-television movie deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald W. Chasey, executive producer for Patchett Kaufman Entertainment, 
contradicted one sister who testified that the family had backed out of a movie 
deal. Chasey said that in January the sister, Therese Ambrusko, a San Francisco 
lawyer, told him she was concerned because she might be a witness in the trial 
and subpoenas might delve into the movie deal. "She wanted to send me a letter 
saying we didn't have a deal, but that she didn't really mean it and in fact we 
really had a deal," Chasey testified. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Froelich repeated his allegation that Ambrusko committed "flat-out 
perjury" and said the family "drove" the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another example of the way Hollywood affected the case, an Atlanta 
television reporter and anchorman was fired last year after it was disclosed 
that he had entered into a partnership with sources -- including a lawyer and 
private investigator who had worked for Sara Tokars -- to peddle a movie in 
which a character patterned after himself uncovered evidence proving that Fred 
Tokars was behind the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of this raised enough questions in the minds of the jury to discredit 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very relieved," Parker said after the verdicts. "I've been involved in 
other major prosecutions that had more significant impact upon the United 
States society as a whole, but obviously this case had gripped the community of 
Atlanta and appropriately so. I think people yearned to see justice done, and I 
believe justice has been done."  
</P>
<P>
 Froelich said he thought the jury had been overwhelmed by testimony of 
high-level drug dealing and graphic accounts of violence.

U.S. YOUNGSTERS SEE LESS HARM IN USE OF DRUGS

<P>
 Only 54% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 believe that there is a 
great risk associated with trying cocaine once or twice, a report issued by the 
Department of Health and Human Services said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration, also said only 49% of those surveyed in 1992 thought smoking a 
pack or more of cigarettes a day would bring great harm. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the youths saw less harm connected to using drugs than the rest 
of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "These figures indicate a need for continuing and strengthening prevention 
work, especially among today's youth," said Dr. Philip R. Lee, the director of 
the Public Health Service. "We cannot afford to let any young person in America 
today grow up and be less than fully aware of the serious consequences of drug 
use."

U.S. TARGETS ILLEGAL SHARING OF SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors say the indictment of an MIT computer science major is the 
first move in an assault on the illegal sharing of expensive copyrighted 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of a budding computer rights movement say the case could 
short-circuit computer users' First Amendment rights to information. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury indicted David LaMacchia on Thursday on one count of 
conspiring to commit wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology junior is charged with 
running a computer bulletin board that allowed users to illegally copy more 
than $1 million worth of copyrighted software for free. The software included 
everything from games to word processing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Donald K. Stern called the case the largest involving computer 
piracy in the nation's history. He indicated similar cases could follow as 
technology makes the exchange of information easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this new electronic environment it has become increasingly difficult to 
protect intellectual property rights," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Richard Stallman, a software writer who founded and directs the Free 
Software Foundation, the government's case against LaMacchia "is an additional 
increment in how our freedom is restricted to squeeze out every possible penny 
for those software owners." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the federal indictment, LaMacchia operated the computer bulletin 
board at MIT in late 1993 and early this year under the computer aliases "John 
Gaunt" and "Grimjack." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the bulletin board, named Cynosure, allowed people on MIT's 
computer network and the global Internet information highway to illegally copy 
the software. 
</P>
<P>
 LaMacchia, who faces fines of up to $250,000 and possible jail time, declined 
to comment on his case. His attorney, David Duncan, said LaMacchia should not 
be held responsible for the activities of other people who may or may not have 
used his bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 "This raises serious First Amendment issues," Duncan said. "Are you going to 
impose on the system operator the role of censorship?"

NIRVANA FANS DESPAIR AT SINGER'S DEATH; REACTION: A SENSE OF DEJA VU HITS 
FOLLOWERS OF INFLUENTIAL BAND AS KURT COBAIN JOINS LIST OF FALLEN ROCKERS WHOSE 
EARLY DEMISE SEEMED FORETOLD.

<P>
 Familiar with the details of his troubled life, but appalled at the way he 
died, fans of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain were shocked Friday. But they 
were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it coming -- from the beginning," said Aaron Smith, a 21-year-old 
employee at the Tower Records store on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. 
Smith, from Seattle like Cobain, remembered seeing him after a concert two 
years ago. "He was just real solemn -- like he didn't like it. He was seemingly 
depressed -- at the time he should have been happiest." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, news of his apparent suicide prompted gasps Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my God!" cried Suzi Brownsteen, clapping her hand to her mouth. "I can't 
believe it! It's so weird." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Virgin Megastore in Costa Mesa, Shawn Euzebio fought back tears: "His 
music touched lots of people -- it got me through my own stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first band I ever had somebody die on me," said Euzebio, 20. "He 
was a spokesperson for our generation -- he represented what we all feel in our 
lives, but he lived it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the sense of deja vu was overwhelming as Cobain joined a long line of 
creative and self-destructive musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another one bites the dust," Mark Narramore, 35, said quietly as he flipped 
through Pink Floyd CDs at the Virgin Megastore in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were infuriated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so disappointed in him," said Jodie Wilson, 24-year-old supervisor of 
Tower Records on Sunset. "I think it's a very bad example to set. I know life 
gets bad but not this bad. And he had the power and the money to disappear and 
take care of himself. . . . Just think if some poor kid is sad and puts on a 
Nirvana album and thinks, 'Hey, if he did it . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that was one thought going through the mind of an afternoon disc 
jockey on KROQ who offered up pleas to those listeners depressed about life, 
who might want to imitate Cobain, to call the station instead for sources of 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 A curtain of mourning descended on some L.A. rock stations, and the bass lines 
of Nirvana's popular "Come As You Are" wafted across the airwaves all afternoon 
along with other Nirvana songs. Disc jockeys offered up melancholy reflections 
on the troubled Cobain and even the phone message recording from the Seattle 
medical examiner's office that officially announced his death. KROQ announced 
that they would play Nirvana all Friday evening and postpone their promised 
Depeche Mode weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Blair, 24, a musician shopping at the Virgin Megastore in West 
Hollywood, was already mourning the passing of the music. "The rawness of 
Nirvana is what I liked," Blair said. "He'll probably be a legend." 
</P>
<P>
 At some record stores, the playing of Nirvana was spurned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of feel that's in bad taste -- to encourage or glamorize the fact that 
someone shot themselves," said Virgin Megastore floor manager Jon Nelson. 
Nonetheless, the store -- which was flooded with calls all morning from fans 
desperate to learn whether Cobain was really dead -- had no qualms about 
stocking up to supply the expected demand for Nirvana CDs. "We just ordered 150 
more copies -- as many as we could," said Nelson. "That's business."

environmental project that last week was placed in the hands of a 
court-appointed receiver in a dispute over control. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen cited his "deepest concern at the situation occurring at (the) Biosphere 
2 site and the implications concerning people, ecosystems and total system" in 
his resignation as a vice president of Space Biospheres Ventures, the company 
that operates Biosphere 2. 
</P>
<P>
 His resignation letter was sent to Edward P. Bass, the Texas billionaire and 
financier of the $150-million project 35 miles north of Tucson. A copy of the 
handwritten letter, which was faxed from the Fairmont Hotel in Tokyo, was 
obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bass obtained a temporary restraining order in federal court in 
Texas dissolving his partnership with Space Biospheres Ventures and temporarily 
placing the project under the court receiver. Bass said he wanted sounder 
management of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the first team to occupy Biosphere 2 were arrested this week 
and charged with sabotaging the project by breaking seals and doors to open the 
sealed environment of the biosphere to the outside. They were fired from the 
project Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was the creator and co-founder of Biosphere 2, a closed ecological 
system that contains a rain forest, savannah, a small farm and a tiny ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone in Tokyo, Allen said: "I feel that this was an unnecessary 
tragedy and I offer the hand of friendship to Ed Bass to reverse the ongoing 
calamity and put Biosphere 2 on sound footing for the future of humanity and 
science." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Norberto Alvarez-Romo, a member of the current crew of seven inside 
Biosphere 2 for a one-year experiment, left the sealed dome Friday afternoon. 
Alvarez-Romo is vice president of mission control for Biosphere 2 and director 
of cybernetics systems inside the 3.15-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Chris Helms, a spokesman for Space Biospheres 
Ventures, said that Alvarez-Romo "exited Biosphere 2 for a family emergency and 
to play a key role in reviewing a possible mission restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Biosphere 2, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 
Alvarez-Romo went to aid his wife, who had collapsed and was at a Phoenix 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez-Romo will be replaced by Bernd Zabel, who supervised the construction 
of Biosphere 2 in 1985.

<P>
 State Food and Agriculture Secretary Henry J. Voss, who was arrested Dec. 17 
on a drunk-driving charge after leaving a holiday party at the home of Gov. 
Pete Wilson, has pleaded no contest in Sacramento Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-time offender, Voss, 62, received the usual sentence for driving under 
the influence, including three years' informal probation and $1,350 in fines 
and court costs. In lieu of 48 hours in jail, a work program was recommended 
for Voss, a customary option. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss' blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.16%, twice the legal limit. He was 
arrested shortly after leaving the party when an officer saw his car straddling 
the center line.

UNION OFFICIAL CUTS TIES WITH HER POLITICAL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alice Huffman, political director of the state's largest teachers union, has 
agreed to cut her ties with a political consulting firm she owns, according to 
an announcement made late Friday by the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman has been at the center of a conflict-of-interest controversy within 
the group since it was revealed last month that a political action committee 
she helped form had accepted $175,000 from the gubernatorial campaign of 
Democrat Kathleen Brown.The money was paid to Huffman's committee to help woo 
black voters and the committee often retains Huffman's public affairs firm for 
campaign services. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement, the teachers union's board of directors said "there is 
nothing to support a charge that Alice Huffman or any (other) CTA staff person 
acted inappropriately" with regard to its procedures. Huffman, who has been on 
vacation, will resume her duties Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 No further details were spelled out in the release and union President D.A. 
(Del) Weber was unavailable for comment.

PROSECUTORS TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR SUSPECT IN GIRL'S KIDNAPING AND SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Prosecutors announced Friday that they will seek the death penalty for Hooman 
Ashkan Panah, the Woodland Hills man accused of abducting and murdering an 
8-year-old girl whose battered body was found in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, 22, has pleaded not guilty to seven charges, including murder, 
kidnaping and sodomy, in the Nov. 20 death of Nicole Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled because I want him dead," said Lori Parker, mother of the 
victim. "If they could fry him next week, I'd push the button." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to seek Panah's execution was made by a committee of senior 
prosecutors, who evaluated the case after reviewing a memo prepared by Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Peter S. Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah's defense attorney, Robert Sheahen said Friday that the imposition of 
capital punishment against Panah, whom he called mentally retarded, would be a 
travesty. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury also charged Panah with four special-circumstance allegations -- 
murder in conjunction with kidnaping, sodomy, child molestation and oral 
copulation -- each of which makes him eligible for the death penalty.

TAXPAYER GROUPS BACK WILSON CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling Gov. Pete Wilson "the last line of defense for California's 
taxpayers," the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. endorsed Wilson's reelection bid 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you care about the way government handles your money, then you want Pete 
Wilson as your governor," Joel Fox, president of the watchdog organization, 
said at a news conference. Fox was joined by Jay Curtis, president of the Los 
Angeles Taxpayers Assn., which also endorsed Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has come under attack for siding with the Legislature and raising taxes 
early in his tenure as governor. But Fox and Curtis lauded Wilson's recent call 
for tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must keep this taxpayer's friend in the governor's office," Curtis said.

FEINSTEIN LAUNCHES REELECTION BID; POLITICS: THE SENATOR ENTERS THE RACE IN A 
STRONG POSITION, ACCORDING TO POLLS. SHE IS TRYING TO COURT SWING VOTERS IN THE 
REPUBLICANS' CENTRAL VALLEY STRONGHOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein officially kicked off her reelection campaign Friday, 
telling voters that if they liked her first 17 months in office, they should 
elect her for another six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to about 300 supporters at the new Delancey Street housing project in 
San Francisco, Feinstein said she knew when she went to Washington that she 
would have to work fast to prove herself worthy of reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday she said she was confident that she has met the test, pointing to 
her work on a proposed assault weapons ban, funding for new Border Patrol 
guards and a deficit reduction package, and has added a woman's voice to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you sent me to accomplish, I have accomplished," she said, flanked by 
her husband, daughter and granddaughter. "And so today, I say to the 5.8 
million California voters who sent me to the Senate 17 months ago, I announce 
my candidacy for a full six-year term and I ask you to cast that vote one more 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein enters the race with a tail wind of strong poll ratings and the 
expertise of a candidate who has run two statewide races in the last four 
years: her failed bid for governor in 1990, followed by the election that 
ousted appointed U.S. Sen. John Seymour in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times poll found that she is well-regarded by nearly two-thirds of 
the state's voters and she leads all her opponents by at least 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say she is in pretty good shape," independent pollster Mervin Field said. 
"She seems to be resonating with the large middle majority of Californians and 
there has been an absence of any missteps." 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein is running hard against an unpredictable challenge from a Santa 
Barbara millionaire who has promised to lavishly finance much of his own 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Rep. Michael Huffington must first defeat former Orange County Rep. 
William E. Dannemeyer in the June 7 GOP primary. But Huffington is already 
focusing his effort on Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Huffington put Feinstein on the defensive with a series of 
statewide television commercials attacking her as a big-spending liberal and 
criticizing her vote for President Clinton's 1993 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein did not identify Huffington by name Friday, but in her speech she 
rejected the charge that tax increases in the Clinton budget have hurt the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is now creating jobs, not losing them," she said. "The budget for 
which I voted is sowing the seeds of a new prosperity and, for the first time 
in memory, the federal budget is going down, not up." 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-year-old senator, a former mayor of San Francisco, also highlighted her 
family's lengthy history in California in a thinly veiled poke at Huffington, a 
former Houston oilman who moved to Santa Barbara in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is an incredibly special place," she said. "It is my home; it is 
the place of my birth . . . it is where my mother developed her values, where I 
developed my values and where my granddaughter, Eileen, will develop her 
values. It is not a place to come for political opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has no substantial challenger in the Democratic primary this year 
and is therefore in the politically enviable position of being able to spend 
the election year spring courting swing voters. Her itinerary during the recent 
two-week congressional break has been a tour of traditionally Republican 
bastions. 
</P>
<P>
 She started with a visit to a portion of the Central Valley that she lost in 
the 1992 election, appealing to Republican audiences of ranchers and farmers. 
Later, she christened a B2 bomber before several thousand aerospace workers in 
Palmdale, 
</P>
<P>
 Her speech there caused some political watchers to do a double take. 
Conservative Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who had considered 
challenging Feinstein, said that after the speech he turned to former Rep. Mel 
Levine and said: "That speech is one good reason I didn't get in." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a conservative, gung-ho hawk speech," Dornan said. "I thought she got 
into my notes and gave the best Bob Dornan speech I've ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Valley also is shaping up to be a key battleground between 
Feinstein and Huffington. It was the first stop on Feinstein's recent campaign 
swing and Huffington spent three days this week touring the farm country. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein angered agriculture officials in 1990 when she supported the Big 
Green environmental initiative and she lost the area to Seymour in 1992. In her 
recent tour, however, she found some thawing. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the guest at one event hosted by prominent Fresno County rancher John 
Harris, a Republican who has recently opened many doors for Feinstein and 
contributed $1,000 to her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she expects to be outspent by Huffington in the upcoming race. 
She hopes to raise about $10 million, just a bit more than she had in the 1992 
race. But Huffington has vowed to spend $15 million and possibly more. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as she runs her third statewide campaign, Feinstein is certain to 
finish as one of the biggest political fund-raisers in U.S. history, raising as 
much as $50 million since 1990. Her recent schedule has been packed with 
fund-raisers at homes and hotel ballrooms, including at least eight events in 
the last five days.

STATE DROPS PLANS TO SEND PAROLED CHILD MOLESTER TO SAN DIEGO AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to parole convicted child molester Thomas Max Hetherington to the San 
Diego area were dropped Friday after local officials pleaded with Gov. Pete 
Wilson and three of Hetherington's victims invoked their legal right to keep 
him at least 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Mayor Susan Golding wrote the governor on Thursday that the victims 
"are still undergoing therapy and reportedly became hysterical" at the prospect 
of Hetherington returning to the community where he molested eight girls at a 
day care center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller wrote Wilson and then spoke Friday morning with 
Craig Brown, the undersecretary for the state Youth and Adult Correctional 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The key move came from county Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who persuaded three of 
the victims and their families to request that Hetherington, 78, not be paroled 
near their homes. By state law, no violent felon can be paroled within 35 miles 
of a victim if the victim seeks such protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob faxed the requests to Sacramento only hours before Hetherington was to 
be released from the Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo and then leave for San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday afternoon, correction officials announced that Hetherington is on 
parole and is being watched by a parole agent, awaiting a decision on an 
alternative location, possibly to be made next week. Officials declined to 
disclose Hetherington's whereabouts, except to say that he is not in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County has not been ruled out as a parole location. But if the 
35-mile limit is applied to the victims' homes in San Diego, Ramona and 
Bonsall, the only area not off-limits is in the county's mountainous and 
virtually unpopulated southeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hetherington was convicted in 1982 of repeatedly molesting eight children in 
rural Ramona, north of San Diego. The victims ranged in age from 2 to 11. They 
were in the custody of a day care center run by Hetherington's wife, who has 
since divorced him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentenced to 21 years in prison, Hetherington was set to be released Friday 
under a law that gives time off for good behavior. Arizona authorities two 
months ago rejected his request that he be allowed to live in that state when 
paroled.

MIDEAST COUNTERFEITING MAY HASTEN NEW U.S. DESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL MCALLISTER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terrorists may be on the verge of claiming a new victim: the U.S. greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said the agency is at work 
on new designs for U.S. currency amid reports that terrorist organizations may 
be flooding the world with counterfeit $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The bogus-money problem has become so severe that many overseas banks are 
refusing to accept the $100 bills. A leading terrorist expert said the 
counterfeit dollars, being produced in the Middle East by terrorist groups 
linked to Iran and Syria, could cause serious economic problems especially for 
small nations that rely on the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 While confirming work on a new design, Bureau of Engraving officials were 
reluctant Thursday to discuss what changes they will recommend that Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen implement or to link the change to the increase of 
overseas counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources said they had been told that the Treasury hopes to 
announce the proposed changes later this month and said the House Banking and 
Finance Committee is planning hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the ideas said to be under consideration: Moving portraits to the side, 
implanting small holograms on the bills, printing on watermarked paper, using 
multicolored patterns that are difficult for copiers to reproduce and printing 
with multicolored inks -- all steps other countries have adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most dramatic proposals has come from Robert Kupperman, an expert 
on terrorism. He has called for a two-tiered money system -- new greenbacks for 
domestic use and new "redbacks" -- dollars printed in red -- for overseas use. 
</P>
<P>
 Coin World, a numismatic publication which this week disclosed the redesign 
effort, said it understood the new currency may closely resemble mock-ups made 
by the PBS program "Nova." The "Nova" dollars included safety features used by 
many foreign countries including multicolor printing, a portrait to the side 
and watermarked paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department has been reluctant to make major changes in the 
dollar, leaving the United States with what a Secret Service spokeswoman 
described as "the most stable currency in the world, and the most easy to 
counterfeit." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago the Bureau of Engraving introduced two major changes to 
high-valued currency: extremely small printing called "micro-printing" and a 
polyester thread that also contains tiny printing. Coin World said those 
efforts have failed to thwart the counterfeiters, and youngsters showed the 
publication how they could easily pull the polyester thread from the new 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Ferguson, the bureau's research director, confirmed that the agency 
is close to making final recommendations as to how the new currency should 
look. But he rejected suggestions the terrorism concerns had prompted the 
redesign effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you with conviction that we will not make any changes this year," 
he said, noting that it would take longer, perhaps two years or more, to 
implement any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said the redesign effort had begun two years ago and "hasn't changed 
in intensity because of any outside issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Figures provided by the Secret Service and interviews with terrorism experts 
suggest increasing concern within the government over bogus dollars from 
abroad. In fiscal 1993, the agency said, there was five times as much 
counterfeit currency produced overseas ($120 million) as in the United States 
($24 million). 
</P>
<P>
 Kupperman said a group of counterfeiters in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, directed 
by Iranian and Syrian intelligence agencies, are believed to have produced $1 
billion worth of "the most nearly perfect $100 bills that the Secret Service 
has ever detected." 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service declined to confirm on that claim, saying it could not 
comment on any ongoing investigation.

REPORT DISCLOSES CIGARETTE ADDITIVES ON SECRET LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chemicals added to cigarettes can cause liver damage and convulsions in 
animals, a radio network reported Friday, adding to the furor over regulation 
of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts say the uproar over a top-secret list of additives is 
overblown because scientists have known for 30 years of dozens of toxic 
ingredients in cigarette smoke and tobacco itself that probably far outweigh 
the danger from any added chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who doesn't know that cigarettes are a health hazard has been living 
in a cave for the last 30 years," said Victor Zonana, a spokesman for the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The list is but one issue in the battle over tobacco. The Food and Drug 
Administration is considering naming nicotine a drug, which would force it to 
ban most cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in question is a federal law that makes companies tell the government the 
more than 700 additives that go into cigarettes, but which must be kept secret 
under penalty of imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 National Public Radio on Friday made public 13 chemicals that it said were 
from that top-secret list. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has designated some of the chemicals, in certain forms, as 
hazardous. All chlorofluorocarbons, which can damage the ozone layer, are 
prohibited in foods, for example. And NPR's list showed Freon, a CFC, is added 
to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 NPR quoted an independent toxicologist who said two of the chemicals, ethyl 
2-furoate and sclareol, cause liver damage and convulsions in laboratory 
animals. Ethyl 2-furoate was also discussed as a possible chemical warfare 
agent in the 1930s, said Dr. Barry Rumack of the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 But the list is too vague to know whether or how toxic any of the chemicals 
are in cigarettes, toxicologists said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said Friday that within weeks he will introduce 
legislation to make the list of additives public.

 Calloway had been awaiting a company hearing for allegedly falsifying his 
employment application when he was hired, and was probably going to be fired, 
the Commercial Appeal newspaper reported. The paper said he had failed to 
disclose that he had been fired from another air cargo company. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Express refused to discuss Calloway's work record or his professional 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred shortly after the plane left Memphis International Airport 
on a routine run to San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway, who was off-duty at the time, was flying as a passenger. Federal 
Express often allows its employees to fly free on cargo planes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calloway, who was seated immediately outside the crew's cabin, is accused of 
attacking the crew members with a claw hammer and threatening the captain with 
a spear gun, used by scuba divers for underwater fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 With blood running down his face, the pilot struggled to keep the cargo plane 
under control, and bloodied and injured crew members managed to turn the plane 
around about 40 miles from Memphis and return to the airport as the fighting 
continued, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's pilot, Capt. David G. Sanders, 49, was treated Thursday night and 
released. First Officer James M. Tucker, 42, and Second Officer Andre H. 
Peterson, 39, remained in serious condition Friday. Calloway was also 
hospitalized with serious injuries.

CLINTON FIRES BACK AT HEALTH PLAN CRITICS; REFORM: HE BASKS IN GLOW OF 
MINNEAPOLIS RALLY. LATER, AT TOWN HALL MEETING, HE ASSAILS THOSE WHO QUESTION 
HIS MOTIVES RATHER THAN DEBATING ISSUES. 
</P>

<P>
 Having lived through several tough weeks, President Clinton revived his 
spirits Friday with an enthusiastic rally in one of his party's most reliable 
strongholds. Then, seemingly re-energized, he struck back during a televised 
town hall meeting at critics who, he said, were questioning his motives rather 
than debating the issues of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "This health care debate, in my opinion, has really been retarded -- in more 
ways than one -- by all this motive-throwing-around that we have," Clinton 
said. "This is a bunch of hooey. If people don't agree with me, let them come 
forward and contest me with their ideas. But I am sick -- and I think a lot of 
you must be sick -- of all this hot air rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, doing some motive-questioning of his own, Clinton added that much of the 
rhetoric he dislikes has come "from people who are making a killing from the 
insurance business." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's sharp language came after the first two questioners at the town hall 
meeting made statements suggesting that his interest in health care stems 
primarily from politics or is a government "power grab." The news director of 
the television station that set up the town hall said before the broadcast that 
the station purposely had arranged the order of the questions to ensure that 
there would be "a tough question right at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I have learned in 20 years of public life is you don't get 
very far questioning other people's motives," Clinton said. "Let's argue about 
what should or shouldn't be done and not talk about other people's motives." 
</P>
<P>
 The town hall meeting, which ranged across topics from the economic impact of 
Clinton's plan to whether it includes dental coverage, was the third for 
Clinton this week. It included questioners from stations here and in Detroit, 
Milwaukee and Sioux Falls, S.D.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton delivered a rousing version of his health care 
stump speech to a spirited rally before a crowd of several thousand cheering 
supporters here. Entering the hall Clinton beamed at the welcome sound of 
applause and lingered for more than half an hour shaking hands, waving and 
basking in the crowd's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota in general -- and Minneapolis in particular -- has a long tradition 
of liberal activism. The state was one of Clinton's strongest in the 1992 
election. The area's political leanings were on display with Clinton's 
reception and even with the protesters who greeted him -- most of whom seemed 
to be criticizing him from the left. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of protesters, for example, stood outside Clinton's hotel when he 
arrived late Thursday night demanding U.S. action on behalf of human rights in 
Tibet. By contrast, when Clinton visited Topeka, Kan., earlier that day he had 
been picketed by a militant anti-gay-rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton clearly warmed to the supportive audience here and pulled out all the 
rhetorical stops in advocating his plan as he spoke to the crowd, which was 
organized by the Minnesota Nurses' Assn. Here, as elsewhere, nurses' 
organizations have been among Clinton's most supportive groups, in part because 
his plan would eliminate rules backed by doctors in many states that sharply 
limit the types of medical care nurses can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for us to come together across regional and racial and 
income and party lines to do something that is good for America. All of our 
jobs are at stake, all of our health care is at stake, our children are at 
stake, our parents are at stake," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that they hope the show of support for health care 
reform here will help bolster their position with a key congressional vote -- 
the state's Republican senator, Dave Durenberger, a moderate who is one of the 
strategically crucial handful of Republicans who have been willing to consider 
Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's travels recently have been carefully targeted at key members 
of Congress -- Kansas Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery and Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy 
Landon Kassebaum on Thursday -- Durenberger and a handful of House members from 
the northern Midwest Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But although White House officials had hoped that Durenberger would show up 
for the rally and share the podium with Clinton, he stayed away -- a symbol, 
perhaps, of the frustrations Clinton has found in trying to entice GOP 
moderates into a health care deal. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Clinton received a loud endorsement from the state's other 
senator, liberal Democrat Paul Wellstone. Wellstone is a leading advocate of a 
proposal to create a government run "single-payer" health care plan similar to 
that used in Canada.

CLOUDS, WIND FORCE A SECOND DELAY FOR SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clouds and wind forced NASA to delay the planned launch Friday of the space 
shuttle Endeavour on its mission to study the Earth. It was the second launch 
delay this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Liftoff for the Earth radar-mapping mission was rescheduled for 4:05 a.m. PDT 
today, with better weather in the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA halted the countdown and waited for nearly three hours in hopes low 
clouds over the launch site would break up. When they did, a crosswind exceeded 
safety limits, a minor communications problem popped up and launch director Bob 
Sieck called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the six astronauts had been strapped inside the fueled ship for more 
than five hours, slightly longer than desired. They left the shuttle at late 
morning, sipping bottled water and shaking hands with technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA then drained more than a half-million gallons of fuel from Endeavour's 
tank. The delay cost nearly $500,000 for the fuel alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, NASA had delayed the launch from Thursday to Friday to 
check Endeavour's engine oxidizer pumps for a defect discovered elsewhere in 
the fleet. The pumps checked out fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's scrub delayed another NASA launch. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight of an unmanned Atlas rocket with a crucial weather satellite was 
moved from Tuesday to Wednesday as a result of the need for today's launch 
attempt for Endeavour. The military has reserved time in between for a 
classified operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which tracks ascending rockets for 
safety purposes, needs two days between launch attempts to reprogram computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the nine-day shuttle flight begins, $366-million radar equipment will map 
Earth's surface. NASA says it is the finest space radar ever designed for 
environmental research, an advancement akin to color pictures versus 
black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar will scan Earth's surface and the astronauts will photograph the 
same scenes 138 miles below for comparison. About 2,000 researchers, teachers 
and students at sites around the globe will help to verify the radar's 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA plans to fly the radar instruments on Endeavour again in August to see 
how the sites look in a different season.

VANS WORKERS REJECT UNION BY LARGE MARGIN; LABOR: CENTRAL DISPUTE INVOLVED 
COMPANY-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFITS. THOUGH DEFEATED, TEAMSTERS OFFICIALS REMAIN 
UPBEAT. 
</P>

<P>
 Employees at Vans Inc. Friday rejected a bid by the Teamsters to represent the 
1,400-person work force at the shoe-making factory, according to union 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost all the workers voting, the tally was 718 to 473, according to 
Raul Lopez, secretary of Teamsters Local Union 396.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good voter turnout. This is just the start for union activity in 
Orange County," Lopez said. "We are not disappointed. And this will never end." 
</P>
<P>
 Union organizers had spent more than three months trying to persuade the 
factory workers, mostly Spanish speaking, to join the Teamsters with talk of 
increased benefits and higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders in Southern California were watching the election as a test of 
their ability to organize the growing group of immigrant factory workers, who 
have traditionally resisted unionization.  
</P>
<P>
 Vans, the popular canvas shoemaker based in Orange, fought the unionization 
effort, saying the company could not pay substantially increased wages and 
benefits at a time when shoes sales have stalled and profits have eroded.  
</P>
<P>
 Craig E. Gosselin, Van's general counsel, said Friday, "We won the election by 
approximately 250 votes, which has been certified by the National Labor 
Relations Board. We consider that to be a decisive win. We're very gratified 
for the support of our employees and we look forward to moving ahead and 
returning to profitability." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they would release a formal statement to shareholders 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Profit margins are still down at many companies. It's a difficult time for 
management to realize increases in benefits and compensation for its workers," 
said Todd Nicholson, president of the Industrial League of Orange County, a 
trade group based in Irvine. "We're beginning to see some signs of economic 
recovery here in Orange County. And that is going to require everyone -- 
management and labor -- to pull together to make sure the vitality of industry 
here continues."  
</P>
<P>
 The central dispute in the Vans election was over workers' ability to afford 
company-sponsored health benefits. The average Vans worker, according to the 
union, makes about $5.75 an hour, and finds it too expensive to make 
co-payments for the company-sponsored health plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Gosselin said that the union was using misleading 
statements to influence its workers and that the company, consequently, was 
spending money to fight the unionization attempt. He would not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Lopez said, the union filed unfair labor charges with the National 
Labor Relations Board, charging that supervisors had told workers the 
unionization was "a sin," that God was on the side of the company, and that the 
plant would close if the union succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 workers gathered in the Vans parking lot in the night air Friday 
night, many with children, waiting for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Gonzales, a 30-year-old machine operator, who has worked for the company 
for nine years, said he was a little disappointed. He said he would go back to 
work on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still a family here. Everyone wants to go back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The voting included 180 ballots that the union is challenging and 13 that are 
void. They were not included in the final tally and thus won't change the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Vans has struggled to retain market share in the highly 
competitive casual shoe market. For years, it rarely changed the style of its 
basic sneakers, a staple for many Southern California teen-age males. Last 
year, the company added new shoe designs and style, prompting domestic sales to 
increase 19% in the third quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote Friday night, Eric Appell director of research for Torrey 
Pines in San Diego, a stock brokerage that follows the company's operations, 
said, "Naturally, we hope the union loses, because we prefer to have the 
flexibility that unions don't provide. Still, we think if (Vans officials) have 
to increase benefits and wages, that shouldn't have a significant impact on 
earnings, because they may bargain with the union to have production levels go 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Appell said he remains upbeat about the company's long-term prospects, 
predicting Vans would become a stronger force in the casual shoe market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going forward, we see this company as accelerating their profitability," he 
said. "They are going to be the next big national shoe brand." Although the 
ballots were not counted until after the market closed, Vans shares rose 12.5 
cents Friday, closing at $6.125 per share in Nasdaq trading.

WEEKEND OF HORSEPLAY; 200 RIDERS RETRACE PORTOLA ROUTE IN ANNUAL REVELRY-FILLED 
EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morning began early for the 200 riders of El Viaje de Portola, who gathered 
shortly after dawn Friday on the patio of the El Adobe cafe, where the brandy, 
Bloody Marys and cowboy hubris flowed like water from a broken spigot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, there's such a feeling of history and tradition here," cooed Kim Oviatt, 
a Visalia rancher celebrating his 19th straight appearance on the legendary 
ride, which for 31 years has retraced the route traveled by the Spanish 
settlers who first came to the county in 1769. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, the press and the public have focused on this ," Oviatt said, 
eyeing his drink. "This is more than just a get-together of guys drinking and 
eating." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Gaspar de Portola himself had shown up on Camino Capistrano Friday 
morning, he would have seen 200 cowboy-hatted men riding in a parade of 
hoof-stomping horses and grinning from ear to ear -- most with drinks still 
clutched in their fists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me bless this ride and may it be the best ride ever," pronounced Msgr. 
Paul Martin, as the men and their horses made their annual procession past 
Mission San Juan Capistrano.  
</P>
<P>
 The event raises several thousand dollars a year for the mission, as the 
riders solicit sponsors throughout the county. On Friday, the mission dedicated 
a new plaza funded by the Portola riders at a cost of about $20,000. The riders 
have raised about four times that amount during three decades spent 
commemorating the trail route, which winds east down the Ortega Highway and 
into the foothills of Rancho Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride annually attracts some of the most influential businessmen, civic 
leaders and politicians in Orange County, including Sheriff Brad Gates and 
Anthony Moiso, the chief executive officer of the Santa Margarita Co., which 
owns the sprawling acreage through which the 30 miles of trails meander. 
</P>
<P>
 But this modern variation of the Portola expedition is by no means limited to 
Orange County. Riders from all over the state and from as far away as Texas, 
Maryland and Alaska take part in the male-only, invitation-only festivities, 
which many characterize as three days of good-old-boy bonding, horseback riding 
and spinning tales around a campfire. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of its three decades, stories of drinking, carousing and other twists 
on the "boys-will-be-boys" theme have dogged the reputation of the Portola 
riders like a snake hissing at the heels of their horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses who attended the start of the festivities Friday say it's not all 
mere legend. 
</P>
<P>
 They recalled with vivid detail the year that several nude women were seen 
running near the camp, apparently taking part in the festivities. Another year, 
a herd of elephants stormed into the camp, while still another time a naked 
woman crashed the party by parachute.  
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps most unforgettably, witnesses said a group of helicopters once 
buzzed the camp with Wagnerian music blaring, reminiscent of a scene from the 
movie "Apocalypse Now." 
</P>
<P>
 The whiskey does flow freely, but riders blame the press for what they say is 
a distortion of the ride's true meaning and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to find out, a reporter chatting with several friendly riders at 
El Adobe on Friday morning was introduced to the event's "official spokesman," 
cattle rancher Gilbert Aguirre, who promptly ordered him and any other "media 
types" to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a private party," Gilbert snapped. "We don't allow anybody in here. 
It's like our house. So get out -- now." 
</P>
<P>
 A few cowboys within earshot gave looks that seemed to say, "What's eating 
Gilbert Aguirre?" A few others attempted to explain how the ride has this image 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about horsemanship. That's all it is," Oviatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the revelry is often accompanied by tequila, Jack Daniels bourbon, vodka, 
gin and fraternity-style pranks, a few conceded privately. Most, though, say 
it's all good fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob McDonald, a real estate developer from Newport Beach on his 10th Portola, 
called it "nothing more than 200 guys whose common bond is horsemanship and 
horses. We enjoy camping and looking up at the stars. I've made lifelong 
friends on this ride." 
</P>
<P>
 As for its reputation and the aura of secrecy surrounding it, "there's not an 
excessive amount of drinking," McDonald said. "There just isn't. I'm not aware 
of that going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Johnson, a horse-stable owner from Palm Springs, said he loves "the 
camaraderie, the fellowship, the games we play." 
</P>
<P>
 The games? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, like steer-roping," he said. "But mostly, it's seein' old boys you just 
wouldn't see any other time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the Portola is three days of hard riding for five to six hours 
each day on Friday, today and Sunday, when a tired group of cowboys calls it 
quits for one more year. They say it's listening to country music and cowboy 
poetry under a sky full of stars. Many of the 200 are important, powerful 
executives, but for three days, they say, they leave the work world behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad-boy reputation, Johnson said with a snarl, is "totally undeserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Austin, who grew up in San Juan Capistrano and now lives in Northern 
California, said her father has been on every ride in the Portola's 31-year 
history, which she termed symbolic of an Orange County that no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone on since this was a little town where everybody knew everybody 
else," she said. "For me, it brings back the time when Capistrano was all about 
ranches and horses and orange groves. Now it's all tract houses and strip 
malls, and I find it terribly sad." 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away stood Ernest Morris of Templeton, who helped to recall those 
halcyon days by saddling up his horse in a parking lot full of straps, spurs, 
chaps and boots, reeking of the smell that only 200 horses can supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on this thing 20 years," he said. "I'm the artist. I draw the 
little pictures on our cowboy hats. You know, pictures of cowboys and horses. 
Nothing pornographic!" 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said he had heard all the talk about "200 tired old boys taking a drink 
now and then" and confessed to being bewildered by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why, we're out there where it's hot and dry," he said. "Isn't it OK to take a 
little drink . . . of water now and then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Morris lamented the fact that most of his colleagues don't swear or "do 
anything that's much fun anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like a church group," he said. "And you can believe me. I'm the only 
truthful man on the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the most excitement comes when "a guy steps in a squirrel hole and we 
have to decide whether to shoot him or take him to the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the men mounted their horses and began their march toward 
Portola's past. Serenaded by mariachis and blown kisses by wives and 
girlfriends who treated them like departing soldiers, they headed east, into 
another time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only regret," shouted one, with his name painted on the sign on his back, 
"is that all of you can't enjoy this as much as we do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you forgot!" shouted the gap-toothed cowboy riding behind him. "It's 
three days of leavin' the women and children behind, and there ain't nothin' 
better than that, baby! Let's go!"

TRAGEDY'S FINAL CHAPTER IS A LIFE SENTENCE; MURDER: KILLER OF ESTRANGED WIFE 
AND HER LOVER IS SENTENCED DURING AN EMOTIONAL COURTROOM SCENE IN WHICH SOME 
SPECTATORS CHEERED AND OTHERS WEPT.

<P>
 A Huntington Beach man was sentenced Friday to life in prison without parole 
for murdering his estranged wife and her lover in a case that has devastated 
three families and stripped a child of her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 During an emotional sentencing hearing attended by more than 40 friends and 
relatives of the victims, many wept and some even cheered when Gary Beaudoin, 
32, was given the maximum prison sentence for the Sept. 10, 1992, murders of 
Patricia Beaudoin, 22, and Mark Forshee, 23, also of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Several family members spoke during the court session, recalling how the 
murders have forever changed their lives. Mattheson Smith of Huntington Beach, 
the slain woman's father, also voiced his grief and guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe fathers feel they should be there to protect their families, their 
daughters," Smith told the judge, struggling to keep his voice steady. "Now I 
have to live with the guilt of not being there when she needed me most." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the murders, Gary and Patricia Beaudoin were the parents of a 
toddler, Kayla, but were in the process of separating and heading toward 
divorce. Prosecutors depicted the murders as a cold-blooded attack by a man who 
refused to let go. Defense attorneys, however, said Gary Beaudoin was driven by 
despair and rage when he discovered his wife was cheating on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial became an intimate portrait of a crumbling marriage, and proved to 
be emotionally draining for jurors, many of whom were moved to tears during 
their weeklong deliberations and even while their verdicts were being read last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Beaudoin, Smith and Forshee families were left struggling to 
get past their losses. Kayla, 2, is being raised by her mother's family and is 
still too young to understand it all, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Forshee, the sister of the victim, told the court that she lost her best 
friend when her brother was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing means anything to us anymore," she said through her tears. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of the murders, Gary Beaudoin was returning home when he saw his 
wife and Forshee moving out her belongings. He began following the pair. When 
Forshee pulled over at Bolsa Chica Street in Huntington Beach, Gary Beaudoin 
approached the truck, carrying a gun.

<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans told jurors that Patricia Beaudoin and 
Forshee were shot in the head and upper body, and probably never knew what hit 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia told jurors that Gary Beaudoin fired 
in rage when Forshee laughed in his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Many relatives said Friday they feel Beaudoin has tried to blame the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Jack M. Earley, who represented Beaudoin at his 
sentencing, said that was never his client's intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not saying these are bad or evil people who deserved to die," Earley 
said during the hearing. He later read from a statement written by Beaudoin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there is no remorse or words to change the results of my 
actions," his statement read. "I loved my wife and daughter very much and the 
possibility of losing both of them was emotionally devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Beaudoin, Gary's father, was hoping for a lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "But no matter what the sentence, no one comes out a winner here at all," 
Jerry Beaudoin said outside court, shaking his head. "This case is sad for 
everyone, all around."

REPUBLICANS WANT TO SEE GOP-TV IN THE PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Republicans want their GOP-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 If the party gets its way, local cable companies will soon carry "Rising 
Tide," the 3-month-old weekly program produced in Washington that showcases the 
party's leaders and offers a Republican spin on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some have been approached, no local cable company has yet agreed to 
run the show, so the party is launching a letter-writing campaign in a further 
effort to persuade them to do so, said David Arnold, precinct director for the 
Republican Party of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The counterpunch: Two cable companies have contacted Democratic Party leaders 
in Orange County to offer them equal time should the companies decide to run 
the GOP program, said county Democratic Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia, who is 
mulling over strategies to counter the Republican effort with other party 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies dotting Southern California from Santa Clarita to Pasadena and San 
Diego are running the hourlong program, and more than 100 cable access systems 
carry it nationwide, said Chuck Greener, director of communications for GOP-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the California county where Republicans probably feel most at home 
isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have talked to about four or five companies. None of them have been very 
receptive," Arnold said. "They're having a big problem because they don't want 
a partisan show. They want to appeal to the entire community. But Orange County 
is the most conservative county in the country. I would think viewers would 
love this show!" 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP is not giving up, however. Earlier this week, this month's Orange 
County Young Republicans newsletter landed in mailboxes with a letter to cable 
companies printed inside and an urging to readers to snip it out and mail it 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put balance into what our organization perceives as bias in the 
broadcast networks," said Kurt English of Newport Beach, newsletter editor for 
the Orange County Young Republicans. "I sent my letter earlier this week."  
</P>
<P>
 Arnold said the Young Republicans effort is the first of several 
letter-writing campaigns the party plans to promote. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP-TV was launched in January from a basement studio at Republican National 
Headquarters in Washington. The program aims to broaden communication with the 
party's grass-roots, raise funds and attract new members, the party says. 
National party Chairman Haley Barbour, who hosts the show, spent about $1.5 
million in donations to set up the studio. To keep it going, Barbour has vowed 
to spend $500,000 a year from contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP-TV just supplied a copy of last week's show to Orange County Republican 
headquarters so the party can peddle the program to local cable companies, 
Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show featured a discussion of upcoming gubernatorial races, interviews 
with several Republican governors and a segment highlighting the week's "GOP 
newsmakers," among other things, Greener said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, "Rising Tide" will broadcast live from San Francisco and feature a 
discussion of immigration, crime, taxes and defense cuts in California. Among 
the scheduled guests: Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Orange County Republicans could pick one cable market to crack first? 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana," said Arnold,. 'if I had to pick . . . because that is probably in 
the most liberal part of Orange County. That would be a great way to let the 
people there know what's going on, and maybe get them to switch parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have pricked up their ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the party leadership in Orange County has pooh-poohed the lavish 
spending on GOP-TV, the prospect of equal time has them talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will take action," Garcia said. "It may be something totally different 
than using cable, but we will do something to counteract what they're doing."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; PARK SPRINGS TO LIFE AGAIN AFTER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring is breathing new life into Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park, where 
5,200 acres were scorched by fire last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new season is helping the burned areas recover from the devastation, 
bringing an explosion of new colors and plant life to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from shooting stars to Indian paintbrush is blooming in the park, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wildflowers are starting to pop," said Jina Drury, a park technician. 
"It's very pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire cleared parklands of heavy brush and dense trees, allowing new plant 
life to take root and flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing flowers in areas we haven't seen them before," Drury said. "And 
the ashy black ground is now being replaced by green, grassy areas. The park is 
making a nice recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Spring has brought more visitors to the park to picnic, pedal the miles of 
mountain bike trails or ride horses along San Juan Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everything about spring's arrival is peachy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more trimming and mowing to do," Drury said. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ANTI-VIOLENCE PANEL PLANS TO RECONVENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Smith received an unwelcome reminder of the city's youth crime 
problem earlier this year when his 5-year-old son was attacked by a group of 
teen-agers on his way home from school. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack did not seriously injure his son, but it sparked shock and anger in 
the community. It occurred about a year after Smith and a group of residents 
completed a comprehensive report that studied ways to reduce youth violence in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident has also added a sense of urgency to the Youth Community Task 
Force's plans to reconvene this month and assess how its recommendations have 
been received. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do a recheck," Smith, who is on the task force, said. "We want to 
examine what's happened over the last year and whether any of our assumptions 
have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force delivered its report amid much fanfare at a joint session of 
the City Council and the Irvine Unified School District board. The increased 
concern about youth and gang violence was underscored in November, 1992, by a 
drive-by shooting near an alternative high school in the Woodbridge area. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force provided more than 50 recommendations for reducing youth 
violence, including beefing up security on campuses to teaching ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and the school district have implemented some of the suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district increased the number of school safety officers on high 
school campuses and extended the program to some middle schools. It has also 
improved its ethics and nonviolent conflict resolution curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has allocated thousands of dollars to fund after-school 
activities and a program aimed at helping parents with troubled children. The 
city also plans to have the Police Department back up to full staffing by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are off to a pretty good start," Smith said, adding that the next 
step might be to expand anti-drug programs in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the attack on his son prompted a flurry of calls from residents 
outraged by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is really a feeling in the community now that citizens are 
angry," he said. "They are sick of it, and they've had enough."SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; FIREFIGHTERS BACK SWITCH TO COUNTY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's firefighters association gave its support this week to a proposal 
that the Orange County Fire Department provide fire services for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is painful to think that our department may end.If we can't maintain our 
level of protection as a 'stand-alone' fire department, then the county is a 
viable alternative," said David C. Dorn, president of the Buena Park Firemen's 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorn said about 90% of the 52 members of the association favor the move. Under 
the county's contract proposal, all 61 city Fire Department personnel would 
keep their jobs and be absorbed into the county department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been told layoffs are likely" if the city faces continued budget 
problems, Dorn said. "If we go county, everybody will have job." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff cuts, he said, "would result in increased fire loss and possibly more 
injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 The city turned to the county Fire Department to determine if the city could 
save money by contracting for fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin O'Rourke said the city staff is preparing an updated cost 
analysis based on the county's final proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 At this week's City Council meeting, about 80 people attended a public 
information forum and were given the opportunity to ask questions and voice 
their comments and concerns about the county's contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The next public information meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m. April 18 in the 
City Council chambers. The council is tentatively scheduled to decide on the 
contract proposal May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a great deal for us, though it is fair," Dorn said, adding that 
some department employees will receive $20 a week less in compensation, while 
two employees will receive a substantial salary and benefit reduction of about 
$1,600 a month.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; PSYCHOLOGIST NAMED TO SCHOOL BOARD POST

<TEXT>
<P>
 A child psychologist from Seal Beach was appointed this week to the board of 
the Los Alamitos Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathew Duggan, 35, will fill the seat left vacant when Jeanne Flint resigned 
in February.His appointment to the five-member board expires in November, but 
Duggan said he plans to seek election to the seat at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fabulous opportunity to help the kids," said Duggan, a Seal Beach 
resident. "I've dealt a lot with schools and that got me interested in doing 
more at a larger level." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members picked Duggan on Monday from among 13 applicants after 
interviews conducted that same day. After he was sworn in, he participated in 
Monday's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan said the district's biggest challenge is getting more money to support 
school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to convince people in the government that funding education is 
crucial to the betterment of this country," Duggan said. "Children are the most 
underrepresented segment of our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan has a private practice in child psychology in Long Beach, and he is a 
former consultant to the Los Angeles Unified School District. He is also a 
member of a drug education panel at Wilson High School in Long Beach. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CITY OKS $400,000 LAND PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $400,000 land purchase for a new animal control shelter and fire department 
training center was authorized by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.4-acre plot sits on the future site of an industrial park, near Avenida 
Pico and Avenida La Pata. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the purchase price, the city agreed to give about $160,000 in 
sewer credits to the landowner, Rancho San Clemente Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, developers receive allotments for sewer use from City Hall. 
Landowners who use more than their allotted share are charged extra.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas Lorch voted against the purchase, saying the city would pay 
too much for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorch said that with so many acres of open space available, "there could be 
some alternatives. I don't think this is such a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the property would cost about $4.50 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Some land in the proposed industrial park costs as much as $8.94 per square 
foot, said interim Fire Chief Gene Begnell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This land is by no means a bad deal," he said. FRANK MESSINA

 She started the display four years ago after realizing how fast ranch life was 
changing. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; MITSUBISHI GIVES 25 TV SETS TO RED CROSS

<P>
 Mitsubishi Electric America Inc. is donating 25 television sets and carrying 
cases to the Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross for use at 
shelters if there is a natural disaster, officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is donating televisions nationwide to chapters of the Red Cross, 
according to Takashi Kiuchi, Mitsubishi chairman and chief executive 
officer.The television sets, carried in aluminum storage and shipping crates, 
will be delivered to temporary shelters after natural disasters for victims to 
use upon request by Red Cross chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one is in a natural disaster, all your choices are taken away," said 
Kara Lakkees, public affairs spokeswoman for the Red Cross. "When you provide a 
television for a shelter, what you are doing is re-establishing a sense of 
normalcy." 
</P>
<P>
 The news on television also helps people see what is going on in other areas 
affected by the disaster and controls rumors, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The television sets, which are worth $629 each, will have a second audio 
program capability for transmitting Spanish audio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Mitsubishi and the Red Cross said the program is meant to 
encourage awareness of advance preparation for disasters.AILEEN CHO

 The City Council and Cal State Fullerton this week agreed to have the 
university pay the city $7.4 million over 48 years to pay back what the school 
borrowed to build a sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton borrowed the money from the city over the past 10 years in 
order to finance the university's recently completed sports complex.The complex 
includes baseball and football stadiums and several fields for soccer and 
softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, the city invested $10.2 million in the complex and loaned the 
university the $7.4 million to complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had expected the university to repay the loan with money from a 
Cal State Fullerton fund-raiser, but it failed to produce the money expected. 
The fund-raising campaign, which concluded last year, raised about $1.36 
million in two years, said Gary A. Chalupsky, executive director of the 
Fullerton Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city will collect its money through an agreement that allows the city 
to lease a piece of university-owned property, which currently is leased to a 
hotel, and collect all the lease revenue. Before this week, the city and the 
university split the hotel revenue profit in half.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; BUDDHIST TEMPLE WINS COUNCIL OK

<P>
 The City Council has decided to allow the Chua Duoc Su Buddhist congregation 
to build a temple in Skylark Estates, a neighborhood of mostly single-family 
homes on Magnolia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints from neighbors have delayed the project for more than a year. Only 
last month, the Planning Commission rejected the project, despite the 
congregation's offer to reduce the temple's size by about half, to 5,000 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, council members unanimously agreed to that plan, saying it 
will not significantly affect noise and traffic in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meets every criteria for that (type of) project, " Mayor Frank Kessler 
said Wednesday. "There is no legitimate reason to deny the project." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-member Buddhist congregation, made up mostly of Vietnamese immigrants, 
plans to convert a remodeled farmhouse bought five years ago to an elaborate 
temple with archways, green roofs and curved eaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of the design, residents have complained that the temple would 
appear out of place in the neighborhood. It would be 29 feet tall at its 
highest point. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple spokeswoman T.Le said the temple, in fact, will enhance the 
neighborhood. She said a seven-foot-high wall will be built as a buffer between 
the temple and nearby residences. More than 80 parking spaces will be installed 
to prevent congregation members from parking on the streets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have decided to hold all activities indoors," Lee said. "And we will not 
use firecrackers or fireworks during religious ceremonies, although we were 
told it's legal in Garden Grove." 
</P>
<P>
 Le said that some congregation members do not understand why city permits are 
necessary to operate a temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam, you just need a piece of land," Le said. "Here in America, you 
need permits. Some of us don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Churches and temples are allowed in residential areas, according to David 
Kennon, the city's community services director. But since 1992, the city has 
required religious groups to have a conditional use permit. Public hearings are 
held before the permit is granted, Kennon said, allowing people who could be 
affected by the project to voice their opinions.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; FATHER IS SUSPECT IN DEATH OF BABY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have arrested a 28-year-old man in connection with the death of his 
6-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant, Cathy Licet Ramirez, died at UCI Medical Center in Orange early 
Thursday.Doctors attributed her death to severe blows to the abdomen, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruperto Ramirez, a father of five, was arrested Thursday night at his home in 
the 1600 block of West 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4:15 a.m. Thursday, paramedics and police had been summoned to the home 
on a report that a child needed medical attention, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Dick 
Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant's mother, Catalina Gomez, 27, could not be reached for comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who said she lives with her two small children in the same A-frame 
house as the family said she was shocked that anyone would think Ramirez could 
kill his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that they treat their five children right," the woman, who 
declined to give her name, said of the couple. "I never saw him or her hit 
their children. (The children) sometimes behave like brats, and she really lets 
them have it, but kill one of them? No. I'm sorry, but that is not true." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she did not hear anything unusual in the house the night 
authorities were called. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust said Ramirez was taken to Santa Ana City Jail, where he awaits 
arraignment on a murder charge. His bail was set at $250,000. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY OKS PAYING STATE $85,000 SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a settlement of a lawsuit filed by state labor 
officials, who accused the city of failing to withhold $200,000 from a 
contractor who allegedly did not pay workers "prevailing" wages to build a 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the settlement, approved by the council Tuesday in closed 
session, the city will pay the state $85,000 -- money the city withheld from 
the contractor's final payment because construction on the library was 
completed a year late, said City Atty. Alan R. Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor commissioner Victoria Bradshaw of the state Industrial Relations 
Department notified City Manager Ray Kromer in June of 1991 to withhold the 
$200,000 after the state accused Rainey Construction Inc. of La Habra of not 
paying prevailing wages to construction workers on the library project. 
</P>
<P>
 A "prevailing" wage is defined as the minimum pay rate set by the state for 
public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the $2-million library was completed in June, 1991, the city paid 
Rainey for the project and accepted a $200,000 bond from the contractor to 
cover the state's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state notified us late and didn't give us full notification," Kromer 
said. "By the time they notified us, we had already released money to finalize 
the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing the state labor commissioner could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor commissioner sued the city last November, contending that the city 
should not have accepted the bond and demanding the $200,000, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the city will allow the state to sue the bonding company 
and collect the $200,000. If the state collects on the full amount, Burns said, 
the city will be reimbursed for the $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we're very optimistic that the city is going to recoup the 
$85,000," Kromer said. "With that bond, we have hopefully covered the city." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of disputes over the library construction, other lawsuits 
involving the city, the contractor and the architect are pending, Burns said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; PUBLIC DEFENDER TESTS 3-STRIKES LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first local challenge to the "three strikes" law, the Orange County 
Public Defender's Office claimed Friday that that the new legislation unfairly 
punishes defendants for past convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Only convictions racked up after the law went into affect last month should be 
counted as strikes, said Deputy Public Defender Kevin J. Phillips, who helped 
formulate the challenge that takes aims at the heart of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just grandfather these (prior convictions) in," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office filed its challenge Friday in the case of Mario 
V. Rodriguez, 30, of Garden Grove, who last month became the first Orange 
County resident charged under the new law. Rodriguez pleaded not guilty Friday 
to felony assault and weapons charges stemming from a barroom brawl during 
which Rodriguez allegedly shot a man in the face with a flare gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's two prior "strikes" came when he was convicted of assault with 
intent to commit murder and second-degree robbery, according to court records. 
A preliminary hearing on the new charges was scheduled for April 25, according 
to a court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rodriguez's case, the public defender's office argued in its court filings 
Friday that only charges filed after the law went into effect in March should 
count against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Arnold D. Westra, who is prosecuting Rodriguez, could not 
be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said a judge must decide whether the prior convictions should count 
against the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters hail the "three strikes" law as a way to crack down on repeat 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The law mandates a sentence of 25 years to life for a third-time felon whose 
earlier convictions included serious or violent felonies. Any third felony 
conviction, however, can trigger the sentencing enhancement, regardless of 
whether it is considered violent or serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the law is overly broad, and unfairly allows juvenile 
convictions to count as "strikes." Critics, including Phillips, say the law 
also restricts a judge's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with enhancing sentences for past conduct, but this 
law has no wash-out period and doesn't give any leeway for people in the 
prosecutor's office or judges to use their discretion to decide whether a 
defendant should go away for life," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems a little Draconian," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Other legal challenges to the law are mounting statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials on both sides of the issue are debating whether the new 
law will clog criminal courts and prisons, or whether it will save money by 
cracking down on crime and criminal activity caused by repeat offenders. RENE

<P>
 Three people were injured, including two California Highway Patrol officers, 
when a suspected drunk driver struck a vehicle the officers had stopped on the 
Riverside Freeway early Friday, CHP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were preparing the vehicle for towing after arresting the driver, 
who was wanted in Riverside on a warrant, when the crash occurred about 1:40 
a.m., the CHP said.The man's female passenger was also arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Greg Dixon, 26, and Carla Eldridge, 29, were taken to Kaiser 
Permanente's Anaheim Medical Center in Anaheim, where they were treated for 
minor injuries to the knees and released, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Grippi, 35, of Anaheim, allegedly the driver who caused the crash, 
was also taken to Kaiser Hospital. Grippi, whom the CHP said was not wearing a 
seat belt, sustained facial cuts, chest injuries and a broken leg. She was 
later transferred to the jail ward at Western Medical Center-Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Grippi was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man and woman the CHP officers had stopped in the northbound lanes of the 
Riverside Freeway west of Coal Canyon Road were booked at the Orange County 
Jail, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were identified as Ricky Dewbre, 19, and Sharon Leno, 40, both of 
Riverside. According to the CHP, Dewbre was wanted on a warrant and allegedly 
was in possession of stolen property. Leno was also booked on suspicion of 
possession of stolen property.

LA HABRA LANDLORD HELD AS SUSPECT IN 5 APARTMENT FIRES; ARSON: AUTHORITIES 
ALLEGE HE SET BLAZES -- THE LATEST ONE IN ANAHEIM -- AT COMPLEXES HE OWNED TO 
COLLECT INSURANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Authorities said Friday that they suspect a 63-year-old landlord of trying to 
set as many as five fires at his own apartment buildings in Orange County, but 
they released his wife from jail after concluding that she was not involved in 
any of the arsons. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent fire came early Thursday morning at an eight-unit apartment 
building at 1545 W. Ball Road in Anaheim, forcing at least three families to 
flee into the night. Building owner Gheorghe Alexandroai and his wife, Floarea, 
50, were arrested hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Floarea Alexandroai was released from Anaheim City Jail late Friday afternoon 
after investigators determined that she did not take part in what they believe 
was an insurance-driven scheme. As she sat on a couch in the couple's La Habra 
home Friday afternoon, just hours after she was released, the teary-eyed woman 
said she remained unsure whether her husband set two fires and tried to start 
three others as charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, I don't know," she said, wrapping a pink sweater more tightly 
around her hunched shoulders. "I feel so sorry for him. . . . So sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 But pity was far from the minds of some of Gheorghe Alexandroai's tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of man would do that kind of thing with so many kids in the 
building?" said an irate Ronda Hahn, who has lived for three months with her 
three children at another complex that Gheorghe Alexandroai owned at 1541 W. 
Ball Road. Investigators allege that the landlord also tried to set fire last 
November to Hahn's building, next to the one involved in Thursday's blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man must have no morals whatsoever," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gheorghe Alexandroai, who emigrated to this country from Romania two decades 
ago, is being held at the Anaheim jail on $150,000 bail. Officials said he is 
expected to be arraigned Monday on as many as five charges of arson and 
attempted arson.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they are also considering whether attempted murder charges 
should be filed in the Ball Road blaze and perhaps others, but no decisions 
have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Thursday's fire, the county arson task force was already 
investigating Alexandroai and was preparing to serve a search warrant against 
him, said Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young. The warrant was hastily executed 
Thursday after the Ball Road fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the warrant, investigators alleged that he set or attempted to set five 
fires in Orange County in the last nine months. No one was hurt in the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are looking at other cases possibly involving Alexandroai in 
Mira Loma in Riverside County and in Chicago, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1992, he allegedly set an early-morning blaze at an apartment 
building that he owns in the 8600 block of Cerritos Avenue in Stanton, 
according to the search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 He later received $217,000 in insurance money. According to the search 
warrant, a Stanton building inspector told investigators that the repairs made 
with the insurance money were unnecessary or were upgrades that tenants had 
asked for before the fire struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the Garden Grove Fire Department, which covers the Stanton 
area, are handling that incident, working with the Anaheim Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators alleged in the warrant that Alexandroai then tried to set fire 
last Nov. 19 to the apartments at 1541 W. Ball Road by leaving a trail of 
gasoline-soaked rags and clothes in the attic. No blaze was actually ignited in 
that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Fire Investigator Mike Doty said that at the time, authorities 
believed that gang members seeking retaliation may have been to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 8, Alexandroai allegedly tried to incinerate the apartment building 
that he owns next to the one on Cerritos Avenue in Stanton, causing charring in 
the attic and other limited damage. None of the occupants were hurt, and all 
were relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 2, the search warrant said, firefighters once again responded to 
tenants' calls that they smelled gasoline at 1541 W. Ball Road. Firefighters 
found seven one-gallon plastic milk jugs filled with gasoline in the attic, 
along with plastic cat litter pans that also contained gasoline. They also 
found cash register receipts for some of the items, allegedly purchased from a 
store half a mile from Gheorghe Alexandroai's La Habra home. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the California Department of Forestry is also investigating a 
suspicious blaze at an Alexandroai property in Mira Loma last Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until fire investigators from Garden Grove, Anaheim and the Orange 
County Fire Department began comparing notes last month that they noticed the 
similarities in the incidents at the Alexandroai-owned buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late to prevent this week's blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent incident, fire investigators said they believe that 
Alexandroai left five plastic salad bowls filled with gasoline-soaked rags in 
the attic of the apartment building at 1545 W. Ball Road late Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 The rags caught fire shortly before 4 a.m., seriously damaging five of the 
eight apartments and leaving several families homeless, including that of the 
apartment manager. Authorities say they are uncertain how or when the fire was 
actually set. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe it happened again," said Hahn, the tenant in the building 
next door. "There were a lot of little kids standing out there in the cold, 
asking, 'What's going on?' It's just not fair."

MASS MURDER TRIAL ORDERED MOVED TO O.C.; COURTS: JUDGE CITES EXTENSIVE NEWS 
COVERAGE IN TRANSFERRING CASE OF DECADE-OLD SLAYINGS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge on Friday ordered the mass murder trial of Charles Ng 
transferred to Orange County, but gave defense lawyers 30 days to file an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Siskiyou County Judge James Kleaver, who was assigned to the case by 
state legal authorities, said he shifted the long-delayed trial to Southern 
California because of extensive pretrial news coverage in the northern area.  
</P>
<P>
 Ng, 33, described as a martial arts expert, faces a dozen murder counts. 
Prosecutors contend that Ng, along with survivalist Leonard Lake, killed and 
tortured victims at a remote mountain house in Calaveras County, about 150 
miles east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake committed suicide with a cyanide capsule shortly after his June, 1985, 
arrest for shoplifting at a San Francisco-area store. Ng, who was with Lake at 
the time, escaped and fled to Canada, but was returned to the United States 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Judicial Council recommended that Ng's trial be transferred to 
Sacramento or Orange County, and Kleaver said he favored Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I drove in here this morning, there were three television trucks from 
Sacramento. That gives you some indication of the interest of the Sacramento 
media in this case," Kleaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleaver is the latest in a series of judges who have conducted proceedings in 
the complex case. Others either withdrew because of potential conflicts or were 
successfully challenged by attorneys.

 Ng, in an unusual arrangement, is being held in a maximum security section of 
Folsom Prison, about 40 miles to the north. He is taken to court proceedings in 
a prison van. 
</P>
<P>
 Security in the small Calaveras County courtroom was tight. Spectators were 
ordered to remove their shoes and belts before entering, and shotgun-toting 
deputies were inside the courtroom to provide security. Two armed deputies 
stood near Ng throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, retired Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald A. 
McCartin rejected Ng's request for new lawyers, citing trial delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, we may all be old and dead before this case comes to trial," 
McCartin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Ephraim Margolin of San Francisco opposed the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just another mistake in a long series of mistakes in the prosecution 
in this case," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calaveras County Dist. Atty. John E. Martin said: "We've wasted enough 
time. The people have a right for this case to move forward."

ACTION DELAYED ON BOLSA CHICA ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has delayed action on two controversial issues affecting the 
Bolsa Chica area. 
</P>
<P>
 One item is a long-proposed county regional park bordering the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands; the other issue is proposed extension of a street from the Bolsa 
Chica area to Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, the county has proposed a long, slim regional park that would 
extend from the border of Huntington Beach's existing Central Park to the ocean 
at Pacific Coast Highway. The proposed Bolsa Chica Regional Park would be on 
the south edge of the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Department of Harbors, Beaches and Parks earlier this year 
requested that the Huntington Beach Planning Commission approve the first phase 
of development for the regional park. The city's planning staff recommended 
approval, but the commission, by a 4-2 vote on March 1, rejected the county's 
plans for the park. 
</P>
<P>
 That rejection was appealed to the City Council, which has ultimate approval 
of city land uses. The council was scheduled to vote on the park issue this 
week, but it deferred action pending further study by a three-member council 
subcommittee. The matter is now scheduled to come before the council on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 In another action linked to the Bolsa Chica area, the council decided to seek 
an alternative to the proposed linking of Seapoint Street to Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Seapoint Street is in a neighborhood of upscale homes near the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands. Residents of the area have argued that extension of Seapoint Street 
to Coast Highway would create heavy traffic into their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said Seapoint Street must be extended to provide better 
public safety, including access for police and fire vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 5-2 vote, the council agreed to delay action on Seapoint Street until May 
2.

UCI STUDENT WINS PRESTIGIOUS TRUMAN SCHOLARSHIP OF $30,000; ACADEMIA: THE 
ENGLISH AND COMPARATIVE LITERATURE SCHOLAR IS SCHOOL'S SECOND AWARD WINNER IN 2 
YEARS.

 Julia Kiely already met one challenge when she returned to college to get her 
bachelor's degree more than a decade after graduating from a community college. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the 36-year-old UC Irvine undergraduate student has reached another 
milestone -- a prestigious Truman scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiely, an English and comparative literature scholar, is the second UCI 
student in two years to win the $30,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiely said she will use the scholarship to pursue a master's degree in public 
policy and pay for her final undergraduate year at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics is my life," said Kiely, a staunch Republican whose father was 
president of his college's Young Democrats club and whose mother headed her 
college's Young Republicans group. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiely graduated from Cerritos College in 1979 and took night classes in the 
succeeding years while working, she said. Kiely joined the staff of a local 
congressman, later became the director of government affairs with the Anaheim 
Chamber of Commerce and also worked as an organizer for oil industry interests, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of the founders of CAST -- or Child Abuse Service Team -- a group 
coordinating city, county and state agencies to make services to abused 
children less traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, after she was unable to find a job in government or politics, Kiely 
decided to get a bachelor's degree at UCI to compete in the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she said, she wants to serve as director or staff member of a 
foundation that supports and gives scholarships to abused children or youths at 
risk of falling into crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiely is pleased to have won the scholarship competing against younger 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was much older" than the rest of them, Kiely said. "I could've been the 
mother of a couple of them."

3 PLEAD INNOCENT IN SHOOTING DEATH OF SECURITY GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Santa Ana men charged with the shooting death of a movie theater 
security guard in February pleaded innocent Friday to first-degree murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Lee Alonzo Jr., 19, Rafael Maldonado, 20, and Jessie Pena, 19, pleaded 
innocent in Orange County Municipal Court to murdering 23-year-old former 
Marine Dagoberto R. Carrero while he worked the night shift as a security guard 
at the Century City Centre Theatre in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Alonzo, angry over a dispute he had with Carrero at 
the theater a month earlier, returned on Feb. 19 and shot the unarmed security 
guard five times through a glass door, hitting him in the head and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne said Alonzo apparently watched as Carrero got 
involved in an argument with six teen-agers, who reportedly threatened the 
security guard after he asked them to leave the showing of a 7:15 p.m. film. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo, who pretended to side with Carrero in the argument, then left the 
theater, returned with a handgun, and shot Carrero, Browne said. The handgun 
was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, police sought the six teen-agers for the shooting. Then 
investigators received a tip that led to the arrest of Alonzo and two friends. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Alonzo allegedly phoned Maldonado and Pena to give him a 
ride from the crime scene. The two were charged with murder because they helped 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing for all three men was set for May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo had no previous record. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero, a native of Puerto Rico who flew helicopter missions in the Persian 
Gulf War, was shot on his last night on the job. He had been accepted into the 
Air National Guard, and was scheduled to fly to Texas the same week for a 
four-month training session, which he hoped would help pay for college.

SUSPECTED FAKE-BEARD BANK BANDIT NABBED; CRIME: HE IS CAPTURED AFTER $13,500 
HOLDUP OF HUNTINGTON BEACH BANK. POLICE SAY HE MAY BE LINKED TO 30 ROBBERIES.

<P>
 A man suspected of more than 30 bank robberies in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, usually wearing a fake beard and mustache and a baseball cap, was 
arrested Friday after robbing a bank at gunpoint, FBI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Maynard Hearn, 37, of Santa Monica, who authorities think is the "fake 
beard bandit," was arrested at 11:30 a.m. after robbing Union Bank in 
Huntington Beach at 11 a.m., FBI Special Investigator Gary Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber, wearing a fake beard and mustache and baseball cap, showed a 
teller the handgun in his waistband and a note demanding money, said Huntington 
Beach Police Department Lt. Luis Ochoa.  
</P>
<P>
 The teller got money from other tellers and gave him $13,500 in cash, which he 
stuffed into a black vinyl bag, Ochoa said. He drove from the parking lot in a 
white sedan, followed by a witness who was in the bank. The witness called 
police with a description of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 11:30 a.m., Los Alamitos Officer Dave Stauffer saw the car going 
north on the San Gabriel River Freeway in Hawaiian Gardens. He followed and 
arrested Hearn in the parking lot of Hawaiian Gardens City Hall, said 
Huntington Beach Sgt. Ron Lesovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn is suspected of robbing a Mission Viejo bank earlier this week of 
$6,900, again in disguise, police said. He also is suspected of other robberies 
in Laguna Hills, Irvine, Mission Viejo, Newport Beach, San Clemente, Lake 
Forest, Cypress, Garden Grove and Villa Park, in addition to San Diego and 
Texas, starting in 1986, police and Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn is being held at Huntington Beach City jail, and bail is set at $50,000.

SCHOOL DISTRICT SUES RAMS OVER PRACTICE FIELD; FOOTBALL: LEASE FOR USE OF 
FACILITY IN ANAHEIM HAS EXPIRED. THE TEAM IS THREATENING TO LEAVE THE CITY AT 
THE END OF SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The school district that owns the Los Angeles Rams' practice facility filed 
suit Friday to evict the team because it has refused to sign a new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnolia School District filed the suit in Orange County Superior Court, 
asking that the team be forced to leave the former elementary school that was 
converted into "Rams Park" when the team arrived in town in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's lease expired Dec. 31 and it has refused several offers made by the 
district and the city, which acts as the district's agent under a complicated 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be perfectly happy to keep the Rams as tenants, but not without a 
lease," said Esther H. Wallace, acting president of the district's Board of 
Trustees. "It wouldn't be fair to the school district. We've offered them a 
pretty good deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Rams Executive Vice President John Shaw refused to comment Friday on the suit 
and the lease. The team has told the city that on May 3 they will give notice 
that they may move out of Anaheim Stadium after the 1994 season. It is being 
courted by several cities, including Baltimore and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's latest offer to the Rams for the practice facility would have had 
the city pay the teams' $220,000 annual rent and would have allowed the team to 
break the 15-year agreement at any time by paying a $220,000 fee to the 
district. The city also would have paid half of the approximately $1.2 million 
cost of converting the facility back into a school if the Rams leave town after 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White said the city supports the district's 
lawsuit, and he is perplexed by the Rams refusal to accept the latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand how they can logically reject the offer," White said. 
"There is no way they can get a better deal. . . . Now they've exposed 
themselves to paying attorney fees -- not only their own, but the district's 
and the city's -- and damages for (overstaying) their lease, not to mention the 
inconvenience and cost of moving."

MAN PLEADS INNOCENT TO FELONY CHILD ABUSE; CRIME: HE MAY FACE MORE CHARGES WHEN 
INQUIRY INTO DEATH OF HIS GIRLFRIEND'S 22-MONTH-OLD SON IS COMPLETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A house painter pleaded not guilty Friday to felony child abuse in connection 
with the death of his girlfriend's 22-month-old son, and he could face more 
serious charges once authorities complete their investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laudenback, 32, of Newport Beach was charged last month after the March 
25 death of Tyler Jaeger, the son of his girlfriend, Karey Jaeger, 
22.Laudenback was baby-sitting the toddler while the boy's mother went to her 
job as a special education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, the child was taken to Hoag Hospital on March 18 for treatment of 
a large bump on his head that turned out to be a fractured skull. Laudenback 
told Jaeger the boy hurt himself during a fall, and the injuries were 
consistent with a tumble, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was brought back to the hospital on March 25 with additional 
injuries, but he could not be revived, officials said. Police said they 
arrested Laudenback the same day after learning of suspicious bruising on the 
boy's body and the earlier head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback was arraigned Friday at Harbor Municipal Court in Newport Beach, 
and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 3, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback, who faces a single charge of felony corporal punishment on a 
child, could be sentenced to up to six years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary autopsy indicated that the child died of abnormal bleeding from 
a cut liver and pancreas, caused by injuries from a blunt instrument, police 
said. Prosecutors said they are awaiting a coroner's report to determine 
whether homicide charges should be filed.

DODGERS NO-HIT; MERCKER BIG HIT; BASEBALL: BRAVES STARTER STRIKES OUT 10 IN 
SEASON'S FIRST NO-HITTER IN 6-0 VICTORY OVER L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The realization set in after the sixth inning, and grew in intensity the rest 
of the night. Every move Kent Mercker made on the mound at Dodger Stadium on 
Friday was watched with a growing excitement; every pitch Mercker unleashed 
during the eighth inning kept the crowd of 36,546 in their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the ninth, and while the crowd stood, Atlanta Braves' Manager Bobby 
Cox stayed seated in the dugout. His pitcher was throwing a no-hitter, and a 
nervous Cox wasn't about to change the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker ran out to the mound with a 6-0 lead, a score that would stand, and 
his thoughts were on Brett Butler, the first batter he would face. He hates 
facing Butler, and all Mercker was thinking was that he had to stay ahead of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was down two strikes before he battled back to even the count. Then 
Mercker threw a fastball on the outside corner, and Butler went down looking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza stepped to the plate, but he, too, went down on a called third 
strike. It was a change-up, and it was the pitch Mercker had used to stymie the 
Dodgers all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Eric Karros, who had nearly broken up Mercker's no-hitter in the 
sixth inning. But fate would have it otherwise, and when Karros grounded 
Mercker's changeup back to him, Mercker held on to ball tight. He was going to 
throw the ball to Fred McGriff at first base, but his adrenaline was so high, 
he thought he might throw it into the dugout.  
</P>
<P>
 So he ran across toward McGriff and tossed the ball softly, and the Braves' 
dugout emptied onto the field. Cox left his seat. Mercker had thrown a 
no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a sense after the sixth inning that something could happen," Mercker 
said. "I had two no-hitters going in the past but that's when I was in the 
bullpen and I didn't have the endurance to keep going after six innings. On one 
of them, we went on to complete the no-hitter. But it's kind of a joke with the 
other guys, they can't believe that I would come out of the game with a 
no-hitter going. But I told them it's not my decision, it's the manager's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, I had to prove that I had the endurance. I'm glad to just be able to 
keep up with the other four guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker was the fill-in pitcher last season, the fifth guy on a pitching staff 
that has accumulated more Cy Young awards than a mantle can hold. He won the 
fifth spot after last season when he took over after Pete Smith was sidelined, 
being called out of the bullpen, where he was a mid-reliever. But in Mercker's 
six starts last season, his longest outing was six innings.  
</P>
<P>
 It was on Sept. 11, 1991, when he combined with Mark Wohlers and Alejandro 
Pena on a no-hitter against San Diego. And again against the Padres last 
season, he had a no-hit bid going again, but Cox took him out.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cox wasn't about to take Mercker out this time, especially after the sixth 
inning, when the best chance the Dodgers had to break up his no-hitter was 
taken away. That's when Mercker said he knew something good might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Through six innings, only four balls were hit by the Dodgers that might have 
gone for base hits. But with two outs in a sixth, Butler, who was on first base 
with a walk, broke for second to steal on Mercker's 1-1 pitch to Eric Karros. 
Karros lined a shot that was headed toward center field, but when Butler broke 
for second, so did second baseman Mark Lemke, who was in perfect position to 
catch the ball by the bag for the third out of the inning. Manager Tom Lasorda 
said Butler was running on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the sixth inning when Lemke caught that ball, I had a sense of a 
no-hitter, " Mercker said, "because there is no way that play should have been 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, Terry Pendleton made two fine plays at third base on 
grounders by Raul Mondesi and Jose Offerman. And in the fifth, Deion Sanders 
made a diving catch in short center field on a sinking fly ball by Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mercker said his legs started to tighten and he lost velocity on 
his fastball, but his adrenaline kicked in, and he seemed to get stronger. By 
the end of the game, he had struck out 10, with four walks, none past the sixth 
inning. He retired the final nine batters in order. And there was only one 
Dodger to reach second base, Delino DeShields in the first inning, when he 
walked and stole second.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give him credit, he pitched a good game, he caught us at a time 
when we weren't swinging the bats very well," said Mike Piazza, who has one hit 
in 16 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker's performance overshadowed a fine outing by Dodger starter Pedro 
Astacio, who had a career-high 11 strikeouts in 7 2/3 innings and the debut of 
Chan Ho Park, who pitched the ninth inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Fred McGriff led off the inning by hitting Astacio's first pitch into the 
seats in left-center. Terry Pendleton followed later by blasting a shot into 
the Braves' bullpen in rightfield. Then in the fourth inning, David Justice 
took Astacio deep into the seats in right-center to put the Braves up, 3-0. 
</P>

LOSS TO NUGGETS LEAVES THE LAKERS THINKING LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They're better off in the lottery anyway, right? 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers took a big step in that direction Friday night. They were pushed, 
actually, the force of a 28-6 run in the third and fourth quarters propelling 
the Denver Nuggets into control of the game and the race for the eighth and 
final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets went on to win, 112-99, before a capacity crowd of 17,505 at the 
Forum, despite a career-high 33 points from Vlade Divac and 21 points and 10 
assists from James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 But those numbers aren't the real concern today for the Lakers. These are: 
</P>
<P>
 Four games behind with nine to play. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those games is at Denver's McNichols Arena on April 19. But whereas the 
Lakers play only one lottery-bound team the rest of the way, the Clippers, and, 
in an unusual twist, play all nine games in sets of two in a row, the Nuggets 
still have the luxury of games with Minnesota, Dallas and the Clippers. 
Denver's toughest stretch begins Sunday -- Houston, Phoenix and at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to keep working hard," Doug Christie said after the Lakers' 
seven-game home winning streak was snapped. "It's not impossible to win out in 
the end. Hopefully, they will stumble like we stumbled tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of a big enough stumble? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's slim to none now," Coach Magic Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of their offensive rebounding to erase a 10-point deficit in 
the third quarter and draw within 79-78 heading into the fourth, the Nuggets 
then stepped outside to turn that into a 92-85 lead on a three-pointer by 
Rodney Rogers and a basket by Bryant Stith on consecutive possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 They then capitalized on three consecutive turnovers for baskets by Brian 
Williams, Robert Pack and Stith, and the cushion grew to 98-85 with 6:59 left. 
That was the end of the 28-6 charge . . . and of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the speculation, people were saying a lot," center Dikembe Mutombo said 
after getting 15 points, 15 rebounds and five blocked shots. "Christie, or 
whatever his name is, was talking about they were going to kick our butts, 
we're scared of them. You can't talk trash like that. You can't talk trash 
until you take care of business." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets came in having lost four of their previous five games, but the one 
victory was by 14 points the night before against the league's winningest team, 
Seattle. That was enough to push Denver's lead back to three games and prompted 
Johnson to call Friday's meeting a must-win game for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lived as a player for games like this," he said. "I told the players at 
shoot-around today, 'You are the luckiest 12 guys on the face of the earth 
tonight.' And they are. This is what you live for." 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a charged crowd, the Lakers looked as ready for the biggest game of 
the season as their coach in taking a 29-23 lead by the end of the first 
quarter while limiting Denver to 33.3% shooting. The six-point margin came as 
Christie tipped in his own miss with 1.1 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson update: Asked before the game about a return for next season, he 
replied, "What are the chances of me being back? More so the other way, that I 
won't. . . . I don't know if my wife and I are ready to give up our lives. The 
problem is, I've become attached to these guys." . . . After attempts to change 
his schedule, Johnson will be in Michigan today as planned for his charity high 
school game while the Lakers play at Portland. That is no surprise. What is a 
surprise is that Michael Cooper, not Bill Bertka, will be in charge against the 
Trail Blazers, a change from the previous plan. "I want Coop to see what he can 
do," said Johnson, who discussed the decision with owner Jerry Buss, among 
others. "Everyone does." Playoff Race at a Glance

ANGELS CAN'T GET REED ON BREWERS IN 5-1 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jody Reed listened all winter to friends calling him stupid. He watched a 
newscast accuse him of being greedy. Even his own family had difficulty 
understanding the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 While Reed may forever be ridiculed for turning down $7.8 million from the 
Dodgers, the second-guessing Friday night was focused on the guys across the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed put on a dazzling exhibition in the Milwaukee Brewers' 5-1 victory over 
the Angels before 8,788 at County Stadium, leaving the Angels wondering why he 
wasn't playing for them. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Reed going two for three with three runs batted in. There was Reed 
turning three double plays. There was Reed diving across second base, robbing 
Bo Jackson of a single and single-handedly stopping a rally. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Manager Buck Rodgers wishing he was an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the star of the game," Rodgers said. "He did absolutely everything out 
there. He definitely would have been a nice guy to have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, I didn't even know he was available at the time he signed with 
Milwaukee. When you're told one day that he's looking for three years at $8.5 
million, and a couple of days later he's signing a minor league contract at 
$350,000, something's not right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have thought that we definitely would have been interested at that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 And Reed was quite interested in the Angels. When the Dodgers acquired second 
baseman Delino DeShields in November, Reed began scouring the country for a 
job. The Angels were one of the first teams he called. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to be a natural fit. The Angels were moving Damion Easley to third 
base, and had no one else with experience. Instead, former General Manager 
Whitey Herzog chose to trade for Spike Owen and give Kevin Flora a shot at the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen quickly showed that he couldn't handle the everyday job. Flora was not 
ready. And they had to start a frenzied search the last 10 days of spring for a 
second man, settling on a $605,000 platoon of Harold Reynolds and Rex Hudler. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been Reed at $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "My agent called the Angels," Reed said, "but it lasted about five seconds. 
Don't ask me why, but they just had no interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels might have to pay the consequences, and starting Friday night, it 
appears they already have. Reed was as responsible as anyone for starter Phil 
Leftwich's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers took a 3-0 lead in the first inning after Reed's two-out, two-run 
single up the middle, and had a 5-1 lead after Reed's run-scoring single in the 
sixth. Brewer starter Ricky Bones never allowed the Angels back in the game, 
yielding six hits and one unearned run in 8 1/3 innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key of the game was getting defense from Jody Reed," Bones said. "I think 
he makes our middle infield one of the best in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, of course, thought he was just as valuable for the Dodgers. He figured 
he could have been their starting second baseman for the next three years, 
trying to terrorize the Giants. Now, he's on a rebuilding team that is picked 
to finish last in the American League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there's a reason for everything," Reed said. "Things will work out for 
the best. The only thing I ever wanted to do was play baseball, and that's what 
I'm doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a period of confusion there for a while, but that chapter is over. 
It's time to move on. I don't have anything to prove to anybody. It's 
unfortunate a bad picture was created, but I don't have a recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed will keep in touch with his former teammates, he says, and will harbor no 
grudges toward the organization. He played for the Dodgers for only a year, but 
still deeply cares for them.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sympathetic for Darryl (Strawberry)," he said. "Who cares what brought 
it on, or whose fault it is? He's a human being who's struggling. You don't 
want to see anyone go through that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us really knew what was going on with Darryl last year. 
It was like Darryl was on his own program. He just wasn't around too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to feel for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed says he just doesn't need anyone to feel for him.

THE MASTERS; DEMONS HAUNT DREADED NO. 12; GOLF: THIS TIME FORSMAN SURVIVES THE 
HOLE, SHOOTS A SIX-UNDER 66 AND TRAILS LEADER MIZE BY ONE SHOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES DEPUTY SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Masters golf tournament is as well known for its failures as its 
successes. More often than not, the tournament is lost, rather than won, as 
Augusta National finds another way to expose the dismal failings of its 
competitors in the most public of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the dismal figure was Dan Forsman, shooting a watery seven on the 
par-three 12th hole during the final round when he trailed eventual winner 
Bernhard Langer by only one shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsman tumbled to seventh place, good enough to get him an invitation back 
this year, but not good enough to make him forget. However, he made a good run 
at compensation Friday, shooting the low round of the day, a 66 that placed him 
one shot behind leader Larry Mize. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the course is being kind to Forsman, paying him back for being a 
gracious loser, or maybe it's merely teasing him, setting him up for an even 
bigger fall. The next two days will provide the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mize, the first-round leader, shot a 71, putting him at five-under-par 139. 
Forsman, Greg Norman and Tom Lehman are at 140. Hale Irwin, Tom Watson, Tom 
Kite, Jose Maria Olazabal and Ernie Els are one more shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that group of leaders, Els is only 25 and likely to wilt under the pressure 
of the Masters; Olazabal is 28, and everyone else is at least 35. 
</P>
<P>
 The course was able to keep its firm grip on the rest of the players, with 
only a few of the most famous being shown the door after the cut. Among the 
missing will be Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player, the three players 
who were most responsible for bringing golf out of its infancy and into the 
public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsman is more infamous than famous. It was last year when he discovered that 
his personal plot in hell was only 155 yards long with a green that has one 
bunker in front, two in back. At the very front, is Rae's Creek, which flows 
with the speed of a Southern drawl. It's the corner in "Amen Corner," and no 
less than Nicklaus calls it "the toughest hole in tournament golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Forsman, who started his 1993 Masters a virtual unknown, was a stroke out of 
the lead. He had attracted quite a following with his friendly manner, ready 
smile and the fact that Americans have a perpetual love affair with the 
underdog. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a six-iron, and the ball landed in the middle of Rae's Creek. He took 
his drop and hit his wedge short into the green and watched in disbelief as it 
caught the slope and rolled right back into the water. After another drop, he 
hit his wedge to the back of green, two-putted and was left to wonder what 
might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have gotten a lot of response from people after what happened last year," 
Forsman said Friday after shooting his 66. "People have been encouraging, 
yelling, 'Get by 12 and you can do it.' It's constantly before me, but this is 
golf, it's not life and death. There are other things a whole lot more 
important than what I did on the 12th hole at Augusta." 
</P>
<P>
 Forsman said he has gained a lot from last year and added that the pressure of 
the Masters was a lot to handle. It's not like any other tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about walking across a 2-by-4 that's sitting on cinder blocks, 
it's not too bad," Forsman said. "But this was like walking across the same 
2-by-4 on top of the World Trade Center with the wind swirling all around and 
everyone is there waiting for your demise, remembering all the people that have 
gone to their death." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Forsman hit an eight-iron within eight feet of the cup. He missed the 
putt, but got his par, the same score as Thursday. Forsman had little trouble 
with the rest of the back nine, with birdies on four of the holes. He also had 
three birdies and one bogey on the front nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he feels just fine with his par on No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at the 12th, I thought it was one of the most beautiful holes I've 
ever seen," he said. "Now, after last year, I respect it even more. I walk 
across the bridge (to the green) a little quieter. I get off the green and bow 
and pay homage to the great hole -- the 12th." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12th hole did catch Mize Friday with a bogey. "If 12 can't get your 
attention, then you're not alive," Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mize played a steady round with three birdies and two bogeys, the second 
coming after he missed a short putt on No. 18. Mize, who also led after the 
first round last year, had things figured out a little better this year, 
shooting 71 instead of 74. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did better on Friday this year," Mize said. "The difference, I think, is 
I'm more comfortable in the lead. I'm a little more prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having won here (in 1987) also makes it easier, especially going into the 
weekend. Having a green jacket takes the pressure off." 
</P>
<P>
 Logic says the most pressure Mize will likely encounter today and Sunday 
should be coming from Norman. After an erratic 70 Thursday, he shot a steady, 
controlled 70 Friday. Coming into this tournament, he was playing tremendous 
golf, with an overwhelming victory at the Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in a very comfortable position," Norman said. "I'm relaxed and hope that 
I can put on a performance this weekend like I know I can. The keys are 
patience and putting." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as usual, another key will be the 12th. After two rounds, there have been 
more double-bogeys (11) on the hole than birdies (eight). There have also been 
49 bogeys. It's playing as the second-most difficult on the course, behind the 
fourth hole, a 205-yard par-three. However, with no water, the fourth doesn't 
have that monster quality to it. No. 12 still has the lock on personal demons. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling with their own demons, meanwhile, were Nick Price, whose 73 on 
Friday left him at 147; defending champion Bernhard Langer, who shot another 74 
and is at 148; and former winners Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam, who are tied at 
149 after each shot a 73.

UNDECIDED ROBINSON WINS WOODEN AWARD; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PURDUE STAR EASILY 
OUTDISTANCES RIVALS, BUT DOESN'T EASILY TALK ABOUT DECISION ON COLLEGE OR NBA 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The basketball coronation of Purdue's Glenn Robinson continued Friday as the 
All-American junior forward was named winner of the John R. Wooden Award. Any 
more of these things and Robinson will have to ice down his shoulder, what with 
all the heavy trophy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 A plane delay out of Chicago caused Robinson, who led the nation in two NCAA 
categories -- scoring and most times asked, "Are you turning pro?" -- to arrive 
at the Los Angeles Athletic Club nearly 30 minutes after Wooden himself had 
opened the envelope and made the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden did what he could to add some suspense, but it was hardly worth the 
trouble. Everyone in the room, including the three other finalists who attended 
the brief ceremony, knew whose name belonged on the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winner is a gentleman from an area and a school of which I'm somewhat 
familiar," said Wooden, the famed former UCLA coach who starred at Purdue in 
the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 How long Robinson plans to stay in familiar surroundings remains unclear. 
Projected as the No. 1 selection in the June 29 NBA draft, Robinson has until 
the middle of May to declare his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, at least publicly, Robinson remains noncommittal about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a timetable," he said. "Whatever I decide to do, you guys will be 
the first to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said that speculation about his senior season -- will he or won't he? 
-- has gotten to the point "that people don't even ask my name anymore." But 
one thing is for sure: If Robinson does leave early, it won't be under the 
auspices of the new NCAA rule that allows underclassmen to regain their 
eligibility within 30 days of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I say I'm leaving, I'm leaving," he said. "I'm not going to play around." 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source close to the situation, Robinson recently indicated 
that he plans to forgo his final season at Purdue. If true, a consultant for an 
NBA team said, the 6-foot-8 forward would be the likely top choice in the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's playing future might remain a mystery, but his selection as the 
Wooden Award winner was no shocker. His 4,930 balloting points easily 
outdistanced the totals of Duke senior swingman Grant Hill (3,862), Connecticut 
junior forward Donyell Marshall (3,585), California sophomore point guard Jason 
Kidd (3,461) and Louisville junior center Clifford Rozier (1,818). 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last year, when only two of the five finalists attended the ceremony, 
the dais included all but Rozier, who was unable to attend because of academic 
obligations. Also on hand were coaches Gene Keady of Purdue, Mike Krzyzewski of 
Duke, Denny Crum of Louisville, Todd Bozeman of Cal and Jim Calhoun of 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who held Robinson to a season-low 13 points in Duke's NCAA Southeast 
Regional final victory, said he would have voted for the Purdue forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do what he has done is amazing," said Hill, whose team lost to Arkansas in 
Monday night's championship game. "Just his ability to carry his team on his 
shoulders is something else. He did a lot of things, mainly his scoring. He may 
be the best shooter in the country, the way he shoots the ball, right in your 
face, is really amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is certain to be a top-three or top-four NBA selection. The same goes for 
Kidd, who already has announced his decision to forgo his final two seasons at 
Cal. Marshall, as well as Rozier, have yet to decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, Hill, who stayed at Duke all four years, offered advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, I've got mixed feelings," Hill said. "Part of me would say he 
should enjoy his last year. I know I've enjoyed my last year. I know he has a 
good team returning with a chance of going far in the (NCAA) tournament and 
maybe possibly winning it. I would tell him to take advantage of that. You're 
only in college one time and it's the last time before you're in the real 
world. I'd tell him to have fun and really enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, I'd really like him to come out with me. For both of us to 
come into the league at the same time would be something really special, along 
with Jason and hopefully Donyell. All of us (could) come in together and wreak 
havoc out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was wishful thinking, but when Keady accepted the award for 
Robinson, who was en route from the airport, the Purdue coach said: "Hopefully, 
he can come back and get another one of these next year. But we'll have to wait 
to see about that one." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very latest, the wait ends on May 15. The Vote

 From Jeff Rude of the Dallas Morning News: "Masters lore extends to the Crow's 
Nest, the loft above the clubhouse, where amateur contestants can stay.

<P>
 "Tom Watson and Lanny Wadkins stayed there when they were both collegians in 
1970--and it was a memorable experience for Wadkins.

 " 'Tom was screaming in his sleep every night,' " Wadkins said. " 'He had

 Trivia time: What is the highest score recorded on any hole in the Masters 
tournament?

<P>
 Watery grave: The par-five 15th hole was a nightmare for several players in 
Thursday's opening round of the Masters.

 Nolan Henke found the water fronting the hole and got a 10; Payne Stewart had 
a nine and Tom Watson an eight, among other soaring scores. 
</P>

 However, they didn't break the record for futility on No. 15. That still 
belongs to Jumbo Ozaki, who got an 11 during the 1987 Masters.

DUCKS WIN; WILSON EXPANDS VOCABULARY; HOCKEY: COACH CANNOT STOP PATTING HIS 
TEAM ON THE BACK AFTER IT BATTLES BACK TO GAIN A 3-1 VICTORY OVER THE LOWLY 
EDMONTON OILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The coach who banned the E-word slipped up Friday night. He used it himself. 
Repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mighty Duck Coach Ron Wilson might not mind paying the team fines for 
uttering the word expansion -- and they'll be increased because his faux pas 
appeared in print. 
</P>
<P>
 His Ducks reached an expansion milestone Friday by winning for the 32nd time 
this season. Their 3-1 victory over Edmonton in front of 15,701 at Northlands 
Coliseum tied the NHL record for victories by a first-year team. 
</P>
<P>
 Only thing is, Florida beat them to the mark, though the Panthers are stuck on 
32 with three games to go in their Eastern Conference playoff race. That leaves 
the record up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty proud of that. We certainly did not expect it," said Wilson. 
"They've got three tough games left. We're tied now. If they win a couple more 
and we win one, at least we're No. 2 all-time." 
</P>
<P>
 The record was shared by the 1967-68 Kings and Philadelphia Flyers, who were 
among six teams the league added that season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teams that won 31 in '67 played a lot of their games against expansion 
teams. We only won two against expansion teams, so we have 30 wins against 
established teams," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a 2-10 record against expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad we didn't play 60 against expansion teams or our record would 
have been brutal ," Wilson said, breaking into a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were behind, 1-0, after Kelly Buchberger's first-period goal. A team 
that prides itself on being tough was being pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-period hit knocked Terry Yake, the team's leading healthy scorer, out 
of the game in the first period. He suffered a mild concussion and is 
questionable for today's game at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert, who made 38 saves for his 20th victory of the season, was decked 
by Scott Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got chippy because we didn't show up in the first period," Wilson said. 
"They run our goalie, and we're helping their guy up, not Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Stu Grimson got us going in the second period with the hit he put 
on (teammate) Stephan Lebeau. Stephan got up with a bloody lip and Stu went to 
the penalty box." 
</P>
<P>
 It's only partly funny -- a Grimson check in December knocked Anatoli Semenov 
out for two months with a dislocated left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patrik Carnback scored a second-period goal, then he and John Lilley 
assisted on Garry Valk's 18th for a 2-1 lead at 10:08 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton helped the Ducks over the hump at the end when when Oiler Luke 
Richardson received a match penalty with 4:10 left for what was ruled an 
attempt to injure Bobby Dollas, who fell to the ice after taking a stick to the 
jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Sweeney scored on the long power-play at 18:23, and the Ducks were on 
their way to No. 32. Duck Notes

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK; YAKE'S YEAR FALLS APART IN 2ND HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Yake figured he was good for 30 goals this year, easy. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the season's final games tick by, Yake is stuck on 21 goals -- one 
fewer than he scored in 66 games with Hartford last season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has played in all 81 games, but his goal-scoring has taken a nose dive 
during the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake, still the only Mighty Duck with a hat trick this season, scored his 15th 
goal Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has scored six goals in 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's discouraging, if you expect to score 30 goals and are on pace to get 30 
most of the year, to see that you're not going to get it," said Yake, whose 
mood has dipped in recent weeks. "It makes it tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Yake sat out the second and third periods against Edmonton on Friday after 
being shaken up on a hit in the first period and suffering a mild concussion 
that left him questionable for today's game against Vancouver. His shifts are 
running out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets frustrating after a while," he said. "The opportunities per shift are 
still there. It's a matter of not putting them away." 
</P>
<P>
 Yake sat on the bench Friday morning before the Edmonton game talking with 
assistant coach Tim Army, trying to figure a way to get back on track before 
the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 " I think he's a little bit . . . confused . . . as to what his role should 
be," Army said. "What I mean by that is the first job for all our players is to 
play within a defensive system. He's always thinking defense instead of 
offense. I think when you're the third forward, you have to think defense. But 
when you're the lead forechecker or the second forward, you can become more 
assertive." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Yake has been concentrating on not making defensive errors -- and his 
goal-scoring has suffered. His point production hasn't fallen off as 
dramatically. He has 16 assists since the midway mark, putting him ahead of the 
28-assist pace he was on the first half. Defensively he hasn't faltered much, 
and remains a plus-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to win hockey games," Yake said. "If I'm not scoring, I'm 
trying not to be scored against. That creates a vicious cycle. You don't create 
as much, so you don't score as much. That's what's been happening to me lately. 
I've got to rethink my game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I know what I need to do to play well, I can go do the things I need to to 
fix it. I think in certain situations, I get confused. I read a lot into 
things. Lately I think that's what I've been doing."

KWAN GIVEN LESSON IN STYLE AND SUBSTANCE; FIGURE SKATING: TORRANCE 13-YEAR-OLD 
FINISHES SECOND IN PRO-AM TO MORE EXPERIENCED, GRACEFUL KADAVY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youth was served notice Friday night at the Sports Arena. Although Michelle 
Kwan of Torrance was rewarded for the extraordinary things she can do at the 
precocious age of 13, judges in the Hershey's Kisses Pro-Am also sent her a 
message about what she must do in order to continue her journey toward the top 
of the women's figure skating world. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the superior technical merit scores Kwan, of Torrance, earned for her 
four-minute freestyle program, in which she landed six of the seven triple 
jumps she planned, she had to settle for the $30,000 second prize.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more valuable to her in the long run were the lessons she had an 
opportunity to learn in competing against the more mature, more graceful 
professionals, Caryn Kadavy and Rosalynn Sumners. 
</P>
<P>
 Both won over the crowd of 10,737 with their elegant presentations. Kadavy, 
the 1988 Olympian who finished first last year by upsetting Nancy Kerrigan, 
defended her title to win $40,000, and Sumners, the 1984 Olympic silver 
medalist, was third to win $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadavy, who is skating with more confidence than ever, received scores of 5.9 
on a scale of 6.0 for composition and style from seven of nine judges. Sumners' 
style marks included two 5.9s and five 5.8s. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, neither Kadavy, 26, nor Sumners, 29, even in the prime of their 
careers, could jump like Kwan, who made only a few minor errors and earned 5.9s 
from eight judges for technical merit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she was marked down for her artistic deficiencies, which might be 
something that she cannot correct at this stage. There is only so much a 
13-year-old can do to project mature femininity. 
</P>
<P>
 Her coach, Frank Carroll, thought she should have won, pointing out that Kwan 
took more risks than Kadavy, who tried only one triple jump. That was one more 
than Sumners tried.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not unhappy," he said. "Caryn is a beautiful skater, and this makes 
it easier for me to point out things that she does to Michelle and say, 'Have 
you learned from it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kadavy, who was still a novice when she was Kwan's age, predicted great things 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is our future," Kadavy said. "She's very mature for her age, but she 
still has time to mature more. That will come with age." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the same thing can be said for the pro-am concept, which was 
introduced to the sport only last year and is suffering growing pains. Hoping 
to salvage box-office receipts after Kerrigan withdrew, the USFSA did not rush 
to get out the information after Brian Boitano and Scott Hamilton joined her. 
Some fans were visibly disappointed to find out about it when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were more pluses than minuses in this year's event, due not only 
to the quality of the skating but also to the ambience created by the crowds. 
Perhaps it is the influence of an interactive generation, but the spectators 
were not shy about letting the judges know what they thought about the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 They were particularly vocal about Paul Wylie's low technical marks Thursday 
night, even though the judges had little choice but to mark him down after he 
failed to complete a required element. 
</P>
<P>
 His fans could have relaxed, because his presentation scores, including two 
6.0s, ultimately placed him where he should have been, in first place entering 
Friday night's freestyle programs. His style marks in that program earned six 
6.0s as he easily won. 
</P>
<P>
 Reigning national champions faltered in dance, in which Elizabeth Punsalan and 
Jerrod Swallow finished second to Renee Roca and Gorsha Sur. But the pairs 
national champions, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa, rebounded from a 
disappointing technical program to win.

 The Angels were spending most of their time in the clubhouse before the game 
talking about the frigid weather in Milwaukee, putting on long johns, and 
planning on how they would keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson suddenly brought the conversation to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish you guys will quit worrying about the weather," he yelled. "I didn't 
come all the way here to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the weather was not nearly as bad as forecast, with the game-time 
temperature announced at 48 degrees. The Angels, however, swore it dropped 
dramatically by the game's conclusion.

 "They tell you it's psychological," second baseman Harold Reynolds said, "and

PREP TRACK; HURDLER TRIES TWICE AS HARD AT ARCADIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Haslip figured to lead the nation in the 300-meter hurdles this season, 
but it is his early success in the 110 high hurdles that is catching everyone 
off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Running the event for only his second time, the Pasadena Muir High senior 
recorded the nation's leading prep time this season, 13.94 seconds, at the 
Pasadena Games last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still learning how to run the high hurdles," said Haslip, also a star 
football player headed for USC. "But once I really get on, I think I can run in 
the low 13s. I just need to stop knocking the hurdles down. I'll get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip was one of the top returning 300 hurdlers, having won the event in the 
State meet last season. His time of 37.09 was the third-fastest among returnees 
in the nation. With one year of high school competition remaining, he decided 
to give the high hurdles a try, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Arcadia/Foot Locker Invitational today at Arcadia High, Haslip faces 
plenty of competition in each race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arcadia Invitational is one of the most prestigious meets of the year as 
athletes from 15 states are entered. The invitational session begins at 4 p.m. 
with field events, followed at 6:30 by the first running event. "We've been 
doing this meet for 27 years, and I think this field has the potential to be 
our best ever," organizer Doug Speck said.  
</P>
<P>
 Speck said the most anticipated event is the boys' 100 meters, with Pat 
Johnson of Redlands and Bryan Howard of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs heading a 
strong field. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard is the defending State champion in the 100 and the runner-up in the 
200, but he was upset by newcomer Johnson in both races at the Inland Empire 
Championships two weeks ago. Johnson's times of 10.42 in the 100 and 20.70 in 
the 200 lead the nation this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' sprints should also be close, between Long Beach Poly juniors 
Andrea Anderson and Aninah Haddad. ERIC SHEPARD

 The charge came Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores pitched a complete game in the Golden Hawks' 4-1 Empire League victory 
over Los Alamitos at Los Alamitos, enabling El Dorado to take sole possession 
of first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "My confidence was a little shaken up because I wasn't getting my curveball 
over the last few games," Flores said. "That's my go-to pitch, and I was able 
to throw it for strikes today." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior left-hander (3-3) struck out seven and gave up only four hits in 
breaking his personal two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Flores' victory improved El Dorado to 12-4, 4-1 in league play. Los 
Alamitos (10-6, 3-2) is tied for second with Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got great pitching and we played error-free ball," Golden Hawks Coach 
Steve Gullotti said. "Pitching and defense is how we win, and that's what we 
did today." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado scored its first run in the top of the third inning when senior Ryan 
Reyes (two for four, one run batted in) drove in sophomore Mike Castillo (two 
for two, two runs scored, two RBIs) from third base with a double. Castillo 
opened the inning with a walk and advanced to third on two passed balls by 
Griffin junior catcher Mark Ukleja, who gave up four in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukleja, who missed several games because of an injury, appeared to get signals 
crossed often with senior left-hander Miles Campbell (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad because he's a good kid," Los Alamitos Coach John Bryant said. 
"This was definitely one of his tougher games." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado scored two more runs in the fourth on back-to-back RBI doubles by 
Castillo and junior Jim Cox, the Nos. 8 and 9 hitters. The Golden Hawks' final 
run came in the sixth on Castillo's second RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom of our order really picked us up today," Gullotti said. "We didn't 
get a lot from the top, but the bottom gave us a lift." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Campbell kept the Griffins in the game by striking out nine and 
allowing only eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos scored its run in the sixth, when senior Clay Kemp's single drove 
in senior Bill Blackledge, who singled with one out in the inning and stole 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Griffins went quietly in the seventh. Flores retired the side in 
order, striking out two of the three batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, however, was not confidence-shattering for the Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a good club," Bryant said, "and I think we're in a good position for 
the stretch drive." 
</P>
<P>
 In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 11, Loara 1 -- Don Costello had a double, a home run, five RBIs and 
scored twice to lead Esperanza (9-5, 3-2). Scott Hild struck out seven and gave 
up one earned run on four hits in six innings to earn the victory. Loara is 
9-6, 2-3.

GRAND NATIONAL'S START IN DOUBT; HORSE RACING: PRESTIGIOUS ENGLISH STEEPLECHASE 
COULD BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF RAIN OR DISRUPTED BY ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, the Grand National was declared void because of two false starts. 
This time, it could be washed out by rain or disrupted by animal rights 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The prestigious steeplechase was in danger of being postponed today because 
several days' heavy rain has made the Aintree course dangerously soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "A statement will be made (today)," course clerk Charles Barnett said Friday 
night, amid speculation that the race could be called off or postponed until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett spoke as pools of water lay on the course and rain continued to fall. 
The forecast called for more showers overnight, with the possibility of hail 
and sleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the wooden floor of a temporary bar, filled with spectators 
sheltering from the rain, collapsed under their weight. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 If the race is called off because of weather for the first time in its 
155-year history, bookmakers will have to repay some $112.5 million in wagers 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the race was to be canceled, it would be a veritable disaster, not just 
for the firm but the industry as a whole," William Hill spokesman David Hood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the second year running to lose our showpiece race, admittedly this year 
to an act of God, would be an administrative nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Aintree officials also will be on guard in case animal rights activists try to 
disrupt the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of information received, we have been notified that there may be 
plans to stage a demonstration using aircraft, parachutists, hang-gliders, or 
even microlight aircraft," police inspector Ray Simpson said. "We have made 
contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident that our operation will cover most eventualities. However, 
if people are prepared to use such irrational means, there is little we could 
do to stop them."

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; FULLERTON ROLLS PAST LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind the pitching of Matt Wagner, Cal State Fullerton overwhelmed Long Beach 
State, 9-1, in a Big West Conference baseball game Friday night at Long Beach 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner (8-0), who pitched a complete game, struck out nine and gave up only 
three hits.  
</P>
<P>
 The Titan runs came early, with Fullerton scoring six in the first two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Dante Powell, who went three for five with three runs scored and 
three runs batted in, scored the game's first run after leading off the game 
with a walk. He stole second and advanced to third on a groundout before 
scoring on a Long Beach error. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ferguson, who was hit by a pitch in the first inning, later scored on 
Bret Hemphill's RBI groundout to give the Titans a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans increased the lead to 6-0 in the second, with Powell doubling in 
two runs and Ferguson adding an RBI single. Hemphill's sacrifice fly later 
scored Powell to put Fullerton in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner gave up a home run in the bottom of the second, but allowed only two 
hits the rest of the way while retiring 16 of 18 49ers in one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton catcher Adam Millan was four for four with an RBI and two runs 
scored and Ferguson finished three for four with an RBI and two runs scored. 
The first six hitters in the Fullerton order accounted for all 12 Titan hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Rancho Santiago standout Mike Fontana (7-1) took the loss for Long 
Beach, going 4 2/3 innings and allowing eight runs, five earned. 
</P>
<P>

conference. Long Beach dropped to 23-8, 4-3.

NORTHRIDGE'S DEFEAT IS DOUBLY DAMAGING; COLLEGE BASEBALL: SAN DIEGO STATE WINS 
IN NINTH, 9-8, AS MATADOR RIGHT-HANDER NAJAR LEAVES THE GAME WITH ARM INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Little League night Friday at San Diego State and the stands were 
filled with youngsters begging players for baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope the young 'uns weren't paying close attention. Though the game pitted 
teams tied for first place in the Western Athletic Conference West Division, it 
wasn't exactly a how-to clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State's Tony Zaragoza homered to lead off the bottom of the ninth as 
the Aztecs came back to edge Cal State Northridge, 9-8, in the opener of a key 
WAC series at Smith Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game that was as bizarre as it was costly. The Matadors (18-18, 6-4 
in conference play) not only lost the game, they also may have lost 
right-hander John Najar. 
</P>
<P>
 One pitch after Travis Lee singled home two runs to hand the Aztecs an 8-7 
lead in the eighth, Najar injured his elbow while pitching to Doug Webb.  
</P>
<P>
 On the pitch, which went to the backstop, catcher Eric Gillespie retrieved the 
ball and tagged out Jeff DaVanon, who attempted to score from third. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar, meanwhile, was in agony and walked into short right field, cradling his 
forearm in his left hand.  
</P>
<P>
 According to reports from the Northridge dugout, Najar may have fractured a 
bone in his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Jason Vargas (1-4) retired Webb for the third out, but though the 
Matadors pulled even in the top of the ninth, things ended fast in the Aztecs' 
final at-bat when Zaragoza belted Vargas' first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his fourth homer of the year and it marked the second time in as many 
games that Vargas suffered a tough loss in the bottom of the ninth.  
</P>
<P>
 He also was the losing pitcher in Tuesday's 7-6 loss to Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge tied the game in the top of the ninth on a single by Jonathan 
Campbell and a fielding error by left fielder Kurston McMurray. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (22-14, 7-3) was definitely generous. The Aztecs committed six 
errors and the pitching staff hit two batters and unloaded as many wild 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildest inning, perhaps of the season, took place in the Northridge half 
of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors trailed, 3-1, but loaded the bases with one out. Catcher Eric 
Gillespie then sent a grounder to second to start an apparent 4-6-3 double play 
to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Aztec catcher Rob Plarski was called for catcher's interference, 
which allowed Gillespie to automatically reach first and force across a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Joe Duggan wild-pitched home a run with Brian Vasey at the plate to 
tie the game, then walked Vasey to reload the bases . . . or maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 The plate umpire, Andy Lopez, lost track of the count, and Vasey was called 
back from first. He made the most of his new chance, delivering a two-run 
double to the gap in right-center for a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey has nine RBIs in his past six games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors took the lead in the sixth inning, which was almost as bizarre as 
the second.  
</P>
<P>
 Vasey and first baseman Jason Shanahan opened the inning with singles to chase 
Duggan. With one out, reliever John Lynn hit Keyaan Cook and then walked Chad 
Thornhill to force home a run and tie the score, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn was yanked in favor of right-hander Vern Pallett who did exactly what 
Coach Jim Dietz hoped for: He served up an inning-ending double-play ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for San Diego State, Pallett forgot what to do when Nelson 
tapped back to the mound for what should have been a routine 1-2-3 double play. 
</P>
<P>
 He looked toward home, then fired to first to record the putout as Shanahan 
scored from third for a 7-6 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Pallett knew he'd made a big mistake as soon as he released the ball and 
looked heavenward.

TORRID SAUGUS LIGHTS UP CANYON IN 14-5 FOOTHILL LEAGUE RUNAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was cold at Canyon High on Friday but visiting Saugus apparently didn't 
feel a chill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions (11-4-1) were experiencing a warming trend. They scored 14 runs 
on Thursday and they branded the Cowboys for another 14 on 17 hits in a 14-5 
Foothill League victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus' bats struck early. With one out in the top of the first inning, Darren 
Hoevel doubled and Danny Cato hit a fly ball into the bitter breeze that was 
blowing toward left field. It cleared the fence 335 feet away and Saugus was 
off and running, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions led, 6-0, after three innings, then they scored five times in 
the fourth. Cato opened with a single, Brandon Hernandez walked, Nick Lawson 
singled, Steve Rogers singled and, after Colin Butterfield struck out but 
reached safely on a wild pitch with two out, Nate Wright singled and Hoevel 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten batters had come to the plate and Saugus was cooking, 11-0. Scott Willis, 
Canyon's sunburned coach, had also heated up by game's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if it's snowing," he said. "You can't just let anybody walk in 
here and beat the hell out of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon fell to 3-8-1, 1-3 in league play, while Saugus stayed a game behind 
first-place Hart at 3-1. Canyon starter Lucas Solomon (1-2) couldn't get out of 
the first inning. He allowed three runs while retiring only two batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Relievers Ricky Engbrecht (five runs on five hits in 2 1/3 innings) and Pat 
McDermott (three runs, five hits in one inning) weren't any better. Hernandez 
gave Saugus the strong pitching it was looking for, capping a week in which the 
Centurions were 5-0-1 in a five-day span. They opened it with four games in the 
Coachella Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez (2-2) allowed four hits and five unearned runs in six innings and 
joined the offensive spree by going three for four. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Saugus batters drove in runs. Six had two or more hits. Cato was four for 
five, finishing the week with 12 hits and three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that offense kind of helps," Hernandez said. "All I had to worry about 
was throwing strikes."

NO FOOL ON THE HILLTOP; HILL BELIEVES HE CAN MAKE USF A BASEBALL POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rich Hill has begun life on the Hilltop climbing out of a hole, scratching and 
clawing as the new coach of a long beleaguered baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Battle, battle, battle, that's us," he says, although the rallying cry took 
on unintended meaning Friday in a game that characterized Hill's first season 
coaching the University of San Francisco, where the team's unofficial nickname 
-- Hilltoppers -- refers to the campus being situated atop one of the city's 
many hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was ejected in the eighth inning for arguing a call that left Pepperdine 
with the bases loaded. For Hill, who left Cal Lutheran last year after a 
successful six-year tenure, it marked his first ejection in an NCAA Division I 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the next pitch, USF players and assistant coaches got into a heated 
shouting match with Pepperdine third base coach Steve Kling. 
</P>
<P>
 USF escaped the jam and rallied in the ninth before Pepperdine turned a 6-4-3 
double play with the bases loaded to preserve a 3-2 West Coast Conference 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no handshakes afterward and Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez -- who 
spent 15 minutes beforehand chatting cordially with Hill -- directed a few 
choice words at the rookie coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding themselves one swing away from victory despite being outhit, 12-1, by 
the 1992 national champion Waves illustrates the Dons' scrappy nature under 
Hill, 31, whose nickname around the Hilltop is Hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 The season has been like taking a drive through San Francisco. Up and down, up 
and down, up and down. With no place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 USF (16-18, 4-9 in WCC play) won its first four games, then lost four of five. 
Three victories followed, then eight losses. Hill could charge admission for 
this ride. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been exhilarating moments for a team that was an 8-44 laughingstock 
last season: USF beat Stanford, 18-5, last week, swept a doubleheader from 
Loyola Marymount in March and beat San Jose State three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there have been days like Friday, the team's seventh one-run loss. "We 
don't accept losing," Hill said. "I can understand how it happens, but these 
players are ticked off we aren't doing better. That's how I know this program 
is turning around." 
</P>
<P>
 With his skill as a recruiter, Hill plans to do just that. In compiling a 
194-76 record at Cal Lutheran, Hill sold players on the tiny Thousand Oaks 
campus by describing it as a bucolic setting where horses galloped beyond the 
outfield fence. 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 "(San Francisco) has so much to offer, it is so vibrant," he said. "Golden 
Gate Park, the beach, it's such a great experience to go to college in an urban 
setting, an experience everyone should have. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our guys hear a siren, they get pumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill gleefully compares cramped Benedetti Diamond to Fenway Park and Wrigley 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartments run along the third base line and dormitories along first. Traffic 
along busy Masonic Avenue is pelted by foul balls. Bells clang from a nearby 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 The fog rolls in about 3:30 p.m. and lingers for a couple of hours. Strong 
winds are not uncommon. Fenway? Weather-wise, think Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, a similarity to Cal Lutheran: The dugouts are a bunt away 
from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all the same between the lines," said Daryl Hernandez, a USF outfielder 
from Moorpark College and Simi Valley High. "This is an up-and-coming program 
and a great place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the recurring sentiment among players. Hill will make the Dons top 
dogs. And he is doing it with an infusion of talent from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's top pitchers are Jason Mitchell of Canoga Park and Jason Chandler 
of Granada Hills. Chandler (5-4) pitched a complete game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Ricardo Banuelos is from Canoga Park, second baseman Roberto Garcia 
is from Sylmar and relief pitcher Keith Halcovich is from Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 More from the area are on the way. The College World Series is on the horizon, 
to hear the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be going to Omaha by my junior year," said Rich Igou, a 
left-handed pitcher at Notre Dame High who committed to USF during the early 
signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill emerged from the clubhouse after the game sporting his trademark grin. He 
gabbed with recruits, the parents of players, friends from Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Hill had a quiet moment. He rubbed his eyes. "It's the start of 
things," he said. "The snowball is gaining momentum, gaining size. Right now we 
have to do it on sheer desire. That's what we're all about."

FISCHER TAKES ON A NEMESIS; TRACK AND FIELD: TO WIN THE HIGH JUMP, CAMARILLO 
SENIOR MUST IMPROVE ON HIS PREVIOUS SHOWINGS AT ARCADIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No incantations are expected, but Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High will 
attempt to exorcise some ghosts tonight at the Arcadia Invitational track and 
field meet at Arcadia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, bound for Wisconsin, cleared a region record of 7 feet 4 inches in 
the high jump in the Santa Barbara Easter Relays two weeks ago, but has not 
performed well at Arcadia. He cleared 6-8 in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's performance was particularly frustrating because Fischer had 
cleared a then-personal best 7-1 to open the outdoor season and improved to 7-2 
a week after Arcadia in the Mt. San Antonio College Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just doesn't like jumping at Arcadia," Camarillo Coach Dennis Riedmiller 
had said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer is not enamored of Arcadia's facility. Jumpers must begin their 
approaches on a relatively slow and sometimes-moist grass surface before making 
the transition to a tartan apron on their last two or three steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Fischer is determined to jump well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should be able to clear 7-2 consistently in the big meets this season," he 
said at Santa Barbara. "Arcadia is definitely a meet I want to jump high at." 
</P>
<P>
 A 7-2 clearance might be required to win. Arthur Lloyd of Rialto Eisenhower 
jumped 7-2 in a dual meet last month and Rodney White of Indianapolis Pike has 
a personal best of 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the area's top performers, including Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill, 
Jason Medearis and Brett Strahan of Hart, Andre DeSaussure of Taft, Delores 
Tuimoloau of Channel Islands, Cathy Prater of Agoura and Kim Mortensen of 
Thousand Oaks, are expected to take part in the meet, which is regarded as the 
nation's top regular-season competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, who has bests of 23-11 in the long jump and 49-3 in the triple jump, is 
undefeated this season. A 25-7 foul leap in a meet Thursday against Ridgecrest 
Burroughs could indicate he's ready to smash his long jump best. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis has personal bests of 14.30 seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles and 
38.02 in the 300 intermediates, but he will be a decided underdog to Muir's 
Kenny Haslip, who has timed 13.94 in the former and 37.09 in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 A bronchial infection plagued Strahan at the end of the fall cross-country 
season, but he appears capable of improving his personal best of 4:13.90 in the 
1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, runner-up in the 400 in last year's state championships, has come 
back slowly from a hamstring injury suffered in February, but says he's ready 
to roll in both the 200 and 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau holds the region record in the girls' shotput at 46-11 1/2 and has 
also thrown the discus 145-0, a Ventura County record. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater, third in the 300 low hurdles in last year's state championships, is 
looking to crack the 44-second barrier for the first time, and sophomore 
Mortensen will attempt to become the third runner from Thousand Oaks to dip 
under 11 minutes in the 3,200.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; WINDMILLER'S 2-HITTER GETS NORTHRIDGE SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Windmiller pitched a two-hitter, striking out seven as Cal State 
Northridge softball team defeated New Mexico, 10-0, to salvage a split in a 
Western Athletic Conference doubleheader against New Mexico on Friday at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was called after five innings because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller (16-1) allowed only one runner to reach second base. Tamara Ivie 
went three for three with three runs, three runs batted in and belted her 
fourth home run. Vicky Rios and Shelby Wilcox each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (28-6, 5-2 in conference play) lost the first game, 2-1, when two 
errors in the third inning led to two unearned runs against junior right-hander 
Kathy Blake (9-5), who has lost four of her last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Calcante's third home run in the sixth accounted for the Matador run. 
</P>
<P>
 In another softball game: 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 1, Pierce 0 -- Blanca Lozano pitched her first no-hitter of the season 
and Javonda Thompson hit her second home run for the Pirates (14-14, 4-2) in 
the Western State Conference game at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano, who struck out two batters, had a perfect game through three innings, 
but issued her only walk of the game to start the fourth. MEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA d. CS Northridge, 15-10, 15-3, 15-4 -- Four starters had double figures 
in kills to lead the top-ranked Bruins in the first round of the UCLA 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann had a game-high 17 kills to lead the Matadors (14-9) but 
Northridge committed 26 errors in the match, compared with 11 for UCLA (21-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hughes had 10 kills and Peter Piexoto had nine for the Matadors. 
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark 2, Oxnard 1 -- Jason Young singled home Jim Seguine from second base 
with two out in the 12th inning, lifting Oxnard (12-14, 6-6) to a WSC victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore right-hander Joey Vargas (3-4) went the distance, scattering five 
hits, striking out four and walking one. Moorpark starter Jeff Naster got no 
decision despite pitching 11 innings, striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
 Seguine was two for two. Kevin Nykoluk went three for five for Moorpark (6-5 
in league). 
</P>
<P>
 Desert 15, Antelope Valley 10 -- The Marauders, who often score in double 
digits, committed six errors that led to eight unearned runs in a Foothill

OHIO STATE, FRESNO STATE TO PLAY IN PIGSKIN CLASSIC; FOOTBALL: BIG TEN 
CO-CHAMPIONS ACCEPT BERTH FOR AUG. 29 GAME IN ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ohio State agreed Friday to play in the Disneyland Pigskin Classic, ending a 
lengthy search for an opponent to play Fresno State in the Aug. 29 game at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Turned down by Nebraska in early March, Don Andersen, executive director of 
the Orange County Sports Assn., said he was happy to have Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a nice catch," Andersen said. "It makes it doubly pleasing to 
have a Big Ten team. I don't think we've had it any better than Ohio State as 
far as tradition and winning goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Ohio State brings to the party is national recognition. Fresno brings a 
lot of people. The Red Wave coming down the freeway is going to be pretty good 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State (10-1-1) tied Wisconsin for the Big Ten championship, but the 
Badgers won the conference tiebreaker and played in the Rose Bowl. The Buckeyes 
defeated Brigham Young, 28-21, in the Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a team meeting, and the players voted unanimously to accept the 
invitation," Ohio State Coach John Cooper told reporters in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (8-4) shared the Western Athletic Conference title for the second 
consecutive season. The Bulldogs lost to Colorado, 41-30, in the Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 Freedom Bowl, the Bulldogs upset USC, 24-7, and attracted 50,745, 
the second-largest crowd in the game's history.

 Taking advantage of a depleted Highland squad that was playing without eight 
starters who had been suspended earlier in the day, Antelope Valley ripped the 
Bulldogs, 18-4, in a Golden League game Friday at Highland.

tied the score and Desi Sandlin drove in the go-ahead runs with a single. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaup, a sophomore infielder, made his third pitching appearance of the season,

OPENING NIGHT AT VENTURA LOOKS MORE LIKE ENDURO

<P>
 Ventura Raceway's stock car season opened with a bang Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 The bang of blown engines and blown tires. 
</P>
<P>
 IMCA sprint cars were supposed to be the feature event, but only three 
entrants showed up, and two of them blew their engines before the start of the 
seven-lap heat race, turning it into an exhibition run for Ventura's Randy 
Moody. 
</P>
<P>
 When the main event rolled around, Paul Hewlett didn't start, and Tracy Van 
Blargen of Camarillo had his car stall in a puff of white smoke in the first 
turn, so Moody headed back to the pits and called it a night. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Blargen restarted, and insisted that he wanted to race despite the obvious 
oil leak, and ended up running four laps under full power, trailing a cloud of 
white smoke all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Paul Moore of Oak View won the 20-lap Street Stock main 
event after a solid second place finish in his heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore ran the first half of the main bumper-to-bumper behind James Weston of 
Santa Barbara, until Weston's tire shredded midway through the race to force a 
yellow caution flag. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time racing resumed, Weston had replaced the tire and rejoined the 
field at the rear of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston moved from 12th to fifth by the last lap, only to hit a pothole that 
popped another tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lauer of Santa Maria ran away with the 12-lap IMCA Modified main, nearly 
a quarter of a lap ahead of Ventura's Doug Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Scott Boucher of Oak View won the 15-lap Pony Stock main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NASCAR Southwest Tour makes its first of two seasonal visits to Saugus 
Speedway tonight with a 100-lap main event. Racing begins at 7.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MODEST RALLY ENDS AS STOCKS FOLLOW BOND PRICES DOWN; 
MARKETS: INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE DROPS 19 AS INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER. DOW STILL 
ENDS WEEK WITH GAIN OF 38.30 POINTS.

<P>
 Wall Street broke a three-day winning streak Friday, resuming its decline as 
bond yields moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks lost more ground than blue-chip issues, with the Nasdaq 
composite index shaken by declines in some technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials were off more than 30 points at midday, but closed 
with a loss of 19.00 points at 3,674.26. For the week, the index gained 38.30 
points, helped by Tuesday's big rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 The broader market also was weak Friday, with declining issues outnumbering 
advances by about 7 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume slowed 
to 264 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stocks fell with bonds. It's as simple as that," said David Shulman, chief 
market strategist at Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days guiding the stock market higher, the bond market was hit by 
renewed selling Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a guide to long-term interest rates in 
general, rose to 7.26% from Thursday's 7.20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said some investors were spooked by comments from Federal Reserve Gov. 
Lawrence Lindsey, who suggested that the U.S. job market is tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Chicago Fed president Silas Keehn said some areas of the manufacturing 
sector are approaching capacity limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors view any comments from the Fed regarding the economy's growth 
as potential warning signs of further interest rate hikes. The Fed twice raised 
short-term rates in the first quarter, and the result was a surge in bond 
yields and a plunge in stock prices, much of which occurred in the last two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market also was jittery Friday ahead of next week's batch of economic 
reports. The government will report on March producer inflation on Tuesday, and 
March consumer inflation on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Any new signs of inflation could force the Fed to again raise short-term 
interest rates sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most of the selling in stocks was later in the session as investors 
worried about holding on to shares over the weekend amid so much uncertainty 
about the direction of rates, said James Melcher, founder and president of 
Balestra Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks tumbled on a combination of profit taking and concern about 
shipment delays stemming from the ongoing strike by truckers represented by the 
Teamsters' union. A stronger dollar also hurt, because it may result in lower 
prices on Japanese cars here. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors dove 2 3/8 to 57 3/4, Chrysler plunged 3 to 50 7/8 and Ford 
ended off 2 1/4 at 58 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit-taking also hit some other industrial shares. Deere fell 2 7/8 to 85 
1/2, Georgia Pacific lost 1 1/4 to 62 3/4 and Bethlehem Steel sank 7/8 to 20 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks also gave back some of their recent gains. Microsoft 
tumbled 2 3/4 to 87, Texas Instruments slid 3 1/8 to 79 3/8 and Intel lost 1 
1/4 to 69 3/8. Also, Western Digital slumped 2 to 17 1/2 despite Thursday's 
strong quarterly profit report. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, some banking issues were strong. NationsBank leaped 1 5/8 
to 49 3/8, First Chicago surged 7/8 to 50 5/8 and Wells Fargo added 1 1/2 to 
148. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the media sector, Western Publishing fell 2 3/4 to 11 1/2. Arbitragers 
said investors were disappointed that the company's puzzles and game unit was 
sold and not the entire company. Also, comic book giant Marvel Entertainment 
Group plummeted 2 to 19 after it told analysts it expects lower second-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad with London's Financial Times 100-share average 
losing 8.2 points to finish at 3,120.8. Shares finished higher on the German 
bourse with the 30-share DAX index adding 1.93 points to 2,203.34. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei average rose 44.01 points to 19,934.99 despite news of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa slid 44.08 points to 2,229.25. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen as foreign exchange 
markets digested the resignation of Hosokawa. In New York, the dollar closed at 
105.15 yen versus 104.85 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold and silver prices also finished higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, lumber futures plunged to their lowest level in more than five 
months on the Chicago Merc on signs that rising mortgage rates have choked off 
demand for building materials.

EARTHQUAKE PROVIDES AN UNWELCOME REMINDER; FILLMORE: LOUD 3.6-MAGNITUDE TEMBLOR 
RATTLES THE NERVES OF RESIDENTS. EPICENTER IS SITUATED FIVE MILES NORTHWEST OF 
CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Mental health counselor Robert Ortiz had just finished persuading a Fillmore 
man to talk about his fear of earthquakes when the jolt came: a magnitude-3.6 
quake that shook Fillmore Friday morning and rattled the nerves of a city still 
recovering from the Jan. 17 disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's quake, with its epicenter five miles northwest of Fillmore, did 
little damage to the city, which had already sustained $250 million in losses 
from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the big one we had shook down everything we had to shake down," 
Fire Chief Pat Askren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Askren said a cursory check of public buildings, bridges and roadways Friday 
revealed no signs of injuries or substantial damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's quake, which seismologists said was centered too far from Northridge 
to be considered an aftershock, hit at 10:53 a.m. with a rumble or cracking 
noise, described by some residents as a sonic boom. Then came a jolt upward, 
strong enough to snap an awning back and forth on Central Avenue and lift one 
teacher from her chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mori, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, said the 
sound can occur when the ground begins to shake at the same frequency as sound 
waves, or when buildings begin to rumble. Scientists have not yet determined 
which fault was connected to Friday's earthquake, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second, smaller quake, unrelated to the one in Fillmore, also struck 
Southern California Friday in San Bernardino County, authorities said. That 
jolt, measuring 2.9 on the Richter scale, was an aftershock to Wednesday's 
powerful 4.8-magnitude quake at Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore quake lasted about 10 seconds, but residents remained shaken 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the whole city is jittery," said Fillmore City Councilman Scott 
Lee. "People who have been in a major earthquake, we feel like we're in an 
earthquake all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's wife, Jan, was in her San Cayetano Elementary School classroom when the 
shaking began. "I have quite a few students who have homes that came down in 
the big earthquake, so any time the ground moves they get real nervous," said 
Lee, who teaches first and second grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had several children in tears, others had stomachaches, headaches. I had a 
couple of kids clinging to my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 It was especially hard, she said, since she had her own lingering anxieties 
about the January quake. "Our nerves are as jumpy as the students'," she said. 
"I was glad to come home this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Crisis counselors Ortiz and Norm Levine had the same reaction as they stood 
outside a Fillmore home, trying to talk to a man about the phantom earthquake 
he keeps sensing. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you give this guy reassurance when, bang , here comes another one?" 
said Ortiz, part of an outreach team from Ventura County Mental Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't want to cower down in a fetal position," Levine added: "though I 
thought about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The random nature of earthquakes only makes anxiety worse, said Beatriz 
Anderman, a counselor working with Catholic Charities at St. Francis of Assisi 
Church in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every earthquake that we have is only a reinforcement of the behavior we had 
before," she said. "You never know when it's coming. So you keep waiting and 
waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge disaster, which hit Fillmore harder than any other 
Ventura County community, the Catholic Charities counselors saw 800 people for 
psychological problems. That quake was particularly hard for children because 
it struck before dawn, leaving them in the dark and unprepared, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The January quake left a wake of devastation in Fillmore, destroying homes and 
businesses. Some stores still operate out of tents and the city reservoir may 
have to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineer Bert Rapp was busy inspecting a condemned car dealership when 
Friday's quake struck. "It sounded like a truck ran into the building," he 
said. "We all looked at each other and said, 'What was that?' But there was no 
place to go."

FRIENDS, FAMILY MOURN DEATH OF HONORS STUDENT; CRIME: MINA CASTANEDA IGNORED 
PLEAS TO LEAVE HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND, WHO IS CHARGED IN THE KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every time Mina Castaneda vowed to leave her abusive husband, something -- his 
brooding charm, her desire to help him, her fear of what he would do if she 
walked -- always brought her back home. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday, Castaneda's best friend, Connie Carrillo, sat in a 
mustard-yellow auditorium and mourned her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the hospital before I got out of my marriage," Carrillo remembered 
telling her 25-year-old friend. "Don't you wait as long as I did." 
</P>
<P>
 But Castaneda waited even longer. On April 2, the Oxnard resident died of a 
bullet wound to the head -- the work, prosecutors say, of her husband, Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, about 100 of Castaneda's acquaintances and loved ones 
squeezed into the small auditorium at Oxnard College. They remembered the 
community college student whose dreams of being a teacher came to an abrupt end 
last weekend, and they began planning a scholarship fund for the 3-year-old 
daughter she left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled into the (college) parking lot on Monday and that's when I 
realized," said Louise Vincent, a friend who worked with Castaneda at the 
on-campus children's center. "Those of you who remember Mina remember her big, 
white Cadillac." 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter erupted from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called it the Queen Mary. Everything she needed was in the trunk of the 
Queen Mary," Vincent said. "I realized I would never see the Queen Mary in the 
parking lot again." 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda enrolled at Oxnard College three years ago, about the same time that 
her new husband went behind bars for an armed robbery conviction. Living with 
her parents while caring for then-newborn Josalynn, Castaneda enrolled her 
daughter at the on-campus children's center and soon found work there herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very bubbly, friendly, always laughing," said Jill Olsen, who worked 
with Castaneda in past semesters. "She always looked on the bright side of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Immensely popular with co-workers, Castaneda received consistent promotions, 
climaxing this school year when the center's director awarded her her own 
afternoon class to supervise. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda's days revolved around the preschool. Even in the mornings, when she 
had classes to attend, she would drop by the center to help with the children's 
snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 An honors student with a string of scholarships to her name, Castaneda was to 
graduate in May with a dual degree in liberal arts and child development. 
Friends said she planned to enroll at Cal State Northridge in the fall and work 
toward obtaining teaching credentials.  
</P>
<P>
 But last May, Jose Castaneda got out of prison, and Mina Castaneda's life 
underwent a radical change. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Carrillo remembered, Jose acted like the picture of the perfect 
husband -- doting, caring, gentle. But at times, especially as the months wore 
on, he was abusive, hateful and unconcerned with the events in his wife's life, 
Carrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time he drank, he would beat her," she said. "He didn't really care 
about her life, and she was depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The two had met about seven years ago, while they were both employed at a 
local pizza restaurant. They married at the courthouse in 1990 on the day of 
his conviction for armed robbery, said Jim (Jimbo) Heiney, a close friend of 
Mina Castaneda since high school. Josalynn was born while her father was in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends at Oxnard College said Mina Castaneda largely kept her troubles to 
herself, presenting only the sunniest of exteriors to the world around her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had so many hopes and prayers that he would come out and they would have 
a 'Brady Bunch' lifestyle," Heiney said. "But he got out, and that's when all 
hell broke loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, she showed up on Heiney's doorstep, vowing that this week, 
this month, she was really going to pack her bags and leave Jose. But each 
time, she ended up returning home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never wanted to give up on anything," Heiney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, Mina Castaneda decided to get a divorce, Carrillo said. 
She even filled out the necessary legal papers and dated them April 1, planning 
to file them on April Fool's Day, Carrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on March 31, Mina and Jose Castaneda reconciled. And on Saturday, at a 
friend's house in Santa Paula, Jose shot and killed Mina Castaneda during an 
argument, according to police investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office on Friday charged Jose Castaneda with murder 
and unlawful possession of a firearm. He will be arraigned Monday in Ventura 
County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Josalynn has been placed in foster care, but Mina Castaneda's brother, Mike 
Brenner, 27, said he has vowed to his dead sister that he will fight to adopt 
the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Oxnard College, students struggle to grasp with the implications 
Mina Castaneda's death may have on their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach a single-parenting class, and it really shook my students up," Oxnard 
College counselor Betty Sahota said. "Some said, 'You know, one day, that may 
be me.' "

 A new system designed to make the county courts more efficient by allowing 
municipal judges to try Superior Court cases will be challenged next week in 
the state appeals court, Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the consolidation plan that began Monday, Municipal Judges Herbert 
Curtis III and Bruce A. Clark have been reassigned to Superior Court, where 
they now preside over major criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the county's 27 judges approved the plan, but Clayman said they 
had no authority to put it into effect because state law allows only voters to 
choose Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our belief is that the law does not permit Municipal Court judges to hear 
felony cases on a regular basis," Clayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Christina A. Briles, who is preparing an appeal called 
a writ, said the consolidation not only violates voter rights, but also ignores 
jurisdictional limits and separation of Municipal and Superior courts. 
Municipal judges typically hear only misdemeanors and civil suits involving 
less than $25,000, while Superior Court judges hear felony cases and major 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are not given the relief we want in the state court, we may seek relief 
on the federal level," Briles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson, who helped design and 
implement the consolidation, said Friday that she expected the legal challenge 
and welcomes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "All along I've assumed that they would make some type of writ," Johnson said. 
"It's the proper way to challenge it. I don't mind it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson insisted that the assignment of Curtis and Clark to felony cases is 
not permanent and therefore not a violation of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are rotating assignments," she said, adding that even though she is a 
Superior Court judge she has been accepting assignments to the Municipal Court 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said his office supports the consolidation 
because it provides the courts flexibility to place judges in assignments where 
they are most useful. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said cross-assignments "are badly needed, essential to our system of 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 He also called the objections to the consolidation "petty and territorial" and 
said municipal judges are as capable of hearing felony cases as their Superior 
Court counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relatively speaking, we have a good bench here," Bradbury said. "There are a 
couple flaky people on it, but by and large we have a good bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the public defender's office stressed that they have no personal 
objections to Curtis and Clark. They just believe the courts are circumventing 
state law with the consolidation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases this week, the public defender's office has filed affidavits 
to disqualify Curtis and Clark from hearing felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys can file only one such affidavit per case under state law. So when 
Curtis has been disqualified, the case has usually been sent to Clark, and vice 
versa. Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell, felony division chief, made 
the reassignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We file that disqualification, and what we are looking for is a duly 
appointed Superior Court judge," explained Briles of the public defender's 
office. "But rather than give us what we want, Judge Campbell is giving us the 
other Municipal Court judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Judge Johnson said such cases have gone from one municipal judge to 
the other "because, frankly, they are the least busy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell said his goal was to make sure the new plan was not thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motive is not to allow the affidavit to break the consolidation plan," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one felony drunk-driving case, the public defender's office disqualified 
Clark only to see the case passed off to Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all procedural gamesmanship," complained Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles 
R. Roberts Sr., who bounced from one courtroom to another as cases were 
reassigned.

SIMI PRIEST WON'T BE RETRIED ON THEFT CHARGES; COURTS: PROSECUTORS CITE 
STATEMENTS BY JURORS WHO DEADLOCKED THAT THE EVIDENCE FAILED TO PROVE THAT THE 
MONEY WAS STOLEN FROM HIS PARISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saying problems with their case are too severe to overcome, Ventura County 
prosecutors announced Friday that they will not seek to retry a Simi Valley 
priest accused of stealing in excess of $50,000 from his former parish. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli smiled broadly after the announcement, which appears 
to mark the end of a two-year criminal prosecution against him. His attorney 
rejoiced in the decision too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to Disneyland," defense lawyer Richard J. Beada quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 During his six-week trial in Ventura County Superior Court, Piroli maintained 
that a senior pastor framed him by planting much of the money found in Piroli's 
rooms at St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley and in his church-owned car. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal on a charge of grand theft in 
connection with more than $50,000 that prosecutors accused Piroli of stealing 
from the Simi Valley church. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also acquitted him of embezzlement related to a small amount of money 
he was accused of taking from Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, where he 
previously served as assistant pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli was arrested May 29, 1992, when Los Angeles police found him and a 
Mexican national sitting in a church-owned car in Hollywood. In the car, police 
found $10,000 in small bills, trace amounts of cocaine and church collection 
envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later parishioners said they found more money stashed in Piroli's 
Simi Valley bedroom and office. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday's announcement by prosecutors, Piroli would not immediately say 
whether he plans to seek reinstatement as a priest in the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Also undetermined is who will get the money found in Piroli's room, car and 
bank accounts -- which totals about $75,000. Superior Court Judge Allan Steele 
will rule on that at a hearing May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In their motion to dismiss the grand theft charge against Piroli, prosecutors 
cited concerns of the jurors who deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with jurors after Piroli's trial, prosecutors were told that the 
evidence failed to prove that the money in the priest's possession was stolen 
from St. Peter Claver Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also questioned the church's accounting procedures, according to the 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Friday's announcement by prosecutors, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary C. Peace 
suggested that the archdiocese should bar Piroli from ever again holding a 
position of trust in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ability to continue functioning as a priest is subject to question," 
Peace's motion said. "The Catholic Church has the ability, apart from criminal 
prosecution, to deal with his future in the priesthood and to ensure that he is 
not again placed in a situation where this conduct can be repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 If Piroli wants to remain a priest, archdiocese spokesman Father Gregory Coiro 
said, "I expect he will have to have a very painful and personal discussion 
with Cardinal (Roger) Mahoney." 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by about a dozen supporters outside the courtroom Friday, Piroli 
appeared upbeat and laughed with attorney Beada. He let Beada do most of the 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada asked Judge Steele on Friday to allow Piroli to have access to $30,000 
he has in nine frozen bank accounts. The judge allowed Piroli access to 
$10,000, but maintained control over the rest of the money so the banks could 
be repaid for records they copied for his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace requested that the $43,419 found in Piroli's room and office at St. 
Peter Claver be returned to the church. Beada, however, argued that included in 
that money is $8,000 to $10,000 worth of coins belonging to Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada also said $960 of the $10,000 found in the church car in Hollywood 
belonged to Piroli. The defense claimed that Piroli's supervisor, Father James 
McKeon, planted the rest of the cash in the car -- an allegation McKeon denied 
under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 After ruling at the May 6 hearing how to divide up the money, Steele is 
expected to formally dismiss the grand theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Reveling in the aftermath of the district attorney's announcement, Piroli said 
he would wait until after the May 6 hearing to give interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney said he expects Piroli to have a difficult time being accepted 
back into the church if he decides to seek reinstatement as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church appears to have taken sides," Beada said. "If the church wants to 
take David back, that will play a part." 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said he was relieved to know he won't face another trial and is 
grateful for a handful of loyal supporters who accompanied him to court 
throughout his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very thankful for those who have been here and been supportive," he said. 
"I'm even thankful for the press, some days." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Dennis Mongrain, the new pastor at St. Peter Claver, said, "If the D.A. 
wants to drop the case, the church will stand by the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really just want to move forward," he said. "Ever since Piroli left, the 
chemistry here has really changed. There's been a resurrection. People are 
working together now. We have renewed spirit here -- a spirit of community, of 
warmth and friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said: "I stick by the church's earlier statement. It's out of our 
hands. If they decided not to pursue the case, then we'll go along with that, 
and move on about our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Archdiocese spokesman Coiro said Friday's decision unfairly let the 
accusations against McKeon stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak for Father McKeon, but if it were me I would feel humiliated," 
Coiro said. "He doesn't have the ability to answer those unfair accusations. A 
conviction would have been nice. It would have brought a kind of closure."

RED PEPPER SPRAY A HOT ITEM MIRED IN RED TAPE; SAFETY: DEMAND FOR NEWLY LEGAL 
SELF-DEFENSE TOOL IS SO STRONG THAT MANY SHOPS ARE RUSHING TO BE LICENSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Janet Crandall wasn't sure if red pepper spray was the firearms alternative 
she really wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Friday, the Ventura woman watched a 10-minute video that explained how a 
short burst of the spray, derived from fiery cayenne pepper, can leave an 
attacker stunned or in great pain, usually allowing the intended victim time to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation convinced her. Crandall plunked down $19.95 for a canister 
plus $12 for state-mandated instruction. Although Friday was a slow day, a 
salesman at Uniforms Etc. said the Ventura outlet has been selling about 10 
canisters of pepper spray each day since April 1, when it was licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 While Uniforms Etc. is one of two retail stores in west Ventura County 
licensed to sell the non-lethal spray since it became legal for civilian use on 
March 1, east county residents have been forced to drive elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a large Simi Valley gun shop wants to sell pepper spray, but his 
application to the state has gotten bogged down in paperwork, he said. And 
several gun shop owners in west county cities say they, too, are waiting for 
their paperwork and inspections to be completed so they can begin selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how bureaucracy works," said Roy Craik, owner of C Crest Arms gun shop 
in Simi Valley. "We'll just wait, and when it happens, it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 For those that have it, however, pepper spray is a hot item. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms Etc. has already sold about 80 canisters of the stuff, while 
Shooter's Paradise in Oxnard is holding twice-weekly instruction sessions in an 
attempt to keep up with demand for the spray. The store has sold about 60 
canisters a week, a salesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many customers are women or people who have had violent confrontations in the 
past and want to protect themselves, said Ray Spinelli, a salesman at Uniforms 
Etc., which sells police uniforms as well as various types of tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't carry a gun with you and this is cheaper," Spinelli said. "You may 
not necessarily want to kill someone, but you can deter them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray, whose scientific name is Oleoresin capsicum , is a pepper 
extract in an oil base that sticks to the eyes, nose and mouth. It has a 
blinding and choking effect and overpowers most people with a burning sensation 
that makes breathing difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall, 42, decided to try pepper spray. She is already certified to carry 
Mace, another type of tear gas, but she heard that Mace is not always effective 
on drug-crazed assailants. Pepper spray, she was assured, will deter such 
attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said she would not hesitate to use the four-inch canister, which can 
be clipped to a belt or tucked inside a purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have no second thought about pushing that sprayer," said Crandall, a 
claims adjuster for the state worker's compensation system. She is more 
concerned about possible effects on animals, she said. If desperate, she might 
use the spray to defend her pet Labrador retriever from attacks by aggressive 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said she had a hard time finding a place to buy pepper spray, 
although she had recently read about its new legal status. A Ventura gun shop 
employee directed her to Uniforms Etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Montemorra, who owns a large Oxnard gun store, said he is losing money on 
potential pepper spray sales because the state has been dragging its feet in 
licensing his shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call every day to ask when we will have it in stock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montemorra contends that he has followed all state guidelines for licensing to 
sell the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for the state Department of Justice said dealers who are not 
yet licensed probably did not begin the application process until just before 
legal sales began March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like people who wait until this week to do their taxes," said Michael 
Van Winkle, public information officer at the Department of Justice's division 
of tear gas. "They didn't get the stuff in on time for us to get the 
applications turned around that quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Winkle said the state has a backlog of about 20 applications and that most 
are completed within 10 days. He said many dealers did not realize that 
customers would begin asking for pepper spray the first day it become legal in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 As March 1 approached, there was a period of frenzy and confusion among 
prospective retailers throughout the state, officials said. Many stores waited 
days for their shipments from the distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Others waited for state workers to inspect their businesses and authorize them 
to sell the product. Now, about 200 sporting goods stores and gun shops are 
selling the spray, including the handful in Ventura County. About 30,000 
canisters have been sold statewide in the first month, according to estimates 
by distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to obtain pepper spray must watch a 30-minute training video or 
take a 30-question test, then demonstrate their ability to use the canisters. 
People who have taken a Mace class must only view a 10-minute video and pay a 
$12 state certification fee to carry the spray. All others must pay $17. 
</P>
<P>
 The spray costs $15 to $20.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; LANDOWNERS AGAIN OFFER CITY PARCELS

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in four months, a group of Simi Valley landowners with 
property zoned for a regional mall are offering to sell two neighboring parcels 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Lagomarsino, Robert Eadington and Bub and Kathleen Orton are scheduled to 
meet in closed session with the City Council on Monday to discuss the price of 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Gary Seaton of Mitchell Realtors, representing the landowners, 
offered to sell the city the 80 acres of undeveloped land for about $8.8 
million -- about the same per-square-foot price the city paid a month earlier 
for 32 acres nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Lin Koester rejected the offer, saying the city had achieved 
its goal of owning a key piece of mall land with the 32-acre purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount being requested by the landowners this time is being kept 
confidential until negotiations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December the city agreed to pay $3.5 million for the 32-acre parcel, 
hoping they could use it to lure a mall developer to the city. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 2 RESCUE MOTORIST FROM BURNING CAR 
</P>

<P>
 Two Simi Valley men saved the life of a motorist trapped in a burning car 
early Friday after a traffic accident on the Simi Valley Freeway, according to 
a California Highway Patrol spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP spokesman said Orlando Allain and Arnold Tibson pulled Gregory Scott 
McCaslin of Simi Valley from his burning car just before it was engulfed in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to their quick thinking and actions, they saved McCaslin's life while 
jeopardizing their own," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaslin, 21, is in critical condition in Simi Valley Hospital with 
third-degree burns and neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 While driving alone on the Simi Valley Freeway, just west of Kadota Street in 
Simi Valley, McCaslin rear-ended another car driven by Randall Allen, 44, also 
of Simi Valley. The speed of McCaslin's car has not been determined, but the 
force sent Allen's car across three lanes of traffic and into the median. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen had only minor injuries and was not treated. He was also driving alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McCaslin's car went over the right shoulder, rolling down a 60-foot 
embankment several times before coming to rest against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men awoke to the sound of the accident at 12:26 a.m. and ran outside 
with their fire extinguishers. They found McCaslin unconscious in the front 
seat. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PARENTS DISCUSS FUTURE OF SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More computer training and a requirement that parents help with homework were 
among ideas tossed out by parents during a recent brainstorming session to map 
the future of Thousand Oaks schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestions will be used to develop a new set of goals to guide the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District for the next five years.Budget priorities and 
curriculum policies will be set according to those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's meeting at Sequoia Intermediate School in Newbury Park was 
attended by about half a dozen parents and community members, along with a 
dozen district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Humbertson, a member of the steering committee developing the plan, said 
she believed the turnout was low because similar open forums are being held at 
individual schools throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the parents who did attend, David McCune said he would like to see an 
elementary school curriculum that forces children to interact with parents on 
homework and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see schools where parents were in fact required to be involved," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents said they wanted to see a lower student/counselor ratio in high 
schools and junior high schools, have counselors in elementary schools and 
teach elementary students how to resolve conflicts. The district now has 
counselors only in the upper grades. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the suggestions will be used to come up with a set of recommended goals 
before the district's current five-year plan expires in June. The school board 
is expected to discuss and adopt a new five-year plan in the next two months.

 A Simi Valley businessman who is trying to halt construction of a $3.2-million 
Boys & Girls club because it would block his view is taking his case to the 
state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Green, owns the Park Plaza office complex, and his son, attorney Matt 
Green, are appealing to the state after their request for an environmental 
impact report was rejected by a Superior Court commissioner and the state Court 
of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Green said he plans to file the petition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greens' protests have stalled construction of a 25,000-square-foot center 
directly behind Park Plaza on Alamo Street and Lemon Drive at Rancho Tapo 
Community Park. The project was approved by the City Council in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said the club would destroy the ambience at Park Plaza, a 
three-building, three-story complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to stop this project from happening, we just don't think it 
should happen right here," Green said. "They should do it right, which means 
not putting up a building right next to another building." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club, which has 2,000 members, now rents space at a former 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deal with the city and the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, the 
organization made plans to build a new clubhouse that will allow it to expand 
its activities and serve more youngsters. SARA CATANIA

 A 30-year-old Simi Valley golf course that has fallen into disrepair will get 
a $250,000 make-over, the park district has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement with the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, a 
private golf company will pay for improvements at the Sinaloa Golf Course on 
Madera and Irvine roads in exchange for a 15-year lease, district General 
Manager Jerry Gladden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shackelford Golf, owned by former college basketball star Lynn Shackelford, 
will spruce up the grounds with new landscaping, replace the course's sprinkler 
system and install a net at the end of the greens to keep balls from flying 
into neighboring property. 
</P>
<P>
 Shackelford said he will also renovate the pro shop, a former gas station that 
needs roof repairs and a paint job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has run the course all these years, nd it's been a low-cost 
facility for youth, seniors and new golfers,"Gladden said. "Now we're giving it 
a chance to be a nicer place to 1735355494SARA CATANIA.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; TRASH SENT TO AREA LANDFILLS DOWN 30% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The amount of trash Moorpark residents and businesses send to area landfills 
has dropped by more than 30% since 1990, newly released figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Myers, the city's solid waste coordinator, said programs that push 
recycling and composting have contributed most to the reduction.For instance, 
the city recycled more than 7,300 outdated phone books last year, amounting to 
more than 14 tons of rubbish that would have otherwise been sent to a landfill, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a curbside recycling program, one for apartments, condos and 
commercial buildings," Myers said. "And we still see the potential for even 
more reductions through our back-yard composting program." 
</P>
<P>
 An individual composting grass clippings and food scraps at home, Myers says, 
could prevent nearly a third of a ton of waste from heading to area landfills.  
</P>
<P>
 Some Moorpark residents are using compost to replenish the soil in their 
gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Vi Johnson, an artist and veteran gardener at a community garden, said the 
city has still only scratched the surface with home composting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to encourage commercial gardeners to bring in their lawn 
cuttings and wood chips to the community garden," Johnson said. "It's a big 
project to get everyone involved in composting, and we need more gardeners to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, cities must cut in half the amount of waste they dump by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is offering a free class in back-yard composting from 10 a.m. to noon 
April 16 at Moorpark Community Gardens, 13950 Peach Hill Road. Also, residents 
can recycle their old telephone books along with their other recyclables 
throughout April. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on either program, contact Myers at 529-6864, Ext. 248. SCOTT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; COUNCILMAN TO SERVE ON BASE REUSE PANEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week decided to send Councilman Michael L. Maertzweiler 
as its representative to the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority Executive 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley asked the city to appoint a council 
member to the Executive Council, which will serve as an advisory board to the 
nine members of the planning authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode and several other council members had expressed 
concern about the voting structure, which gives the five supervisors, three 
representatives from Irvine and one from Lake Forest each one vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Executive Council will not vote on how the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station is to be used when the military moves out in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Being on the Executive Council "gives us a voice, but does it give us a vote?" 
Councilwoman Carol Downey asked. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Robert D'Amato said by sending a representative, the city 
would have a vote on what the executive council recommends to the planning 
authority, but that vote would not be binding. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CAR DONATED TO HIGH SCHOOL FOR AUTO 
CLASSES 
</P>

<P>
 It's a teen-ager's dream. A brand new sports car equipped with a compact disc 
player and sunroof, all ready to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, students at Santa Paula High School won't be driving the 
$22,000 metallic green Z28 Camaro donated to the school by a local car dealer. 
Instead, students enrolled in the automotive department will spend their time 
learning how to take the car apart and put it back together again as part of 
their class. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's OK with student Steven McKeen, 16, who will have an opportunity to 
work on the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really excited," Steven said. "It will be a good experience to find 
out how the car was put together and what features these new machines have." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second time in the last 17 years that a dealer has donated a new 
vehicle to the high school, said Sandra Barbier, Santa Paula High School 
principal and deputy superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so appreciative of this gift," Barbier said. "We live in an era where 
students are in need of vocational training, and this would provide them with 
that training." 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 126 students enrolled in the school's automotive classes will have 
a chance to work on the new car, said Bill Atwood, who is in charge of the high 
school's automotive department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the next 10 years, students will be able to disassemble and assemble this 
car a thousand times," Atwood said. "This will give them a chance to learn the 
latest technology in a computerized system." 
</P>
<P>
 The car, which cannot be licensed, titled or driven on any road, was donated 
by Santa Paula Chevrolet dealership and GEO as part of a program which aims at 
providing schools with cars for in-classroom instructional purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1972, Chevrolet has donated nearly 11,000 vehicles to schools 
nationwide, said John Macik, executive general manager for Santa Paula 
Chevrolet. CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COMMERCIAL VACANCY RATES HIT LOW POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vacancy rates for commercial properties in Ventura County dropped in the first 
quarter of 1994, hitting some of the lowest numbers since the late 1980s, 
according to a report by a commercial real estate group released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Office space vacancies showed the biggest decrease countywide, from 24% in the 
first quarter of 1993 to 19.2% in the first quarter of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that decrease was due to General Telephone Co. taking over the lease 
of the long-empty Chevron office building in Oxnard, said Charles Engel, a vice 
president with CB Commercial Real Estate Group, which published the report. But 
he said he expected the trend to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outlook for the office-space market is very optimistic for the balance of 
1994 and into 1995," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake relocation helped beef up occupancy figures for office space in 
east Ventura County, Engel said. Westlake Village, closest to the quake-damaged 
west San Fernando Valley, fared best, dropping to a 16.5% vacancy rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial occupancy in east Ventura County also showed a sharp drop-off 
because of the earthquake, from 15% in the last quarter of 1993 to 13.5% in the 
first quarter this year. Three corporations -- Packard Bell, NNB and Vivitar -- 
that relocated from the Valley after January's quake, have filled more than 
320,000 square feet of formerly empty space. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Schniepp, director of the UCSB Economic Forecasting Group, said the 
drop seemed more related to the earthquake than to an improved economy. He said 
many businesses that relocated did so only temporarily, and will probably be 
required under previous leases to return when damages are repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a progressive downward trend," Schniepp said. "And that's 
good, but still, we have to remember that in an absolute sense, these vacancy 
numbers are still quite high." MARY F. POLS

<P>
 Oxnard police have arrested five people and seized two ounces of rock cocaine 
in connection with a monthlong investigation into drug sales in north Oxnard, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came after police raided an apartment in the 1900 block of Ginger 
Avenue about 6:30 p.m. Thursday after witnessing cocaine sales there, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Angel Ledesma, 19; Michael Joseph Brackrog, 19; Charles Dominick 
Campbell, 20; his brother, Christopher Darnell Campbell, 23; and Terri Rose 
Barden, 18, were arrested. Christopher Campbell and Barden live in Port 
Hueneme, the others in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledesma and Brackrog fled from police when officers tried to serve a search 
warrant on Ledesma's Ginger Avenue apartment, police said. They were 
apprehended in a nearby apartment and booked into County Jail on suspicion of 
possessing rock cocaine for sale, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledesma was wanted on four additional warrants and was being held in lieu of 
$40,000 bail. Brackrog's bail was set at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Campbell brothers were arrested in a restaurant parking lot in the 1800 
block of North Oxnard Boulevard after officers saw them leave the Ginger Avenue 
apartment. Charles Campbell resisted arrest and was taken into custody after 
struggling with officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Campbells were booked into County Jail on suspicion of possessing rock 
cocaine for sale and suspicion of possessing cocaine base. Charles Campbell was 
also booked for resisting arrest. They were each being held in lieu of $20,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Barden was arrested at the Ginger Avenue apartment on suspicion of possessing 
cocaine base. She was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 All five suspects are scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Ventura County 
Municipal Court at 2 p.m. JULIE FIELDS

 An Oxnard woman was arrested Friday on suspicion of stealing $238,000 from a 
large dental supply manufacturing company in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilma Caliboso Ildefonso, 31, who worked for Van-R Dental as a bookkeeper, was 
arrested after Oxnard police investigated her handling of various company 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Ildefonso, who was responsible for writing checks to two 
subsidiary companies of Van-R Dental, allegedly would alter the payee line on 
the checks, type her own name and deposit the checks in various bank accounts. 
She altered the checks from June, 1992, to January, 1994, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a company audit revealed financial losses, the company asked the Oxnard 
Police Department to investigate. The monthlong investigation ended after 
police obtained search warrants to serve on Ildefonso's various bank accounts, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ildefonso was booked at Ventura County Jail, where she was being held in lieu 
of $250,000 bail. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; NEW ZONING AREAS OKD FOR CHURCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Churches in Oxnard will be allowed to move to areas that have for years been 
reserved for business and industry under an amendment to an ordinance approved 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After a public hearing late Tuesday, the council voted unanimously to allow 
churches to open in business parks and light-industrial zones -- areas that 
typically rent or sell for less than residential property. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of churchgoers attended the hearing and scores more wrote letters to 
the City Council supporting the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of land and building in those kinds of zones tends to be 
significantly less," said Jeffrey Brown, a founding member of the Calvary 
Church in Oxnard, who attended the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This provides young churches another avenue to pursue those facilities," 
Brown said. "That's one of the major hurdles for young churches -- the expense 
of getting facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a blanket prohibition to having churches go into an industrial zone 
is inappropriate," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to allowing churches in industrial areas, the ordinance approved 
late Tuesday calls for new developments to be pedestrian-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spacing of shops and pedestrian-scale fountains, planters and other 
elements should make the pedestrian want to explore by walking rather than 
driving to his or her next destination," the new law says. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NURSES' UNION SEEKS TO HALT PAY PACKAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County nurses will ask a judge Monday to stop the county from imposing 
a new pay and benefits package, even as the county goes to court to stop the 
nurses from striking. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Nurses Assn., charging the county Health Care Agency with 
"breaching their duty to bargain," filed a motion Friday for a temporary 
restraining order.Such an order would keep the county from implementing a 
compensation package on nurses at the Ventura County Medical Center. The 
package could cut some nurses' salaries by 9.3% and give administrators greater 
latitude in layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to impose the package 
after health officials declared contract negotiations at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses' union has already voted to authorize a strike, but has said it 
would only do so as a last resort. Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne issued 
a temporary order two weeks ago requiring many of the nurses to provide at 
least 72 hours notice before striking.  
</P>
<P>
 He will consider a permanent restriction Monday. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CONVICTED DRUNK DRIVER GETS 6 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge sentenced a 24-year-old convicted drunk driver Friday 
to six years in state prison in connection with the death of an Ojai man who 
was killed while riding a motor scooter home from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabino Olivera pleaded guilty last month to vehicular manslaughter in the 
death of 52-year-old Jerry Blue, a federal oil platform worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue was struck from behind by Olivera's pickup truck on the afternoon of 
Sept. 30 while riding his motor scooter north of Vineyard Avenue near Central 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James McNally ordered the six-year sentence Friday, 
citing court testimony that Olivera was driving 90 m.p.h., left the scene of 
the crash and had a 0.25% blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue's widow, Gayle, told the judge that her husband's death has had a 
devastating impact on her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy A. Ratner said Olivera showed "total disregard for 
other persons on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Victor Salas asked the judge for leniency, saying Olivera is 
a Mexican national who dropped out of school as a young boy to take care of his 
family after his father died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Salas also took issue with a probation report that he said portrayed his 
clients as a "menace to society." 
</P>
<P>
 "Probation cannot look into a man's heart. Nobody can," Salas told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Olivera wants to make it clear that he did not mean to hit the victim and 
to suggest such is insane," he added later. DWAYNE BRAY

CITY TO CONSIDER PLAN TO REDUCE TRAFFIC, POLLUTION LEVELS; THOUSAND OAKS: 
OFFICIALS SAY THE ORDINANCE WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LOCAL AIR 
QUALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed ordinance aimed at reducing traffic in Thousand Oaks and making 
substantial improvements to the city's air quality will come before the 
Thousand Oaks Planning Commission Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council, 
the ordinance would complete a two-year effort to revise the city's plans to 
control traffic and automobile emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the ordinance would have significant impact on the quality 
of air in Thousand Oaks and would allow the city to meet county, state and 
federal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are basically a number of small measures (and) each will have a small 
impact on the air quality here," said John Helliwell, the city traffic 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Helliwell said the new law, coupled with other recent air quality measures the 
city has approved, "should make a significant difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal includes four major additions to traffic mitigation measures 
already being practiced in the city. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Linking traffic signals to a master computer system that would improve the 
timing of traffic lights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating new incentives for businesses to move toward ride-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moving toward the use of natural gas in public vehicles such as city buses. 
</P>
<P>
 * And adding a section to the city's General Plan that would address air 
quality issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new programs are possible with the aid of federal grants, some of 
which have already been acquired by the city, Helliwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Revising the General Plan has met with enthusiastic support from at least one 
planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is a long overdue proposal and I think it is truly needed," 
commission Chairman Irving Wasserman said. "I would like to see us get started 
on that part of this right away." 
</P>
<P>
 For the ordinance to be successful, he and other commissioners said, there 
needs to be an assurance that the proposals lead to action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now my sense is that this is a first step," Planning Commissioner Linda 
Parks said. "It provides a lot in terms of what we should plan to do, but does 
not take the steps to implement them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Helliwell said he believes the ordinance will lead to implementation of 
the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this ordinance will do is give us a stronger tool to work with than 
we've had," he said. "The rest will follow." 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff's written analysis of the ordinance states that one of its 
goals is to make a city commitment to the programs. Implementation of the plan 
is expected to occur in the months following the proposal's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman said the proposed ordinance is strengthened because the federal 
government can impose sanctions on the city if it does not comply with air 
quality standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions could include the withholding of federal highway and waste-water 
funds, the staff report says. 
</P>
<P>
 "That says to me that we will have pressure to enforce these standards," 
Wasserman said. "It gives the ordinance some teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would also require that the city be capable of showing results 
from any program it implements. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA requires that programs be 'measurable' and 'quantifiable' so that it 
is evident whether progress is being made, the staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really an important aspect of this," Wasserman said. "That tells us if 
we're really making an impact or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which was approved in March by the city's Transportation 
Commission, will be forwarded to the City Council in May if it is approved 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing on the ordinance will be held Monday at 7:30 p.m. in 
Thousand Oaks City Hall, 2400 Willow Lane.

MIKE PENNER: LEFTWICH FIGURES THIS IS HIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He throws right-handed and everybody calls him Lefty. 
</P>
<P>
 He has all of four career major league victories to his name and the Angels 
call him their No. 3 starter. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the answer to the Angels' half-prayer, half-trivia question, "Langston 
and Finley and then . . . and then?" -- usually prompting blank stares all 
around and a roomful of head scratching. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's after you spot the room his first and last names. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't easy being Phil Leftwich, as 8,788 aspiring Eskimos discovered on a 
frigid Friday evening in Milwaukee. With a small band of Brewer fans shivering 
in the stands, a smaller band of Brewers made Leftwich's 13th big-league start 
truly Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich learned, for instance, that it is bad luck to surrender three runs in 
the first inning to a team generally regarded as the Mets of the American 
League. Better to step on a crack in the sidewalk while carrying a black cat 
under a ladder than to serve up three RBIs to Jody Reed (he had 31 in 1993) or 
a game-breaking home run to Kevin Seitzer (he averages seven per season), but 
Leftwich messed with superstition more than once and paid for it with a 5-1 
loss and sixth-inning hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich is now 4-7 as a major-league starting pitcher. His earned-run average 
as an Angel is 4.05. He has thrown 86 2/3 innings on this level. And he is more 
important to the Angels' hopes of contention, such as they are, than any 
pitcher not named Langston, Finley or Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do anything this year," Manager Buck Rodgers says, "Phil, first of all, 
has to pitch well enough to stay in the rotation the whole year. If he does 
that, he should finish close to .500, maybe one game above, 12-12, 13-12, 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he does that, that's all we can expect of Phil Leftwich. If he can do 
that, we ought to have enough to win with him." 
</P>
<P>
 The order is taller than it seems, considering that Leftwich has never won 
more than 11 games on any level in any professional season. This time last 
year, Leftwich was a Triple-A pitcher with a boarding pass for Double-A. That 
ticket was never punched, but after a series of April shellings, the Angels 
thought long and hard about sending Leftwich back to Midland for remedial work 
in Large Inning Avoidance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew going into spring training last year that I'd be fighting for a job in 
Triple-A," Leftwich said. "The year before, I had a bad year in Double-A. The 
whole season I was battling arm problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this time last year, I came back and was throwing the ball well. My big 
problem was giving up the big inning, kind of like tonight. I'd throw five 
scoreless innings, then give up a five-run inning." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich started 2-6 at Vancouver, then won five of his next six decisions. 
When Scott Sanderson held his annual July blowout, the Angels sent for 
Leftwich, threw him out there against Oakland on July 29 and watched him lose, 
2-1, to Bob Welch, no disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich lost two more starts, then went 4-3 from Aug. 15 on. The Angels, who 
would hand Joe Magrane a four-year, $13.3-million contract on the basis of 
three starts, immediately christened Leftwich a cornerstone to their starting 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with the Angels, a cornerstone can be a relative thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers describes Leftwich's four-pitch repertoire as "average across the 
board." On the Angels, this is high praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I say 'average,' I don't mean that's bad," Rodgers says. "The 
major-league average is not bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm saying is the he does not have one predominant pitch. He's close to 
average across the board, which means he has to get all his pitches over the 
plate and keep all four pitches alive in the hitters' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because if you narrow him to one pitch, and you need him to get outs solely 
on his fastball, you could get in trouble. He has a good fastball, not an 
outstanding fastball." 
</P>
<P>
 And when you're close to average, you better "do your homework," as Rodgers 
puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Homework? As in going inside and memorizing your opponents' pull-hitting 
tendencies? 
</P>
<P>
 Not in Rodgers' dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 'homework,' I mean he's got to pitch inside," Rodgers said. "Get the 
hitters off the plate. Like tonight against Turner Ward. Phil got ahead of him 
on the count by pounding inside, up and in. Then he hangs one and lets him off 
the hook. (Ward singled and later scored.) He has to learn to come inside 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 The training, however, will come on the job -- and, the Angels hope, in the 
midst of a playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich believes he is ready for the challenge, should it come. 
</P>
<P>
 "My confidence has never been better than it is now," Leftwich said after 
Friday's defeat. "They scored some runs in the first inning, but except for 
Seitzer's home run, I came back and pitched strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've set a goal to be in double-digit wins this year, definitely to be above 
.500. With this team, I think that's realistic. Hopefully, I can give Langston 
and Finley the backup they'll need." 
</P>
<P>
 And fill in the blank to the nationwide query, "Who do the Angels have after 
Langston and Finley?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If what I think happens this year happens," Leftwich said, "they won't be 
asking that question next year."

STRODES CREEK GOING DOWN FAMILIAR PATH; HORSE RACING: SANTA ANITA DERBY ENTRANT 
HOPES TO DUPLICATE SUNDAY SILENCE IN KENTUCKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Stop here if you've heard this story before: 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur B. Hancock III has a young horse who was sired by Halo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock thinks the colt might be sold for a decent price, but the horse is 
unlucky and regarded as damaged goods by potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying to sell the horse a couple of times, a frustrated Hancock finally 
decides to race him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock sends the horse to trainer Charlie Whittingham in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse scores a victory and finishes second in his first two races, then 
goes on to win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened to Sunday Silence. And except for the last part -- 
winning the Kentucky Derby -- this is also the Strodes Creek story. Bred by 
Hancock and owned by him in a partnership with Whittingham, Strodes Creek could 
still duplicate Sunday Silence's feats all the way to the Churchill Downs 
finish line on May 7, but first he will have to run a big race today in the 
$500,000 Santa Anita Derby, which is loaded with Kentucky Derby candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-5 morning-line favorite, Brocco, heads an eight-horse field that also 
includes stakes winners Tabasco Cat, Soul Of The Matter and Fly'n J. Bryan. 
Whittingham even has a second hopeful in Numerous, the $1.7-million yearling 
owned by Howard Keck, who also raced Ferdinand. Whittingham won his first 
Kentucky Derby winner with Ferdinand in 1986, three years before Sunday 
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six might run today. Soul Of The Matter, winner over Brocco in the recent 
San Felipe Stakes, is expected to be scratched because of a skin blister on his 
left foreleg, and late Friday there was an unconfirmed report that longshot 
Pollock's Luck also might not run. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock, who owns Stone Farm near Paris, Ky., would have sold Sunday Silence 
for $50,000, but he couldn't get that for the knock-kneed colt at auction, so 
he and his partners, Whittingham and Ernest Gaillard, a retired La Jolla 
surgeon, charged into Louisville five years ago and upset Easy Goer, the 
heaviest Kentucky Derby favorite in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday Silence almost died of an intestinal virus as a weanling, and later, 
while being shipped across the country, he survived an overturned-van accident 
that occurred after the driver suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek's problems also began early. He was foaled with one testicle 
undescended, and when he was a yearling, a lesion, a flaky growth, was detected 
in the stifle joint of an upper rear leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hancock was determined to run Strodes Creek through a Keeneland 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't do it," veterinarian Dewitt Owen advised him. "He won't bring 
much. Especially the way you do it, Arthur, announcing everything that's wrong 
with a horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock later withdrew Strodes Creek from a horses-in-training sale because 
inclement weather had disrupted the colt's training schedule. Then a deal fell 
through to sell Strodes Creek privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, when the unraced Strodes Creek was a 2-year-old, he took off 
running in a five-acre paddock at Stone Farm. Far ahead were two fences, both 
about six feet high and at least eight feet apart. Strodes Creek must have 
figured he would jump both of them, or he didn't realize that the second one 
was there. By the time the colt reached the first fence, he was in high gear. 
He cleared that barrier but crashed into the back fence, opening a large gash 
in one of his shoulders. It took more than 20 stitches to close it. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was suggested to Hancock that Strodes Creek could have been killed, he 
said: "Yes, but I like to see a horse jump like that. Just about every horse 
I've had that could jump could also run." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock is superstitious. He credits the finding of a lucky penny in Baltimore 
with helping Sunday Silence win the 1989 Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's some destiny involved with Strodes Creek," Hancock said. "I 
think I've been destined to keep him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock, 51, son of the late Bull Hancock of Claiborne Farm fame, was a 
partner with the late Leone Peters when they won the Kentucky Derby with the 
Eddie Gregson-trained Gato Del Sol in 1982. Gato Del Sol ran fourth in the 
Santa Anita Derby; seven years later, Sunday Silence won at Arcadia by 11 
lengths, which is still the record margin for the Santa Anita race. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek, named after a family that crossed the Allegheny Mountains 
during Daniel Boone's time and built a fort less than three miles from where 
Hancock's farm now stands, grew rapidly. By the time Strodes Creek got to 
California, Whittingham knew the colt would need time for his head to catch up 
with his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big horse and he knew it," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Strodes Creek ran, in a 6 1/2-furlong race at Santa Anita on 
Jan. 15, he came from last place to win by five lengths. In his next start, at 
a mile on Feb. 12, the speedy Argolid beat him by two lengths. On March 5, 
Strodes Creek again came from off the pace to score a half-length victory over 
Irgun in a 1:35 mile. In his next start, Irgun won the Gotham Stakes at 
Aqueduct by six lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham, who will turn 81 Wednesday, is fitting Strodes Creek with 
blinkers for today's race. "He was green and lugged in in that last race," 
jockey Corey Black said. "He's improved every race and should still improve. 
Whether he can improve enough to win, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, that man of destiny, Arthur Hancock is still not tuning out 
overtures for his horse. Not long ago, he asked Whittingham his opinion about a 
new offer he had received. 
</P>
<P>
 "A faint heart has never won a fair lady, my boy," Whittingham said. Hancock 
still owns Strodes Creek, so apparently he understood. Santa Anita Derby

UNDECIDED ROBINSON WINS WOODEN AWARD; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PURDUE STAR EASILY 
OUTDISTANCES RIVALS, BUT DOESN'T EASILY TALK ABOUT DECISION ON COLLEGE OR NBA 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The basketball coronation of Purdue's Glenn Robinson continued Friday as the 
All-American junior forward was named winner of the John R. Wooden Award. Any 
more of these things and Robinson will have to ice down his shoulder, what with 
all the heavy trophy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 A plane delay out of Chicago caused Robinson, who led the nation in two NCAA 
categories -- scoring and most times asked, "Are you turning pro?" -- to arrive 
at the Los Angeles Athletic Club nearly 30 minutes after Wooden himself had 
opened the envelope and made the official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden did what he could to add some suspense, but it was hardly worth the 
trouble. Everyone in the room, including the three other finalists who attended 
the brief ceremony, knew whose name belonged on the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winner is a gentleman from an area and a school of which I'm somewhat 
familiar," said Wooden, the famed former UCLA coach who starred at Purdue in 
the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 How long Robinson plans to stay in familiar surroundings remains unclear. 
Projected as the No. 1 selection in the June 29 NBA draft, Robinson has until 
the middle of May to declare his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, at least publicly, Robinson remains noncommittal about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a timetable," he said. "Whatever I decide to do, you guys will be 
the first to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said that speculation about his senior season -- will he or won't he? 
-- has gotten to the point "that people don't even ask my name anymore." But 
one thing is for sure: If Robinson does leave early, it won't be under the 
auspices of the new NCAA rule that allows underclassmen to regain their 
eligibility within 30 days of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I say I'm leaving, I'm leaving," he said. "I'm not going to play around." 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source close to the situation, Robinson recently indicated 
that he plans to forgo his final season at Purdue. If true, a consultant for an 
NBA team said, the 6-foot-8 forward would be the likely top choice in the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's playing future might remain a mystery, but his selection as the 
Wooden Award winner was no shocker. His 4,930 balloting points easily 
outdistanced the totals of Duke senior swingman Grant Hill (3,862), Connecticut 
junior forward Donyell Marshall (3,585), California sophomore point guard Jason 
Kidd (3,461) and Louisville junior center Clifford Rozier (1,818). 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last year, when only two of the five finalists attended the ceremony, 
the dais included all but Rozier, who was unable to attend because of academic 
obligations. Also on hand were coaches Gene Keady of Purdue, Mike Krzyzewski of 
Duke, Denny Crum of Louisville, Todd Bozeman of Cal and Jim Calhoun of 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who held Robinson to a season-low 13 points in Duke's NCAA Southeast 
Regional final victory, said he would have voted for the Purdue forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do what he has done is amazing," said Hill, whose team lost to Arkansas in 
Monday night's championship game. "Just his ability to carry his team on his 
shoulders is something else. He did a lot of things, mainly his scoring. He may 
be the best shooter in the country, the way he shoots the ball, right in your 
face, is really amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is certain to be a top-three or top-four NBA selection. The same goes for 
Kidd, who already has announced his decision to forgo his final two seasons at 
Cal. Marshall, as well as Rozier, have yet to decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, Hill, who stayed at Duke all four years, offered advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, I've got mixed feelings," Hill said. "Part of me would say he 
should enjoy his last year. I know I've enjoyed my last year. I know he has a 
good team returning with a chance of going far in the (NCAA) tournament and 
maybe possibly winning it. I would tell him to take advantage of that. You're 
only in college one time and it's the last time before you're in the real 
world. I'd tell him to have fun and really enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, I'd really like him to come out with me. For both of us to 
come into the league at the same time would be something really special, along 
with Jason and hopefully Donyell. All of us (could) come in together and wreak 
havoc out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was wishful thinking, but when Keady accepted the award for 
Robinson, who was en route from the airport, the Purdue coach said: "Hopefully, 
he can come back and get another one of these next year. But we'll have to wait 
to see about that one." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very latest, the wait ends on May 15.

much. Especially the way you do it, Arthur, announcing everything that's wrong 
with a horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock later withdrew Strodes Creek from a horses-in-training sale because 
inclement weather had disrupted the colt's training schedule. Then a deal fell 
through to sell Strodes Creek privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, when the unraced Strodes Creek was a 2-year-old, he took off 
running in a five-acre paddock at Stone Farm. Far ahead were two fences, both 
about six feet high and at least eight feet apart. Strodes Creek must have 
figured he would jump both of them, or he didn't realize that the second one 
was there. By the time the colt reached the first fence, he was in high gear. 
He cleared that barrier but crashed into the back fence, opening a large gash 
in one of his shoulders. It took more than 20 stitches to close the wound. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was suggested to Hancock that Strodes Creek could have been killed, he 
said: "Yes, but I like to see a horse jump like that. Just about every horse 
I've had that could jump could also run." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock is superstitious. He credits the finding of a lucky penny in Baltimore 
with helping Sunday Silence win the 1989 Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's some destiny involved with Strodes Creek," Hancock said. "I 
think I've been destined to keep him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock, 51, son of the late Bull Hancock of Claiborne Farm fame, was a 
partner with the late Leone Peters when they won the Kentucky Derby with the 
Eddie Gregson-trained Gato Del Sol in 1982. Gato Del Sol ran fourth in the 
Santa Anita Derby; seven years later, Sunday Silence won at Arcadia by 11 
lengths, which is still the record margin for the Santa Anita race. 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek, named after a family that crossed the Allegheny Mountains 
during Daniel Boone's time and built a fort less than three miles from where 
Hancock's farm now stands, grew rapidly. By the time Strodes Creek got to 
California, Whittingham knew the colt would need time for his head to catch up 
with his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big horse and he knew it," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Strodes Creek ran, in a 6 1/2-furlong race at Santa Anita on 
Jan. 15, he came from last place to win by five lengths. In his next start, at 
a mile on Feb. 12, the speedy Argolid beat him by two lengths. On March 5, 
Strodes Creek again came from off the pace to score a half-length victory over 
Irgun in a 1:35 mile. In his next start, Irgun won the Gotham Stakes at 
Aqueduct by six lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham, who will turn 81 Wednesday, is fitting Strodes Creek with 
blinkers for today's race. "He was green and lugged in in that last race," 
jockey Corey Black said. "He's improved every race and should still improve. 
Whether he can improve enough to win, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, that man of destiny, Arthur Hancock is still not tuning out 
overtures for his horse. Not long ago, he asked Whittingham his opinion about a 
new offer he had received. 
</P>
<P>
 "A faint heart has never won a fair lady, my boy," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock still owns Strodes Creek, so apparently he understood.

MARIO'S FINISH LINE; PHOENIX IS VERY SPECIAL IN ANDRETTI'S FINAL SEASON AND 
CREW CHIEF MCGEE HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF HIS CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim McGee was Mario Andretti's roommate and chief mechanic when Andretti drove 
in his first Indy car race in 1964. He was the crew chief in 1969 when Andretti 
won his only Indianapolis 500. He was with him here last year when Andretti won 
his 52nd race to become -- at 53 years, 34 days -- the oldest Indy car winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two are together this weekend as Andretti defends his Slick-50 200 
championship Sunday at Phoenix International Raceway. Qualifying is today for 
the race, No. 2 in the PPG Cup Indy car season -- which Andretti has said will 
be his last. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started right here in Phoenix," McGee said. "Clint Brawner and I had 
put together a car and we needed a driver. I told Clint that 'That Andretti kid 
has really looked good running against Parnelli Jones and A.J. Foyt back East.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti moved to Phoenix, roomed with McGee and worked on the car as a welder 
and handyman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pretty handy as a welder and he rebuilt a dirt car for us before we 
put him in our champ car," McGee said. "That was an amazing time in Indy cars, 
a real transition year. We were shifting from roadsters to rear-engine cars, 
and at the time were moving from the old Offy engines to Ford V8s. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went to Indy in '65, we had a whole new car, a new engine and a 
rookie driver, and we got there late. We only had two engines and when we blew 
both of them in practice, it looked like we were cooked, but Clint got 
Firestone to lend us an engine so Mario could finish his rookie test." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident helped launch what many racing followers believe is the career of 
racing's greatest driver. Andretti qualified fourth, finished third and was 
named rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it turned out, it was one of the most amazing races of his career," McGee 
said. "We were so afraid of blowing the borrowed engine, we ran such a safe 
fuel mixture that it left Mario down 150 horsepower to guys like A.J. and (Dan) 
Gurney and Bobby Unser. The car didn't have proper ventilation, so Mario cooked 
in the cockpit. His hands were so blistered, I don't know how he held the 
steering wheel, but there was no way anything like pain could stop him." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year, Andretti went on to win his first Indy car race, at 
Indianapolis Raceway Park, and stunned his elders by beating Foyt for his first 
driver's championship. He won the title again in 1966 and '69, when the Indy 
500 was one of his nine victories that season, and for the last time in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great run until it ended in 1970 when Mario left Brawner to go with 
Andy Granatelli (who had been a partner with Brawner)," McGee said. "He and 
Clint had been feuding for years, and I was the peacemaker, but when Granatelli 
entered the picture, Clint said, 'So long.' I worked a year for Andy in Santa 
Monica, but a year was enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
 After stints with car owners Parnelli Jones and Bob Fletcher, McGee was 
approached by Roger Penske in 1975 to help develop an Indy car team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Sneva was our only driver that first year, and we built it up to a 
three-car team that began dominating the series," McGee said. It also brought 
him and Andretti together again. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my last year with Penske, our cars finished 1-2-3 at Michigan with Mario 
winning. It was a great team, and it still is." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti and McGee parted company when Mario joined a new team formed by Paul 
Newman and Carl Haas in 1983. McGee spent 12 years with Pat Patrick, during 
which time he was crew chief for two Indy 500 winners, Gordon Johncock in 1982 
and Emerson Fittipaldi in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 season, in which McGee directed Bobby Rahal to his second Indy 
car championship, he decided to take a year off, enjoy his family and explore 
other possibilities. They took a monthlong trip to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got back, I had a call from Mario," McGee said. "He asked me what I 
was doing, I told him nothing, and the next thing I knew Carl (Haas) was 
calling, asking me to come up to Chicago. He told me (Nigel) Mansell was coming 
over and the team needed someone to help him through the year, especially at 
Indy. He said he wanted me to sort of guide him around, not only in the race 
car, but off the track as well." 
</P>
<P>
 When McGee accepted the challenge, it reunited him with Andretti yet again in 
a fourth decade and on a seventh different team. He was made team manager for 
both Andretti and Mansell, although on race days he is in Mansell's pit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had watched Mario while I was working for Patrick," McGee said, "but I was 
still a bit surprised when I started working with him again and saw how much he 
still had the same burning desire, the fire, that he had when we started 
together. It wasn't only his mental approach, but also his physical. Basically, 
he was doing the same work he did 20 and 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 There were highlights and lowlights for Andretti in 1993. The highs came when 
he ended a 73-race winless streak, dating back to 1988, with his victory at 
Phoenix and when he set a world closed-course record of 234.275 m.p.h. to win 
the pole for the Michigan 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was back in his glory when he was on the podium at Phoenix," McGee said. 
"You could see the old fire back in his eyes. He was a winner again. But I 
think that pole at Michigan was even more remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "At his age, to set a record of that magnitude, it's a heck of a feat. I know 
records are made to be broken, but that one's going to stand for a while, I'm 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The downside of Andretti's year was the anguish over the disappointing season 
by his son Michael in Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was painful for me, no doubt about it, because it was so unjust," 
Mario said. "When (McLaren team manager) Roy Dennis decided to have Mika 
Hakkinen do all the testing for the team, it left Michael out in the lake 
without any oars. He went to tracks he'd never seen, and when he didn't 
produce, he caught it from all sides. I knew what was happening, but there was 
nothing I could do about it. It was very stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to Michael's credit that he was able to maintain his cool and focus on 
his future. Australia (where Michael won the Indy car series opener last month) 
proved he was a man on a mission and he came through with flying colors." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Andretti, the first to win both an Indy car and a Formula One 
championship, said he has mixed emotions about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could keep on, I feel I'm still competitive, but I don't want to fade into 
the sunset," Andretti said. "I don't want to retire, but I know I have to. It's 
not my fault that the years go by. I was talking with Bryan Herta. I told him 
he could spare five or six years, and he said he could use five or six years of 
my experience. Now, if we could just work it out, I'd stay around. Wouldn't 
that be nice?" 
</P>
<P>
 Herta, 23, is a promising driver from Los Angeles who won the Indy Lights 
championship last year and has been testing with the Newman-Haas team in hopes 
of making his Indy car debut in the Indianapolis 500 on May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very comfortable with my decision," Andretti said. "On the other hand, I 
know I will miss the driving. All those miles, thousands and thousands of them, 
have been such a part of my life I can't imagine what it will be without them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will miss going to the tracks, feeling the tension, the commitment, the 
team camaraderie. Every year you look at each track in a different way. Every 
new season is like waiting for a newborn baby. You can't wait to find out 
what's going to happen. I don't know what in hell I'll be thinking about this 
time next year, but it's not something that concerns me at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, my focus is on this race and this season. I have a job to do and 
that's to get as much out of the car the crew gives me as I possibly can, and 
to keep it out of trouble during the race Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti's speed of 171.953 m.p.h. in his Lola-Ford on Phoenix' mile oval 
during practice Friday was seventh-fastest of the 31 cars entered in Sunday's 
race. Emerson Fittipaldi was quickest at 177.087. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phoenix has a very soft spot in my heart," Andretti said. "I have driven a 
lot of miles, probably more than anyone, on this track. I got my start right 
here and I look back on it with a lot of emotion and a lot of images in my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti won here in 1966, '67, '88 and '93. He sat on the pole for eight 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some great memories," Andretti said. "Like when I won the pole in 1986 
and Michael qualified second, so we had the first father and son on the front 
row ever for Indy cars. The win in '88 was special, very special, because it 
was our first race with Kmart as our sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the win last year is something that will always be extra special. 
Only I know how much I really, really wanted to win in the 1990s. It gave me a 
win in my fourth decade and it proved that on the right day, and in the right 
circumstances, I could still win."

SALTER TO COACH BISHOP AMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Salter, a football assistant at La Puente Bishop Amat High since 1988, has 
been selected as the school's new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be presented to the team Monday afternoon, when his promotion will be 
announced at a news conference at the school."It would be best if I didn't say 
anything until Monday," Salter said Friday. He is in Tucson with the Bishop 
Amat baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, 32, replaces Mark Paredes, who resigned two weeks ago to become coach 
at Riverside North. Paredes said he had recommended several of his assistants 
for the job but was unaware of the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed Salter is the only candidate interviewed for the job by the 
school's principal, Msgr. Aidan Carroll, who could not be reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter graduated from Bishop Amat in 1979. He began his coaching career at the 
school in 1980 while attending Whittier College. ERIC SHEPARD

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY IS AT A CALIFORNIA DRUG TREATMENT 
CENTER, HIS BROTHER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry entered a drug treatment center Thursday afternoon in 
California, according to his brother, Michael Strawberry, who would not 
disclose the site. The 32-year-old Dodger admitted Monday that he had a drug 
abuse problem, but the specific nature of the substance has not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl wanted to go to John Lucas' center (in Houston), I know he talked 
about that, but the decision was up to somebody else," Michael Strawberry said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said the center was chosen by 
the two doctors who evaluated Strawberry Tuesday in New York. Claire said 
Robert Millman, who represents the owners, and Joel Solomon, who represents the 
players' union, are in charge of Strawberry's rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Strawberry -- who resigned from the LAPD in February so he could work 
closely with his brother -- said he did not know if the center was chosen so 
that Strawberry could be close to his family, although he believes the family 
will be involved in Strawberry's rehabilitation at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he is settled in, I believe (the center) has a setup where family 
members can be involved in therapy, but that is down the road," Strawberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Strawberry said he spent most of the winter with his brother, as well 
as a week in Vero Beach, Fla. during spring training, but saw no signs of drug 
abuse. "I wasn't around him too much last season, and we weren't as close as we 
have become recently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved my job as a police officer, but Darryl wanted me to work for him and 
be around him as a positive role model. So I took over his marketing company 
and was going to travel on the road with him as well. That's all on hold for 
now, but the strategy remains. Whether Darryl plays for the Dodgers or 
whomever, he needs me to be there." 
</P>

 After bullpen coach Mark Cresse got the call Thursday night from Ron 
Perranoski, he turned to Darren Dreifort and told him the news: If the team 
tied the game or remained a run behind after the eighth inning, Dreifort would 
pitch the ninth. If the team went ahead, Todd Worrell would pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Dreifort -- who had yet to pitch in a major league game -- respond 
to the news? 
</P>
<P>
 "He was calm, like he has been doing this for 20 years," said Cresse, who is 
in his 18th season as the bullpen coach. "(Dreifort) is really cool, but not 
cool to the point where he is cocky. Most guys are excitable or breathe heavy 
or something, but not this guy -- he's awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort retired the Florida Marlins on three ground balls.

PENDLETON'S PLAYS IN SECOND PAY OFF; BASEBALL: THIRD BASEMAN ROBS MONDESI, 
OFFERMAN TO HELP PRESERVE NO-HITTER. BUTLER'S BASERUNNING HELPS BRAVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At the time, they were simply a couple of nice plays that brought a ripple of 
applause from the Atlanta Braves' fans at Dodger Stadium on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But it developed that Atlanta third baseman Terry Pendleton's glove work in 
the second inning kept intact a no-hitter for Kent Mercker, who won, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, a three-time Gold Glove winner, took potential hits away from the 
Dodgers' Raul Mondesi and Jose Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, they were just routine," Pendleton said. "Just kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 First, he ranged to his left to short-hop Mondesi's grounder and throw out the 
speedy rookie by a couple of steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't back up on a ball hit like that," Pendleton said. "I've got to get it 
on the short hop or I don't have enough time to throw him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Two batters later, he made an even better play on Offerman, backhanding a hard 
grounder that was headed down the third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was do or die," Pendleton said. "Offerman hit a bullet and I just tried 
to make a stab at it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth inning, some ad-lib strategy by Brett Butler unwittingly kept the 
no-hitter alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros hit a line drive up the middle that would have landed in center 
field for a single under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 But Butler was going on the pitch, and second baseman Mark Lemke was heading 
to the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 In perfect position, Lemke made the catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way I would have gotten it otherwise," he said. "Funny, with me 
breaking, if Karros hits the ball to where the second baseman normally is, he 
gets a base hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, something exceptional happens in this Dodger-Brave series on April 
8 every 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 On that date in 1974, Henry Aaron hit his 715th home run. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher was Al Downing of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing, who will broadcast tonight's game on CBS radio, was at Dodger Stadium 
to see Mercker's gem. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting ahead of the hitters all night," Downing said. "That's the key 
to any well-pitched game." 
</P>
<P>
 All evening, Downing had been asked about that other game 20 years ago in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me to talk about it now," he said. "It did, though, when 
both of us were still playing. Everybody tried to make a big issue out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I gave up the 715th. But it could have been anybody. I couldn't have 
done it without help from a lot of other pitchers who threw home run pitches to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Another former Dodger pitcher, Don Sutton, was behind the microphone in the 
Braves' booth Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mercker's changeup was the difference," Sutton said. "Here's a guy who can 
throw in the 90s, but he also gave the Dodgers something they've never seen 
from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker is a reliever by trade, who started only six games last season for the 
team with the best rotation in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He will probably be back in the bullpen again when the Braves return to a 
four-man rotation of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Steve Avery and John Smoltz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just think, he throws a no-hitter and he doesn't get a chance to start the 
next time," Sutton said.

EVEN WITH SON GONE, LIFE GOES ON FOR LEITER; ANGELS: HE PITCHES TODAY, THREE 
DAYS AFTER THE MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR NINE-MONTH-OLD RYAN.

 Pitcher Mark Leiter was hugging his wife in the Anaheim Stadium parking lot 
Monday, his eyes flooded by tears, when he casually glanced down and saw that 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ryan, lying in the car with an oxygen tank hooked to his frail body, 
looking up at both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan smiled for five, six, perhaps even seven seconds. It was his way of 
letting them know, Leiter said, that he soon would be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting all choked up," Leiter said Friday, recalling that afternoon 
before leaving on the Angels' first trip of the season. "I told my wife 
(Allison), 'That's the last time I'll see him smile. I don't think I'll see him 
again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Alexander Leiter died a few hours later of Hoffmann disease, a child's 
form of Lou Gehrig's disease. He was nine months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "He passed away in my arms on opening day," Allison Leiter said Friday. "I was 
always worried what it would be like. I feared the worst. But he looked so 
beautiful. He looked just like an angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "But can you imagine, of all days for him to go, it was on opening day. The 
birth of the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had to be a reason for that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leiters had been preparing for Ryan's death for the past 7 1/2 months. 
There is no cure for the disease, nor remedies to prolong life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan came down with pneumonia in Arizona and was nearly recovered, but the 
disease was stripping away his life. The last few days, he was not sleeping and 
his weight had dropped to about 14 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't think he was going to keep going on like he was," Leiter said. 
"He just wasn't happy at all the last day and a half. He wasn't smiling and 
wasn't breathing like he normally was. He wasn't in pain. He just wasn't 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was just hanging on because my wife wouldn't let him go. Maybe he 
saw the opportunity where I was gone, and there was so much going on, it was a 
good time for him to take off." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, who makes his Angel debut today, won't accept his son's death. He 
still has difficulty understanding why it has happened. Yet, he also knows that 
his own family's life must go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never cursed or blamed God for any of this," Leiter said. "There have 
been times through the winter where I'd be by myself in the car, and mentally 
not really being there, but I'd just kind of argue with him (God). 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted a reason. Not just for us, but for parents who love their kids 
and anyone who loses a loved one and how much it hurts inside. We just wanted 
to know why. Can't there be a reason? If God sat down with you, and nobody 
would believe you anyway, so why not just tell me? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't accept it. I live with it because I have to live with it. But I 
sure don't accept the fact that I have to lose my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the memorial service for Ryan, Leiter will try to deal with 
his emotions today when he starts against the Milwaukee Brewers. His family 
will be in the stands -- with Allison and three-year-old Mark Jr. accompanying 
him on the trip -- and they believe Ryan will be watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, our hearts are broken and we're sad," Leiter said, "but it's not 
good to just sit around a room and cry to each other. I wouldn't have seen any 
good in going home for a week or whatever when you're going to need the rest of 
your life to get over something like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "This, I think, will be the best for everyone."

NEWSWIRE: OHIO STATE, FRESNO STATE TO PLAY IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ohio State agreed Friday to play in the Pigskin Classic, ending a lengthy 
search for an opponent to face Fresno State in the Aug. 29 football game at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a nice catch," said Don Andersen, executive director of the 
Orange County Sports Assn."It makes it doubly pleasing to have a Big Ten team. 
I don't think we've had it any better than Ohio State as far as tradition and 
winning goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State (10-1-1) tied Wisconsin for the Big Ten championship, but the 
Badgers won the conference tiebreaker and played in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a team meeting, and the players voted unanimously to accept the 
invitation," Ohio State Coach John Cooper said in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (8-4) shared the Western Athletic Conference title for the second 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State and Fresno State are each guaranteed $550,000 from the Pigskin 
Classic, less expenses. Last year's teams, USC and North Carolina, each 
received $720,000. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

 Tackle Jackie Slater decided to remain with the Rams after the team increased 
its one-year offer. The Rams had offered Slater, who earned $1.365 million last 
season, a $500,000 base salary, but Atlanta offered $700,000 with an additional 
$350,000 in incentive opportunities. After it appeared that Slater was leaning 
toward the Falcons, the Rams added a significant incentive package if he plays 
more than 50% of the time in 1994. T.J. SIMERS

NEWSWIRE: SCHOOL DISTRICT SUES TO EVICT RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Magnolia School District, which owns the Rams' practice facility, filed 
suit Friday to evict the team because it has refused to sign a new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's lease expired Dec. 31 and it has refused several offers made by the 
district and the city of Anaheim, which acts as the district's agent under a 
complicated agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Rams executive vice president, refused to comment on the suit, 
filed in Superior Court in Orange County. The team has told the city that on 
May 3 it will give notice that it might leave Anaheim Stadium after the 1994 
season. It is being courted by several cities, including Baltimore and St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's latest offer for the practice facility would have had the city pay 
the Rams' $220,000 annual rent and would have allowed the team to break the 
15-year agreement at any time by paying a $220,000 fee to the district. TERRY 
SPENCER

HE'S IN THE PICTURE FOR USC; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: MAGAZINE COVER LED TO A WHOLE 
NEW WORLD FOR TROJANS' NIGERIAN LINEBACKER ISRAEL IFEANYI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A well-remembered picture, in a long-forgotten magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Israel (Izzy) Ifeanyi is on USC's football practice field this 
spring, hurling his 6-foot-4, 245-pound body into Trojan ball carriers and 
quarterbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi, a 23-year-old junior from Nigeria, doesn't remember the name of the 
magazine or who was wearing the football uniform.  
</P>
<P>
 He just remembers thinking: "This is what I want to be -- an American football 
warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi talked the other day about the picture: "I was about 13, living with 
my grandmother in Owerri, Nigeria, and all I remember is being at a friend's 
house, looking at this magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this picture of an American football player, and I was very 
impressed with it. The player seemed like a warrior to me. I decided then 
that's what I wanted to be, a football player.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember what the magazine was, or who the player was, but I can 
still clearly remember the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime later, his father got him an early 1980s videotape of a 
Miami-Cincinnati NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched it over and over," he said. "I didn't even know the names of the 
positions, but I couldn't wait then to learn how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi, who had been a promising young cricket player in Nigeria, came to the 
United States in 1990 and initially stayed with a friend and his family in 
Windsor, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned there that a good place for me to be in order to qualify for 
college, and to learn football, was California," he said. "I wanted to start at 
a California junior college." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi contacted another Nigerian athlete, Uzoma Obiekea, who was playing 
basketball at El Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uzoma was living in Inglewood with his brothers and sisters, and in 1991 I 
moved in for a couple of months with them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Uzoma went to UC Irvine to play basketball and I went there one day with him. 
I heard about Orange Coast College being there (in Costa Mesa) and I went there 
one afternoon to introduce myself to the football coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Taylor, Orange Coast defensive coordinator, recalled: "Izzy walked in the 
door one day and just introduced himself, and said he wanted to play football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I noticed about him was that he filled up the doorway pretty 
good.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know much about football, but he's a bright guy and he picked up 
the game really fast. He's got a great football body and runs a 4.6-second 40. 
We played him at outside linebacker and at defensive end on pass plays.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had a good freshman season for us in '92, but he really improved last 
season. The coaches voted him a unanimous all-conference player. He'll be a pro 
someday." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Lindsey, USC's defensive coordinator, found it hard to believe that 
Ifeanyi had never put on a football uniform until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obviously very well coached in JC," Lindsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't tell by watching him in practice that he has so little experience. 
He's very success-oriented. He has a great desire to win and to do all the 
little things right.  
</P>
<P>
 "He still has a way to go, because next season he'll see things he's never 
seen before . . . guys the size of Tony Boselli (USC's 6-8, 300-pound 
All-American offensive tackle) blocking him.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a team full of guys like him, you couldn't wait to get to practice 
every day. He's hungry to learn, hungry to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi will play outside linebacker for the Trojans, and will line up as a 
defensive end on pass plays, Lindsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 And he will wear a special linebacker's number, 55. That was Junior Seau's 
number in 1988 and '89, and it was also worn by departing senior linebacker 
Willie McGinest. 
</P>
<P>
 In spring drills, Lindsey said, Ifeanyi's pass rushing has been superior to 
his defending against the run. 
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson won't declare Ifeanyi a starter yet, but the Trojan coach said: 
"He plays hard and he can really move. He'll play a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi said Robinson gets high marks for patience, adding: "I was very 
nervous when practice started, because I know so much is expected of me.  
</P>
<P>
 "But Coach Robinson made me feel much better when he came up to me the first 
day and said: 'Go ahead and just play. And don't be afraid to make mistakes.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Lindsey told me to learn all the little things first, like lining up in 
the right place. And not to try and make the big play every time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Ifeanyi might be able to provide more to USC than his own talent 
in his new sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a "little" brother, back home in Nigeria. Seems he plays basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 19 and 6-4 when I left home, and my little brother was taller than I 
was," he said. "The last time we played basketball, he beat me." Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC finishes spring drills next Saturday with an 11 a.m. scrimmage. . . . In 
addition to Israel Ifeanyi, Coach John Robinson has expressed satisfaction with 
three other junior college transfers who have practiced all spring -- wide 
receiver Keyshawn Johnson and defensive end Marcus Bonds of West Los Angeles, 
and linebacker Errick Herrin of Mt. San Jacinto.

NORTHRIDGE MAY LAND WASHINGTON TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 University of Washington forward Sam Allen says he is transferring to Cal 
State Northridge, which is news to Matador Coach Pete Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be good news if it happens, but Cassidy has not yet received 
confirmation that it will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that's true," Cassidy said. "But there has to be a release from their 
athletic director to ours, and we haven't received anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a 6-foot-7 forward, averaged 7.1 points and 3.6 rebounds in almost 16 
minutes a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The paperwork is merely a formality, he said. The Sacramento native said he is 
leaving Washington to play closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA rules require athletes who transfer from one Division I school to another 
to sit out a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who retains one season of eligibility, said he will finish the spring 
semester at Washington, then transfer to Northridge and use next season as his 
redshirt year. "I'm going where someone really wants me, and that's always 
good," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen signed with Washington last spring after a standout sophomore season at 
American River College in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen started nine of Washington's 27 games, but his top performance -- a 
17-point, 14-rebound effort in an overtime loss to Montana -- came off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen also played well in the Bay Area. In the Huskies' Pacific 10 opener at 
Stanford, Allen scored 16 points. The next night at Cal, he scored 17 points.

SADDLEBACK TO REINSTATE CROSS-COUNTRY PROGRAMS

 Saddleback College announced Friday that it will reinstate its men's and 
women's cross-country programs this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 John Klink, track and field coach, also will handle cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs were suspended last fall because of financial cutbacks. In 1992, 
the women's team finished fifth in the Orange Empire Conference and the men 
finished seventh.

SLATER PICKS RAMS' 'SWEETENED' OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tackle Jackie Slater, teased by a contract proposal from the Falcons, decided 
Friday to remain with the Rams after the team "sweetened" its one-year offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams offered Slater, who earned $1.365 million last season, a $500,000 
base salary; the Falcons offered $700,000 with an additional $350,000 in 
incentive opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 After it appeared that Slater was leaning toward the Falcons, the Rams added 
an incentive package if he plays more than 50% of the time in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our entire organization is happy to have him back," said John Shaw, Ram 
executive vice president. "It's only fitting that an All-Pro player and 
potential Hall of Famer finish his career where it started." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, who has played 18 years, was in Mississippi visiting relatives and is 
expected to return early next week to sign the one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an agreement in principle with the Rams," said Steve Feldman, an 
Orange County attorney who represents Slater. "It appeared he was headed to the 
Falcons, but the Rams stepped up, sweetened their offer and made it clear they 
wanted him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said the Rams have also reached an agreement on a one-year contract 
with defensive lineman David Rocker, who played in 14 games as a reserve. T.J.

BOEING BETTING 777 WILL BE ITS LUCKY NUMBER; AVIATION: AEROSPACE LEADER UNVEILS 
THE AIRLINER TODAY. THE FIRM SAYS THE PLANE WILL CHANGE THE WAY IT DOES 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They designed it entirely on a computer. It's powered by two engines instead 
of four, which will require rigorous testing for long-haul trips. Hundreds of 
the planes may have to be sold just to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boeing Co. engineers have placed a multibillion-dollar bet that the 
aerospace leader's newest wide-body jet, the 777, will succeed. The unveiling 
of the first 777 today, orchestrated with an invitation-only shindig at a 
Boeing factory complex, will give customers, suppliers and many workers their 
first intimate view of the plane that will take Boeing into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred thousand guests are expected for the rollout of this high-tech 
debutante, which is slightly smaller than Boeing's jumbo 747-400. Its advances 
range from electronic cockpits to user-friendly lavatory seats that don't 
bounce around in turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The 777 introduction comes at an awkward time. Commercial airlines have been 
reeling from years of punishing losses. Boeing itself has slashed production 
and cut thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Boeing's long-term strategists estimate the world's airlines will 
need 12,000 new planes worth $815 billion by 2010, with jets like the 777 
accounting for nearly 40% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing says the 777 has fundamentally changed the way it does business, how it 
designs and builds aircraft, and its relationships with airlines, suppliers and 
employees. Customers such as British Airways and United Airlines say they're so 
pleased with the openness Boeing has shown they now demand similar treatment 
from competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a revolution from one end to the other," said Paul Nisbet, an 
aerospace industry analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen customers have ordered 147 777s and signed options to buy another 108. 
Each costs $116 million to $146 million, depending on interior configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing won't say how much the plane cost to design and build, but outside 
experts estimate a cost of at least $4 billion. Boeing constructed new 
factories and labs to produce the plane. It collaborated with leading 
businesses in Japan, America's high-tech rival, to share the risks of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest risks is whether government regulators will permit the 
twin-engine plane to fly long over-ocean routes. Previously, twin-engine planes 
have had to prove reliability for at least two years in service before such 
permission has been granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing is gambling that it will have such approval when United puts the first 
777 in service by May, 1995. Ron Robinson, 777 chief engineer for test 
integration, said nine airplanes will make a total of 4,820 test flights. The 
maiden flight is this June. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin-engine power is one of the plane's most alluring qualities for buyers. It 
is expected to be far more efficient than four-engine models and less costly to 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane is the first Boeing designed entirely on computer. Except for a few 
critical areas, such as the cockpit and passenger doors, there was no mock-up 
-- the model historically used to make sure parts fit together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, everything came together right where the engineers said 
it's supposed to and everything fit," said Edward Chapin, supervisor for the 
forward body and wing section at the Everett factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but the profit is still in question. Nisbet said Boeing might have 
to deliver 300 planes before it breaks even. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 777s will carry 375 passengers 4,240 miles. A longer-range "B" 
market version, available in December, 1996, will carry 305 passengers up to 
8,490 miles -- 50 miles farther than the 747-400. 
</P>
<P>
 The engines, made by Pratt & Whitney, General Electric and Rolls Royce, are 
the largest ever built -- the GE cowling (the exterior of the engine) is wider 
than a 757 jetliner cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 777 also is Boeing's first "fly-by-wire" aircraft, meaning that electronic 
circuits, not mechanical links, carry commands to the rudder and ailerons. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing began studying a new airplane in 1986 to fill the gap between its 
218-passenger 767-300 and its 420-passenger 747-400. The plane also was an 
attempt to catch up with Airbus Industries' A330-A340 aircraft and McDonnell 
Douglas' MD-11, 300-passenger planes already in development.

RISING RATES HAVE EXPERTS WONDERING; ECONOMY: RECOVERY COULD BE SLOWED TOO 
MUCH, SOME FEAR. CALIFORNIA IS ESPECIALLY AT RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fast-growing U.S. economy appears to have raced into a danger zone in just 
the past few days, with interest rates starting to approach levels that could 
slow housing and other key industries that have propelled the economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the risks may be greatest in California, where mortgage-burdened 
residents are more heavily in debt than Americans overall, according to data 
from the DRI-McGraw Hill consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "California households are going to be more sensitive to rising interest rates 
than households in other parts of the country -- though rising interest rates 
will hurt everywhere," said Richard F. Wertheimer, a DRI economist in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, rates rose once again, worrying the stock market, where the Dow 
Jones industrial average lost 19 points. Long-term interest rates have risen 1 
1/2 percentage points since earlier this year, when the Federal Reserve Board 
started to push rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this isn't going to ruin it for us," said 
Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the rate increase has occurred at a time of ebullient economic 
growth, and most forecasters still expect the state and national economies to 
move forward in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jump in rates has added a sudden element of uncertainty to an 
otherwise upbeat picture. Low interest rates helped fuel a rebound in housing, 
autos and other key industries last year, and high rates imperil that comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our eyes glued to the (data) screen, trying to make heads or tails of 
this thing," said Adrian Sanchez, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If rates stay the same, it probably won't do too much damage," he added. "But 
if they keep going up, my gut sense is that it could -- possibly -- choke off 
the recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Even current levels are high enough to take some of the zip out of an economy 
that has been growing at about 4% in 1994, after a 7% sprint late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many forecasters believe higher rates will shave half a percentage point or 
more off the nation's growth rate later in the year. In addition, the effects 
will be felt in 1995, as well, because it can take nine months or even longer 
before higher interest rates take a measurable toll on the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists expect long-term rates to settle down, given the lack of 
evidence of inflation and the prospect of a further Fed move to tighten rates 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates pinch the economy in a host of ways, pushing up loan costs for 
consumers and business and limiting the benefit of refinancing mortgages, to 
name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, crawling out of its worst recession in six decades, the effect 
might be sharpest for a simple reason: Household debt burdens are substantially 
heavier than for the nation overall. 
</P>
<P>
 By one measure -- total household debt divided by household net worth -- 
California's debt load is 18% heavier than the U.S. average, according to 
DRI-McGraw Hill.  
</P>
<P>
 Because homes in California cost more than average -- 68% higher by some 
estimates -- each percentage point rise in rates is felt more strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 During last October, when 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were available at less 
than 7%, an unusually high 44% of California households could afford a 
median-priced home, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the interest-rate surge. The most recent data show that by the end 
of March, with mortgage rates pushing beyond 8%, the index of affordability had 
slipped to 39% of households. Rates this week averaged 8.47%, the highest in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, history provides some perspective: Back in 1989, before housing prices 
began their plunge, a scant 14% of households could afford the median-priced 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 A new analysis by Salomon Brothers concludes that California has finally 
entered an economic recovery, aided by an "impressive" surge in home sales. A 
key risk factor, according to the report: interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Economic concerns go beyond the Golden State's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like housing was headed for a banner year," said Joel L. Naroff, 
chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp in Philadelphia. "But if mortgage 
rates reach 9% or more, I think it will sharply slow down the housing market -- 
at least compared to what we thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, the spotlight on rising rates may be having some odd 
consequences. Many consumers, for example, are scrambling to deal instead of 
dally, a phenomenon that boosts business rather than hurts it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who were on the fence are now tilting over to buy their houses," 
observed Bill Ruane, a realtor with REMAX in El Segundo, where the inventory of 
unsold houses has fallen to about 26 today -- from 120 more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, interest rates are rising at a time of spirited competition 
among many lenders, a competition that is keeping rates low. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter-point rise in the prime rate, for instance, might be expected to 
affect holders of bank credit cards.  
</P>
<P>
 "But this little blip has not slowed up the rate competition at all," said 
Robert B. McKinley, president of RAM Research Corp., a Frederick, Md., firm 
that tracks the bank card industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For a typical cardholder, with a balance in the $2,000 range, annual expenses 
might go up by about $5, McKinley said. Although rates for some auto loans have 
reportedly risen, the 8% average rate nationally has held steady, according to 
Donald P. Hilty, corporate economist at the Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 55-month payment schedule, the average monthly payment is $321. A rise to 
9% would only push up the monthly payment to $328, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Hilty expect the picture to change much: "The bottom line is, we 
don't see interest rates on car loans increasing much in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 That is largely because Hilty perceives little inflation "at the retail level 
or down the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
 The danger of inflation is a matter of dispute right now. Many economists 
believe the economy cannot expand at rates in excess of 2.5% for a sustained 
period without running into production bottlenecks, labor shortages and related 
price pressures.  
</P>
<P>
 Growth is widely expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Although most Americans enjoy booming economic growth and the improved job 
possibilities it brings, well-heeled investors often take a different view. 
Many on Wall Street -- focused on their bond holdings -- were disheartened by 
the Fed's moves, which they didn't view as tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons interest rates are going up is because the economy is 
stronger than we thought," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic 
forecasting at Georgia State University.  
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of continued economic strength has mounted in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy produced 456,000 payroll jobs in March alone, the biggest gain in 
more than six years. Consumer confidence has rallied and retail sales are 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lyle E. Gramley, a consulting economist with the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
and former Fed governor: "We learned in 1987 that an economy can continue to 
grow if its underpinnings are strong -- even if it has the worst stock market 
crash since 1929."

NEWS ANALYSIS; EXIT HOSOKAWA, CUE BUREAUCRATS; JAPAN'S ECONOMY LIKELY TO 
IMPROVE, BUT NOT TRADE RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY and JAMES FLANIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While it provoked a brief -- and quickly reversed -- plunge on the Tokyo stock 
market Friday, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to resign is widely 
viewed as unlikely to hurt Japan's struggling economy and might even help, many 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's resignation is expected to end a political deadlock, increasing 
chances that a budget will be passed and that economic stimulus measures can 
take effect. Japan's recession -- its worst in the postwar era -- is widely 
expected to end this year, thanks in part to growing exports to an expanding 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer term, however, there are serious questions about whether Japan will 
undertake substantial economic and political reforms no matter who succeeds 
Hosokawa. Without such change, trade relations could worsen with the United 
States and the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, assuming that there is a smooth transition to someone within the ruling 
coalition, such as Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Hosokawa's departure is "not 
necessarily bad news for the economy and stock market," said Kathy Matsui, a 
strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp. "Our economist is saying it's 
actually quite good news that Hosokawa is out." 
</P>
<P>
 At Nomura Securities in New York, Anne Zachara, vice president in charge of 
Japanese equities, concurred, noting that Hosokawa's government was a reform 
coalition dedicated to economic stimulus through income tax cuts and public 
spending as well as some initial steps to open Japan's markets to foreign 
competition. "Those policies are all in place and unlikely to change," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate effect of Hosokawa's departure may be passage of the 
government's budget. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has blocked 
passage of a national budget for the current fiscal year, which began April 1, 
to press its demand that Hosokawa respond to allegations of financial 
improprieties in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers now expect the Liberal Democrats to drop their opposition to 
passage of a budget, which in turn could make available funds for public works 
projects.  
</P>
<P>
 "They got his head," Jeffrey Young, an economic analyst at Salomon Bros. Asia 
Ltd., said in referring to the Liberal Democrats' role in forcing Hosokawa from 
office. "They can't ask for too much." 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that Hosokawa was unable to push through a fiscal stimulus 
package because of political opposition, his departure will help Japan deal 
with its slow economy," said Richard Drobnick, head of an international 
business program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's economy has endured its worst postwar recession during the last three 
years, and its major banks are still saddled with an estimated $250 billion in 
bad loans left over from the giddy 1980s when real estate and Tokyo stock 
prices soared in tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recession, Japan's companies have begun to restructure, although 
not as dramatically as their U.S. counterparts. Major layoffs have not hit the 
big companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, banks have been writing down some loans. And the belief has been 
growing in recent weeks that the recession is near an end. Bank of Japan 
Governor Yasushi Mieno, who has a reputation as a conservative forecaster, said 
this week that "the economy is brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 "Inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring programs have progressed 
steadily," Mieno said. "Exports are recovering due to brighter overseas 
economies led by the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 But that very reliance on exports to the United States indicates that long 
running imbalances in Japan's economy have not been dealt with and could cause 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's departure is likely to increase trade tensions, Japan experts said, 
because it will leave policy controls in the hands of powerful government 
ministries that are opposed to a real opening of Japan's markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing prime minister had been trying to fundamentally change Japan's 
economy by reducing the power of the Ministries of Finance and of International 
Trade and Industry. But he faced determined opposition and his resignation will 
leave "bureaucratic government in power indefinitely," said Chalmers Johnson, 
professor emeritus at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Ministry had already trimmed the size of a Hosokawa tax cut. Its 
foot dragging on economic reform could aggravate tensions with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, it would be better if the ruling coalition selects Hata, the 
apparent front-runner, to be the next prime minister. Hata "is perceived as 
serious about reform, he's got a better domestic base and the U.S. has a lot of 
confidence in him," Young of Salomon Bros. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is that both the ruling coalition and the opposition 
Liberal Democrats would split and that Michio Watanabe, leader of a Liberal 
Democrat faction, would be the next prime minister. Hata and Watanabe, both 
former finance ministers, are well-respected economic policy-makers, said Kenji 
Mizutani, vice president of Tokai Research & Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hata, "there should be a continuation of policies," while Watanabe "may 
change some of the nuances," said Kunio Miyamoto, chief economist at Sumitomo 
Life Research Institute. "But I don't think we have a viable alternative to 
further deregulating our economy and further expanding domestic demand. So the 
substance shouldn't be very different." 
</P>
<P>
 Mizutani added, however, that the overall political situation is likely to 
remain unstable at least until there is a new election that produces a clear 
winner. With so many political parties and factions competing against each 
other, political uncertainty could continue for a year or two, he said. During 
this period, "businessmen will not expect much" in the way of decisive economic 
policies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holley reported from Tokyo and Flanigan from Los Angeles. A Troubled 
Economy... 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has been mired in its worst recession in the postwar era, due in part to 
slowed consumer spending and sluggish demand abroad for Japanese goods. 
Political troubles of now-resigning Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa have not 
helped matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's gross domestic product, quarterly in billions of U.S. dollars: 
$1,757.63 ...but a Reviving Stock Market 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recession and Hosokawa's political troubles, the Japanese stock 
market has rallied from its lows of last November. The comeback is partly just 
a buying response from bargain hunters, but there also has been optimism that 
an economic stimulus package would help pull the economy out of recession.

SAMSUNG TO BUILD MAJOR TV TUBE PLANT IN TIJUANA; TRADE: THE SOUTH KOREAN 
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS GIANT'S PLANNED $100-MILLION FACILITY IS A RESPONSE TO 
NAFTA. IT WILL EMPLOY MORE THAN 1,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samsung, the South Korean consumer electronics giant, will build a 
$100-million plant in Tijuana to make television picture tubes, The Times has 
learned, the biggest example yet of how foreign manufacturers are adapting to 
the new playing field created by the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plant would also be a vote of confidence in the business climate in 
Tijuana, which less than a month ago was the scene of the assassination of 
Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. The plant, expected to 
open early next year, is expected to employ more than 1,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Whiteley-Ross, vice president of the San Diego Economic Development 
Corp., said the Samsung plant would represent "a huge benefit for the San 
Diego-Tijuana community. . . . Suppliers to that facility will add hundreds if 
not thousands of jobs to both sides of the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Samsung operates a huge television assembly plant in Tijuana but, 
like many other Asian manufacturers with plants here, imports most of the 
components from Asia. Now, Samsung and other foreign-based companies have 
decided that they must increase local supplies so their goods can shipped 
duty-free under NAFTA guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Tijuana Mayor Hector Osuna confirmed that Samsung officials 
will unveil plans for a 65-acre manufacturing complex in a meeting at the 
mayor's office next week. The plant is to be built in the El Florido business 
park, about eight miles southeast of downtown Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Samtron, the Samsung unit based in Compton that is heading the 
site selection, did not return telephone calls Friday. Officials at the El 
Florido industrial park also did not return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Diego city officials who asked not to be identified confirmed that 
Samsung had notified the city of its intention to build a plant in Tijuana. 
Real estate sources also confirmed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement call for the abolition 
of most tariffs on goods produced and sold within the U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade 
region over the next 15 years. But those goods have to satisfy "rules of 
origin" that specify a minimum percentage of a product's value consist of raw 
material and labor originating within the trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules have caused an enormous amount of confusion and apprehension among 
Asian manufacturers of consumer electronics, many of which assemble products 
along the border in Mexico with components shipped from the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rules of origin vary greatly from product to product, the NAFTA 
guidelines are specific for television manufacturers: They require that any 
television over 14 inches in size use a picture tube made in North America, 
according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule puts Korean television manufacturers such as Samsung, Gold Star and 
Daiwoo at a disadvantage with Japanese competitors that already make picture 
tubes in North America. Sony and Matsushita, for example, make picture tubes at 
huge plants in San Diego and Tijuana, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Doyle, director of international real estate for Cushman Realty Corp. in 
San Diego, said he is being "inundated" with inquiries from Asian consumer 
manufacturers seeking to expand supply sources to include more U.S. and Mexican 
companies to comply with NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese suppliers are refocusing their investment 
strategies to be closer to Latin American markets," Doyle said. "There was a 
wait-and-see attitude as to the overall impact that NAFTA would have. . . . 
Now, the Asian communities are realizing they can participate on an even 
playing field."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: REGULATORS SHUTTING DOWN GOLDEN STATE BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal thrift regulators decided Friday to close Golden State Bank after 
unsuccessfully trying to sell the tiny savings and loan they seized last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that liquidates failed thrifts, 
said it will begin today to refund the insured portions of $3.6 million that 
depositors have in 200 accounts at the Irvine thrift.Checks will be mailed 
directly to depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35% of that amount is uninsured, which means that depositors will share 
over time in the proceeds from the sale of the thrift's $46.7 million in loans 
and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure is expected to cost taxpayers $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When the thrift opened in Newport Beach in 1984, it was called Westmark 
Savings Bank. It became Sherman Oaks Savings Bank in late 1987, and its new 
owners eventually moved it there with ambitious plans for increasing the 
thrift's size tenfold to at least $300 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the thrift never made an annual profit again.  
</P>
<P>
 It got caught up in financial woes and bankruptcy actions involving its 
primary shareholder, Stanley I. Glickman. After he left, the S&L moved to 
Irvine in 1992 and changed its name again, but it never was able to reopen a 
branch in Orange County.

 Teamsters to Meet With 18 Small Trucking Firms: The union will meet today with 
officials from the companies that want to resume operations after being shut 
down by a nationwide strike.The firms would operate under an interim agreement 
until the strike is settled and a final contract is reached. No negotiations, 
however, are scheduled with the four largest trucking firms hit by the 
three-day-old walkout. The strike involving about 75,000 Teamsters has resulted 
in a few arrests, including those of seven members in Riverside County on 
Thursday. On Friday, sheriff's deputies served union officials with a court 
injunction restricting the number of pickets outside the Consolidated 
Freightways terminal in Mira Loma to 20.

 Borland May Get $50-Million Loan: Borland International Inc., based in Scotts 
Valley, Calif., will get the loan from Novell Inc. if the agreement for the 
Provo, Utah-based company to buy Borland's spreadsheet business runs into 
regulatory problems, according to documents filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Last month, Novell said it would buy WordPerfect Corp. for 
$1.4 billion in stock and pay $145 million in cash for Quattro Pro, Borland's 
spreadsheet business.Borland has said the spreadsheet business sale depends on 
the WordPerfect acquisition going through. In papers filed with the SEC, 
Borland revealed that Novell has promised the struggling business software 
maker a $50-million loan if the spreadsheet sale falls through because of 
antitrust violations or if the SEC forbids the move.

 Boeing to Design New Fighter: The Seattle-based aircraft company and two 
engine makers will design a new fighter plane in an attempt to win a contract 
to produce the jets for the U.S. Marines and Air Force, Boeing said. Boeing is 
teamed on the $32-million project with Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce.The work 
is being done under an agreement announced with the Defense Department's 
Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is expected to decide in 1996 whether 
to develop a prototype based on one of the designs, Boeing officials said. If 
the go-ahead is given, a prototype probably would not fly before 1999, Boeing 
said. Boeing is to come up with a concept for an advanced short takeoff and 
vertical landing fighter, to compete with designs by Lockheed and McDonnell 
Douglas.

 MIT Computer Whiz Indicted: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
electrical engineering and computer sciences student has been indicted for 
allegedly operating a computer bulletin board that gave users around the world 
access to copyright-protected software free on the Internet, authorities said. 
David LaMacchia, 20, was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on charges of 
conspiring to commit wire fraud, resulting in the piracy of an estimated $1 
million in business and entertainment software, the U.S. Attorney in Boston 
said. LaMacchia is accused of using computers at MIT to operate a bulletin 
board known as "cynosure" that enabled Internet users all over the world to

 Ford to Begin Sales of Natural Gas Trucks: The auto maker announced Friday, at 
the Eco Expo in Los Angeles, that it will begin this fall offering, with full 
warranties, natural-gas versions of its F-Series pickup truck.The trucks will 
be modified by outside companies to use the alternative fuel, as well as 
gasoline. Ford said last week that conversion to natural gas could add $3,000 
to $5,000 to the regular price of a vehicle though the exact cost will be set 
by the companies that do the work. The company has not yet determined how many 
of its 500 California dealers will sell and service the trucks.

TEACHER RECOVERING FROM SODA LACED WITH CLEANER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Littlerock High School English teacher who became violently ill after 
drinking a soda that had been laced with cleaning fluid is expected to be 
released from a Palmdale hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Ennis, 32, felt a burning sensation in her throat and started vomiting 
during a class Thursday morning after taking a sip from an open can of soda she 
had placed near an overhead projector, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was immediately taken to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are viewing the incident as a misguided prank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look premeditated," said Sheriff's Lt. Ron Shreve of the Antelope 
Valley station. "We don't think it's an attempted murder." 
</P>
<P>
 The soft drink had been next to the projector near a bottle of cleaning fluid 
for at least two class periods, Shreve said. 
</P>
<P>
 The soda can had the odor of cleaning fluid, according to sheriff's reports.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe a student poured the cleaning fluid into the 
soft drink, but have no suspects. They released no specific information about 
the type of cleaning fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, who has been a teacher at the school for two years, said she isn't sure 
when she will return to the classroom.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what to think," she said Friday from her hospital bed. "I 
love teaching and I truly love all my students." 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis said she normally has a good rapport with students and is often asked to 
work with teen-agers who don't get along well with other instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rough crew, but I really care about them," Ennis said. "Maybe the 
person that did it didn't realize how toxic it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident reflects increasing incidents of violence on area campuses, said 
Antelope Valley Union High School District Trustee Bill Olenick. Evidence of 
the problems also can be seen in expulsions, which have grown from seven in 
1985 to more than 50 in 1989, and amount to 35 already this year, Olenick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have certainly changed," said Olenick, who works as a juvenile 
probation officer. "Some of it is the board is getting tough, but the incidents 
of weapons and violence on campus have risen." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is offering a $200 reward for information about the poisoning, 
Olenick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis was listed in good condition Friday, but was scheduled to stay a second 
night at the hospital for additional testing, according to Cindy Reid, hospital 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Ennis' students have visited her, bearing flowers and expressing 
surprise about the incident, Ennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still care about them," she said. "My feelings about them haven't changed."

ELECTIONS / SAN FERNANDO COUNCIL; EACH VOTE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the little city of San Fernando, where only about 6,000 of the 24,000 
residents are registered to vote, City Council elections are an old-fashioned 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Since elections in the 2.4-square-mile city are usually decided by a few 
hundred votes, candidates comb the streets shaking hands, sharing stories and 
knocking on every door, knowing that each person could make a difference -- 
literally. In 1992, only 1,887 people voted. 
</P>
<P>
 On this year's April 12 ballot, there are eight candidates for three seats on 
the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 Three incumbents, Dan Acuna, Jose Hernandez and Doude Wysbeek, are hoping to 
retain their seats by touting their efforts to rebuild after the Northridge 
earthquake, reroute the ruptured Four Corners oil pipeline and clean up city 
government following the firing of parks Director Jess Margarito in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Five challengers, Joanne Baltierrez, John Becker, Raul Godinez, Ed Guzman and 
Arthur Kay, are hoping that the same emotional issues will bring new blood into 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, the San Fernando City Council could be all Latino for the 
first time -- or the 82% Latino city could lose its Latino council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil pipeline broke in eight places during the Jan. 17 quake, including a 
fracture beside O'Melveny Elementary School that fueled a large fire. That 
sparked the ire of residents, who were unaware that the line ran under the 
school. The City Council has been trying to get the line rerouted but seems to 
have no jurisdiction over the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of Margarito, a popular Latino activist who was fired amid 
allegations that he falsified official documents and misappropriated city 
funds, hangs over the campaign and divides both residents and candidates. Some 
believe the firing is a sign that dirty politics are a fixture in the Mission 
City, while others see it as an indication that the city's old, white power 
structure still exerts considerable influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding after the earthquake is the main political issue in San Fernando, 
however. City officials say that 53 buildings need to be demolished at a cost 
of about $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 DAN ACUNA, who is seeking a third consecutive four-year term, is one of the 
most popular figures in San Fernando politics. Currently the city's mayor, 
Acuna, 53, said that jobs, crime, the pipeline and post-quake rebuilding are 
the major issues facing San Fernando. He thinks the current council is dealing 
with all of them well but feels that the city needs to be more active in state 
and national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of challenges today that we have never faced before," Acuna 
said. "But as a city we are unique in that we're economically sound." 
</P>
<P>
 City activists launched an unsuccessful recall drive against Acuna in 1991, 
citing his history of financial problems, and the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission issued a warning letter to Acuna in 1992 after finding 
that he improperly filed economic-interest statements and misused campaign 
funds, but no punitive action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 JOANNE BALTIERREZ, who once lived on welfare and struggled to support herself 
while getting an education, believes she can bring a unique perspective to the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltierrez, 37, said the two main issues facing San Fernando are literacy 
training and bolstering a business community that was badly shaken by the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel the city needs to develop a plan to retain businesses and 
attract new businesses," said Baltierrez, a social worker. "This is a good 
opportunity for us to lure businesses from surrounding communities to San 
Fernando." 
</P>
<P>
 To help attract economic activity, Baltierrez has suggested waiving business 
fees in the city for one year. She has also proposed the creation of a literacy 
program where local college and high school students can volunteer to help 
others learn to read. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN BECKER isn't flashy. One of two members of San Fernando's Transportation 
and Safety Commission running for the council (the other is Ed Guzman), Becker 
has refused campaign contributions, choosing to run a hit-the-streets campaign 
without a budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the people from the church know who I am," said Becker, a service 
representative for the Automobile Club of Southern California. "Money doesn't 
win votes anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, 42, was appointed by the City Council to the commission in September, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that most people in San Fernando are unaware of key issues facing 
the city and that it is the responsibility of the City Council to keep them 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the City Council is letting residents know when an important 
vote is taking place," he said. "You should don your tennis shoes and let 
people know yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 RAUL GODINEZ says that "good, clean government" is what San Fernando needs 
after the scandal surrounding former parks Director Jess Margarito. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumor is that there was a powerbroker in this town, that if you wanted 
something done, you went to Jess, and we can't have anything like that in San 
Fernando," said Godinez, an engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez, 32, said his engineering background would be an asset in rebuilding 
the city. He believes the disaster has provided an opportunity for San Fernando 
to combat its image problem, and he suggests hiring a public relations 
consultant to help change the way people view the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Orange County and other areas frown when I say I'm from San 
Fernando, and it's not fair at all," he said. "This city has a very rich 
history, a great Police Department, and many other attributes. People just 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 ED GUZMAN does not think the City Council has done a good job of dealing with 
the Four Corners pipeline crisis, spending the public's money, preparing the 
city for an earthquake -- or anything, for that matter, which is why he decided 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "My civic participation spans two decades," said Guzman, a state employment 
representative. "I don't think that the direction the council is taking is good 
for the city. They don't have the energy and they have no vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman, 38, is strongly opposed to the construction of the Pacific Pipeline, a 
proposed oil conduit that would run through San Fernando. The City Council has 
also opposed the second proposed pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my opinion that poor communities are traditionally the chosen sites for 
prisons, pipelines, landfills," he said. "It's not good for the community, it's 
not good for property values, and no one wants to live under a pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
 JOSE HERNANDEZ is running for his second City Council term because there are 
things he "wants to see through," such as creating a more livable environment 
in San Fernando and maintaining the current level of public services without 
raising taxes. Active in Latino affairs, Hernandez also motivated to run 
because after many years without strong representation, Latinos are finally at 
the forefront of San Fernando politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult to get Latinos elected in the 1970s," said Hernandez, 
chairman of Cal State Northridge's urban studies and planning department. 
"Historically, white voters have voted for white candidates, but as the Latino 
population grew, a Latino council became inevitable. I think I am qualified 
because I was a former mayor, I have experience in the Planning Commission and 
I'm a family man." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 63, said he is a strong supporter of youth and senior citizens' 
programs. He said the challenge for the upcoming council will be to balance 
social and economic-development programs with sound fiscal policy. 
</P>
<P>
 ARTHUR KAY sees his council bid as an extension of his work as a teacher, 
businessman, and currently, attorney for the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spent my entire life helping people," said Kay, "and now I want to help 
San Fernando solve its problems."  
</P>
<P>
 Kay, 53, believes the worst problem currently facing San Fernando is the lack 
of hope many of the city's residents feel. He favors development of more arts, 
job-training and mentor programs, and would seek more federal Community 
Development Block Grants to finance the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove he would listen to the public, Kay gave his home telephone number to 
the audience last Wednesday at a City Council candidates forum. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUDE WYSBEEK's political philosophy has been to "give people the maximum 
service for minimum dollars. Money doesn't always get the job done anyway." 
Wysbeek was elected in 1980, lost a reelection bid in 1984 and then was 
appointed to the council to fill a vacant post in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek, 55, said the major issues facing San Fernando are the same issues the 
city faced before the quake: maintaining good yet inexpensive public services, 
such as a strong police force and clean streets. He thinks San Fernando is in a 
unique position to lure businesses to the northeast Valley because it has an 
independent water supply and no utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline, Wysbeek said, is a major issue from an emotional standpoint, but 
is not something the council has jurisdiction over. The best the council can do 
is ask the state fire marshal to force Arco, which owns the pipeline, to 
institute the maximum safety standards -- which the council has already done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people recognize that I don't play games," said Wysbeek, who owns an 
electric motor shop in town. "I'm a no-nonsense person, and I do research 
before I open my mouth about something."

SENTENCE OF DEATH IS SOUGHT FOR PANAH; COURTS: PROSECUTORS SAY MURDER OF NICOLE 
PARKER, 8, DEMANDS MAXIMUM PENALTY. SUSPECT PLEADED INNOCENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Prosecutors announced Friday they will seek the death penalty against Hooman 
Ashkan Panah, the Woodland Hills man accused of abducting and murdering an 
8-year-old girl whose battered body was found in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, 22, has pleaded not guilty to seven charges, including murder, 
kidnaping and sodomy, in the Nov. 20 death of Nicole Parker.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled because I want him dead," said Lori Parker, mother of the 
victim. "If they could fry him next week, I'd push the button." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to seek Panah's execution was made by a committee of senior 
prosecutors, who evaluated the case after reviewing a memo prepared by Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Peter S. Berman. Panah's defense attorney, Robert Sheahen, was 
invited to submit statements, but did not, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen plans to use a psychological defense. "Hooman has a history of 
hospitalization for mental disorders," Sheahen said Friday. "If California 
executes a mentally ill person it would be copying backwater Alabama, currently 
the only state to impose the death penalty in such cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole's nude body was found in a suitcase hidden in Panah's bedroom closet 
under a pile of clothes. Police made the discovery Nov. 21, one day after 
dozens of volunteers mounted a search for Nicole, who disappeared from the 
courtyard of the Ventura Boulevard apartment complex where both her father and 
Panah lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the presumption all along is this was appropriately a death 
penalty case," said Berman, citing the brutality of the slaying.  
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury also charged Panah with four special circumstance allegations -- 
murder in conjunction with kidnaping, sodomy, child molestation and oral 
copulation -- each of which makes him eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on any one of the special circumstance charges, Panah would face 
execution. The minimum sentence, if he is convicted, is life in prison without 
the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said the most significant factors in deciding to seek the death penalty 
were "the seriousness of the offenses that were committed against the child, 
the brutality of the murder itself (and) the age of the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Panah's case involves no "mitigating factors," or points favorable to the 
defendant, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah is scheduled to appear in court May 2 for a hearing on the results of 
two psychological examinations expected to be conducted later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Records submitted by Sheahen indicate Panah received psychiatric treatment in 
1988, six months after he left his native Iran.  
</P>
<P>
 A note found in Panah's car after the murder indicates he made a half-hearted 
suicide attempt, according to police. In the rambling 10-page document with 
pages apparently smeared with blood from wounds he made to his wrists, Panah 
blamed the killing on unnamed "psychotic, evil and powerful" people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reviewed all of the medical reports that are available to date, and 
we don't quite interpret the results of those reports the same as the defense 
has done publicly," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 While refusing to discuss specific facts related to Panah's psychological 
condition, Berman acknowledged certain factors may someday be revealed that 
could persuade prosecutors to drop their quest for Panah's execution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to this point, there have been no circumstances that we have found that 
would warrant a disposition (settlement) other than the death penalty," Berman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was echoed by the victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will hold one drop of water," Lori Parker said. "Obviously, 
he's sick, but I don't think he's insane."

'THE PROPER SPIRITS'; FIRST BOTTLES OF JAPANESE BEER ROLL OFF VALLEY LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the ceremonial tossing of rice by a Shinto priest, the first Japanese 
beer ever manufactured in the United States for large-scale sale in Japan 
rolled off the assembly lines at the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch plant, opening the 
door to expanding trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The new product, Kirin Ice Beer, came off the line at a rate of 2,000 cans per 
minute after being blessed by the Rev. Alfred Y. Tsuyuki, Shinto priest of the 
Konko Church of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ceremony filled with the proper spirits," said Tsuyuki, who said the 
practice of blessing beer at the start of manufacturing is regularly done in 
Japan to purify the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Anheuser-Busch officials, who said it was the first time their beer had been 
blessed, were more excited about being the first United States brewery to 
manufacture a Japanese beer for export to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the big win -- trade and jobs for people who make the beer," said 
Stephen J. Burrows, president and chief operating officer of Anheuser-Busch 
International Inc., which is manufacturing Kirin Ice Beer for Kirin Brewery Co. 
Ltd. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first trial in the history of the Japanese beer industry to ask 
an American brewer to produce a Japanese brand and export it to Japan on a big 
scale," said Kazuhisa Tani, director of international planning for Kirin. "We 
can quickly introduce the beer into the Japanese market without having to 
construct a new brewery." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kirin is the largest beer manufacturer in Japan, Tani said the 
company wanted to avail itself of Anheuser-Busch's exclusive ice-brewing 
technique to manufacture the beer. Last year, the two companies established a 
joint venture in Japan called Budweiser Japan Company Ltd., which markets and 
sells Budweiser in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Burrows, 99,360,000 cans of beer will be sent to Japan by May. 
</P>
<P>
 Anheuser-Busch officials said no new jobs will be created to produce the 
initial batch, but industry experts were optimistic that it could mean more job 
security and more hiring if the venture is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, imported beer only represents 2% of market sales in Japan. Tani 
said he believes this project will triple that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the brewing industry, this is quite a remarkable transaction," said 
Robert S. Weinberg, president of R. S. Weinberg and Associates in St. Louis, an 
independent analyst for the beer industry. "In the long run, it could create 
significantly more jobs if it is the first of many ventures." 
</P>
<P>
 If Friday's beer blessing was any indication, the beer could do very well. 
Even Shinto priest Tsuyuki could not wait to get his robe off and grab a cold 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of the biggest patrons," he said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FIRM PUTS THE FOCUS ON HISPANIC MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The key to successful global marketing is to first understand ethnic 
communities at home -- at least that's the way Carlos E. Garcia sees things. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we learn how to deal with different cultures right here, it will make 
looking across other borders much easier," Garcia said. "That's one of the 
biggest hidden benefits of dealing with a Hispanic market." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia should know. He's the president of Garcia Research Associates, a full 
service marketing research firm located in Burbank.  
</P>
<P>
 Founded four years ago, Garcia Research has found that there is a definite 
need for the company's services in Southern California and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 As more and more businesses "wake up and see what was always there: a vibrant 
and growing Hispanic market," they are turning to companies like Garcia 
Research for help in understanding that market, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company conducts focus groups, does creative concept testing, one-on-one 
interviews, quantitative surveys, attitude and usage studies and helps clients 
determine the effectiveness of advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the company has developed a local and national clientele that 
includes companies such as Kodak and Mission Foods, said Vice President 
Alejandro Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of running focus groups and phone interviews will be a lot easier 
thanks to a motion passed by the Burbank Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency recently approved a $20,000 building rehabilitation loan that will 
enable the firm to create a focus facility, where people will gather to test 
and comment on products, and a center to conduct interviews. The company 
intends to hire 50 part-time employees who will conduct interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The climate for businesses in Burbank has been a welcome change for the 
company, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, Garcia Research moved to Burbank from North Hollywood to escape 
Los Angeles' "punitive and unreasonable business tax." 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank has a much more favorable business environment," Garcia said. "We 
moved here before we knew about the possibility of rehabilitation loans. That 
was a pleasant surprise."  
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Tague, assistant executive director of the Burbank Redevelopment 
Agency recommended that the agency approve the loan agreement, arguing that the 
city would receive 50 new jobs if the company expanded. The agreement is 
consistent with the aims of the city's Economic Incentive Zone, which assists 
small businesses that wish to move to and expand in Burbank, Tague wrote in a 
report to the city manager. JOCELYN STEWART

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MOTEL CLOSED, BUT NEIGHBORS STILL CONCERNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the outside, it looks like a victory for a community besieged by crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Boarded-up windows and a chain-link fence surround the Chateau Motel, a Van 
Nuys inn that was the target of a months-long anti-prostitution battle by 
residents, police and City Councilman Marvin Braude.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's the inside of the closed motel that worries residents now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned that vagrants, drug dealers and prostitutes will inhabit 
these rooms," said Romana Catton, a neighborhood watch activist. "I've already 
seen vagrants sitting outside it like they were the king of the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 The operating status of the 36-unit motel is unclear. A sign on the office 
door says "Closed for Repairs." The owners, identified by city records as Jin 
Chan Yang and Guey Dan Hwu, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, homeowners are pleading with city officials to stop a motel they 
once branded as a magnet for petty crime from becoming the free-rent home of 
hustlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten a few calls so far from people wondering if there's a way to seal 
off access to the property," said city zoning Administrator Dan Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Green set more than two dozen operating conditions for the Chateau 
and four other Sepulveda Boulevard motels after deeming them public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to meet the conditions, which included hiring private security, could 
allow the city to close the properties within six months, Green said. The 
Chateau was the only one of the five motels that did not appeal Green's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are monitoring for criminals trying to conduct business on 
the vacant property. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a concern," Van Nuys Officer Joe Losorelli said. Although he has 
cleared a few vagrants off the property, he welcomes the change. "I'm just glad 
they closed it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ross, owner of a locksmith store across the street, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a daily activity dealing with the prostitutes all the time," said 
Ross, who said the women would come out of the motel and approach customers in 
front of his store. "It's better now." JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DISNEY CARTOON CELS TO BE SOLD AT AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 300 animation cels from classic Walt Disney Studios cartoons as well 
as some other rare art -- worth about $2 million -- will be put up for auction 
Sunday by collector Howard Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some first-rate pieces from a number of very important Disney 
films," Lowery said. "But what's really unique is some of the works from the 
more obscure cartoons." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the auction -- which will likely draw many people who come to 
watch instead of buy -- are four animated cels by Ub Iwerks, a cartoonist who 
was the co-creator of Mickey Mouse with Walt Disney.  
</P>
<P>
 The works on auction are from cartoons he produced from an independent studio 
he ran for 10 years after he left Disney in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Balloon land," by Iwerks will be one of the works on auction, as well as some 
rare originals from MGM's Tom and Jerry cartoons from the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to see the work from some of the smaller studios," said 
Lowery, who has been collecting and auctioning cartoon art -- some of it 
rescued from the trash can -- for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been holding regular auctions in Burbank since December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction on Sunday will include animated cels from several Disney movies 
such as "Plane Crazy," from 1928 at a value of about $5,000; "Pinocchio" from 
1940, valued at $20,000; "Fantasia" from 1940, valued at $10,000, and "Bambi" 
from 1941, valued at $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lowery's favorites is a frame of the wicked queen in the 1937 Disney 
film "Snow White," which will probably sell for about $10,000. It was sold by 
the studio in the 1940s for about $100, Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio had sold some of its cartoon art through a marketing program 
between 1939 and 1946. But much of the art had been thrown out after the movies 
were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction will be from 1 to 5 p.m. Sunday at Burbank Hilton Hotel on 
Hollywood Way. A preview of the work will be available at Lowery's gallery 
today from 9 a.m. to noon at 3818 W. Magnolia in Burbank. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; 'HAZMOBILE' SERVICE EXPANDS ITS STOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A citywide hazardous waste collection program that uses a truck to pick up 
unwanted household chemicals has been expanded to include Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck and its three trailers -- dubbed a "Hazmobile" -- give residents the 
opportunity to recycle or safely discard such chemicals as paint, motor oil, 
antifreeze, furniture polish and insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck will stop to pick up waste several days each month at the Sylmar 
Square Shopping Center. The Sylmar stop is the only one in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley, and the service is available to all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a drive-through system," said Jackie David, spokeswoman for the Los 
Angeles Bureau of Sanitation. "You give your keys to the Hazmobile workers; 
they open your trunk and take your waste."  
</P>
<P>
 The city started the Hazmobile program in February after residents complained 
that the previous method of collection, the monthly "Roundup" program, was 
inconvenient, since people often had to wait in line for hours to dispose of 
toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Northeast Valley residents interested in disposing of their hazardous waste 
can visit the Hazmobile today, Saturday or April 14, 15 and 16 between 9 a.m. 
and 1 p.m. Residents must call the Hazmobile hot line, 1 (800) 98-TOXIC, to 
schedule an appointment. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: JAZZ DANCE MASTER STEPS OUT OF L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the few remaining jazz dance masters in the Los Angeles area left town 
last week, saying that changes in the dance world have made it difficult for 
him to teach jazz dance the way it should be taught -- in the classical 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Bennett has been playing music since he was a 9-year-old strumming songs 
like "Ain't She Sweet" on a ukulele for passers-by on the streets of New York, 
where he was born. He played prominent roles in the Broadway productions of "A 
Chorus Line" and "West Side Story." A Southern California transplant starting 
from the late 1960s, the 51-year-old dance instructor counts among his students 
actresses Sally Field, Ann-Margret and Lesley Ann Warren. Bennett fought the 
currently popular hip hop and street dance styles, which he disdains as 
undisciplined -- and paid the price. Unable to attract the number of serious 
dancers necessary to effectively run Studio F, the dance studio he co-owned in 
North Hollywood, the former Sherman Oaks resident decided to teach in a reduced 
capacity elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not a man who would compromise his standards just to fit in with the 
popular mode of the day," student Joan Solari said. "If he was starting out as 
an opera singer he wouldn't sing rap because it was fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bennett -- who taught dance in Los Angeles for nearly 25 years -- 
taught his last dance class at Studio F.  
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later, Bennett was on the road to the scenic city of Redding in 
Shasta County, where he plans to live and teach master classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Close associates describe him as a demanding teacher and a perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemarie Rand, co-owner of Studio F, calls Bennett a complex man who has 
mellowed since the days when he threw chairs when a class wasn't going the way 
he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his gifted way, he can be a little cruel," Rand said. "When he gets angry 
or displeased it hurts emotionally. He's sometimes very intolerant."  
</P>
<P>
 Born in Queens, N. Y., Bennett began dance lessons at the age of 2 1/2. After 
studying ballet and tap at a local dance school throughout grade school and 
middle school, the dancer was accepted into the school made famous by the 
movie, "Fame" -- the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan -- and was 
thrown out in 1959, his junior year, for auditioning for a part in "West Side 
Story" -- a violation of school policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, after spending a few months in a regular high school, from which 
he never graduated, he finally got to dance and act in the acclaimed Jerome 
Robbins musical, in the role of a gang member. In the early and mid-60s, 
Bennett studied with jazz dance legend Matt Mattox, a protege of Jack Cole, one 
of the greatest influences on his dancing career. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Los Angeles in 1969, and got his first teaching job in California 
at the American School of Dance in Hollywood. He taught at two other dance 
schools before opening Studio F with Rosemarie Rand in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's mettle was also tested by the bumpy waters in life's path. A 
wrenching car accident in 1967 ultimately sidelined his professional dancing 
career for nine years. He battled alcohol and drug addiction, which he 
successfully overcame after a 30-day stay in an Orange County treatment center 
in 1983. Two marriages ended in divorce -- the second resulted in a son, 
Morgan, now 20 -- before he found his current partner, physical fitness trainer 
Liz Sibert. 
</P>
<P>
 Former students and an ex-business partner say the departure of Bennett -- who 
has choreographed dance numbers for jazz artist Chuck Mangione and taught 
Vincent Paterson, choreographer for one of Madonna's concert tours -- leaves a 
gaping void in the Los Angeles dance scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so few masters really left," Rand said. "He certainly is one of 
them. There are probably three or four left. He's a classicist. He's not the 
Michael Jackson type. Unfortunately, there's not much outlet for that kind of 
dance anymore." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: HIDDEN HILLS; COUNCIL CHALLENGERS WANT MORE PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two challengers for seats on the Hidden Hills City Council said they would try 
to increase sheriff's patrols and emergency preparations if elected next 
Tuesday in the upscale, bucolic town of about 500 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of a sleepy political race for three council seats, businessmen 
Stuart Siegel and Monty Fisher said they would change little about the tiny 
city's policies except to expand, where possible, security and preparations for 
any disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would ask the county and the state for emergency materials, such as radios, 
generators and cots and things," said Siegel, whose business operates indoor 
swap meets. "We would like to get more sheriff's patrols too." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel said he was unsure how to fit more security into the city's 
$1.2-million budget, but suggested asking the state for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel, 49, is serving his second term as a board member of the Hidden Hills 
Community Assn., which maintains the streets and most of the sparse city 
facilities. He moved to Hidden Hills in 1989, and lives with his wife, Peggi, 
and three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, 55, owns a heating, air conditioning and refrigeration company, and 
has lived in Hidden Hills with his wife, Teri, since 1979. He served as a board 
member of the Community Assn. until last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said he would "concentrate more" on emergency services and 
security, Fisher had no complaints about the current council. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the guys running are friends and neighbors," Fisher said. "Stuart and I 
thought we have good experience, and we could be of good use on the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Politics in the enclave of ranch-style homes have been relatively quiet since 
the overwhelming defeat in 1990 of three council members who favored a 
lower-cost housing project on the city's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of their replacements -- Mayor David Stanley and Councilman Howard Klein 
-- are running for reelection Tuesday. The other seat up for grabs was held by 
Susan Norris Porcaro who moved out of town last year. James Cohen, her 
appointed replacement, is running for his council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley, 42, said in his campaign statement that he is proud to be part of a 
"respectful, responsive and supportive new government" that emerged after the 
defeat of the "patronizing, non-representative, threatening government" that 
preceded him. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein also touted his role in stopping development, as well as getting a 
$7-million flood drain paid for by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have an open City Council working with the homeowners together for the 
first time, trying to make Hidden Hills a place we all can be proud and safe 
living in," he said in his campaign statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, an attorney specializing in real estate and business, said his 
professional expertise is important to running a city, even one as small as 
Hidden Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that it is vital that this city, with a budget in excess of $1.25 
million and confronted with complex issues, be guided by a professional 
manager." KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TRIP IS INTENDED TO BOOST UNDERSTANDING

<P>
 In November, a group of Ethiopian Israeli teen-agers visited Los Angeles as 
part of an Anti-Defamation League program to foster cross-cultural 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nine African American and Latino high school students, three from the San 
Fernando Valley, are heading to Israel for a reunion with their counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-day excursion beginning Sunday is part of a program called "Children of 
the Dream" created in 1992 by the ADL to counteract tensions between African 
Americans and American Jews. By educating students about the persecution of 
Ethiopian Jews, the program directors hoped to dispel stereotypes among 
American students. The Israeli students who visited in November shared their 
experiences of discrimination with Los Angeles Unified School District 
students, many of whom had similar stories. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the students heading to Israel Sunday -- Ta'Lease Cleveland of Canoga 
Park -- said she felt great respect for the Israeli students after hearing them 
tell of the religious persecution they faced in Ethiopia and the hardships they 
endured to flee to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major problem we have with racism is that people are ignorant of other 
cultures," said Ta'Lease, who attends the Bravo Medical Magnet school in Los 
Angeles. "If more people could appreciate other cultures, we would live in 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Ramos, a senior at North Hollywood High School, and Tamara Brazill, a 
senior at Kennedy High School, will also represent the Valley on the trip.  
</P>
<P>
 The ADL raised about $70,000 to pay for three trips, including two groups of 
Ethiopian Israelis visiting Los Angeles, and the group of Americans who are 
traveling to Israel. The program has already expanded to other states, but this 
will be the first group of Americans to travel to Israel as part of it. 
According to the ADL, the need for such programs is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot take for granted that a multitude of ethnic and religious groups 
can coexist without positive programming," said Marjorie Green, an education 
director for ADL. "We need all kinds of proactive missions and educational 
programs to pave the way for a community where we value differences." SUSAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NOW CHAPTER BACKS BID TO RECALL ROBERTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley/northeast Los Angeles branch of the National 
Organization for Women has endorsed the recall of state Sen. David A. Roberti, 
citing his record on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many reasons we dislike him, primarily his anti-choice stand," said 
Linda McCabe, the chapter's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 While the members of NOW have mixed feelings about gun control -- the central 
issue in the Roberti recall campaign -- they are strongly pro-choice. NOW 
believes that the Van Nuys Democrat's record shows him to be an opponent of 
abortion, even though he claims to be a moderate.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the chapter has endorsed the Roberti recall campaign, NOW has refused 
to support any of the candidates vying to replace him for the remainder of his 
term, McCabe said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; CHILDREN SOUGHT FOR HEALTH CARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills nonprofit group is seeking children in the San Fernando 
Valley to benefit from premium-free health care paid for by a recent $500,000 
donation it received. 
</P>
<P>
 The CaliforniaKids Healthcare Foundation provides primary and preventive 
health care for uninsured children whose working parents earn too much to 
qualify for state-assisted programs but not enough to afford private medical 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides routine physical exams, immunizations, laboratory tests, 
emergency medical care and other services, spokeswoman Cathy Wolfolk said. The 
only cost to patients is a $5 fee payable to the health care provider, Wolfolk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $500,000 donation from Blue Cross of California in March allowed the 
foundation to expand its search for clients, Wolfolk said. The program was 
started in Los Angeles County in 1992 and has more than 1,000 children 
enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, a child must be a California resident between the ages of 2 and 
18, not be eligible for coverage under any federal or state health benefit 
plan, and not be enrolled under any private health care contract. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or an enrollment application, call 1-800-374-4KID. JEFF

FORMER CALABASAS TEACHER ARRESTED ON SEX CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Calabasas High School teacher, wanted on 30 counts of having sex with 
a 17-year-old student, was arrested near Seattle on Tuesday when he applied for 
a Washington state teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 The California warrant for the arrest of Brian McNamara, 37, issued in March, 
was discovered in a routine fingerprint and background check, and he was taken 
into custody at his apartment in Issaquah, Wash., east of Seattle, said Deputy 
Dave Robinson of the King County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a tip that he might be in the area," Robinson said. "When he was 
fingerprinted and we ran his record, he was easy to find." 
</P>
<P>
 A Calabasas woman, now 18, told police that in 1992 and 1993, during her 
junior and senior years at Calabasas High School, McNamara repeatedly had sex 
with her, according to the Los Angeles district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara refused to waive extradition to Los Angeles and extradition 
proceedings will begin soon, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara, a member of the school's science department since September, 1989, 
resigned Aug. 27 for undisclosed reasons, said Bob Fraisse of the Las Virgenes 
Unified School District.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the district is currently in litigation with McNamara but would not 
specify why. The district's lawyer, Bruce Barsook, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, McNamara told police he had been in the area for 
nine months and falsely claimed to be a teacher for the Bellevue School 
District.

SHAKEN TO ACTION; PREPAREDNESS: RESIDENTS OF A PASADENA STREET SET UP A 
SELF-HELP PLAN TO LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an unfortunate fact of life in Southern California: The next major 
earthquake could be named for your town. What do you do if you live in the next 
Northridge? 
</P>
<P>
 If you reside on a particular street in northwest Pasadena, you swing into 
action. You know that block lieutenant Louis Jefferson will make sure that 
someone checks on Selma Stevens, 72, who is partially paralyzed with back 
problems, and her 73-year-old husband, Booker. 
</P>
<P>
 Block captain Henreen Nunley would immediately dispatch an able body to help 
another resident who lives alone and recently had triple-bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Red rags would fly in the yards of houses where someone is injured; first aid 
teams would be dispatched to those houses. A shrill whistle would signal that 
someone is trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Duke and Michael Mims would make the rounds to shut off leaking gas and 
water lines along the street. Emergency supplies could last the residents two 
weeks without any outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to resident Bunny Wilson, she and her neighbors would have a fighting 
chance in a major earthquake. Wilson took one look at the trauma and confusion 
sparked by the Northridge earthquake and realized that the city and county 
could not provide all the needed lifesaving actions. Neighborhoods would have 
to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst can happen," Wilson said. "We think about the worst-case scenario 
and work our way backward. It's as if Los Angeles doesn't exist, that there is 
no fire department, no police department. . . . People are going to have to 
understand that if there is a major earthquake, we are on our own." 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year-old businesswoman and mother sent out flyers and rallied neighbors 
to the first meeting of the Prepared Block Assn. on Jan. 29. Twenty-five 
members of the street's 43 households showed up. Since then, participation has 
grown to more than 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort already has brought unforeseen benefits to this racially mixed 
street. A block of neighbors, who for the most part never knew each other's 
names, have found a new sense of community and caring for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's filling a void in every neighbor's heart -- that they wanted to 
get to know their neighbors but didn't know how," Wilson said. "We have the 
best block in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The block realized that preparing for the worst also meant providing for those 
like Selma Stevens, who might require help getting to safety, and for those who 
might need immediate emergency attention in the critical hours after the quake 
-- when the city is paralyzed with confusion and communications are 
inconsistent.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers inventoried the block's strengths, weaknesses and schedules. 
Residents filled out forms charting household members, daily routines, special 
needs, and talents and tools that could be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Households also plotted the locations of cut-off valves for water, gas and 
electricity. This information was distributed to the eight block lieutenants 
who are responsible for six- to seven-house sections, and the block captain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with this information, the block association now knows who would need 
what, where and when in an emergency situation, and who on the block can get it 
to them. After the earthquake, the block lieutenants are supposed to assess 
damage and report to Nunley, the block captain, by two-way radio. Nunley will 
then dispatch search-and-rescue teams as needed.  
</P>
<P>
 When things stop shaking, and everyone's emergency needs have been met, the 
block has organized a security patrol to keep looters and criminals at bay so 
their "city within a city," can survive intact until more permanent rescue and 
recovery arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ardith Duke, a homemaker with a 3-year-old, said she was the type who would 
scream and run through the house in panic during an earthquake. Now she is a 
block lieutenant. "There's no fear because I'm prepared," Duke said. "Now, you 
just take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Nunley are quick to credit an outsider, Ted Wright, with helping 
the block transform from frightened to prepared. "We would have done what we 
were doing had we not met Ted," Wilson said. "What Ted Wright brought to us is 
expertise."  
</P>
<P>
 Wright is a British-born, self-described "back-yard survivalist." The spry 
71-year-old said he outlasted the Nazi bombings of London by living in a 
back-yard bomb shelter for seven months. The Lancaster resident had been 
preaching preparedness ever since a minor earthquake in 1980 made him realize 
that despite the London Civil Defense Force training he received as a rescue 
volunteer, he was woefully unprepared for a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright applied his domestic survival expertise to earthquakes, writing two 
books on the subject, including "Wright's Complete Disaster Survival Manual," 
published in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright heard about the Prepared Block Assn. after its initial meeting and 
volunteered his help. Wright and Nunley, a resident with 17 years of military 
medical-support experience, worked together to come up with the block's 
disaster response plan. It is organized along a system where members have two 
tiers of responsibility: first to their own household, and then to the block. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wright and Nunley found that few households were ready. Those that had set 
aside emergency supplies for an earthquake often made fundamental mistakes, 
like storing them in hard-to-reach places. 
</P>
<P>
 So the association set quarterly goals for members to secure adequate food, 
water, shelter and first-aid supplies and to find a safe outdoor spot to store 
the items. The association has requested that the name of its street be kept 
secret to discourage theft of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Householders were encouraged to get tents, sleeping bags and outdoor cooking 
gear should their homes become unsafe. "People in Northridge learned by 
experience that you are not going to risk life and limb to go back into a 
damaged house," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright also consulted with households to point out the safe and hazardous 
areas in the house and yard. He provided tips on how to make homes safer by 
securing cabinets, placing glassware at lower levels and bolting heavy 
furnishings to the walls. The Red Cross will provide first aid training at a 
mock drill April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson realizes that her "city within a city" may sound extreme to some, but 
she is undeterred. "The goal of the Prepared Block Association is to make 
earthquake preparation fashionable," Wilson said, "so that people would think 
that it's strange not to be prepared rather than the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 People who want free information about organizing their own block for 
earthquake preparedness can send self-addressed envelope to Prepared Block 
Assn., P.O. Box 2601, Pasadena, Calif. 91102

MAN HOSPITALIZED AFTER SHOOTING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what may be a gang-related incident, shots fired from one car into another 
in Mission Hills Friday seriously injured a Pacoima man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raudel Guardado, 20, remained on life support at Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills. Two men in the car with Guardado, who were not hurt, drove him 
to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Guardado's car stopped at a stop sign at Fox Street and 
Arleta Avenue when a second car pulled up and the driver fired several shots.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not have a motive for the 12:07 a.m. shooting.

MAN DIES OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS

<P>
 A Sherman Oaks man who was found lying on a curb suffering from several 
gunshot wounds died later at a local hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents on the quiet block of 4000 Dixie Canyon Avenue, where 
residents jog and take late night walks, heard shots fired about 12:45 a.m. and 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to name the 29-year-old man until family members are 
notified. Police said he was alive when paramedics arrived and took him to 
North Hollywood Medical Center where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Lowell Hoskins said he and his daughter were watching television when 
shots were fired. They heard a car pull away but saw nothing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have break-ins, but nothing like this before," said Hoskins, who has lived 
in the area for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Caretaker Josephine Koker, who lives near where the body was found, said she 
was awakened by a loud noise and thought it was another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects.

ELECTIONS / 20TH STATE SENATE DISTRICT; LATE DONATIONS FLOW TO ROBERTI AND FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of dollars in political contributions continue to flow to both sides 
of the heated battle over the San Fernando Valley seat held by state Sen. David 
A. Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Late donations pouring into Roberti's campaign coffers since March 26 amount 
to at least $29,350, boosting his election war chest to nearly $700,000. That 
figure is just shy of he $750,000 he has estimated it would take to retain his 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 His last-minute contributions included $5,000 from Arco; $4,100 from the 
California League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and $1,000 
from Philip Morris USA, the tobacco interest. Other contributors included 
attorneys and political action committees for nurses, court reporters and a 
machinists' union. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, the Republican Central Committee of Los Angeles County 
pumped $13,300 of the party's money into printing and distributing mailers 
urging Roberti's recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The county GOP committee also accepted $2,875 from Gun Owners of California, 
which seeks to unseat the Van Nuys Democrat because of his 1989 assault-weapon 
ban. The sum was reported as an in-kind contribution for mailers to Republicans 
in the 20th Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, four groups trying to recall Roberti reported receiving or 
spending a total of nearly $50,000 since March 26 for a last-minute blitz of 
mail advertising. That figure very likely will rise as more contributions 
trickle in before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups reporting their 11th-hour transactions to the secretary of state's 
office include the county Republican committee, Gun Owners of California, the 
Van Nuys-based Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, and Californians 
Against Tax Increases, a statewide government reform advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the five candidates seeking Roberti's seat filed reports of late 
contributions. They are Dolores White of Van Nuys, who won the local GOP 
endorsement and who reported getting $2,000 from the California Voters 
Alliance, and Al Dib, a retired owner of a produce business who said he 
received $3,500 from individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 White has at least $13,091 in her campaign coffers, and Dib has at least 
$24,700. Another challenger, Randy Linkmeyer, has at least $9,508 for his state 
Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, candidates have to file reports disclosing who gave them late 
contributions of $1,000 or more since the last filing deadline, which was March 
26. The notices must be filed within 24 hours of receipt of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Roberti's last-minute contributions of $1,000 or more, none of the $29,350 
came from the San Fernando Valley, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislator, who represented Hollywood for most of his 27-year career 
before winning his Valley seat in 1992, has been criticized for having few 
longtime ties to the community and for accepting money from outside his 
district.

DEBRIS PICKUP PROGRAM IS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Public Works on Friday extended the city's free 
earthquake-debris pickup program until Sept. 30 after residents complained that 
an earlier deadline would not give them enough time to do cleanup work. 
</P>
<P>
 The free service was to have expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing complaints from dozens of angry constituents, Councilwoman Laura 
Chick wrote a letter to the board asking for an extension, said Karen Costine, 
a Chick aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem expressed by callers is that it is becoming harder and harder to 
find licensed contractors who can start immediately," Chick wrote. "Some 
contractors are advising their clients to wait six months until the aftershocks 
have stopped, while others are not willing to commit to begin jobs until summer 
since they are so busy." 
</P>
<P>
 About 40,000 tons of material has been collected by city crews since the 
quake, nearly three-quarters of which has been recycled, according to the 
Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents seeking more information about the service or wishing to make an 
appointment for a pickup should call the Department of Sanitation at (818) 
898-8121, Ext. 78811. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 8 INJURED IN 5-CAR FREEWAY PILEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight people were injured Friday and traffic on the Golden State Freeway was 
backed up for miles after a five-car pileup at the Magic Mountain Parkway exit, 
the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident prompted the closure of two lanes of the Golden State Freeway for 
two hours, CHP Officer Wendy Moore said.At one point, traffic was backed up 
more than three miles. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 11:15 a.m. when the driver of a Toyota 4-Runner, 
who was traveling at the speed limit, rear-ended a Toyota Tercel, which had 
stopped to exit the northbound freeway, Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tercel slammed into a third car, which veered off the freeway and down an 
embankment. The Tercel then struck a fourth vehicle before the Tercel's gas 
tank exploded and set it on fire, Moore said. A fifth car rear-ended the 
4-Runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Scipione, 34, of San Gabriel, the Tercel's driver, suffered minor 
burns trying to get his nieces out of the car, Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 Scipione and Amy Moseley, 28, of Valencia, driver of one of the other 
vehicles, were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. Five 
other occupants of vehicles involved in the accident escaped with minor 
injuries, but did not require hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges were filed in connection with the accident, Moore said. An 
investigation is ongoing.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RITTER RANCH BUILDER SUES COUNCIL; LEONA 
VALLEY: DEVELOPMENT FIRM ACCUSES OFFICIALS OF FRAUD IN THE FIVE-YEAR BATTLE 
OVER THE 7,200-HOME PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The folks planning the 7,200-home Ritter Ranch development have apparently had 
enough. After five years of unrelenting opposition from the Leona Valley Town 
Council and three lawsuits attempting to alter the project, Ritter Park 
Associates is fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 The development company has filed a lawsuit of its own in Los Angeles Superior 
Court against the Town Council and five of its current and former members, 
accusing them of using fraud and deceit in an effort to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks more than $3 million in damages that Ritter Ranch said it has 
suffered as a result of the Town Council's actions plus punitive damages and 
attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This action arises out of defendants' campaign of fraud, deceit, harassment 
and intimidation designed to stop development of the Ritter Ranch project," 
according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those named in the suit say harassment is exactly why it was filed. Town 
Council members believe they have been hit with what is known as a SLAPP suit, 
short for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Goldowitz, an attorney and director of the California Anti-SLAPP Project, 
said the purpose of a SLAPP suit is to squash public participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "To succeed, the filer doesn't expect to win in court," he said. "The purpose 
is to divert and divide and distract, bludgeon into submission an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it doesn't belong in the courts. The purpose of it is to chill." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter Ranch General Manager Peter Wenner declined to comment on the suit, 
saying only, "The lawsuit speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 But after reviewing the 12-page complaint filed Tuesday by Ritter Ranch, 
Goldowitz said he believes it to be a SLAPP suit. Under anti-SLAPP legislation 
that took effect Jan. 1, 1993, he said the Town Council can ask a judge to 
declare the complaint a SLAPP suit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge agrees with the Town Council about the nature of the case, Ritter 
Ranch would have to show there is a probability it would prevail in the court 
or the case is thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 But if quelling the opposition was Ritter Ranch's intent in filing the suit, 
Town Council members said it will not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is still behind this," said Mary Ann Floyd, a former Town 
Council member and one of the five people identified by name in the suit. Floyd 
said the people she has talked to about the lawsuit are "outraged." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit states, "Defendants have engaged in acts of intimidation and 
harassment, have published brochures and advertisements, and have harangued 
local residents with lies and scare tactics about alleged environmental and 
other effects of the Ritter Ranch project." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd said she and the others named in the complaint "unequivocally deny the 
allegations in the suit." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that in two cases, the statements may have been made, but they were 
done so at least two years ago and were based on information that was correct 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done everything by the book," she said. "We have never gotten into 
mudslinging. It has never been our intent to cause the project to go away. The 
council has always stated their only concern is the compatibility of (Ritter 
Ranch) in the Leona Valley area." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Town Council President Bob Mallicoat, also named in 
the complaint, said the suit contains "wild allegations" and that it is 
"frivolous and without merit." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other charges the developer alleges in the suit are that the Town 
Council and the five others named as defendants told residents and others that 
Leona Valley residents would "be assessed a 30-year mortgage to pay for Ritter 
Ranch"; residents' farm animals would be killed by the development; wildlife in 
the area would be harmed, and that the developer's water wells would drain 
those of well-dependent residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Town Council has waged a tireless campaign against Ritter Ranch, seeking, 
among other things, to have residential lot sizes in the Leona Valley portion 
of the project a minimum of 2.5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has filed three lawsuits against Ritter Ranch, all of which were 
decided in the developer's favor. Appeals have been filed in two of the cases 
and the council is still considering whether to file an appeal in the third 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in the past Ritter Ranch officials have said the trio of suits had 
not affected the progress of their development, in the suit filed Tuesday, 
Ritter said that is not so. Delays caused by the lawsuits have cost more than 
$3 million, according to the complaint.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ELECTIONS; 2,000 LEFT OFF THE ROLLS BUT CAN 
STILL VOTE

 More than 2,000 voters in Lancaster and Palmdale were inadvertently left off 
voter rolls, but the mistake will not prevent them from voting in Tuesday's 
local election, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake was made by the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County 
Clerk's office, which supplied a list of the registered voters in Palmdale and 
Lancaster to the respective city clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Ventura, a spokeswoman for the county office, said the voters were 
somehow dropped from the rolls when the registrar's office was preparing an 
Antelope Valley flood and storm district for a measure that will appear on the 
June primary ballot in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of 10 precincts in the north county region were somehow dropped from 
voter lists, affecting about 1,500 voters in Lancaster and 512 in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The error was discovered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters who were left off the roles did not receive sample ballots from the 
city clerks' offices. County officials, the cities' elections consultant and 
the cities were working Friday to get sample ballots to the voters as quickly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lancaster, a group of 40 city employees were sent to the affected area to 
hand-deliver sample ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 The county planned to hand-deliver addressed sample ballots Friday night to 
the post office in Mojave. These should be delivered in Saturday's mail, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample ballots also will be available Monday and Tuesday at the clerks' 
offices in Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale City Clerk Victoria Denham said her office only received about a 
dozen calls from residents who did not receive the sample ballots.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN ARRESTED IN CHARITY CANDY SALES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was no sweet deal for a Lancaster man who was arrested Friday for allegedly 
impersonating a police officer and selling candy he claimed would benefit youth 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say he planned to pocket profits from the candy sales himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bates, 19, was arrested as part of a sting operation by the Antelope 
Valley Sheriff's Station Street Criminal Apprehension Team (SCAT). He was taken 
into custody after he arranged to accept $10,000 worth of chocolate candy he 
had ordered while posing as a police officer, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department said.  
</P>
<P>
 SCAT members made the delivery and arrested Bates on three counts of grand 
theft. He is being held in lieu of $20,000 bail at the Antelope Valley 
Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Bates, who claimed he was helping youth groups with 
fund-raising efforts, had ordered large quantities of chocolate candy and had 
them delivered to the parking lot of a Lancaster apartment complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Bates had previously ordered $3,000 worth of candy from the company and had 
forged a fictitious name on two delivery receipts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said he was keeping the profits from the candy sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "This person was trying to get more donations by impersonating a police 
officer," said Sheriff's Deputy Gil Arce of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities would not give the name of the candy company.

 CHURCH POWER: When the Rev. Tomoji Hirata founded a Buddhist church here 30 
years ago, it was with just a small group of friends. Now Hirata's Orange 
County Buddhist Church in Anaheim has some 900 members. . . . That already 
guarantees a good crowd today and Sunday, when the church -- made up mostly of 
Japanese Americans -- has its annual festival to celebrate Buddha's birthday. 
"We get many non-Buddhists," the minister says. "Many stop by just to learn 
something about our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 BACK TO SCHOOL: You don't have to be enrolled to take advantage of what local 
colleges have to offer. Western State University College of Law in Fullerton, 
for example, today begins what it calls a "mini law school" for consumers, to 
run four Saturdays from 9 to noon. First class: Tax tips. . . . At Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa next Saturday, there'll be a one-day crash course in 
do-it-yourself investigating. Instructor Susan Vaughn, a licensed private 
investigator, says it will teach you "whether your mate is cheating on you." 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT STEP: For years Joan P. Miller has been a volunteer for the local 
American Red Cross chapter. Now she's joined the staff, doing a job she already 
knows a lot about: director in charge of volunteers. The chapter has 5,000 
signed up -- from eighth-graders to a 92-year-old -- and Miller says the office 
gets about 50 new inquiries a week. . . . "We need more, but we're looking for 
people willing to take the training. That way they'll feel more comfortable on 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
 CRYSTAL JUNGLE: If you shop this weekend at Crystal Court in Costa Mesa, don't 
let the orchids, water lilies and turtle ponds throw you. The swanky shopping 
center hasn't been made over into a lush greenhouse. It's a weekend spring 
garden show, with 50 exhibitors on hand, along with gardening expert Pat Welsh, 
who will sign her latest book. . . . The merchants, of course, are interested 
in another kind of green as well -- you'll get free garden tools with $100 
purchases.

 OOOOPS: Somebody made a big mistake, but democracy will survive. It seems more 
than 2,000 voters in Lancaster and Palmdale were left off the rolls, but the 
error was caught and they'll be able to vote in Tuesday's local election. . . . 
County officials and the cities were working Friday to get sample ballots to 
the voters as quickly as possible (B18).

 BEER HISTORY: Who says we are having trade problems with Japan? Certainly 
nobody at the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch plant, and with good reason. That's 
because the first Japanese beer ever manufactured in the U.S. for large-scale 
sale in Japan rolled off the assembly line Friday. . . . The beer was even 
blessed by a Shinto Priest (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 WORD PROBLEM: For years, the massacre of 6 million Jews in World War II has 
been called "the Holocaust." But some scholars argue another word is needed. . 
. . Zev Garber (above), chairman of Jewish studies at Valley College, says its 
literal meaning refers to burnt offerings in ritual sacrifices. "It makes the 6 
million Jews an offering to God, and the priests are the Nazis," he said (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA TO ATLANTA: The Valley, as usual, will send its best high school 
athletes to tonight's Arcadia Invitational track and field meet at Arcadia High 
(C14). . . . Who knows? Today, Arcadia. Tomorrow, Atlanta and the 1996 
Olympics. It's happened before. Olympic medalists Gail Devers, Mike Powell, 
Quincy Watts and Valerie Brisco all competed at the Arcadia meet, which began 
in 1968 without much fanfare. Michael Arkush

STRICT LIMITS SET IN BID TO SAVE SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the western salmon population in steep decline because of the steady 
degradation of its freshwater habitat, a federal agency on Friday adopted the 
strictest limits ever on salmon fishing off the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to ensure that enough salmon survive to perpetuate the species, the 
Pacific Fishery Management Council banned salmon fishing off Washington state 
for the first time and imposed tough limits on commercial and recreational 
fishing off California and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which is responsible for overseeing the West Coast fishing 
industry, said the chief reason for the decline of salmon is the destruction of 
spawning grounds -- in some cases hundreds of miles from the ocean. But the 
agency is powerless to protect salmon except by limiting fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishing is not the primary cause of the decline, and (restricting fishing) is 
not the answer to rebuilding," said Larry Six, executive director of the 
council. "The actions we take here are only a small measure and one that by 
itself will not do the job to restore these stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, the fishing restrictions will go largely unnoticed, because 
salmon farming and the salmon catch in other parts of the world will continue 
to supply California markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision comes nearly two decades after fishermen and 
environmentalists began urging protection of salmon's inland spawning grounds 
and predicting that the West Coast's multimillion-dollar commercial fishery 
would be lost if action was not taken. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the salmon fishing industry from Morro Bay to Eureka is facing 
collapse, with many fishermen predicting that they will be unable to make a 
living from the limited season adopted by the council Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, 13 members of California's congressional delegation urged 
President Clinton to provide emergency aid to fishing communities that have 
been devastated by the decline in salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 And the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees the survival of 
marine species, is considering whether to list the coho salmon as endangered, 
which could lead to changes in water use and logging practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year a dwindling number of salmon are hatched in freshwater streams 
throughout the West. The young fish, or fry, swim downstream to the ocean. 
Several years later, at the end of their lives, the salmon return to spawn in 
the same streams in which they hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Pacific Fishery Management Council has concluded that 
salmon are jeopardized primarily by human activities on land: construction of 
hydroelectric dams, diversion of streams and rivers, logging, ranching, mining, 
pollution, road construction and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Dams have blocked the migration of salmon upstream. Gravel beds where the fish 
spawn have been smothered in silt. Diversion of water to agriculture and cities 
has reduced the flow of rivers and caused water temperatures to rise to levels 
that are lethal to salmon eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't keep destroying rivers and forests and have salmon," said Zeke 
Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's 
Assns. "We've been telling them for the past 18 years this was going to happen. 
Now it's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The only major river system producing enough salmon to provide much of a 
fishing season is the Sacramento River, which has been plagued by a dwindling 
salmon population. 
</P>
<P>
 One Sacramento River species -- the winter-run chinook salmon -- is critically 
endangered, but hatcheries on the river have produced enough salmon to allow a 
limited harvest this year outside San Francisco Bay and to the south. As a 
result, recreational fishing will be permitted all season from the Mexican 
border to Point Arena, 100 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sacramento's not at the peak of production by any means, but compared to 
the disastrous situation we find elsewhere, it's about the only bright spot," 
Six said.  
</P>
<P>
 The council's action, which is expected to be ratified by Secretary of 
Commerce Ron Brown, for the first time prohibits commercial fishing for coho or 
silver salmon anywhere off the West Coast. It also restricts fishing for other 
types of salmon to a much shorter season to protect fish that are returning to 
spawn. The restrictions vary along different sections of the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the northern coast of California, for example, commercial salmon fishing 
is restricted to August and September. South of San Francisco, such salmon 
fishing is prohibited during most of June and all of July -- the heart of the 
season for some fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 State governments usually model their fishing restrictions for inland waters 
on the council's action. As a result, restrictions on river fishing are likely 
to match the coastal limits. 
</P>
<P>
 During Friday's hearing, commercial and recreational fishermen appealed for 
action to save the salmon habitat and to preserve as much of this year's salmon 
season as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Novak, representing fishermen from Morro Bay, said this year's 
restrictions will cut their commercial harvest in half, putting many of the 100 
boats harbored there out of business. "It's going to be economic disaster," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ft. Bragg's Noyo Harbor, fishermen anticipating the restrictions have been 
selling off seaworthy boats for as little as $1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishermen are struggling just as surely as the salmon are struggling for 
survival," Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah) told the council.

MISSISSIPPI OKS SCHOOL PRAYERS LED BY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students will be allowed to pray at school as long as the worshiping is 
something they initiate, under a bill signed Friday by Gov. Kirk Fordice. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was introduced after a Jackson school principal was suspended 
for allowing students to read prayers over the intercom. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board initially fired Wingfield High School Principal Bishop Knox 
last November, saying he had violated district policy. The board later gave 
Knox his job back but suspended him until the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill expands a 1979 state law allowing voluntary prayer in classrooms. It 
allows "non-sectarian and non-proselytizing voluntary benedictions, invocations 
or prayers, which are initiated and given by a student volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 The prayers may be said at school or at school-sanctioned events. 
</P>
<P>
 In debate during the closing days of the 1994 legislative session, Democratic 
state Sen. Travis Little said the bill was a response to "liberal decisions" by 
the U.S. Supreme Court about prayer in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure say the state should not be forcing religion into the 
classrooms and that the law should deal only with prayer at events students are 
not required to attend, such as graduations, assemblies and sporting contests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court declared school prayer unconstitutional in 1963, but a 1992 
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision held that voluntary, student-led and 
student-initiated prayers are constitutional.

 A key Assembly committee has narrowly approved legislation to make parents 
subject to criminal prosecution if a child under the age of 18 removes a gun 
from the home and takes it to school. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-3 vote, the minimum required for approval, sent the bill (AB 2517) by 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) from the Public Safety Committee to the 
Ways and Means Committee for additional screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said that 1990 national statistics, the most recent available, showed 
that children and guns were involved in 2,874 murders, 1,476 suicides and 541 
accidental shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am tired of the almost daily litany of children being maimed or killed by 
gunfire, in shootings and accidents that could have been prevented if all gun 
owners stored their firearms safely," the Democratic candidate for attorney 
general said.

RALLY TURNS INTO LOVE FEAST FOR CLINTON; REFORM: PRESIDENT GETS A LIFT AT 
ROUSING RECEPTION IN MINNEAPOLIS, A DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLD. HE GIVES SPIRITED 
RENDITION OF HIS HEALTH CARE STUMP SPEECH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having lived through several tough weeks in Washington and some testy 
encounters with members of the public in televised town meetings, President 
Clinton appeared to revive his spirits Friday at an enthusiastic rally in one 
of his party's most reliable strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before a crowd of several thousand cheering supporters at a health 
care rally here, Clinton beamed at the welcome sound of applause and, after a 
spirited rendition of his stump speech, lingered for more than half an hour 
shaking hands, waving and basking in the crowd's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota in general -- and Minneapolis in particular -- has a long tradition 
of liberal activism. The state was one of Clinton's strongest in the 1992 
election and that support was on clear display as he moved around the Twin 
Cities Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As is generally the case, some demonstrators greeted Clinton's arrival but 
they were primarily protesters from the left -- one group, for example, that 
stood outside his hotel when he arrived late Thursday night demanding U.S. 
action on behalf of human rights in Tibet. By contrast, when Clinton visited 
Topeka, Kan., Thursday, he was picketed by an anti-gay-rights group bearing 
large placards denouncing him as the "Whitewater President." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton clearly warmed to the supportive audience and pulled out all the 
rhetorical stops in advocating his plan as he spoke to the crowd, which was 
organized by the Minnesota Nurse's Assn. Here, as elsewhere, nurses' 
organizations have been among Clinton's most supportive groups, in part because 
his plan would eliminate rules in many states, backed by doctors, that sharply 
limit the types of medical care nurses can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for us to come together across regional and racial and 
income and party lines to do something that is good for America. All of our 
jobs are at stake, all of our health care is at stake, our children are at 
stake, our parents are at stake," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Washington this may look like a partisan issue, but out here on Main 
Street, it isn't," Clinton said. "Democrats and Republicans and Independents 
all get sick. They all lose their jobs. They all lose their health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's visit had a political purpose more pressing than simple enjoyment, 
of course. White House officials hope that the show of support for health 
reform here will help bolster their position with the state's Republican 
senator, Dave Durenberger, a moderate who is one of the strategically crucial 
handful of Republicans who have been willing to consider Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's travels recently have been carefully targeted at key members 
of Congress -- Kansas Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery and GOP Sen. Nancy Landon 
Kassebaum on Thursday -- Durenberger and a handful of House members from the 
northern Midwest Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But although White House officials had hoped that Durenberger would show up 
for the rally and share the podium with Clinton, he stayed away -- a symbol, 
perhaps, of the frustrations Clinton has encountered in trying to entice GOP 
moderates into a health care deal. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Clinton received a loud endorsement from the state's other 
senator, liberal Democrat Paul Wellstone. Wellstone is a leading advocate of a 
proposal to create a government run "single-payer" health care plan similar to 
the one in Canada. Many single-payer supporters around the country consider 
Clinton's effort too conservative because it would continue to rely on 
privately sold health insurance. But Wellstone, himself, left little doubt 
that, in the end, he will support Clinton's plan in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the opportunity of a generation," Wellstone declared to the rally 
here as he introduced Clinton. "Whether it be single payer or all payer or 
what, we agree on one thing -- universal coverage with comprehensive benefits."

 It took more than an hour for officials to find the crew of a freight train 
that had stopped near a crossing, causing the warning gates to descend and 
block traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was stopped about 25 to 30 feet from the crossing while the crew 
took a leisurely dinner break Wednesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor, John R. Larkey, was charged with obstruction of traffic. If 
convicted, he could get up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

CITYSCAPES / BOB POOL: 'AT FIRST I SAID: "NO WAY, IT'S TOO SCARY. I'M NOT 
WALKING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION. WE'LL GET HIT BY A CAR." '; 
PASADENA PEDESTRIANS GET NEW SLANT ON CROWDED CROSSWALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most popular street corners in Pasadena are now X-rated. 
</P>
<P>
 So, naturally, traffic screeches to a halt when people such as Barbara Sanchez 
and Jennifer Mottershaw step off the curb and sashay into the middle of famed 
Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars have to stop. That is because the thoroughfare best known as the route of 
the Rose Parade has been equipped with new crosswalks that allow pedestrians to 
walk diagonally from one corner to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "X" marks the spot at two of the boulevard's intersections -- at DeLacey and 
Raymond avenues -- where "scramble crossings" were installed last week. Freshly 
painted lines on the pavement and signs on each corner alert pedestrians to 
their newfound freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The crosswalks spring to life every 90 seconds. Eastbound and westbound 
motorists get the first 30 seconds. Northbound and southbound motorists get the 
next 30 seconds. And pedestrians walking north, south, east, west, northeast, 
northwest, southeast and southwest get the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers and pedestrians alike say the new system is taking some getting used 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I said: 'No way, it's too scary. I'm not walking through the middle 
of an intersection. We'll get hit by a car,' " said Sanchez, a teacher from 
Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Mottershaw, a teacher from Riverside, talked her into it. "I let 
her go first so I could call 911 if necessary," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Brandon Stanislawski had a pensive look as he waited to cross 
from the northeast corner of 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado and DeLacey to the southwest. "This is my first time. I don't know 
what's going to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials say the crosswalks were installed at the request of 
business owners in the busy Old Pasadena area. Their sidewalks are jammed at 
noontime and on Friday and Saturday nights by throngs of shoppers and diners. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, people were kind of confused about what to do," said Minder 
Day, a Pasadena traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 City traffic operations chief Daryl Taavola acknowledged that the automobile 
traffic flow along Colorado "does get sacrificed a little" as pedestrians seize 
the intersections. But drivers may be compensated by faster turns to and from 
the boulevard during the minute that pedestrians are banned from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena's new crosswalks are patterned after X-crossings created in 1986 in 
Beverly Hills when officials there became alarmed at accidents between cars and 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, encounters between cars and people have been reduced about 30% at 
the eight intersections equipped with X crosswalks, said Bijan Vaziri, Beverly 
Hills' associate traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills leaders based their crosswalks on a system used in Las Vegas. 
And Las Vegas got the crosswalk idea from Denver. That is where pioneering 
traffic engineer Henry Barnes created them in the late 1940s, according to 
Ralph B. Hirsch, chairman of the Philadelphia-based International Federation of 
Pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1950s, the X-crosswalk idea had spread to places such as Baltimore, 
where pedestrians using diagonal crossings where sometimes said to be doing the 
"barn dance." Robert Sleight, executive director of the Tucson-based Walking 
Assn., said the nickname honored Barnes and the square dance pattern of the 
crosswalks. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, the scramble crosswalk made its debut in Los Angeles. Traffic 
engineers installed them at Downtown intersections to handle the huge crowds of 
shoppers and businessmen clogging the area in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were removed in 1958 when shoppers began deserting the city for 
suburban retail areas. Motorists began complaining that they were causing 
delays, said John Fisher, a principal transportation engineer for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can personally remember them as a boy in the mid-'50s in Santa Monica," 
Fisher said Friday. "Back then, they were all the vogue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do Pasadena's new flashing pedestrian lights signal the return of the X-walk 
trend? 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Hoskin, statistics chief for the Illinois-based National Safety Council, 
said traffic engineers pay close attention to intersections because that is 
were 16,000 pedestrians nationwide were hit by cars last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Scramble crosswalks have been phased out of many cities, "but where you do 
have it, it's very effective -- it can reduce accidents by 50%," said Dean 
Childs, director of Traffic Safety Service for the American Automobile Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Fisher, X-crosswalks are beneficial at intersections in which 
high numbers of pedestrians and cars are trying to make turns. There have been 
no recent requests for them in Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaziri said the high volume of through traffic on most streets makes it unwise 
to completely halt traffic and give over major intersections to pedestrians. In 
fact, he said, Beverly Hills initially installed scramble crosswalks at 10 
intersections but had to remove two. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the intersections of Beverly Drive and Brighton Way and 
Beverly Drive and Dayton Way were too busy for the scramble system to work 
without snarling traffic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena traffic engineers say they may install additional X-crossings if the 
experiment is a success. "Now some of the residential areas are asking for 
these too. We'd like to see how these first two come out first, though," Day 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Colorado and DeLacey, Brandon Stanislawski made it across with a smile 
on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez and Mottershaw said the X-walk could change pedestrians' direction for 
the good. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much easier," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much better," Mottershaw agreed.

REUNION OF A LIFETIME; FAMILIES: FOUR SIBLINGS WHO WERE ADOPTED MEET AFTER 
DECADES OF SEPARATION. THEY SWAP STORIES AND FIND SHARED TRAITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't a family reunion, exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 But what do you call it when four grown siblings get together for the first 
time? 
</P>
<P>
 "A meeting, " Jan Fishler ventured. Debbie Fellers, the sister she had met 
only three hours earlier, grappled for another word, then found one. "It's a 
curiosity, " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was indeed a curious day for the two new acquaintances and the brother 
and sister they would meet -- decades after their adoptions by different 
families. The siblings arrived one by one at Debbie's beauty supply store in 
West Hollywood, each time setting off a top-to-bottom search for something 
shared -- the color of the eyes, the side the hair is parted on, the movement 
of the hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The get-together began when Jan walked in. The two sisters looked at one 
another, paused, and started shrieking in recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a hoot to walk in here and see somebody who looks like me," said 
Jan, 44, who lives near Sacramento. Both women had been raised as the only 
child in their adoptive families -- Jan in Ohio, Debbie in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan set the wheels in motion last year on a search for her birth parents. She 
discovered she was one of eight children born to the same mother. "I just 
wanted some information," she said. "I didn't expect to have seven brothers and 
sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 That discovery set off more searching -- aided in part by dogged detective 
work by a newfound brother, Raymond Adamic, 47, a tire store owner who lives 
outside Cleveland. Using birth and adoption records, he made scores of 
fruitless phone calls with only a last name to go on. The final piece fell into 
place last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a comfortable find, though. Debbie's parents had never told her she 
was adopted and for years ducked questions about her birth and her mother's 
pregnancy. Raymond's successful hunt by telephone forced the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie's adoptive mother told her the truth the day after Thanksgiving. "She's 
having a hard time with it," said Debbie, who is 40. She said she planned to 
introduce her newfound siblings to her adoptive mother this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Their other sister, Bridget Disney, a 37-year-old data analyst who traveled 
from Omaha for the mini-reunion, had found Raymond 15 years ago, but they never 
knew their sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, five months and hundreds of hours of phone calls later, the siblings know 
each other as more than acquaintances, if not yet family. They do not know 
birthdays or whether holiday cards were signed with the right or left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 They also know little about their biological mother, now deceased. Her name 
was Jane and she was from Ohio. She gave three girls away. "Our mother kept all 
the boys, but put all the girls up for adoption," Bridget said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan and Debbie were raised Jewish, Bridget as a Catholic. Raymond lived with 
his mother until age 13, then he and four brothers raised themselves, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Raymond's arrival in West Hollywood late Friday afternoon drew them all to the 
sidewalk. The four blocked pedestrians, hugging and sizing each other up. All 
are about the same height -- 5 feet, 5 inches. Debbie and Jan have the same 
angular faces. They also have the same voices. Jan discovered that the first 
time Debbie left a message on her answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter said: 'Mom, why are you leaving yourself a message?' " said Jan, 
a writer and producer of training videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie noticed that they even dressed alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "After being raised as an only child, the concept -- it's like I'm watching 
this really trippy story," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group planned a pizza party with Debbie's husband and children Friday 
night. "We'll probably stay up till all hours of the night, just exchanging 
stories," Debbie said. 
</P>
<P>
 How does one spend a weekend with siblings lost for half a lifetime? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably going to go to the beach tomorrow and get to know each other," 
Jan said hopefully. "Maybe we'll go to Universal Studios."

HIGH DDT LEVELS FORCE EVACUATION OF TWO HOMES; POLLUTION: THE BANNED PESTICIDE 
IS FOUND NEAR TORRANCE IN YARDS CLOSE TO A TOXIC WASTE SITE AND A FORMER 
CHEMICAL PLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Levels of the banned pesticide DDT as much as 45 times higher than what is 
considered safe have been found behind two homes near Torrance, outraging 
residents who said Friday that they have been trying for years to get 
government agencies to pay more attention to toxic substances in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency detected DDT levels of 254 
parts per million in Cynthia Babich's yard on West 204th Street and 606 p.p.m. 
in her next-door neighbor's yard. The agency returned to sample soil two feet 
beneath the surface and found DDT levels of more than 4,500 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were upset when the levels were 254 and 606 p.p.m. ," said Babich, who 
learned on Friday about the higher DDT levels just outside her fence. "Now 
we're scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
 She and a neighbor will be relocated for two weeks while the contaminated soil 
is removed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA considers DDT levels of 100 p.p.m. safe; concentrations of 260 p.p.m. 
require emergency action. The highest concentration found near Torrance is more 
than 17 times higher than emergency levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich's home is a few hundred yards from the Del Amo toxic waste site -- once 
a rubber manufacturing plant -- and about a quarter of a mile from the old 
Montrose Chemical Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Babich's neighborhood, an unincorporated county area east of 
Torrance, have long complained of stubborn skin rashes, difficulty in 
breathing, hair loss and constant headaches, among other maladies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come to meetings with reports of rashes that won't go away," Babich 
said. "Headaches are so common that we sometimes forget to report them." 
</P>
<P>
 After a rainfall, she said, the neighborhood is plagued by strange smells, 
ranging from the odor of rotten eggs to petroleum to mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marla Frame, who lives two doors from one of the contaminated yards, said that 
she had asked to be relocated during the excavation, but that her request was 
denied.  
</P>
<P>
 EPA spokeswoman Virginia Donohue said there is no health or safety reason to 
move other residents. The families will be moved so that they will not have to 
contend with a bulldozer working in their yards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich said residents began pressuring environmental officials to conduct soil 
sampling more than a year ago, but the first tests were not done until last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an environmental justice issue here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Low-income (people) and people of color are not treated justly. We're not 
taking this anymore." She said her neighborhood is about 75% Latino, and many 
people there speak little English. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials in San Francisco said Friday that beginning next week, about 500 
cubic yards of contaminated soil will be removed from the two yards, placed in 
secure containers and taken to a waste disposal facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will excavate these two yards until they are clean," Donohue said. "We 
will clean probably down to 26 p.p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Once widely used as a pesticide, DDT was banned for most uses in this country 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposure to the chemical can affect the nervous system and is suspected of 
causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue said EPA officials do not know where the DDT in Babich's neighborhood 
comes from. "We are certainly going to do a whole lot more sampling in that 
neighborhood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is that DDT was in soil that was used as a fill, Donohue said, 
"but it's way too early for us to come to any firm conclusions about how it got 
there. The more pressing issue at the moment is removing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents believe the DDT came from the old Montrose Chemical Corp. site, 
about half a mile away. DDT was manufactured from 1947 to 1982 at the Montrose 
plant, northwest of Normandie Avenue and Del Amo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Surface soil tests conducted in nearby neighborhoods during the 1980s led 
environmental officials to conclude that DDT levels were not a threat to public 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be able to discuss their concerns with EPA officials Thursday 
from 6 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. at a public forum at the Vandeene School, 826 Javelin 
St. in Torrance.

FBI TO PROBE MAN'S DEATH IN JAIL WARD; LAW ENFORCEMENT: OFFICIALS WILL LOOK FOR 
POSSIBLE CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WITNESSES TOLD THE COUNTY BOARD THAT 
EXCESSIVE FORCE WAS USED WHILE THE VICTIM WAS IN THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT.

<P>
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Friday opened a preliminary 
investigation into the case of a man who died while in the custody of Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bernard Wiley Jr. died in the jail ward of County-USC Medical Center on 
March 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said law enforcement officers were trying to restrain 
Wiley when he stopped breathing. But several hospital workers who said they 
witnessed the death have told authorities that they believe Wiley was the 
victim of excessive police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI joins at least three local agencies investigating the death of Wiley, 
who was allegedly taunted and beaten by sheriff's deputies before dying of 
unknown causes while tethered to a gurney. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's homicide investigators, the district attorney's special 
investigations division and the Los Angeles Police Department have opened 
inquires into Wiley's death. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman Ron Twersky said a team of agents is looking into possible civil 
rights violations. The result of the inquiry will be forwarded to the Justice 
Department's civil rights division for an opinion on whether to file charges, 
Twersky said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sheriff's and LAPD officials, Wiley fell down a flight of stairs 
in an altercation with LAPD officers, who had responded to a domestic violence 
call at the Mar Vista home of Wiley's former wife. He was taken to the jail 
ward by LAPD officers for treatment of a head injury sustained in the fall and 
was to be booked on suspicion of assaulting an officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials, who operate the jail ward, said Wiley became combative 
while being booked. According to the department's initial report on the 
incident, "several deputies and one LAPD officer were in the process of 
attempting to restrain the suspect when he stopped breathing." Doctors who were 
in the jail ward could not revive Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital workers who say they witnessed the deputies' handling of Wiley 
gave authorities a different version of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in March, the 
employees asked that the death be investigated: "We believe (the incident) 
involved excessive force and unlawful conduct . . . and we believe this 
incident needs to be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the workers declined to be interviewed Friday and others could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Royal, one of the employees who signed the letter sent to the Board of 
Supervisors, declined to comment on the incident when reached at her home 
Friday. Royal said all of the witnesses were under pressure to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been told that we could lose our jobs over this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Masaoka, a field representative for Local 660 of the Service Employees 
International Union that represents three of the workers, said that although 
the employees have not been officially told to refrain from discussing the 
incident, "there were some secondhand verbal comments made that may have 
discouraged some of the nurses (from talking)." 
</P>
<P>
 Adelaida De La Cerda, a spokeswoman at County-USC Medical Center, said 
hospital officials and personnel were cooperating with agencies investigating 
the death. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Eric Ferrer, who is representing Wiley's former wife, Ileana Wiley, 
said he was told by several witnesses that Wiley "was conscious, not boisterous 
and complied with deputies' orders" when brought to the jail ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then (the deputies) chided him, antagonized him and called him names," Ferrer 
said he was told by the witnesses. Eventually, Ferrer said, "(Wiley) was 
attacked by the deputies, thrown to the ground and something was put over his 
head. It's more than coincidence that he then went into cardiac arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office has not released the results of its autopsy. Coroner's 
spokesman Scott Carrier said officials are awaiting the results of toxicology 
and other tests.  
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the Sheriff's Department, LAPD and district attorney's office 
describe their inquires as routine, the kinds of investigations that are 
conducted whenever anyone dies while in custody or as the result of an 
officer-involved shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department declined to comment beyond its initial statement 
about Wiley's death until its investigation is completed.

<P>
 With Southland civic leaders on hand, the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority began construction Friday on the Pasadena Blue Line light rail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13.6-mile, 14-station line from east Pasadena to Downtown Los Angeles will 
be the third light rail line in the Metro network. When it opens in 1998, it 
will serve Pasadena, South Pasadena, Highland Park, Chinatown and Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Work got under way with a ceremonial start to the demolition of the 
single-track bridge over the Los Angeles River that must be replaced with a 
two-track structure to accommodate trains in both directions. Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan and Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole were among those on hand.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STRIPING 
WORK TO CLOSE FREEWAY CAR-POOL LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The car-pool lanes on the quake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) 
were scheduled to be closed at midnight Friday so crews can add new traffic 
striping to the highway for its reopening early next week, a Caltrans spokesman 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The freeway, severed at Fairfax Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard in the Jan. 17 
earthquake, is scheduled to reopen before the rush hour Tuesday, Caltrans 
spokesman Russell Snyder said.Eastbound motorists will have to exit at 
Robertson Boulevard and take surface streets to the La Cienega Boulevard 
on-ramp. Westbound cars must get off the freeway at La Brea Avenue for a detour 
to Washington Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 The eastbound La Cienega Boulevard on- and off-ramps will remain closed for 
reconstruction, but all other ramps will be open.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the car-pool lane experiment was successful, Snyder said, the rebuilt 
freeway will not have car-pool lanes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COMPROMISE 
LIMITS MOVIE FILMING ON EXCLUSIVE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Complaints about excessive filming at a hillside mansion prompted the city on 
Friday to impose limits all along exclusive Tower Grove Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors had complained that filming activity at Mark Slotkin's home, 
coupled with large social gatherings on the property, clogged the narrow 
roadways north of the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Public Works on Friday limited each home on the street to 12 
filming permits and 24 shooting days a year, a policy that will be reviewed in 
a year. The board also ordered Slotkin, an antique dealer and real estate 
broker, to notify the city for the next four months whenever he intends to hold 
a gathering with more than 75 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The new limits are not expected to have any appreciable effect on filming in 
the tony hillside community. Slotkin's home, featured in "Beverly Hillbillies" 
and "Indecent Proposal," was a filming site for nine days last year. The 
busiest filming location on the street was a residence that had 22 days of 
filming in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set a limit because there were complaints, but it's a reasonable limit," 
said Public Works Commissioner J.P. Ellman, who brokered the compromise. "It 
can be viewed as pro-filming because it's not unnecessarily restrictive."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SANITATION 
BUREAU TO OFFER COMPOSTING WORKSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Bureau of Sanitation will offer a series of back-yard composting 
workshops throughout the year, officials announced this week.  
</P>
<P>
 "Composting is nothing new or revolutionary.But once people get started . . . 
they really get into it," said Monchai Yaopruke of the Bureau of Sanitation. 
"We're trying to make it easier for people to become effective composters. 
After all, everyone gains from this." Composting reduces disposal of yard 
trimmings disposal and thus reduces the waste dumped at landfills, Yaopruke 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The community education programs provide hands-on demonstrations. Participants 
may purchase discounted compost bins at the workshops.  
</P>
<P>
 The next scheduled workshop in Los Angeles will be held next Friday from 10 
a.m. to 11:30 a.m., at the Peck Park and Recreation Center, 560 N. Western Ave. 
in San Pedro.

TEACHER HOSPITALIZED AFTER DRINKING SODA SPIKED WITH POISON; SCHOOLS:

 An Antelope Valley high school English teacher who became violently ill after 
drinking a soda laced with cleaning fluid is expected to be released from a 
Palmdale hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Ennis, 32, felt a burning sensation in her throat and started vomiting 
during a class Thursday morning at Littlerock High School after taking a sip 
from an open can of soda she had placed near an overhead projector, Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis was immediately taken to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. She was in 
good condition Friday, but was scheduled to stay a second night at the hospital 
for additional testing, according to hospital spokeswoman Cindy Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are viewing the incident as a misguided prank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look premeditated," said Sheriff's Lt. Ron Shreve of the Antelope 
Valley station. "We don't think it's an attempted murder." 
</P>
<P>
 The soft drink had been sitting next to the projector near a bottle of 
cleaning fluid for at least two class periods, Shreve said. Authorities said 
they believe that a student poured the fluid into the soft drink, but have no 
suspects in the incident. The type of cleaning fluid was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, who has been a teacher at the school for two years, said she was unsure 
when she will return to the classroom.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what to think," she said Friday from her hospital bed. "I 
love teaching and I truly love all my students." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she normally has good rapport with students and is often asked to 
work with teen-agers who do not get along well with other instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rough crew, but I really care about them," Ennis said. "Maybe the 
person that did it didn't realize how toxic it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is offering a $200 reward for information about the poisoning.

LONG BEACH PORT SUED IN TOXICS CASE; ENVIRONMENT: GROUPS CLAIM THAT OFFICIALS 
ALLOWED TENANT FIRMS TO POLLUTE SAN PEDRO BAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmental groups, including organizations seeking to clean up Santa Monica 
Bay, are suing the Port of Long Beach, alleging that it is allowing its tenants 
to release toxic and carcinogenic pollutants into San Pedro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Resource Defense Council, Santa Monica BayKeeper and Heal the Bay 
filed papers in U.S. District Court on Thursday demanding that the port take 
steps to stop Arco, Pacific Coast Cement and Toyota, among others, from 
releasing pollutants into storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot allow our neighbor to pollute the marine environment unabated, 
knowing that pollution from San Pedro Bay is carried directly into the Santa 
Monica Bay on ocean currents," said Terry Tamminen of Santa Monica BayKeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials denied Friday that Long Beach companies are polluting the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our monitoring indicates that we really don't have a problem," 
spokeswoman Yvonne Avila said. "Pollution of that kind would most probably show 
up in sediments. We've done dredging, and our samples indicate that our 
sediments are clean." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the plaintiffs, port tenants have been allowing petroleum 
products, heavy metals and pesticides to reach storm drains in runoff, which 
flows untreated into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The port is responsible for ensuring compliance with environmental laws under 
an agreement with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamminen acknowledged that most pollution reaches coastal water from rivers. 
But he said that monitors at the port had recently found uncovered piles of 
petroleum coke and sulfur at various facilities. He added that materials are 
often exposed to the elements as ships are loaded and unloaded.

SOUND EXPERT TESTIFIES SHE CANNOT FIND RACIAL SLURS IN KING VIDEOTAPE; COURTS: 
DEFENSE WITNESS SAYS SOME WORDS ARE UNINTELLIGIBLE. NOISE FROM TASER MAY 
INDICATE THAT IT WAS USED LONGER THAN OFFICERS SAID IT WAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A German sound expert hired by the city of Los Angeles to analyze the Rodney 
G. King videotape testified Friday that she never heard any racial epithets, 
although there were some words she could not make out. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelika Braun was called by the city and attorneys representing the officers 
involved in the beating to blunt accounts of the incident by King, who 
testified in his federal lawsuit against them that officers repeatedly used the 
word nigger as they hit and kicked him. King is black; the officers who beat 
him are white. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about clicking sounds on the tape, Braun identified them as the possible 
sounds of a Taser gun used to subdue King and said the electronic weapon was 
probably used for a longer period than the officers said. The defense contends 
that most of King's head injuries were caused by an unprotected fall after he 
was shot with a Taser gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Stone, who represents one of the officers, asked Braun if she 
could identify any comments on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have identified, 'Put your hands behind your back' repeatedly; 'Down' 
repeatedly; 'Has anybody got a damn Taser' twice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone asked her if she heard any racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I did not," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, King's attorney John Burris asked Braun if she could 
hear a racial slur made by one of the officers before he ordered King to put 
his hands behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something before that," she said, "but I cannot make it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun, who speaks fluent English, said that she studied in Alabama for a year 
when she was in high school and that she heard the word nigger at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, David Love, the only black officer at the scene of the 
beating, said he did not hear anyone there use the word nigger , adding that if 
he had, he would have reported it to his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an Afro-American it would have offended me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning, Love conceded that he was not always close enough to hear 
everything that was said because of noise from a hovering police helicopter.

 In other testimony Friday, neurologist Arthur Kowell took the stand for the 
city and testified that King suffered no brain damage from the beating. Another 
witness, neuropsychologist Tony Strickland, testified Thursday that he had 
determined through tests that King's injuries were more psychological than 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is expected to wrap up its case early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the trial is to determine the amount of compensatory 
damages to be paid by the city, which has acknowledged liability in the case. A 
second phase will address individual liability by police officers and other 
defendants for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who is seeking $9.6 million, has rejected an offer to settle the case 
for $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers were tried for King's beating and acquitted on all but one 
charge in a state trial, sparking three days of rioting and more than 50 
deaths. Two defendants -- Officer Laurence M. Powell and Sgt. Stacey C. Koon -- 
were later convicted of violating King's civil rights and are serving 30-month 
sentences in federal prison.

SAVING THE EARTH WHILE SAVING SOULS; ENVIRONMENT: AN INTERFAITH COALITION IS 
LEADING THE FIGHT TO VIEW STEWARDSHIP OF THE EARTH AS A SACRED RESPONSIBILITY. 
MEMBER CONGREGATIONS ARE DOING EVERYTHING FROM PROTECTING BAYOUS TO USING 
SOLAR-POWERED ETERNAL LIGHTS IN SYNAGOGUES.

 Towering willow oaks frame a wide spring sky. Birds whistle love calls as old 
as time. Here, members of Heritage Presbyterian Church make the connection 
between faith and the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can give praise to God when we see yellow-rumped warblers," said Kathryn 
Cochrane, whose committee built the trail that meanders through the suburban 
church's Creation Awareness Center, a three-acre wood lot behind the parish 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is one of dozens of recycling, creek-monitoring and other 
environmental efforts undertaken in recent years by U.S. churches and 
synagogues, especially those in politically liberal areas. The eco-spiritual 
movement will get a powerful boost on Earth Day, April 22, from an 
unprecedented coalition of the nation's top religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The National Religious Partnership for the Environment, representing the U.S. 
Catholic Conference, the National Council of Churches, the Evangelical 
Environment Network, and the Consultation on the Environment and Jewish Life, 
will ask pastors and rabbis nationwide to begin viewing the environment as a 
sacred responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just the environmental movement at prayer," said Paul Gorman, 
executive director of the Partnership for the Environment. "There is a 
neglected legacy of teachings that instruct stewardship of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal letter includes documents explaining the scriptural basis for 
putting care of the Earth on the religious agenda, beginning with Psalms 24:1: 
"The Earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbis receive a list of Old Testament references, whereas the pastors' list 
cites both portions of the Bible. Each group within the partnership has 
prepared its own appeal documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Considerable negotiating went on among the member organizations about the 
general thrust of the campaign. Roman Catholics feared that signing on to save 
the Earth might weaken the Vatican's strict stand against birth control. 
Evangelicals worried about environmentalism's New Age image. Black church 
leaders feared they would be accused of succumbing to a white-middle-class 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the groups agreed on two broad concepts: stewardship of God's 
creation and ending environmental injustices inflicted on poor populations by 
the industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the poor and marginalized who are affected first by anything that goes 
wrong with the environment," Judy Jones of World Vision, a Christian relief and 
development agency based in Monrovia, told National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
 The question remains whether the country's conservative Christian 
congregations, representing most of religious America, will join any movement 
that smacks of liberalism. Traditionally, they have viewed environmentalism as 
elitist and secular. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who would follow a Rush Limbaugh," said Cliff Benzel of 
Evangelicals for Social Action, based in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is that conservatives will be inspired by such examples as a Roman 
Catholic church in Houma, La., campaigning on behalf of fishermen to save the 
bayous; a Presbyterian church in Oakland that asks its members to sign up for a 
gasoline tithe, reducing their driving by 10%, and a synagogue in Lowell, 
Mass., that uses solar power in its eternal light. 
</P>
<P>
 But many are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're fighting is a generation that views waste as a sign of 
well-being," said Mike Tabor, a Jewish activist who has developed a 16-point 
energy-reduction plan for synagogues in the Baltimore area, where he lives. "I 
have to fight it in myself," said the 51-year-old farmer. "I let the water run 
while I brush." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal is part of a three-year campaign to integrate the concept of 
environmental stewardship into the religious life of America. The partnership 
will help congregations develop environmental programs and create environmental 
ministries for young clerics. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement began in 1990 when a group of 34 concerned scientists, including 
astronomer Carl Sagan, wrote an open letter to the world's religious leaders 
asking for their help in rescuing the degraded planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The response was quick and widespread. Talks were held in Washington, Moscow 
and Oxford, England. In less than two years, the scientists' letter had been 
signed by Christian, Jewish and Muslim spiritual leaders from 83 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unprecedented," Gorman said. "These two worlds have been separate since the 
church decided Galileo's head should be separated from his body." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit for bringing the disparate groups together is given to Vice 
President Al Gore, who arranged private meetings between religious and 
scientific leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to rescue the environment promises some interesting bonuses. Not 
the least, religious leaders hope, could be renewed interest in church life. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1960s, mainstream Protestant churches have steadily lost members. 
The Presbyterian Church alone has lost more than 1 million people, one-third of 
its membership. During the same period, a majority of Americans have come to 
consider themselves environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people left because the church didn't preach and teach what 
Scripture says about our relationship to the created world," Kathryn Cochrane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With plans to spend $4.5 million over the next three years, the Partnership 
for the Environment could create new jobs for clerics and even stimulate new 
products. Evangelicals for Social Action plans to launch an environmental 
magazine, the Green Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Booksellers already have noticed new interest in volumes about cultures that 
view humans as part of, not superior to, the environment. "Earth Prayers From 
Around the World," published two years ago, has sold 180,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading the word on eco-spiritualism will stimulate debate on it and other 
controversial issues such as population control, economic development and 
animal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bound to be acrimonious," said Gary Comstock, who teaches religion and 
ethics at Iowa State University. "But after all, this is the course of the 
great philosophical reforms."

PROFESSOR FILES SUIT OVER CHARGES OF HARASSMENT; EDUCATION: A STUDENT 
COMPLAINED THAT A TALMUDIC STORY USED IN CLASS WAS INAPPROPRIATE. THE 
INSTRUCTOR IS SEEKING REDRESS FROM A DISCIPLINARY PANEL AND HIS SEMINARY. 
</P>

<P>
 Theology professor Graydon Snyder told the same ancient vignette to students 
for 34 years to illustrate a difference between Judaism and Christianity: A 
roofer falls on a woman and they accidentally have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the story, that is, until one student complained. She was offended, 
not enlightened. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder was disciplined after the complaint was filed in February, 1992, and 
decided to sue the Chicago Theological Seminary in a debate over academic 
freedom and sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenured professor, who has taught at the United Church of Christ seminary 
for more than eight years, said he used the story from the Talmud as an example 
of differences in the way people are judged in the eyes of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "The New Testament says if you think about doing the act, you've done it," 
Snyder said last week. "The Talmud says if you do the act, but didn't think 
about it, you didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The student complained that Snyder's use of the story from Talmud, the 
collection of Jewish law and commentary, was inappropriate. Snyder said she 
called him after the introductory class on the Bible to say she was going to 
file a complaint because she was offended by the sexual content of the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said in the complaint that men are always saying that they don't intend 
to do any harm and in fact they do," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 63, would not identify the woman, nor is she named in his lawsuit, 
filed last month. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote an apology to the woman but admitted no wrongdoing after he attended 
two hearings by the seminary's sexual harassment task force. The panel placed 
Snyder on probation and distributed letters telling the seminary's 250 students 
and faculty that he had been punished and why. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel ordered Snyder to get therapy and advised him not to be alone with 
students or staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still teaching at the seminary, but not the introductory Bible class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume that some control of sexual harassment must be done," Snyder said. 
"But when it enters into an issue of academic freedom, I don't know the line. 
Part of what we're doing here is to help develop that line." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder filed his Circuit Court lawsuit against the school and the disciplinary 
panel, asking for unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's inquiry into the incident was not completed until March, 1993, 
partly because Snyder was on sabbatical for four months. Snyder waited almost a 
year before filing his lawsuit because he was trying to work out an agreement 
with the school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seminary President Kenneth Smith would not comment on the matter, directing 
calls to a lawyer who did not answer telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I told a dirty story or made sexual advances, I could understand," Snyder 
said. "But it never occurred to me I could have a grievance lodged against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's lawsuit will keep pressure on courts to address the conflict between 
free speech and sexual harassment, one observer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I welcome suits like this," said Michael Greve, director of the Center for 
Individual Rights in Washington. "Many untenured professors or instructors take 
these charges lying down. They try to settle them behind closed doors because 
they are humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Ellis, legal director of the National Organization for Women's Legal 
Defense Fund in New York City, said the woman's complaint would probably have 
been thrown out of court if she had filed charges instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conduct that is offensive is not sufficient to make out a claim of sexual 
harassment," she said. "This points up the need for professors to be sensitive 
to a diverse student audience."

SENDING BRUINS, HARRICK BACK TO THE DICTIONARY

 Any coach can teach his players how to handle themselves on the basketball 
court and learn the "system." Then there are those coaches who are able to 
motivate, bring out the best in the talent they have, instill confidence and 
teach success.That has been the difference between John Wooden and everyone who 
followed him at UCLA. 
</P>

 Need more proof? Just look at what Magic Johnson is doing with the same group 
that Randy Pfund once coached.

 UCLA will soon review Jim Harrick. Maybe they should look at the faculty as 
well. According to their letters, here is what we have taught our alumni: 
</P>
<P>
 Life: An imperfect system designed to provide an endless stream of victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Team (see also community ): People supposed to endure our wrath when we 
encounter life's imperfections and to sacrifice everything to make sure it 
never happens again. 
</P>
<P>
 Adversity: Any unpleasantness that can teach others that they deserve what 
they are going to get from us. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsmanship: A contemptuous intolerance of inferiors who provide us the 
ingredients of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory: What happens when we encounter those who are less motivated and more 
poorly led -- and the officials are biased in our favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven help us if our graduates are applying these lessons to matters more 
important than basketball.

THIS STRAWBERRY JAM SEEMS THIN TO MANY DODGER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's see, world hunger, world peace, education, homeless people, or the 
pressure to play a kid's game with all of your effort for millions of dollars. 
I can see why Darryl Strawberry cracked under the strain of the most critical 
issue facing the human race today.  
</P>

 I think Peter O'Malley should double ticket prices and give all of the extra 
money to Darryl so he can play without the burden of knowing where his next

 Why don't the Dodgers cut Darryl Strawberry and invest his salary in starting 
a nonprofit center for teens with drug and alcohol problems? 
</P>
<P>
 It galls me when Strawberry's attorney talks to the media about his client's 
"stress." From almost any seat at Dodger Stadium, a fan can turn and see both 
the beauty of Los Angeles and a city torn apart by violence -- mostly as a 
result of drug and alcohol abuse. The kids that live just beyond the hills of 
Chavez Ravine have real stress. Darryl Strawberry has had many chances; these 
kids have practically none.

 Tim Kawakami said it right. Henry Rodriguez's opening day "wasn't exactly a

 Darryl, I don't feel compassion, sympathy or anger toward you. Only your loved 
ones have the moral right to those feelings. I couldn't care less whether you 
get paid or not. That's between you and O'Malley. I do hope you return to play 
baseball. Hearing 50,000 people sing, "Dar-ryl," is one of the most chilling 
experiences a sports spectator can have, and when you answer it with a deep 
drive, it becomes special. Get well, guy.

 ESPN's Jim Rome should be commended for not holding back in his interview with 
Jim Everett. Sure, Rome is pretty obnoxious, but at least he says the same 
thing to a person's face that he says on the radio every day. It makes me sick 
when sportscasters like Fred Roggin and Joe McDonnell are critical of an 
athlete in his absence and then kiss up to him during an interview.

 Three games into the season and we've already had this from Bob Starr: 
</P>
<P>
 (1) "Dave Winfield has 38 hits off Chuck Finley."Two minutes later, "Check 
that. Winfield has had 38 at-bats against Chuck Finley." 
</P>
<P>
 (2) "Fly ball to right center, between Curtis and Salmon -- and Salmon, the 
smaller of the two, catches it." If Starr thinks Tim Salmon is smaller than 
Chad Curtis, he's not only a hack, he's a blind hack. 
</P>

 (3) "We're going to Milwaukee next, where it was zero degrees on opening day."

REALIGNMENT: CAN CLASSIC BASEBALL BE FAR BEHIND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Sunday's sports section, Ross Newhan quoted Brave General Manager John 
Schuerholz as having endorsed baseball's realignment and playoff structure 
because 54% of fans polled favored it. 
</P>
<P>
 If memory serves me right, this is the same percentage that liked the new 
Coca-Cola better than the old. What Coca-Cola failed to take into account was 
that the 46% who didn't like the new taste switched to something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we look forward to "Classic Baseball?"

DUCKS TIE EXPANSION RECORD WITH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The coach who banned the E-word slipped up Friday night. He used it himself. 
Repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mighty Duck Coach Ron Wilson might not mind paying the fines for uttering 
the word expansion -- and they'll be increased because his faux pas appeared in 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Ducks reached an expansion milestone Friday by winning their 32nd 
game, a 3-1 victory over Edmonton in front of 15,701 at Northlands Coliseum 
that tied the NHL record for victories by a first-year team. 
</P>
<P>
 Only thing is, Florida already reached the mark, though the Panthers are still 
stuck on 32 with three games to go in their Eastern Conference playoff race. 
The record will go to the team that wins the most games of its final three. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty proud of that. We certainly did not expect it," said Wilson, who 
decided along with General Manager Jack Ferreira before the season that the 
connotations of the word expansion are too negative. "They've got three tough 
games left. We're tied now. If they win a couple more and we win one, at least 
we're No. 2 all-time." 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, the record was shared by the 1967-68 Kings and 
Philadelphia Flyers, who were among six teams added to the league in the same 
season and played a huge number of games against other expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teams that won 31 in '67 played a lot of their games against expansion 
teams. We only won two against expansion teams, so we have 30 wins against 
established teams," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a 2-10 record against expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glade we didn't play 60 against expansion teams or our record would 
have been brutal ," Wilson said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were behind, 1-0, after Kelly Buchberger's first-period goal. A team 
that prides itself on being tough was being pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Yake, who was the team's leading healthy scorer, was put out for the 
game by a first-period hit that sent him woozily off the ice. He suffered a 
mild concussion and is questionable for today's game at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert, who made 38 saves for his 20th victory of the season, got decked 
by Scott Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got chippy because we didn't show up in the first period," Wilson said. 
"They run our goalie, and we're helping their guy up, not Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Stu Grimson got us going in the second period with the hit he put 
on (teammate) Stephan Lebeau. Stephan got up with a bloody lip and Stu went to 
the penalty box." 
</P>
<P>
 But Patrik Carnback scored a second-period goal, then he and John Lilley 
assisted Garry Valk on Valk's 18th for a 2-1 lead at 14:06 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton helped the Ducks over the hump at the end when Oiler Luke Richardson 
took a match penalty with 4:10 left because of an attempt to injure Bobby 
Dollas, who fell to the ice after taking a stick to the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Sweeney scored on the long power play at 18:23, and the Ducks were on 
their way to No. 32. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Center Shaun Van Allen's wife, Colleen, gave birth to the couple's first 
child, Aaron Shaun, early Friday morning. Van Allen flew home from Edmonton 
Thursday morning and will rejoin the team when it returns to Anaheim. . . . . 
Coach Ron Wilson was impressed with the hands and playmaking sense of Maxim 
Bets in his debut, but thinks he needs to increase his strength and size. . . . 
. The family of Walt Disney Co. President Frank G. Wells, who died in a 
helicopter crash last Sunday, asks that in lieu of flowers donations be made to 
Environment Now, an environmental restoration and protection group. The address 
is 450 Newport Center Dr., Suite 450, Newport Beach, CA 92660.

NHL ROUNDUP; RANGERS CLINCH AWARD, LOOK AHEAD TO PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was satisfaction, but hardly euphoria. Call it a night at the office, 
planning a couple more months -- maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexei Kovalev scored twice during a five-goal second period that gave the New 
York Rangers a 5-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday and clinched 
the NHL President's Cup for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is given to the team with the best regular-season record, but 
something more important comes along with it -- home-ice advantage throughout 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can put this behind us and get ready for the playoffs," Ranger Coach 
Mike Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously everyone is proud of (winning the Presidents' Cup), but we've got 
to move on," Ranger forward Adam Graves said. "We want to go into the playoffs 
on a high and I think we're going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to keep things businesslike. That's easier to do when the Rangers 
remember the last time they were regular-season champions. That was two seasons 
ago, and they weren't around long enough to appreciate home-ice anything. New 
York was eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Pittsburgh 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy," said goalie Mike Richter, who made 34 saves and extended his 
club record to 41 victories. "But it isn't time to get ecstatic yet. It just 
feels good to be ending the season playing well." 
</P>
<P>
 New York also established a club record for victories in a season with their 
51st and tied the club mark for points with 109, with three games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 5, San Jose 2 -- Joe Nieuwendyk earned an assist in his return after 
missing 17 games because of a knee injury as the Flames helped determine the 
Sharks' playoff berth at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieuwendyk, sidelined since Feb. 24, assisted on Theoren Fleury's 37th goal 
early in the second period to break a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, coming on the heels of a 3-2 setback in Vancouver on Thursday night, 
was San Jose's second in a row after winning seven consecutive games. The Shark 
defeat, combined with Chicago's victory over St. Louis, means they will be 
seeded eighth when the Western Conference playoffs open April 18. They would 
play either Calgary or Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, Dallas 1 -- Pierre Turgeon scored two goals at 
Uniondale, N.Y., as the Islanders beat the Stars and gained the inside track 
for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 New York tied Florida for eighth place with 80 points, but the Islanders hold 
the edge because they have two more victories than the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 1, Montreal 0 -- Dominik Hasek made 31 saves at Buffalo in his seventh 
shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 7, Pittsburgh 2 -- Bill Guerin scored two first-period goals and 
Scott Stevens had a goal and three assists at East Rutherford, N.J., as the 
Devils ended a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, St. Louis 1 -- Joe Murphy scored twice in the second period and Ed 
Belfour stopped 32 shots as the Blackhawks won at St. Louis, only their second 
victory in nine games (2-6-1).

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; LARKIN JUSTIFIES CONFIDENCE WITH HIT IN 10TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's early and Barry Larkin's no rookie. So what if he's one for 15? 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson eschewed the sacrifice and let Larkin swing 
away with the game on the line, a 10th-inning gesture that gave the shortstop 
renewed confidence and the Reds a 5-4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 David West (0-1) set up the winning hit by giving up a leadoff single to Jeff 
Branson and a four-pitch walk to Tony Fernandez, who was trying to bunt. Rather 
than have Larkin try to advance the runners with a sacrifice, Johnson told 
third base coach Ray Knight to give him the hit sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray Knight looked at me as if to say, 'See, Davey is not going to put the 
bunt on because he has confidence in you and I have confidence in you, too,' " 
Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Johnson's message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think about bunting him," Johnson said. "As bad as he's struggled, I 
can't think of anybody I'd rather have hitting in that situation than Barry 
Larkin." 
</P>
<P>
 West helped by going to a full count. He had to throw a fastball, and Larkin 
pulled it into the gap in left-center for the Reds' second extra-inning victory 
in their four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did the same things I'd been doing all day. He just got that ball inside," 
Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 It spoiled another late-inning comeback by the Phillies, who had swept a 
three-game series against Colorado by coming from behind after the sixth inning 
all three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mitchell drove in three runs with two homers off Ben Rivera as the Reds 
went ahead, 4-0, but the Phillies tied it with two runs in the fifth inning off 
Jose Rijo and Dave Hollins' two-run home run in the eighth off Jeff Brantley. 
Hector Carrasco (2-0) pitched a hitless 10th for his second major-league 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Montreal 0 -- Rookie Steve Trachsel, a Long Beach State product, 
got his first major league victory and Shawon Dunston homered and had three 
RBIs as the Cubs spoiled the home opener of the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel outdueled Montreal starter Pedro Martinez. Trachsel, 0-2 as a starter 
last season after being recalled in September, gave up only three hits in 7 1/3 
innings. He struck out eight and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, acquired from the Dodgers last winter in a trade for second baseman 
Delino DeShields, gave up three hits and struck out eight before being lifted 
for a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 6, New York 3 -- Andujar Cedeno had three hits and three RBIs to help 
the Astros snap the Mets' season-opening three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 New York got homers from Bobby Bonilla and Ryan Thompson at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Williams pitched into trouble in the ninth before getting the save by 
retiring Bonilla on a fly ball with the bases loaded. Williams started the 
inning, walked two batters and gave up a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 7, Pittsburgh 3 -- Dante Bichette, the majors' hottest hitter, went 
four for five with a homer and four RBIs to lead the Rockies to a victory at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates have been outscored, 21-5, in their 0-4 start, their worst since 
they opened 0-6 in 1974 before rebounding to win their division. Colorado won 
its first game after being outscored, 33-19, in a season-opening series sweep 
by Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette, hitting .471 with four homers and eight RBIs in three starts, had a 
solo homer and two run-scoring doubles off starter and loser Paul Wagner. 
Bichette added an RBI single off reliever Joel Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 4, Florida 0 -- Rookie Keith Lockhart homered twice in his first 
major league start and Scott Sanders gave up two hits in 7 1/3 innings at San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart, a 29-year-old journeyman who entered the game with three big league 
at-bats, followed Derek Bell's home run in the fourth inning with his first of 
the night for a 2-0 lead. In the eighth, Lockhart, who got his first major 
league hit Thursday night, homered off reliever Robb Nen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, making his first start of the season and 10th of his career, struck 
out six. He walked two and hit a batter before Trevor Hoffman relieved in the 
eighth inning and got the save.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; NAGY SHARP AS INDIANS GET A PLEASANT SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new season, with a new ballpark, some new players and new hope, the 
Cleveland Indians got an old pitcher back Friday night in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Nagy and his surgically repaired right shoulder looked better than the 
Indians had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagy, who was an All-Star in 1992 but missed most of 1993, gave up two runs 
and five hits in seven innings, striking out seven and walking one as Cleveland 
stayed unbeaten with an 8-3 victory over winless Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hoped we would see this," Indian Manager Mike Hargrove said. "We would 
have taken less. But we'll certainly take this and build on it." 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-game winner in 1992, Nagy underwent shoulder surgery and won only two 
games in a shortened, pain-filled 1993 that seems only a distant memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good just to get the win," Nagy said. "I feel good. I feel 
comfortable. I know I still have a lot more work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Thome hit a three-run home run in the second inning off Kansas City 
starter Tom Gordon, then hit a shot back to the mound, off Gordon's shins, that 
brought on a new pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland is 3-0 for the first time since 1984. The Royals are 0-3 for the 
third consecutive year. They are 1-8 in home openers the past nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lose (today), we're going to come out Sunday," Manager Hal McRae said. 
"We're not going to tinker with anything. We're not going to change anything. I 
played for 18 years and I was never concerned with three ballgames and I'm not 
going to be concerned with three games now. We haven't won because we haven't 
scored." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's early, the tinkering could come from the front office, which has 
indicated that another poor start would not help McRae. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Detroit 0 -- Jim Abbott and two relievers combined on a 
four-hitter and Paul O'Neill drove in two runs as the unbeaten Yankees won at 
home over the winless Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott struck out eight in seven innings and walked two. He gave up a single 
to Alan Trammell in the second inning, a double to Mickey Tettleton in the 
fourth and a leadoff single to Trammell in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wickman walked Milt Cuyler starting the eighth inning, and Tony Phillips 
singled before Steve Howe came on for the final six outs, earning his first 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 10, Minnesota 9 -- Troy Neel and Scott Brosius hit run-scoring singles 
in the 10th inning as the Athletics wasted a six-run lead, then defeated the 
Twins in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins' Kirby Puckett had the sixth five-hit game of his career, raising 
his hit total to 2,004, and drove in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McGwire hit his first home run for Oakland since last May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 8, Chicago 6 -- Tim Naehring hit a three-run double in the eighth 
inning and scored when a relay throw got away as the Red Sox won their fourth 
in a row, defeating the White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox hit four homers, giving them nine in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Baltimore 5 -- Manuel Lee snapped an 0-for-8 slump with a two-run 
single in the ninth inning that gave the Rangers a victory at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 8, Seattle 2 -- Rookie Carlos Delgado hit his third homer of the week, 
and Devon White tied a Blue Jays' record with two triples as they routed the 
Mariners at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 White went four for four, including his 200th double, and Joe Carter and 
Delgado homered in a five-run second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado, whose first two homers bounced off SkyDome restaurants, barely 
cleared the left-field fence with his third.

PLAYERS CAUGHT IN NET PROFITS; TENNIS: TOP-RANKED USC FORFEITS MATCH AGAINST 
UCLA WHEN TROJANS LOSE FOUR PLAYERS OVER ELIGIBILITY ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A problem that began last February in Louisville, Ky., has made its way to the 
West Coast, costing top-ranked USC a tennis match against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (16-2) defaulted Friday when four of their players were declared 
ineligible for accepting expense money beyond that allowed by the NCAA while 
competing in summer professional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Black, Jon Leach, Lukas Hovorka and Brett Hansen were declared 
ineligible by the school. All will petition the NCAA for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Two UCLA players, Robert Janecek and Sebastien LeBlanc, also were declared 
ineligible, but the Bruins, who lost to USC, 6-1, earlier in the season, had 
enough players to compete and accepted the default. 
</P>
<P>
 A third Bruin, Eric Taino, had been declared ineligible and was reinstated 
before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has occurred over an interpretation of an NCAA rule that 
precludes payment of expense money on the basis of advancement in a 
professional tournament. Many of the top college players compete in 
professional satellite tournaments during the summer and receive expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ambiguous rule and not many realize it's there," USC Coach Dick 
Leach said. "All of our players were under the assumption that the NCAA rule 
followed the U.S. Tennis Assn. amateur rule." 
</P>
<P>
 The USTA allows acceptance of expense money for travel, lodging and meals, as 
long as there are receipts for proof, Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The logic behind the USTA rule is that as a player advances in a tournament, 
more expenses are incurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA rule is interpreted as meaning that expenses paid to players can be 
no more than the tournament minimum payout, or that for a first-round loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rule is longstanding, the latest interpretation surfaced when the 
University of Miami was targeted during the National Collegiate Indoor 
tournament in Louisville in February, UCLA Coach Billy Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami compliance officer Craig Angelo investigated, found two Hurricane 
players ineligible and informed the NCAA that the problem was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my personal opinion, 60-70% of the top college players will be included," 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State's Laurent Orsini, ranked No. 1 in the nation, sat out 
several recent matches until his eligibility was restored Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time it's over, four or five (Pac-10) schools will be involved, both 
men and women," said David Price, the Pacific 10 Conference associate 
commissioner. "The schools are fact-finding now." 
</P>
<P>
 Restoration of eligibility seems a formality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based upon information we've received from the NCAA, we expect the players 
will be held out no more than two matches," Noel Ragsdale, USC's faculty 
athletic representative, said in a statement.

NBA ROUNDUP; ORLANDO GAINS FIRST BERTH IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orlando Magic claimed its first playoff berth Friday, but there's at least 
one vote that says it won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say Orlando is in pretty good hands for a long time with the big guy 
here," Piston guard Isiah Thomas said after Orlando defeated Detroit, 117-103. 
"I'd tell them to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. They're going to be (in 
the playoffs) for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is Shaquille O'Neal, who was bigger than usual at Orlando with 40 
points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic led, 84-55, in the third quarter before Detroit closed to 106-97 
with five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who made all 12 of his free throws, pulled the Magic out of the 
tailspin with a turnaround jump shot and two free throws as Orlando went on a 
9-2 run to seal the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something to savor," said Nick Anderson, the first draft pick in the 
team's history. "It's been a long time coming, and I would really like to sit 
back and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't get much of a chance. The Magic quickly turned their attention to 
securing homecourt advantage for the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy about making the playoffs, but that's just the first part of 
the job," Magic Coach Brian Hill said. "We're in, and now we're going to try 
and finish up as high as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 100, Indiana 94 -- Scottie Pippen's three-pointer with 42 seconds to 
play highlighted a 9-0 run as the Bulls took advantage of the Pacers' five 
turnovers in the final 1:40 at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 108, Cleveland 98 -- Rex Chapman scored 29 points and Don MacLean 
had 26 points and 12 rebounds as the Bullets won at home and prevented the 
Cavaliers from clinching a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 100, New York 97 -- Clarence Weatherspoon scored 26 points and 
rookie Greg Graham made two key free throws with 11 seconds to play at 
Philadelphia, where the 76ers won their second in a row after 11 consecutive 
losses at the Spectrum and 25 losses in 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Oakley had 18 points and 18 rebounds for the Knicks, who played 
without center Patrick Ewing, sidelined with flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 111, Dallas 93 -- Gary Payton scored four of his 22 points in an 11-0 
burst to start the fourth quarter at Seattle as the SuperSonics matched a 
franchise record with their 56th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 99, New Jersey 78 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 19 points and blocked 
four shots as the Hornets kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a victory in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, the Hornets' 11th in 17 games, pulled Charlotte within 4 1/2 
games of the Nets for the Eastern Conference's eighth playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 112, Minnesota 108 -- Robert Parish made two free throws with 28 
seconds left to break a tie, and the Timberwolves missed two short shots in the 
last 13 seconds at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 104, Phoenix 101 -- Mitch Richmond scored 33 points to lead the 
Kings at home, where they defeated Phoenix for the first time in 13 games.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MODEST RALLY ENDS AS STOCKS FOLLOW BOND PRICES DOWN; 
MARKETS: INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE DROPS 19 AS INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER. DOW STILL 
ENDS WEEK WITH GAIN OF 38.30 POINTS.

 Wall Street broke a three-day winning streak on Friday, resuming its decline 
as interest rates moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks lost more ground than blue-chip issues, with the Nasdaq index 
shaken by declines in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average fell 19 points to 3,674.26, but still ended with a gain 
for the week of 38.30 points. The broader market also retreated with declining 
issues outnumbering advances by about 7 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days guiding the stock market back from shattering losses, bond 
prices lost ground on Friday, pushing up yields, which move in the opposite 
direction. The return to investors on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, a 
guide to long-term interest rates in general, rose to 7.26% from Thursday's 
7.20%. Its price fell 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds began to rise after Federal Reserve Gov. Lawrence Lindsey said the 
shortage of U.S. jobs is "diminishing."  
</P>
<P>
 Later, Chicago Fed president Silas Keehn said some areas of the manufacturing 
sector are approaching capacity limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jittery stock investors worried again that rising rates would makes 
shares less appealing and raise the cost of borrowing to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Federal Reserve nudged rates higher on Feb. 4 and then again on 
March 23, rates have shot up and the stock market had declined nearly 9% until 
Monday. Since then the Dow average has recovered to a deficit of about 7.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors are concerned that further evidence of inflation could spur 
the Fed to tighten credit again. Word on inflation is to come in government 
reports Tuesday and Wednesday on consumer and producer prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some market players stayed away on Friday, resisting any significant 
commitments ahead of those numbers, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment 
officer, First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stocks fell with bonds. It's as simple as that," said David Shulman, chief 
market strategist at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's list of 500 stocks 
fell 3.78 to 447.10 and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 6.46 to 748.71, but 
added 5.26 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the selling in stocks was later in the session as investors worried 
about holding on to shares over the weekend amid so much uncertainty about the 
direction of rates, said James Melcher, founder and president of Balestra 
Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad with London's Financial Times 100-share average 
losing 8.2 points to finish at 3,120.8. Shares finished higher on the German 
bourse with the 30-share DAX average rising 1.93 points to 2,203.34 and Tokyo's 
225-share Nikkei average rose 44.01 points to 19,934.99.  
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa slid 44.08 points, or 1.94%, at 2,229.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marvel Entertainment Group fell 2 to 19 after it told analysts it expects 
lower second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailer Best Buy rose 2 to 73 3/4. Morgan Stanley started a buy rating on 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks retreated on a combination of profit taking and concern about 
shipment delays stemming from the ongoing strike by truckers represented by the 
Teamsters' union. General Motors fell 2 3/8 to 57 3/4, Chrysler fell 2 7/8 to 
51 and Ford ended off 2 1/4 to 58. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deere fell 2 7/8 to 85 1/2, while Georgia Pacific tumbled 1 1/4 to 62 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks were also hard hit. Microsoft tumbled 2 3/4 to 87 and Intel 
lost 1 1/4 to 69 3/8. * Western Publishing fell 2 3/4 to 11 1/2. Arbitragers 
said investors were disappointed that the company's puzzles and game unit was 
sold and not the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mid Atlantic Medical Services rose 5 1/4 to 49 1/8 after predicting a rise 
in first-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen as foreign exchange 
markets digested the resignation of Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa. 
In New York, the dollar closed at 105.15 Japanese yen, up from 104.85 yen 
Thursday. The greenback fell against other major currencies. Gold and silver 
prices also finished higher.  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, lumber future prices plunged to their lowest level in more than 
five months on the Chicago Merc on signs that rising mortgage rates have choked 
off demand for building materials.

STANLEY'S NOT RESTING ON HIS LAURELS; POP MUSIC: THE ACCLAIMED ARTIST NEVER 
GOES ON AUTOPILOT, ELECTING INSTEAD TO PLAY IT 'THE WAY I FEEL.' HE'LL BE THE 
FIRST BLUEGRASS HEADLINER IN COACH HOUSE HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Capturing a mass audience with a bluegrass song may be only slightly less 
difficult than getting a Hatfield to say something nice about a McCoy. But it 
is not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs did it in 1962 with their TV theme from "The 
Beverly Hillbillies," and Eric Weissberg and Steve Mandell scored in 1972 with 
"Dueling Banjos," from the film "Deliverance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Stanley endorses those hits and says they helped recruit a new audience 
for what he calls "the old-time songs . . . the older things." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanley says he has never been tempted to recast his own style in a way 
that might cater to mass tastes. A leading figure in bluegrass music since 
1946, when he and his older brother, Carter, began singing and playing on the 
radio for a 1,000-watt station on the Tennessee-Virginia border, Stanley 
prefers the older things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to branch out into anything else," the 67-year-old banjo 
player and bandleader said over the phone recently. "I'd just rather do it the 
way I feel it, and keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley's music is as raw and unvarnished in its way as anything a grunge band 
could come up with. As a reflection of a poverty-stricken place -- the 
mountainous coal-mining country of southwestern Virginia -- it is as tied to 
its slice of turf as any of the ghetto narratives of today's rap music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an instrumentalist, Stanley is simple and direct. His singing, high-pitched 
and gnarled, sounds like some eerie echo from the past that refused to decay 
and kept on resonating into the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley spoke from Nashville as he prepared to fly West for a two-week tour 
that brings him and his band, the Clinch Mountain Boys, to McCabe's in Santa 
Monica on Sunday and to the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Monday 
(Stanley will be the first bluegrass headliner in the Coach House's eight-year 
history). 
</P>
<P>
 Country music's hub isn't really Stanley country. He still lives outside 
Coeburn, Va., in the same county where he grew up listening to the radio and 
absorbing the string-band music of the Carter Family and Bill Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 While Stanley sees no need to modify his music to capture the ear of a mass 
public, his most recent album, the 1993 double-CD collection, "Saturday Night & 
Sunday Morning," accomplishes a crossover in reverse. It finds such 
mass-audience country stars as Dwight Yoakam, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, 
Emmylou Harris and George Jones joining with Stanley and the Clinch Mountain 
Boys to play music the old way. 
</P>
<P>
 The album draws heavily on Stanley's past for its equal balance of secular and 
religious songs. One disc, "Saturday Night," is full of romance, heartbreak and 
murderous passion.  
</P>
<P>
 The other, "Sunday Morning," contains some of the least-blithe spiritual music 
you'll ever hear. Stanley doesn't sing of comfortable people basking joyfully 
in the thought of heaven-to-come, but of folks for whom the here-and-now brings 
such hard trials and such severe temptations that perhaps only the prospect of 
a heavenly reward can keep them slogging on. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley says that "Saturday Night & Sunday Morning," which received three 
Grammy Award nominations, is the most popular release of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinarily, a big record in bluegrass would (sell) 30,000 pieces," said Dick 
Freeland, the record producer and label owner who worked with Stanley for 20 
years in the '60s and '70s, then came out of retirement to put out the two most 
recent Stanley albums on his West Virginia-based Freeland Recording Co. label. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday Night & Sunday Morning" has sold more than 100,000 copies, Freeland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley says he feels honored that some of country's biggest names would show 
such esteem for his music and the tradition it exemplifies. But he sounds most 
pleased that his 16-year-old son, Ralph II, is upholding the Stanley bluegrass 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the summer, he's been going on tour with me since he was 7 or 8 years 
old," Stanley said. For the past three years, Ralph II has stepped up to sing 
and play guitar on a few songs during his father's sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes the old-time bluegrass; it's what he listens to and what he's got on 
his mind," Stanley said. "He wants to continue on in it, so I want to get him 
all the exposure I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph II hasn't followed his father in every respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he doesn't play the banjo," Stanley said. "When he was 6 or 7 years old, 
he started to play the guitar. He said the banjo was too heavy for him. He 
thought he might do it later, but he never has. I'd like him to play the banjo, 
but if he likes the guitar, that's OK with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley got his early banjo lessons from his mother. According to an oft-told 
tale, when he was about 12 years old, his mother offered him a choice: She had 
$5 to spend for a gift, and he could have a banjo or a pig. Stanley loved 
animals and was enthusiastic about the agricultural programs he was enrolled in 
at school. But he took the banjo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He began to play it professionally in 1946, when he was discharged from the 
Army after a two-year hitch. Immediately upon returning home, he and Carter 
formed a group and began looking for playing opportunities. They landed a gig 
on WCYB radio in Bristol, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Their noon-hour show, "Farm and Fun Time," lasted 12 years. It served as a 
launching pad for live performances within the station's five-state reach and 
led to a recording deal with Columbia Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Monroe, the mandolin player who is acknowledged as the founder of 
bluegrass music, was also on Columbia Records, but he evidently was not pleased 
that the label would sign a second bluegrass act. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Columbia people told us if they signed the Stanley Brothers he would 
leave the label, and he did," Stanley recalled. "Way back in the early days 
there was a bit of jealousy, but it didn't amount to too much. Everybody got 
over it and patched it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe, now 82, is among Stanley's guests on "Saturday Night & Sunday 
Morning," and the banjo player says they are "the best of friends. I visited 
him a week ago (at Monroe's home outside of Nashville). He had an accident and 
broke his hip. He's walking on a walker, and he told me he'd be able to get out 
again and play in May." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Stanley was the Stanley Brothers' primary singer and songwriter. After 
his death in 1966, Ralph began a tradition of breaking in young 
singer-guitarists who would later go on to significant careers of their own in 
country or bluegrass. Ricky Skaggs and the late Keith Whitley were among those 
who served hitches as Clinch Mountain Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest version of the band features veteran bassist Jack Cooke, fiddler 
Art Stamper, who first played with Stanley in the 1950s, and two younger 
players: lead guitarist James Shelton and singer-guitarist Kenneth Davis. 
Stanley said that Davis, 32, had been trying to land a spot in his band for 10 
years before a slot recently opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley says he seldom has been at a loss when it comes to finding musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time people know when I need somebody, and most of the time 
there's always somebody a-waiting," he said. "The first thing I look at is 
character. I want to know if he drinks or whatever. I don't care how good he 
might be . . . if he has bad faults, I don't want him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Stanley plans to record another album, this one a reunion with 
alumni of the Clinch Mountain Boys. Meanwhile, there is more demand for his 
services than he can supply: "I've turned down over 20 bluegrass festivals for 
'94. There aren't enough weekends to play them." 
</P>
<P>
 One festival he never misses is the Memorial Day weekend event he has staged 
for the past 24 years on the site where he was raised. Stanley established the 
festival as a memorial to his brother, Carter. The past two years, Jeanie 
Stanley, Carter's 30-year-old daughter and an aspiring bluegrass performer, has 
been on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley says he has cut back his performing schedule a bit, but retirement 
isn't in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go on as long as I can do it justice and stand the pressure," he 
said. "The most pressure is traveling from place to place. I don't mind it 
after I get there. It's a pleasure to think you're pleasing people." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ralph Stanley & the Clinch Mountain Boys play Monday at 8 p.m. at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $15. (714) 496-8930.

AN APPRECIATION; A POET FOR THE DYSFUNCTIONAL AGE; POP MUSIC: NIRVANA'S KURT 
COBAIN WAS UNEASY WITH SUCCESS. BUT THIS RELUCTANT HERO SPOKE TO HIS GENERATION 
WITH THE IMPACT OF BOB DYLAN AND JOHN LENNON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain hated being called a spokesman for a generation -- even though he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 His tales of youthful alienation, especially the massive 1991 hit "Smells Like 
Teen Spirit," changed the direction of contemporary rock, but Cobain didn't 
feel he was worthy of being a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 A deeply sensitive man blessed with a songwriting grace that has been compared 
to Bob Dylan and John Lennon, Cobain, 27, was found dead Friday in his Seattle 
home, an apparent suicide victim.  
</P>
<P>
 When "Nevermind," the album containing "Smells Like Teen Spirit," made him 
rock's most acclaimed new singer-songwriter in years, he found it hard to 
adjust to the sudden acceptance. He felt as confused and troubled as any of the 
millions of young people who bought the albums he made with the band Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 He had gone through a difficult childhood, growing up in Aberdeen, Wa., 
without much self-worth or hope as he was shuttled between relatives -- until 
none would take him and he sought refuge in the homes of friends or, for a 
while, under a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevermind" sold nearly 10 million copies around the world and led critics to 
draw the parallels with Lennon and Dylan -- both in terms of craft and impact. 
</P>
<P>
 His uneasiness as a role model and star wasn't an act. At times, he simply 
retreated and pretended no one paid attention. But other times, he felt the 
burden of that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I met Cobain was in the fall of 1992. He hadn't done an 
interview in months, but was troubled by recurring rumors that identified him 
and wife Courtney Love, the rock singer and songwriter, as drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had run into a teen-ager who was on heroin at a club in Orange 
County a few nights before and the kid nodded at Cobain as if they were mates 
because of their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of young fans and I don't want to have anything to do with 
inciting drug use," he said in a soft, fragile voice that contrasted with his 
howling intensity on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 He then admitted using heroin in the past, but said he was doing it no longer. 
Referring to the couple's then 4-week-old daughter, he added, "I don't want 
people telling her that her parents were junkies." 
</P>
<P>
 In another interview last fall in Seattle, Cobain seemed uncharacteristically 
optimistic. "Once something like marriage and a baby happens to a person, you 
find a lot of strength that you didn't know you had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To the outside world, things continued to go well for Cobain. "In Utero," 
Nirvana's 1993 follow-up to "Nevermind" was another acclaimed best-seller. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rock world braced for the worst last month when Cobain was found in a 
near-fatal coma in his hotel room in Rome -- a result of a combination of 
tranquilizers and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning to Seattle, in the loneliness of his home, he apparently gave 
up on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 To many who weren't touched by his music, he will be dismissed as another rock 
'n' roll stereotype . . . a guy who was more lucky than talented, more 
indulgent than tormented. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was so much more. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pop world filled with pretenders and opportunists, Cobain was the real 
thing -- a unique and invaluable voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the conscious, literary edge of Dylan's work, Cobain tended to write in 
a fragmented manner that made him the almost ideal poet for this dysfunctional 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 His words could be shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could eat your cancer, when you turn black," sounds ugly and 
exploitative, but it was an attempt to express the almost irrational 
desperation of love. The line was written after he watched a TV documentary 
about a child with a terminal illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in his songs, he could be disarmingly personal ("I tried hard to 
have a father/ But I only had a dad") or stingingly sarcastic ("I wish I was 
like you / Easily amused"). 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday, his wife Courtney Love told me she worried about 
Cobain -- reminiscing between tears about the time she first heard his 
recording of "In Bloom," a song from the "Nevermind" album. (The interview was 
for a profile of Love that will appear in Sunday Calendar, which was printed 
before Cobain's death was known.)  
</P>
<P>
 "I was in England and depressed . . . listening to a lot of Aretha Franklin 
and the Staple Singers -- just music to make me feel better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard the song, I felt his voice . . . that presence . . . that 
sadness. You know the idea (that someone once wrote) that every abused child in 
America bought Nirvana's album? It's so right. I felt a comfort and soul in his 
voice . . . a solace that I needed." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a voice that is now gone.

TENORS STEP OUT TO BE SEEN, NOT HEARD 
</P>

 Through a miracle of modern-day opera-star logistics, it proved possible to 
assemble Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti (in alphabetical 
order), along with conductor, Zubin Mehta, to meet the press and the paparazzi 
Friday in Manhattan's most glamorous meeting place, the Rainbow Room at 
Rockefeller Center. The Three Tenors are back. 
</P>
<P>
 They startled the classical music world with untold riches in unprecedented 
worldwide sales of audio and video documents with their first meeting in Rome, 
in conjunction with the World Cup in soccer four years ago. Now they hope to 
repeat that success with an encore in Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Encore: The Three Tenors," which will be given the day before this year's 
World Cup final at the Rose Bowl, has already been advertised; and the less 
expensive seats, those ranging from $15 to $150, are sold out. But tickets for 
$300, $500 and $1,000 are still available, so now it was time to announce the 
details of the upcoming concert. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the details of the event are the glamour, which was in strong supply, 
as still and video photographers jockeyed for position. Actual facts, less so. 
No program yet, and the concluding medley -- which, in Rome, included 
everything from "Maria" to "Memory" to "O Sole Mio" -- will remain a secret 
until the performance. "I think most of the people will enjoy being surprised," 
Domingo suggested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known is that there will be two medleys this time, and Lalo Schifrin 
will arrange them, as he did the one in Rome. There will be no intermission, 
but rather a 15- minute, mid-point tribute to Gene Kelly, with the dancer, 
himself, overseeing a re-creation of his famous routine to Gershwin's "An 
American in Paris." The Los Angeles Philharmonic will be on hand, as will the 
Music Center Opera Chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert will, of course, be recorded live for distribution on home audio 
and video formats; and it will be broadcast to every corner of the known world. 
"We were considering putting the video in a space capsule and shooting it to 
outer space," joked Mehta, "but we were ruled out." 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a "Making of . . ." documentary. A new record label, 
Atlantic, will the release the album and video in the United States. This is a 
pop and jazz label, unlike, the classical London Records, which put out the 
first concert. 
</P>
<P>
 But from that point on things start to get vague. Tibor Rudas, the flamboyant 
presenter, boasts a state-of-the-art sound system, which will supposedly 
operate without amplification. The press release promises that every member of 
the 56,000-seat stadium will experience the event as if it were held in an 
intimate concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked exactly what that meant, Rudas replied that a bevy of engineers 
were already at work on the system, noting that Dodger Stadium is the best 
possible arena for the concert and "a heck of a lot better than a football 
stadium." No one, however, suggested that Dodger Stadium could compete with the 
historic splendor of the Baths of Caracalla, where the Rome concert was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Why an encore, beyond the expectation of making buckets of money? All three 
tenors seemed to indicate that soccer had something to do with it. "During 
these four years, we have had unbelievable offers around the world," Domingo 
said. "Anybody would be tempted by the amounts. But we kept the possibility for 
the right moment. We love soccer, love it deeply from our childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Charity, on the part of the tenors, does not, this time, seem to play the role 
it had in the first concert, where all three tenors made sizable humanitarian 
contributions (Carreras, who made a recovery from leukemia a few years ago, 
gave to his leukemia fund; Pavarotti, to a hospital in his hometown of Modena, 
Italy; and Domingo, to earthquake relief in Mexico City). "We are performing as 
professionals," is how Carreras puts it now, saying how the money will be spent 
is a personal decision for each one. 
</P>
<P>
 The following are other tidbits learned about the lives of the three tenors 
from a press conference that drew little music press (too low-brow for the 
classical music side, too classical for pop) but rather celebrity journalists 
and foreign correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three tenors get together (which is clearly seldom) what do they talk 
about? Music, a little; politics; society; sport; the ladies. Would Pavarotti 
like to sing with Barbra Streisand? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 What soccer teams are they rooting for? The obvious ones. Domingo is from 
Spain, but he is loyal, too, to Mexico, since he grew up in Mexico City. 
Carreras is from Barcelona, but could support Brazil if it were in the 
championship. Pavarotti is for Italy all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the Bombay-born Mehta. "In my country they play cricket," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the two towering waterfalls with bountiful greenery that 
will be part of the elaborate neoclassical stage setup (along with 20 columns). 
Won't the waterfalls make noise? 
</P>
<P>
 "A good question," said Pavarotti, confident that the engineers know what they 
are doing. "You will see water fall without water," Rudas explained, calling a 
halt to the proceeding -- and generating another rush of photographers -- 
before he would have to get any deeper into that . 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets to the Three Tenors concert: (213) 224-1448.

RICK DU BROW: CBS HAS DESIGNS ON 2 WOMEN; TELEVISION: PRODUCERS DIANE ENGLISH 
AND LINDA BLOODWORTH-THOMASON HELPED PUT THE NETWORK AT THE TOP. BUT CAN THEY 
WORK MORE MAGIC? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the verge of wrapping up its third consecutive prime-time ratings 
championship next weekend, CBS is hoping for some new program magic from two 
women who helped the network reach the top rung. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1990s began, the new pairing of Diane English's "Murphy Brown" and 
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason's "Designing Women" began to lift the long-dormant 
CBS, providing the base for a Monday lineup that soon would be a powerhouse, 
accompanied by such other series as "Northern Exposure," "Major Dad" and 
"Evening Shade." 
</P>
<P>
 When the 1992-93 prime-time season began, the two producers were red-hot and 
well-represented on CBS. English now had two series as "Love & War" joined 
"Murphy Brown." Bloodworth-Thomason had three: "Hearts Afire," "Evening Shade" 
and "Designing Women." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both had acquired high public profiles. English had duked it out 
verbally with former Vice President Dan Quayle, who raised the family values 
issue over the character of Murphy Brown, a single woman, deciding to have a 
baby. Bloodworth-Thomason and her producer-director husband, Harry Thomason, 
meanwhile, were becoming known for their friendship with, and significant TV 
assistance to, Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
 But back at CBS, the magic of their new comedy efforts wasn't quite what it 
used to be. Both "Love & War" and "Hearts Afire" took salvos for their risque 
tones, yet failed to generate real excitement and became erratic in the 
ratings. Both series did well enough if you go by the final ratings last 
season, but the success of "Love & War" has owed much to its choice spot after 
"Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 "Designing Women" eventually left the air. "Evening Shade," which stars its 
co-executive producer, Burt Reynolds, is still doing well, but 
Bloodworth-Thomason says that while she's proud of the show, she is not active 
in it creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Hearts Afire," in which she is very active and which stars John Ritter 
and Markie Post, it was revised -- moving from a Washington setting to a small 
town -- and has been bounced around the schedule this season, currently making 
a critical bid for fall renewal with a brief return to the Monday lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first Monday outing on March 28 -- replacing "Love & War" in the coveted 
post-"Murphy Brown" slot -- was a success as it ranked No. 11, although it is 
No. 84 for the season overall. And this coming Monday, "Hearts Afire" will have 
Rush Limbaugh as a guest, playing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 English, of course, would like her own "Love & War" to retain its slot after 
"Murphy Brown" next season. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while waiting to see just what CBS decides when it announces its fall 
lineup later this spring, English and Bloodworth-Thomason are also working on 
new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 English's company has a situation comedy candidate, "Double Rush," which she 
says is about a "bicycle messenger service in Manhattan. It's about people who 
live on the fringe of society, outsiders. It has a very MTV sound and feel to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodworth-Thomason, meanwhile, is also working up a situation comedy 
candidate called "Women of the House," set in Washington, which, of course, 
means that it would be bound to command at least initial attention from viewers 
for its content and attitude, given the producer's closeness to the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women of the House," says the producer, is like " 'Designing Women' set on 
the Potomac." It is, she says, about a woman who comes to Washington, a 
representative "taking over her deceased husband's seat. She comes with her 
adopted daughter and her retarded brother and she gets into a lot of trouble 
because she's very politically incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 The women working for her are a legislative aide, a press secretary and an 
office manager: "These women are the dregs of Congress. They've lost their jobs 
in other offices." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodworth-Thomason, working on the script this week, says she sent CBS "the 
first 30 pages" and aims to stir things up "without being partisan. Look, the 
President understands that everyone who's friends with him had other jobs 
before he became President. I'm a writer, and I'm going to keep on writing what 
I'm going to write. He would fully expect me to lampoon him. I think he would 
be disappointed if I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a show about Republicans and Democrats. I'm interested in 
Washington. A small group of people in that town set the agenda for the 
American people. I want to take a look at them. A lot of them are in the press 
corps. Maybe I'm wrong that this will be fun, but I'll try." 
</P>
<P>
 If the show does make it to CBS next season, "I'm not saying it will be right 
down the middle," says the producer. "In 'Designing Women,' I expressed my 
opinions all the time. I'm a liberal, but I'm very supportive of the death 
penalty. One of the best parts in the pilot (of 'Women of the House') is a 
speech on behalf of (the late) Pat Nixon. This show would be lousy if it didn't 
have any opinions in it. I've already told the President a few things that are 
in it and he laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 While English is awaiting a fall-season decision on "Love & War" and 
Bloodworth-Thomason is likewise trying to win a "Hearts Afire" renewal, Peter 
Tortorici, executive vice president of CBS Entertainment, makes clear that the 
producers' new projects must also prove themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 English said this week that "Double Rush" was in rehearsal. As for "Women of 
the House," Tortorici, noting that Bloodworth-Thomason was working on the 
script, said that "something that comes in at this point normally won't make 
(the fall lineup)," but he added that she has the reputation of being able to 
turn out shows fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether her involvement with the Clintons had affected her output as a 
TV producer, Bloodworth-Thomason says: "I know people have suggested that 
before. No, I really don't think it did. I know somebody at CBS might suggest 
that or think that, but my honest opinion is that it's just not true. You might 
be a little more tired." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she has written 30 of the 39 scripts thus far for "Hearts Afire" 
and that her husband has directed 36 of the episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 English, meanwhile, disagreed with the notion that the Quayle flap had taken 
some of the zip out of "Murphy Brown" because of the national debate over 
family values that it touched off. Although she turned the series creatively 
over to others in 1992 and it continued to draw audiences, it somehow lacked 
the same comedy pizazz for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an observer," she acknowledges, the problem revolved around how to handle 
Murphy Brown and her baby: "When I left the show, I left the people a very 
difficult assignment, to integrate that baby into a series that essentially was 
about a single woman with no attachments. And I think the people who were there 
would admit it wasn't done in a way that people felt comfortable with, and the 
public sensed that. But this season, there was a marked improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that "Murphy Brown," now in its sixth season, has a commitment for two 
more years, English says: "The fifth season dropout rate was due in a sense to 
the fact that it wasn't the same show. There were a lot of shows that were just 
about Murphy and the baby, and other (episodes) that totally ignored that she 
had had a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers out there said this just isn't realistic -- she's coming to work on 
time and doesn't seem to have household help. And others felt there was too 
much about her being a mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This last season was more realistic. There were less programs that featured 
the baby at the center of the show but as someone else (Murphy) was accountable 
to. Most important, it was not about a mother who happened to have a job, but 
about a woman who had a job who also wanted to be a good mother." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, did Quayle's attack wound "Murphy Brown" at all, as some observers 
think? "I don't believe there was any real moral judgment by the tried-and-true 
'Murphy Brown' audience," says English. In retrospect, was it a plot mistake to 
introduce the baby? "Absolutely not," says the producer.

GOING FOR A BRASS RING; CLASSICAL MUSIC: FOR 23 YEARS, THE CANADIAN HORN 
QUINTET HAS ENJOYED MAKING ACCESSIBLE ARRANGEMENTS -- IN DEFIANCE OF PURISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine doing your best to make classical music more accessible, and then 
coming under fire for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Canadian Brass, though universally conceded to be at the top of 
their field in terms of music-making, have suffered their colleagues' slings 
and arrows for just that subversive activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilty as charged, says Canadian Brass trumpeter Ronald Romm, whose group 
performs Sunday in Costa Mesa under the auspices of the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're jealous," he said by phone from his home in Clearwater, Fla. "You see 
the program. It's very serious in terms of the music we play -- music by Bach, 
Gabrieli, contemporary composers. We just take the mystery and boredom out of 
the concert. It's the in-between pieces, the introductions, that make it 
interesting for the masses." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Gabrieli's Canzona, "La Spiritata," and Charles Ives' Variations on 
"America," the program includes arrangements of the Overture to Mozart's "Magic 
Flute"; "Summer" from Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons"; music inspired by Bach's 
"Anna Magdalena Notebook," and highlights from Verdi's opera "Rigoletto." 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that their detractors object to all those arrangements of 
compositions not written for horns? Purists, of course, would prefer "The Four 
Seasons" played on violins. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, they'd better take issue with the Gabrieli work as well, according to 
Romm, 47. For although Gabrieli wrote his pieces for sackbuts (an early version 
of the trombone) and natural trumpets, they didn't sound anything like 
contemporary instruments either. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to actually make an authentic treatment, you'd have to only play 
contemporary music," Romm said. "But great music is great music. It should be 
played on as many vehicles that will carry it. What are the purists being pure 
about (except) their own stuffiness?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian Brass -- Romm and Frederic Mills, trumpets; David Ohanian, horn; 
Eugene Watts, trombone, and Charles Daellenbach, tuba -- is credited with 
establishing the brass quintet as a viable concert medium. 
</P>
<P>
 They're hoping to establish it as something more than viable.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to keep coming to concerts, and not 50 at a time," Romm said, 
"more like 5,000 at a time. There's always a basketball game with 10,000 people 
going and a football game with 50,000. And people can stay home and watch the 
tube. We have to be interesting in our concerts. Is that wrong? I don't think 
it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 It's how they make their concerts appealing that also bugs purists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good time," he said. "We poke fun at ourselves. We do opera, for 
instance. . . . To portray the characters, we do what we can. We dress up in 
wigs." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides performing and recording, the Canadian Brass has grown to include 
successful publishing (of music and arrangements for brass) and 
instrument-manufacturing enterprises. The group's discography now numbers 30; 
its latest release was an album of Wagner for brass on the Philips Classics 
label, and Gabrieli is next. Tours this season include the United States, 
Canada and Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 The various business concerns hardly detract from one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music we publish is the music we perform," he said. "The instruments we 
sell are the instruments we play. The business of the business is improving 
nicely -- (especially) keeping in mind that musicians are never taught the 
business of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Romm, sales of brass instruments are doing well in general, and, 
as might be expected, he thinks highly of the group's own line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've spent the last 23 years playing every brand of instrument, learning 
what we could learn," Romm said. "Before, you either had an easy-blowing 
instrument with a bright, thin, edgy tone, or you had a nice sound that was 
hard to blow. To have an easy-blowing instrument, you had to sacrifice 
fullness. That's no longer the case." 
</P>
<P>
 The quintet asked a family-owned concern in Wisconsin to make trumpets, 
trombones and tubas to its specifications, and European companies to make 
euphoniums and French horns. The handcrafted instruments -- except for the 
more-expensive tuba that can cost in "the thousands but not several thousands" 
of dollars -- today bear the name Canadian Brass Musical Instrument Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Romm invites musicians to sample the wares: "Tell the brass players to bring 
their mouthpieces to the concert. If there isn't a display (of the instruments) 
at the hall, tell them to bring them anyway -- they can try mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the group's business acumen, it has been asked to help prepare 
students for music-world realities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often we're parachuted into music schools to talk about the music business, 
simply because we've learned about it," Romm said. "We talk about programming, 
about dealing with the sponsor and symphony orchestra union rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The string quartet as a chamber music ensemble dates back centuries, the brass 
quintet only decades. While it's hard to imagine a string quartet donning wigs 
for an opera spoof, Romm doesn't attribute his group's antics to adolescent 
silliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brass player has a different personality from a string player," he said. 
"But you have to consider other factors, starting with repertoire. Early jazz 
and Dixieland, that's our classical repertory. We can go out there and play 
music of Duke Ellington and play this music proudly as our American classical 
music. Forty years ago, Gershwin was Broadway material. Now it's at the 
Metropolitan Opera." 
</P>
<P>
 And 23 years ago, the Canadian Brass was somewhat Canadian. Daellenbach taught 
at the University of Toronto, and Watts played in the Toronto Symphony. Romm, 
however, grew up in Los Angeles -- he attended Westchester High School and USC 
-- and Mills is the only member of the group who was born in Canada. Their 
offices are in Wisconsin and all live in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceded Romm, "Now we're the international Canadian Brass." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Canadian Brass performs Charles Ives' Variations on "America," Dixieland 
selections by Luther Henderson and a bevy of arrangements Sunday at 8 p.m. at 
the Orange County performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Tickets, $11-$30. Phone (714) 553-2422.

COWBOY JUNKETS; THE GROUP TAKES A LITTLE PLEASURE TRIP THROUGH THE LAND OF 
POWER CHORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When they toured in 1989, riding the success of their breakthrough album, "The 
Trinity Session," Cowboy Junkies were hawking souvenir T-shirts that would have 
warmed a librarian's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shhhhh," read the T-shirt slogan, which couldn't have been more appropriate 
to the Toronto rock band's internalized, ruminative take on its country, folk 
and blues influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, five years on, Cowboy Junkies is announcing itself with a clannng -- 
which is more or less the sound of the thick power chords that open the band's 
latest album, "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 By the album's end, Margo Timmins, the singer known for her preternatural 
hush, can be heard declaring herself with assertive bite:  
</P>
<P>
 It's a (expletive) ole world  
</P>
<P>
 But this ole girl, well she ain't giving in.  
</P>
<P>
 While Cowboy Junkies hasn't exactly turned into a hard-rock band (the closely 
drawn, highly literate, mood-conscious internal monologue remains the signature 
of the band's style), those aggressive opening and closing moments do signal a 
desire to avoid being typecast as that whispering band that found success by 
recording in an echoing church. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this album, we definitely wanted to bring up the volume a bit," said 
guitarist Michael Timmins, Margo's older brother and, as Cowboy Junkies' 
songwriter and record producer, the leading architect of the band's sound. The 
group performs tonight and Sunday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been moving away from the 'Trinity Session' feel for a while. With 
every record, we've tried to add a different element," he said. "The idea of a 
power-chord opening (for the new album) was a conscious thought." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent phone interview from a tour stop in Wisconsin, Timmins said that 
his sister has had to put conscious effort into singing some of the 
more-demanding roles he has written for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones she has the easiest time on are the straight love songs. Temperament 
wise, she's very mild and mellow, and she'd prefer to sing ballads," he said. 
"If somebody would let her, she'd sing ballads all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Michael has presented Margo with such songs as "Hunted" and 
"Floorboard Blues," the concluding tracks that give the current album an eerie 
final twist. Most of the songs on "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon" are evocative 
snapshots of relationships in jeopardy. But the characters of the two final 
songs are women who fear they are being stalked by rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 To sing them, Timmins said, Margo "has to find a spot that isn't natural to 
her. She just has to stretch herself a bit. If she has to stretch her style, 
it's more interesting for me and for her. Usually, she ends up giving the most 
interesting bperformances (on) the ones she has to work hardest on to find the 
character, to find her way into the song." 
</P>
<P>
 The creative process can get testy for rock bands in which one member writes 
the songs while somebody else sings them. The Who was legendary for its tussles 
between writer Pete Townshend and singer Roger Daltrey, and serious fallout 
developed in the Band between Robbie Robertson, who wrote the songs, and other 
members who sang them. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Timmins notes that people might assume working relationships would be 
even more explosive within Cowboy Junkies, where sibling rivalries are added to 
the usual tinder that sets off internal flare-ups (besides Michael, 35, and 
Margo, 33, the core lineup includes younger brother Peter Timmins, 28, on 
drums, and bassist Alan Anton). 
</P>
<P>
 But so, far, he said, Cowboy Junkies has enjoyed a relatively unruffled 
nine-year existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been at it as long as the Who and the Band were. But I think in 
our case, the brother-and-sister relationship makes it less (tense), because we 
understand each other very well. Our personalities don't seem to conflict. We 
all have our roles and like what we do, and give each other enough space." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Timmins, who grew up in Montreal, "was always fascinated by music. I 
remember asking to get the (Beatles') 'white album' for Christmas when I was 9 
years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his friend Anton, he went off to pursue that fascination during the 
early 1980s in bands based in New York and London. Returning to Canada in 1985, 
they formed Cowboy Junkies, with Peter drumming and Margo, a rock 'n' roll 
novice, fronting the band. 
</P>
<P>
 The Junkies' 1986 debut album, "Whites Off Earth Now!!" consisted almost 
entirely of old blues covers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We never started with the intention of working on our own material," Timmins 
said. "I'd just come from a band that was totally instrumental. I'd written 
songs before but got bored with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing blues material, he said, "gave Margo the opportunity to work on melody 
ideas and fool around with her voice without worrying too much what the lyrics 
were. With those blues songs, she could take those words and use them as a 
vehicle for her voice. When we were comfortable with what we were doing 
musically, I began writing again, and the narrative elements began to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Few rock songwriters who have emerged since the late '80s take the care 
Timmins displays in etching his songs with the sort of narrative detail 
normally employed by prose storytellers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical Cowboy Junkies song, you know what the weather is -- there are 
hints that allow you to visualize settings and conceive a picture of the 
characters in them. The emotional weather they're facing also becomes clear, 
but Timmins often will leave out a key element of plot, leaving to the 
listener's imagination the specific turn of events that has brought his 
characters to a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know precisely what crisis the couple in "Ring on the Sill" faces, 
only that they realize their marriage stands in the balance, and that it's a 
terribly scary moment for them. In "Seven Years," the damage already has been 
done between 
</P>
<P>
 the song's narrator and her estranged child. Timmins doesn't tell us what has 
passed, but we see the emotional fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to take a certain element of a life and focus in great detail on that 
slice of life," he said. "And I'll leave it to the listener to extrapolate into 
the future and the past. If I've drawn the picture well enough, the listener 
can let those characters move out of that scene and take them where they want 
to take them." 
</P>
<P>
 That approach hasn't taken "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon" into the upper reaches of 
the pop charts (it peaked at No. 114 on the Billboard's album chart), and 
Timmins acknowledges there is a tension between investing a song with narrative 
acuity and detail, and investing it with pop appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some songs, like in 'Anniversary Song,' where I'm attempting to 
write a pop song," Timmins said, referring to a bright, catchy track from the 
new album that sounds like a marriage of Motown and 10,000 Maniacs. "But I 
still want my detail. There are a lot of lyrics and imagery in there, which I 
like. There's a little more to it than the average pop song." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other instances, he said, the band has dropped pop elements from an 
arrangement because they took away from the mood of a narrative. Referring to 
the single from the group's 1992 album, "Black Eyed Man," Timmins said: " 'A 
Horse in the Country' didn't do well at radio, and I could have made it more 
radio-friendly by repeating the chorus or getting to the chorus sooner," 
Timmins said. "There were more hooks, but we felt it didn't add to the song, so 
we took them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Timmins says that the astonishing success of "The Trinity Session" positioned 
Cowboy Junkies to be able to make choices on the basis of artistic 
considerations instead of commercial ones. The now-legendary album, cut live in 
a single 14-hour session in a Toronto church, cost $250 to produce and went on 
to sell almost 1 million copies. "It establishes you with the record company," 
Timmins said. "They haven't put a lot of money into it, but they've made a lot 
off of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for "Trinity II," though. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we wanted to do that, we could never do it," he said. "That was a 
special recording, done in total anonymity and without any expectation." 
</P>

 Wrong Foundation -- The National Health Foundation referred to in a story in 
the Valley Edition of the Los Angeles Times on April 1 is not the National 
Health Foundation based in Los Angeles. The former was cited in a lawsuit by 
the U.S. Department of Labor as part of a health-care plan that allegedly 
bilked contributors out of $1.1 million. The Los Angeles-based NHF, a nonprofit 
organization located at 201 N. Figueroa St., is not associated with the 
American Healthcare Underwriting Managers, Inc., and has not been accused of 
any wrongdoing.
