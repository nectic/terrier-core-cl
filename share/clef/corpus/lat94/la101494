THEATER REVIEWS; TOO MANY CHANGES SPOIL SLADE'S 'SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Same Time, Next Year" was the first play Bernard Slade wrote after making his 
name and fortune creating the television hit "Happy Days" and others. 
</P>
<P>
 His switch to live theater has provided some very viable stage sitcoms that 
often go beyond that genre in tone and intent. 
</P>
<P>
 In this production of "Same Time," at the Theatre District, director Mario 
Lescot takes a level-headed and amused look at Slade's episodic comic chronicle 
about Doris (Karen Mangano) and George (David Rousseve), a couple who found 
each other for a one-night stand and kept it going for a quarter-century. Their 
problem is that both are married to someone else. Each year, while Doris is 
supposedly on a retreat, and George is doing the accounts for an old friend, 
they spend a deliriously happy weekend together at a country inn in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of any production is the ability of the two actors, beyond a comic 
sensibility, to accomplish the interior aging of the couple and to fathom the 
subtext Slade has provided. Mangano and Rousseve ride the fun and the years 
easily and have a definite charm that overrides the couple's progress through 
not only their assignations but the continuing history of their own families as 
time goes by. They're funny and warm and true. 
</P>
<P>
 But the staging is so overproduced as to minimize their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The country inn cottage looks more like a Chicago bordello room, with great 
swags of material everywhere, not posh, but very ripe. Lescot has also seen fit 
to insert interminable slide shows between the six scenes, illustrating current 
events in each era. They're boring and old hat and destroy the dramatic and 
comic through-line Slade so artfully set up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, Lescot has had the effrontery to rewrite Slade's play. The inn's 
proprietor, Mr. Chalmers, never appears on stage, that is until this 
production, where he minces in and out with a feather duster and passes the 
time of day.  
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, Lescot has added two chambermaids who make up the bed, moon about 
and discuss their own affairs before each scene. Slade did not write any of 
this drivel, and the actors involved would be better utilized off-stage, 
helping with the quick changes necessary to keep Slade's tempos where they 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the slides and Lescot's "improvements" are not bad enough themselves, 
they add almost an hour to what is really a rather short play. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; BERKOFF'S 'ONE MAN' DELIGHTS IN KOOKY WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a performer, British director-playwright Steven Berkoff is an odd mix of 
brilliant mime, bawdy vaudevillian and obnoxious child. A really obnoxious 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known here for staging his long-running "Kvetch" at the Odyssey Theatre, 
Berkoff's adaptations of Kafka, Aeschylus and Poe and his direction of 
Shakespeare plays have garnered him an international reputation. The 
repetitive, overly stylized vision that made several of his recent directorial 
efforts so tedious, including a 1989 "Metamorphosis" on Broadway starring 
Baryshnikov and last spring's "Richard II" at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in 
New York, somehow invest his one-man show, "One Man," with a hypnotic humor -- 
weird, dark and totally original. 
</P>
<P>
 "One Man," which is part of the UK/LA Festival and continues tonight and 
Sunday night at UCLA's Freud Playhouse, has three parts. The first, a rendition 
of Edgar Allan Poe's "Telltale Heart," is the theatrical equivalent of a 
late-night reading by flashlight performed by an obsessed teen-ager trying out 
voices and meters and storytelling style, or, by a mental patient who's 
deliriously happy to portray a narrator so close to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a clenched voice, Berkoff will inexplicably drop one word in a 
sentence to a slow-speed rumbling growl. His rhythms -- he breaks up words to 
Philip Glass' metronome -- his robotic movements, his elongated, variant 
giggles, his play with the text, are all true to Poe while remaining 
egocentrically Berkoff. And, like the ghoulish child that is lost to most of 
us, Berkoff takes special joy in physical tasks such as sawing off a leg while 
making noises to indicate he is cutting first through the flesh, then through 
the bone, then flesh again. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking like a deranged, New Age Vincent Price in shabby black tails and 
powder-white skin, Berkoff sticks out his red tongue and waves it for an 
improbably long interval at the word hell . Part of the comedy comes from his 
taking such an extraordinarily long time to do and say certain things, which 
makes this one-hour segment both very funny in parts but too long overall. 
Also, the pacing and mood don't shift at all during natural breaks in the 
story, such as when the murder is committed or when the police come. Berkoff 
seems wedded to his internal timing, regardless of what is happening in the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second part, Berkoff's own piece called "The Actor," is a fascinating, 
bleak look at the treadmill of the actor who is perpetually "at liberty." 
Berkoff ambles along in a hilarious, stationary walk to the beat of a cool jazz 
riff. He throws congenial nods at fellow actors to whom he then gives the 
finger as soon as they're out of sight. He picks up women, marries them, 
divorces them, goes to visit his shrinking, elderly parents, never wishes 
another actor anything but failure and continually gets cut off at every 
audition for "Hamlet" with a brisk "Thank You!" while trying to sneak in just 
another word or two of a soliloquy. Berkoff plays all parts without missing a 
beat, which is how he makes entertainment out of such a bleak and shallow 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, "Dog" tells the story of a nasty punker and his even nastier dog, 
presumably a pit bull. Berkoff plays both parts and has a great bit when the 
master tries to teach the dog to sit quietly without sneering. This segment 
also features an extended routine involving barf, so go forewarned.  
</P>
<P>
 "What you have mistaken for madness is but an overactiveness of the senses," 
says Berkoff in the Poe part of the evening, perhaps explaining his affinity 
for the Gothic author. In "One Man," Berkoff offers his particular 
overactiveness; it makes a fine madness. 
</P>
<P>
 * "One Man," Freud Playhouse, UCLA Campus, tonight at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m. $25. 
(310) 825-2101. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.

SALONEN RETURNS TO MAHLER'S MIGHTY THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gustav Mahler's mighty, sprawling, pensive, virtually endless, sometimes 
gnarled, alternately intimate and grandiose, ultimately thunderous Symphony No. 
3 has served as something of a signature piece for Esa-Pekka Salonen. 
</P>
<P>
 The young maestro -- virtually unknown and either preposterously foolhardy or 
preposterously naive -- assumed the challenge for the first time on short 
notice at a London concert in 1983, replacing an indisposed colleague. The 
visiting Finn's success was tumultuous, against all odds. The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, no doubt, Salonen chose the same symphony to inaugurate his 
tenure as 10th music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic two seasons ago, 
and he subsequently used it as a calling card with his California band at the 
Lucerne Festival. The lightning has struck consistently, again and again, in 
the same musical place. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Salonen dared history to 
repeat itself. And, after a bracing fashion, it did. 
</P>
<P>
 Two basic, essentially dissimilar schools of Mahler conducting have evolved 
over the past decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular interpreters -- Leonard Bernstein and his conspicuously 
perspiring emulators -- pull out all the emotional stops, and sometimes gild 
the expressive lily. In their hyper-romantic approach to Gargantuan glory, 
there is no such thing as too much. 
</P>
<P>
 The more intellectual Mahlerites -- with cool Pierre Boulez at the head of the 
class -- strive for objectivity and restraint. The composer has built his 
essential message into the score, they reason, and the heroic rhetoric benefits 
from toning down. Less, they insist, is more. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen seems to strive for a middle ground between these extremes. He gives 
the zonking apparatus its due yet inclines, wherever possible, toward 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 A stylistic quibbler might wish for a little more expansion -- temporal as 
well as dynamic -- in the ultimate, long-delayed climaxes, and, perhaps, a bit 
more serenity in the introspective passages. Mahler knew what he wanted when he 
issued the instruction "ohne Hast" (without haste). Sitting back, relaxing and 
enjoying the episodic ride would not seem to be Salonen's favorite musical 
pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 This maestro strives for cohesion over the 100-minute haul, and he savors 
tension in the process. He sustains steadfast clarity while tracing the most 
devious architectural detours and lucidity even when exploring the wildest 
orchestral thicket. He overlooks few details, allows no faking. Obviously, he 
is a musician who finds easy effects difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 His Mahler Third is stern yet heroic, relatively calm yet poignant. It makes 
emphatic sense on its own specific terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic followed Salonen's precise commands on Wednesday with 
faithful ardor, even though the playing wasn't always notable for neatness in 
depth. Monica Groop, the young Finnish mezzo-soprano who will replace Elise 
Ross as Debussy's Melisande with the Music Center Opera in February, sang her 
philosophical solos with opulent tone, impeccable poise and perfectly muted 
drama. The women of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, joined by the Los Angeles 
Children's Chorus, brought angelic cheer to their "Wunderhorn" interjections. 
</P>
<P>
 The eager Wednesday-nighters mustered mood-shattering applause after nearly 
every cadence. Oddly, Salonen did little to discourage the disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salonen and the L.A. Philharmonic repeat Mahler's Third Symphony at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center today at 1:30 p.m. and Saturday 
night at 8. Tickets $6-$50 at the box office and commercial outlets.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'FICTION': QUENTIN TARANTINO'S GANGSTER RAP; SURE, THE DIRECTOR 
CAN WRITE. BUT DOES HE DESERVE ALL THE HYPE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story is told of a crusty Midwestern newspaper editor who returned to work 
after a vacation and threw a fit. His prize headline type, enormous letters 
he'd been holding back for years for a truly big event, were used in his 
absence on a story detailing serious tornado damage. "You young fool," he 
snapped at the offending party, "I was saving that type for the Second Coming." 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment it hit the screen at Cannes, even before it was awarded that 
festival's celebrated Palme d'Or, "Pulp Fiction" and its writer-director 
Quentin Tarantino have been given the big-type, Second Coming treatment, 
drenching them in the kind of media awe and appreciation reserved for paradigms 
of cinematic accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, like that tornado, Tarantino is quite an event, a gifted writer and 
a man of filmmaking talent whose work both here and elsewhere can be 
impressive. But despite all the attention, this is not the resurrection of 
anything. "Pulp Fiction's" anthology of stories about gangster fun and games in 
Los Angeles doesn't merit sustained veneration. 
</P>
<P>
 Because "Pulp Fiction" is sporadically effective, the temptation to embrace 
the entire two hours and 29 minutes of Tarantiniana is strong. But in truth 
this is a noticeably uneven film, both too inward-looking and self-centered in 
its concerns and too outward-bound in the way it strains to outrage an 
audience, to be successful across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about "Pulp Fiction," as with Tarantino's debut film, 
"Reservoir Dogs," are its words. They flow in hip torrents that are both 
idiosyncratic and familiar from lowlife characters who love to talk and can 
erupt in entertaining riffs on any subject on no notice at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The film's opening scene, for instance, shot in a simple two-shot that ensures 
the audience concentrate on the dialogue, has a pair of amateur heisters, 
Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer), talking with engaging 
bravado about the vagaries of small-time robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Pulp's" roster of criminals rarely talk shop; philosophical and even 
theological questions about loyalty, morality and the nature of miracles are 
their metier. This is more fun than it may sound because actors invariably 
spark to Tarantino's words, finding in them the kind of wicked twists that 
makes them a kick to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially true of the two actors who appear most in "Pulp's" series 
of independent but interrelated stories, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. 
They play Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, respectively, hired muscle for 
Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), local crime lord, who make small talk about 
the erotic nature of foot massage before "getting into character" and ruining 
several people's day. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Jackson gives a strong performance, Travolta ends up being more 
memorable only because his work is more of a surprise. His Vincent Vega is all 
sleepy boyishness and drug-mellowed bemusement, and seeing him so charming in 
the unexpected guise of a minor league thug is to remember why audiences fell 
in love with him in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But since Vincent and Jules are hit men, albeit romanticized ones, "Pulp 
Fiction's" stories have violence at their core (running the gamut from the 
threat of gunplay to assaultive, occasionally racist language and cascades of 
blood and brain matter), and this is where the film's problems begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Tarantino likes to tease audiences into somnolence before sneaking in 
an explosive jolt, the carnage is not as nonstop as in "Natural Born Killers," 
but there nevertheless is something wearing and repetitive about the film's 
reliance on shock value and bad-boy posturing to maintain our attention. 
</P>
<P>
 And while one of the attractions of "Reservoir Dogs" was that its disturbing 
scenes seemed to flow out of Tarantino's natural exuberance, in "Pulp Fiction" 
the writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, 
especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the 
uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who is afraid of 
losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this rather poignant is that what is felt most in "Pulp Fiction" is 
the hand of a filmmaker who loves movies past. Names like Douglas Sirk pop up 
in unlikely places, and the visual references or homages to a wide variety of 
films are too numerous to catalogue, even if one has seen enough celluloid to 
be sure of catching them all. 
</P>
<P>
 But while "Pulp Fiction's" best scenes, including Travolta and Uma Thurman as 
the boss's wife doing a languid twist, and a deadpan monologue from Christopher 
Walken about a prized gold watch, are informed with the director's personal 
sense of movie history, the personal has a tendency to turn uncomfortably 
solipsistic. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, especially in the scenes involving Bruce Willis as a nervy boxer, 
can be long patches of dialogue that must have tickled Tarantino but will not 
necessarily resonate for anyone else. The word tedious has not been much used 
in describing "Pulp Fiction," but there are extended moments when it fits 
rather too well. 
</P>
<P>
 So while seeing where "Pulp Fiction" is coming from is easy, guessing where 
Quentin Tarantino is headed is more difficult. A gifted mimic who knows how to 
make lively collages out of movie history, he seems unconcerned that his films 
feel more like heartless dead-ends than an opening to something new and 
involving. 
</P>
<P>
 And though in a rare plaintive moment in a recent interview Tarantino talked 
of his future and said, "I don't want to just be the gun guy," the evidence 
that he can live without the rush that violence or its threat brings is not 
convincing. If the kind of work Tarantino does best is where American 
filmmaking is heading, it will have to get there without me. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong 
language and some sexuality. Times guidelines: The violence, including a scene 
of homosexual rape, is more of a shock because of its sporadic appearance.

ACCLAIMED 'HOMICIDE' HOPING TO STAY ALIVE; TELEVISION: NBC HASN'T GIVEN THE 
HIGHLY REGARDED SERIES A HIGH PROFILE, BUT IT HAS STUCK WITH IT. TONIGHT, THE 
SHOW'S SEASON OPENS WITH A FEW 'REFINEMENTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" won the big ratings. "Picket Fences" again won the Emmy. But what 
some critics regard as the best drama on television won nothing last season 
except a quiet nod of "What the heck, let's take a gamble" from its network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notoriously, anything that's different takes time, is going to be a 
struggle," said Barry Levinson, the Oscar-winning director and executive 
producer of NBC's "Homicide: Life on the Street." 
</P>
<P>
 "And you have to surmise that there is going to be fear both on the part of 
the audience and the network. It just comes with the turf." 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide" returns tonight after a nine-month absence. It was on for just four 
episodes last January -- not much of a second season, after a nine-episode 
trial in early 1993 that included a ballyhooed premiere following the Super 
Bowl and then a luckless run against ABC's "Home Improvement," TV's top-rated 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem -- at least in snatching a large TV audience -- isn't just a bad 
time slot. "Homicide" is a cop show without any shootouts, chases down dark 
alleys or high-speed car accidents. It's a who-done-it show in which many of 
the cases remain unsolved at the end of the hour. The characters in its 
ensemble cast of homicide detectives are complex, distinct and vivid 
individuals who don't behave predictably -- more like characters out of a good 
novel than the recognizable and often cliched tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold or 
alcoholic-on-the-wagon curmudgeon types that people most police series. 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically, the show is also unlike anything else, sometimes requiring 
viewers to work to understand what is going on amid the gritty lighting, the 
hand-held, whirling camerawork and the jump-cut editing. And, though the TV 
maxim states that women generally control what gets watched in most homes, this 
is a show about a man's world that until now had just one female regular. 
</P>
<P>
 "No wonder it's rough. Look at what's on television at just about any hour," 
said Daniel Baldwin, who plays one of the homicide detectives. "Excluding some 
news and educational programs, it's about 90% crap, and you're dealing with an 
audience that is willing to watch crap. Very few people out there today are 
interested in the art of listening anywhere in their lives, and our show 
requires you to sit and listen and think, and afterward to perhaps digest. You 
can't be chatting on the phone or balancing your checkbook at the same time. 
That is a lot to ask. Maybe we're all (expletive) crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 But NBC isn't going to settle for crazy just yet. Though it has seemingly 
waffled on its support for the show, the network decided it couldn't give up on 
what Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment, called "a compelling 
show with an on-screen power filled with humor, compassion and voices that make 
it truly stand apart in its look and feel from anything else we've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide," did, however, require some "refinements," Littlefield said. First, 
because not enough women were watching, Isabella Hofmann was added to the cast 
as the co-director of the homicide department, sharing the top job with last 
year's honcho, played by Yaphet Kotto. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, each episode will contain fewer story lines, fewer fragments of cases 
from all the myriad detectives in the bureau, with each of the stories played 
out more fully. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the style of the filmmaking will be restrained a bit -- with more 
primary colors added and fewer camera moves and jump cuts to make it less 
choppy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we turn it into 'Matlock'? No," Littlefield said. "I don't think any 
purists who have embraced 'Homicide' will say, 'Oh, my God. What have they 
done?' This isn't ever going to be cookie-cutter TV. For an audience that is 
looking for a beginning, middle and end, and 'That wraps up another case -- 
book 'em, Dano,' this isn't it. Even though we are a cop show, we don't have to 
play by the same rules. It's a gamble we are prepared to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson and Henry Bromell, the co-executive producer who oversees the 
day-to-day production of the show in Baltimore with executive producer and head 
writer Tom Fontana, said the adjustments will not compromise the series in any 
way.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'NYPD Blue' is wonderfully written and acted television, but it's 
unrealistic. There is a lot of gun play and they generally catch the guy in an 
hour," Baldwin said. "We stick to the reality of this world. We don't have 
anyone riding in on a white horse to save the day." 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide" is about the chess-playing, the inductive reasoning, the lucky and 
unlucky breaks detectives experience as they try to piece together a murder. 
Their lives are filled with victims, bodies that have been dead long before the 
detectives arrive on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most interesting things about people who do this, what it's like 
to be a homicide cop, is that these people will one hour be staring something 
absolutely horrifying in the face and an hour later they'll be taking their kid 
to a ballgame or trying to get their car back from an ex-wife," Bromell said.  
</P>

 They will also try what Baldwin called "typical TV chicanery" to lure 
additional viewers. In a surprise twist in the first episode, the new female 
boss gets romantically involved with one of her subordinates. And in episode 
13, if the show survives the ratings wars that long, Alec Baldwin, the movie 
star brother of Daniel Baldwin, will make a guest appearance.

 Levinson, interviewed while wrapping up work on his new movie starring Demi 
Moore and Michael Douglas, complained that while it is valiant and noble for 
NBC to have stuck with such an atypical series, the network has not done much 
to let people know the show still exists. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, for example, has aired "Picket Fences" -- "Homicide's" competitor on 
Fridays this season -- on different nights, in late night and in summer reruns, 
to help bring exposure to this lauded drama that has had some similar ratings 
problems. NBC, on the other hand, decided not to air reruns of "Homicide" this 
summer, Littlefield said, because "we wanted to make a fresh start (with these 
new, refined episodes) and put our best foot forward."  
</P>
<P>
 "If there is any justice in the world, we'll do a whole season and let the 
people decide," Baldwin said. "We misuse the power of this incredible force 
called television too often. We could use it for positive messages about 
pertinent issues like AIDS or politics, but we don't. I like to think that 
'Homicide' brings up some significant moral issues, human issues, and even if 
you don't agree with our take on them, at least someone is doing something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Homicide: Life on the Street" airs at 10 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 
39).

lowest-rated series. The announcement was made Thursday, three days after Fox 
executives met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had criticized the network for 
canceling four series with predominantly black casts last season. . . . NBC, 
meanwhile, said it will switch time slots for two of its lowest-rated programs. 
Beginning Oct. 22, "Empty Nest" will air Saturdays at 8 p.m., with "Something

criminal forfeiture of the assets of Alfonso P. Cacace, whom they say stole 
more than $3 million in money, bonds, jewelry, antiques and furniture from Mrs. 
Falk. The chain of events began in 1992, when Peter Falk put his mother in a 
nursing home because of her failing health. But three months later, prosecutors 
say, Cacace arranged to have Mrs. Falk discharged from the home without Falk's 
knowledge. A neighbor later reported that Mrs. Falk's antiques were missing and 
movers were packing crates inside her apartment. Cacace's lawyer said the 
allegations "are motivated by resentment" because Cacace "cared for Mrs. Falk 
in the absence of her family members."

MOVIE REVIEW; NOVEL TWISTS POWER CRAVEN'S 'NIGHTMARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freddy Krueger fans will exult and horror movie mavens will not be surprised: 
"Wes Craven's New Nightmare" is much better than the usual run of scare 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven directed the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, still by far the 
best, but had no real involvement in any of the five sequels. His "New 
Nightmare" draws on some Old Nightmares from the series but also gets at 
something new to the genre. It's a complicated, tricky attempt to bring out the 
elements of horror movie-making in a way that's deliberately self-conscious. 
It's post-modernism for the mall crowd -- a movie-within-a-movie-about-a-movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise is that Freddy is not a movie monster but an archetypal demon who, 
now that the "Nightmare" series has ended, has become unleashed into the real 
world via Craven's new script. He infects the dreams of the family of the 
actress -- Heather Langenkamp -- in the original "Nightmare." (She was also in 
"Part 3" but who, besides Freddy, is counting?) He wreaks all kinds of 
razor-fingered havoc until Heather pursues him through her dreams into a kind 
of boiler-room perdition in order to save her child (Miko Hughes). As if this 
weren't enough, Craven also works in the Northridge earthquake, just in case 
his meta-mystical heebie-jeebies weren't to your taste. One way or the other, 
"Nightmare" has moments that will probably scare the bejabbers out of just 
about anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Langenkamp, Robert Englund also turns up, of course, playing the actor 
who plays Freddy (as well as Freddy himself). Craven plays himself; so do John 
Saxon, and the chairman of the "Nightmare" releasing company, New Line's Robert 
Shaye. It's a gimmick, an in-joke, and yet there's something inherently creepy 
about all this self-referencing. It punctures our it's-only-a-movie 
reassurances. After all, these people know it's only a movie too, and yet 
dreadful things keep happening to them. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another novel twist to this "Nightmare." It works in the filmmakers' 
attitudes toward the horror genre by imagining what it might be like for an 
actress like Langenkamp to confront her own child watching her in "Nightmare" 
-- and being terrorized by her. Craven, in effect, does the same thing to 
himself; he's spooked by what he first unleashed. His "New Nightmare" isn't the 
Pirandellian masterpiece that his enthusiasts are calling it, but it's more 
than diverting. It's compelling -- it challenges you to keep up with it. 
</P>
<P>

Times guidelines: It includes lots of up-close gore, scenes of children in 
peril, and graphic earthquake simulations. 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare'

MOVIE REVIEW; 'GIANTS': A COMEDY WORTHY OF CHEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Little Giants" happily arrives just as football season goes into high gear to 
cheer audiences of all ages. This comedy about a small Ohio town getting a 
chance to field a Pop Warner junior team is genuinely funny, more so than you 
might expect, because it is also smarter than many of its ilk. Clearly a great 
deal of care and thought has gone into making special a picture that could so 
easily have been routine family fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the mayor of idyllic Urbania, Ohio, chooses the local 
football hero, Kevin O'Shea (Ed O'Neill), to coach the team. A car dealer with 
"Heisman" on his license plate, Kevin has his name emblazoned on the town water 
tower, the "Welcome to Urbania" billboard and even has a hamburger named after 
him at the Coffee Cup Cafe (where a hearty group of older men hang out and 
become the film's kibitzers). A big, loud husky guy, he has a gentle, nebbishy 
younger brother Danny (Rick Moranis), who has a teen-age daughter, Becky 
(Shawna Waldron), who takes after her uncle to the extent that she's the town's 
best football player. Danny, a gas station proprietor and single father, has 
lived his entire life in Kevin's formidable shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Push comes to shove at last when Kevin, in a burst of male chauvinism, rejects 
Becky for his team -- along with a bunch of boys whose liabilities are lots 
more obvious. That does it for Danny, who assembles the misfits, with Becky as 
the team star, to compete with Kevin's lineup for the chance to represent 
Urbania. Based on his own negative childhood experience, Danny believes all 
kids should get a chance to play football. Of course, the film is about 
winning, the healthiness of honest competition, but it's above all about 
getting a chance to play in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's shrewd script is a collaboration between first-timers James 
Ferguson and Robert Shallcross, Chicago ad execs whose Super Bowl commercial 
centering on Pop Warner football prompted a call from Steven Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment, and Tommy Swerdlow and Michael Goldberg, who did such a good job 
with last year's "Cool Runnings." There's equally knowing direction from 
Duwayne Dunham, who made a nifty feature debut himself last year with Disney's 
"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the filmmakers realize full well they're spinning a classic underdog 
tale whose outcome is not exactly impossible to predict, they concentrate on 
characterization as well as humor. In this light, Moranis' Danny is pivotal, 
the little guy who in sticking to his guns effects changes not only within 
himself but also his overbearing brother and his daughter, a budding beauty 
experiencing the onset of puberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, Kevin is not presented as an all-out heavy, just as someone 
reflexively used to getting his way but who's also capable of humor and 
reflection. O'Neill, a star of TV's "Married . . . With Children," overdue for 
a big-screen breakthrough, is an actor of wit and nuance as well as imposing 
physical presence. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-made film actually shot largely up the coast in Arroyo Grande (by 
"Schindler's List's" Oscar-winning Janusz Kaminski), "Little Giants" reveals 
its subtlety and awareness in an opening sequence introducing Kevin and Danny 
as youngsters. All the children on view are white, but when the picture moves 
to the present we discover a modest rainbow coalition among the aspiring 
pee-wee leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for rude language and pranks. Times guidelines: The 
language is mild and the whole family can enjoy the film.

LOVE BECOMES THE 'TALK' OF THE TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Argentine filmmaker Maria Luisa Bemberg's "I Don't Want to Talk About It," a 
fable of unexpected love and its equally unpredictable consequences, unfolds 
with the subtlety and irony of an Isak Dinesen tale. A beautiful, leisurely 
period piece set in a small South American town in the '30s, it begins as a 
droll, engrossing story that builds to a stunning, utterly surprising climax 
that adds yet another layer of meaning to an already illuminating revelation of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 In an idyllic, ancient town, Leonor (Luisina Brando) is the community's most 
dominant personality; a beautiful, well-off widow who's confronted with the 
truth that her daughter will be a dwarf. Once she has worked out her rage and 
pain, she becomes determined that her Charlotte (Alejandra Podesta) will be 
happy and accomplished. Bemberg and her co-writer Jorge Goldenberg, in adapting 
a short story by Julio Illinas, find considerable humor in the sheer 
imperiousness Leonor exerts over everyone to ensure that Charlotte's diminutive 
size is never mentioned in her daughter's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Marcello Mastroianni's Ludovico, an elegant, slightly mysterious, 
endlessly charming man of the world arrives in the community, Charlotte is 15 
and an outstanding scholar and a skilled pianist. The formidable Leonor warms 
enough to Ludovico to ask him the favor of selecting a horse for her daughter's 
birthday. All it takes is a glimpse of Charlotte, who is already the only 
educated person with whom Ludovico can converse, riding her new horse to make 
Ludovico feel transfixed by love. 
</P>
<P>
 Bemberg brings to the working out of this astonishing development the same 
detached humor and compassion with which she views Leonor's zealously 
protective mother, but she has much more in mind than a tale of the 
transforming power of love. She goes on to suggest that love cannot be enough 
if there's a failure to acknowledge that which makes an individual different 
from others. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to imagine anyone but Mastroianni, with his legendary 
savoir-faire, in the role of Ludovico. Even as he grows older, Mastroianni 
remains the eternal Casanova/Don Juan-like object of desire; in playing 
Ludovico, he reminds us that it rarely occurs to us to consider what a 
lady-killer may really need or be attracted to in a woman. Brando brings a 
moving heroic, even noble, quality to the frequently unintentionally humorous 
yet finally tragic Leonor. From start to finish Podesta's Charlotte rightly 
remains a smiling enigma. 
</P>
<P>
 When Maria Luisa Bemberg dedicates "this tale to all people who have the 
courage to be different in order to be themselves," she in effect is speaking 
more of herself than anyone in her film. At 56 in 1981, Bemberg made her 
directorial debut and accrued international acclaim with the romantic tragedy 
"Camila" in 1984. With "I Don't Want to Talk About It" and the superb but 
unreleased "I, the Worst of All," starring Assumpta Serna as a brilliant 
16th-Century Mexican nun, Bemberg has come fully into her own as a screen 
artist.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CRIMES' A LOOK AT CON MAN'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Imaginary Crimes," set in the early '60s, is about the family life of a con 
man. It's a terrific subject for a movie but, the way it's been done here, the 
story is mildewed with good intentions. It's a respectable piece of work, well 
acted, but it's not terribly exciting. The filmmakers seem to be flaunting what 
sensitive souls they are -- more sensitive, even, than the characters in their 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Keitel plays Ray Weiler, whose wife (played, in flashbacks, by Kelly 
Lynch) has died, leaving him in charge of two young daughters, Sonya, the elder 
(Fairuza Balk), and Greta (Elisabeth Moss). Ray is the kind of guy who is 
constantly cooking up get-rich-quick schemes and then wheedling out of the 
inevitable fallout. Landlords, moneylenders and partners dog his elusive 
tracks; his daughters are schooled in keeping creditors at bay with 
well-rehearsed ruses. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional core of the film is Ray's abiding love for his daughters despite 
his responsibility in damaging their lives. The one thing he does not do -- at 
least not voluntarily -- is desert them. In his own way he wants to do right by 
them -- he wants them to be princesses. But he's hopelessly mired in a 
small-timer's mind-set. Compared to Ray, Willy Loman was a slickster. 
</P>
<P>
 Keitel doesn't pull out all of his stops, and his nuanced reticence is 
intriguing. (As a change of pace from his recent movies, he doesn't drop his 
pants, either.) As usual, he takes chances -- clearly this is a role he cares 
about. Ray speaks in bookish cadences, as if he had memorized his words; it's 
the actor's unstressed way of bringing out Ray's insecurities.  
</P>
<P>
 But Keitel overvalues Ray's lumpishness; he's such a Common Man that, after a 
while, you long for something a bit more uncommon. Keitel is very good at 
getting at the self-hatred in Ray's weaselly soul -- Ray even exploits his dead 
wife's name in order to get Sonya into a prestigious girls' school. (What makes 
the scene work is that we can tell Ray still loves his wife.) But the film 
surrounds Ray in a nimbus of heartfelt intentions, and it tenderizes what might 
have been a great character -- a great performance. 
</P>
<P>
 (And, for a film this well-acted, there are some shocking missed opportunities 
throughout, like the blink-or-you'll-miss-them cameos by Lynch, Diane Baker and 
Annette O'Toole.) The relationship between Sonya and Greta is sensitively 
played; the two actresses share the kind of rapport that can't be faked. Balk's 
Sonya, whose "poetic" voice-overs sugar the soundtrack, is shell-shocked, yet 
almost frighteningly vulnerable. She hates her father's consmanship and yet, 
like him, she holds out for golden opportunity. (In her case, the 
opportunities, like a college education, are far less pie-in-the-sky than 
Ray's.) Balk manages the difficult feat of creating a character who is both 
grimly resilient and fragile, and that combo seems true to the experience of 
abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Anthony Drazan and his screenwriters Kristine Johnson and Davia 
Nelson based the film on an autobiographical novel by Sheila Ballantyne, and 
the film has the tentative self-consciousness of "personal" reminiscence 
movies. Would a real look back to a childhood this ravaged appear so sedate and 
nostalgic?  
</P>
<P>
 Drazan manages the period setting convincingly, and he slides smoothly in and 
out of the flashbacks, but he doesn't want to take the audience over the edge 
-- into the kind of emotional experience we can't sort out as soon as we leave 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for themes and some very mild language. Times guidelines: 
It includes a scene of children watching their father being roughed up.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'EDEN' CREATES A WHOLESOME S&M WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The advance publicity for "Exit to Eden," loosely based on the Anne Rice novel 
about S&M, might lead you to expect a torrid kinkfest. But not to worry. 
Despite its free-love trappings, Hollywood has always been a deeply 
conservative place. No matter how many clamps and tweezers and harnesses are on 
display in its movies, no matter how much epidermis is evidenced, sexual 
wayfarers are routinely punished and true love touted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exit to Eden" is the kind of erotic comedy that Doris Day might have snuggled 
into. It's such a dopey fizzle that it's kind of fascinating: Did the 
filmmakers really think they could get away with making a wholesome movie about 
the S&M scene? Director Garry Marshall seems to specialize in making denatured 
movies about red-hot subjects -- remember "Pretty Woman"? Like that film, "Exit 
to Eden" gambols across sexual minefields before finally plumping for true-blue 
romanticism. Nothing in it is convincing -- not even the whips. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic premise -- not without possibilities -- has L.A. cops Sheila 
Kingston (Rosie O'Donnell) and Fred Lavery (Dan Aykroyd) going undercover at a 
tropical resort that caters to S&M fanciers. (Sheila is assigned her own 
"slave," played by Sean O'Bryan in the film's only funny performance.) They're 
trying to entrap a pair of diamond smugglers (Stuart Wilson and Iman) on the 
trail of Elliott (Paul Mercurio), a photojournalist with incriminating evidence 
against them. Running Club Eden is Mistress Lisa (Dana Delany), who develops a 
dewy-eyed, against-the-rules hankering for Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what Pedro Almodovar could have done with this! But, then again, he 
might not have had the gumption to depict Club Eden as a pastel-colored 
consciousness-raising fantasy island for squeaky-clean libertines. Marshall and 
screenwriter Deborah Amelon are far bigger teases than anyone in their cast: 
They set up an erotic roundelay and then run for cover. This is the kind of sex 
comedy that Dr. Joyce Brothers would endorse. (In a sense, she already has -- 
she makes a cameo appearance.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell huffs and puffs her way through her Sgt. Joe Friday-ish role while 
Aykroyd acts aggravatingly strait-laced. (She rankles him by constantly 
updating him on her ovulation cycles and feminine hygiene problems -- perhaps 
the worst running gag in any movie so far this year.) It might have been funny 
if these two had been sorely tempted into kinkdom but the film never really 
explores their psyches. They don't seem to have any. Elliott and Mistress Lisa 
don't fare much better, despite a lot of pop psych blather about how love means 
losing control. This might be funny if that lack of control were touted in an 
S&M context, but, no, the filmmakers just want us to know that being in love 
means being vulnerable -- without the leather outerwear, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Hollywood romantic comedy is still reeling from the smudging of sex 
roles in the past two decades, "Exit to Eden" might have worked as a 
free-for-all compendium of '90s love play. (All entrants to Club Eden are given 
blood tests -- whew. ) But there's so little erotic heat in this movie that it 
gives sex a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's an achievement. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEWS; WHITFIELD BRINGS HIS QUICK PICK TO THE HOUSE OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it was the pressure of playing in the gaudy environment of L.A.'s 
hottest music venue. Or maybe it was just opening night jitters. Whatever the 
cause, Mark Whitfield's early set at the House of Blues Wednesday was a 
wearying study in hyperactive guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisp, authoritative jazz statements that characterize Whitfield's work on 
his new recording, "True Blue," rarely surfaced in his energetically demanding 
solos. Although he performed several numbers from the album -- notably his own 
"Blues for Davis Alexander" and a Coltrane classic, "Mr. Syms" -- most fell 
prey to a seemingly dogged effort to fill every inch of his musical lines with 
as many notes as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost without exception, Whitfield doubled and quadrupled the rhythmic meter 
in his improvisations, ripping off endless streams of 16th, 32nd and even 64th 
notes. Only on an occasional melodic statement did he reveal the subtle feeling 
for nuance, contrast and touch that he's so clearly capable of expressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps ironically, he was very nearly upstaged by his 4-year-old son, Mark, 
who joined the band on drums for Thelonious Monk's "Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-lues 
Are." The tiny tot played remarkably well, and did so with a strikingly mature 
range of musical dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the senior Whitfield's own dynamic range was too often bounded 
by rapidity and note production rather than sensitivity and musical 
introspection. A potential franchise player, Whitfield won't reach the next 
level of jazz achievement until he finally outgrows his nickname from his 
Berklee Music School days -- "Quik Pik." Improv Lessons From Morgan, Tapscott 
</P>
<P>
 What alto-saxophonist Frank Morgan and pianist Horace Tapscott are doing at 
the Jazz Bakery this week -- performing as a duo -- is a difficult and risky 
business. It's jazz reduced to its essence, improvisation in which each player 
has only the other to deal with for support, contrast and sheer musical 
sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, though, sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 A spare and moody "K.C. Blues," for example, was spontaneously connected with 
the mournful ballad "Goodbye." The result was a moving musical eulogy for 
Charlie Parker, Morgan's greatest inspiration, made even more effective by a 
rolling, two-handed solo passage by Tapscott that both echoed and extended the 
infectious rhythms of the Kansas City style. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, tunes vaguely wound down before eventually expiring. 
Fortunately, there also were times when potentially embarrassing moments of 
confusion and uncertainty led to totally unplanned new musical explorations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their duo numbers, Morgan and Tapscott, who continue at the 
Bakery through Saturday, each played a solo piece. Tapscott's "A Ballad for 
Samuel" typified his quasi-classical improvisational technique, utilizing a 
softly lyrical waltz as the springboard into segments that were as orchestral 
as they were pianistic -- exploding with massive block-chording and bombastic 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's showcase took a different tack. His gorgeously sensual renderings of 
"You Must Believe," "Don't Blame Me," "A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing" and "When 
You Wish Upon a Star" were testimony to a quest for great depth by means of 
great simplicity. His once rather ornate style has matured into a dark, almost 
painfully focused musical vision that reaches out and demands the listener's 
attention. -- D. H.

 * Frank Morgan and Horace Tapscott at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver 
City. (310) 271-9039. $20. Morgan and Tapscott play two sets each night, 8:30

THEATER BEAT: A POWERFUL, POIGNANT 'OF MICE AND MEN' AT DEAF WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After establishing itself with bold reinterpretations of such plays as "One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and " 'night, Mother" in explicitly 
hearing-impaired contexts, Deaf West Theatre Company has achieved sufficient 
acceptance and stature to tackle John Steinbeck's classic "Of Mice and Men" in 
sign language without alterations, much less excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Even for hearing audience members, having live audio translation 
simulcast through cordless headsets isn't much different from watching opera or 
foreign films with subtitles -- once you get used to the rules, you stop 
noticing the artifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Provided the material is sufficiently engaging, that is -- and Stephen 
Rothman's powerful staging handily fills the bill in this regard. The 
production's centerpiece is a riveting performance by Paul Raci as George, the 
wiry drifter driven by tragedy to the ultimate act of loyalty for his retarded 
traveling companion Lenny (Troy Kostur, who eloquently evokes both the 
innocence and ignorance that confine Lenny to a world of his own). 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the inherent abstraction of spoken language, feelings lie much 
closer to the surface in signed gestures, and that emotional expressiveness 
proves particularly well-suited to Steinbeck's story with its decidedly 
non-intellectual, heartfelt pitch to our longings for human connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Given heightened resonance in the casting mix of deaf and hearing actors is 
the recurring theme of alienation -- not just in Lenny, but in other outcast 
characters as well (like Jeffrey A. Gunter's cynical hunchback, forced to live 
in the barn because he's black, or the lonely foreman's wife (Cami Varela) 
reviled by the ranch hands for her flirty ways), the performances ache with the 
poignancy and insight born of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a sly reversal at work in equipping viewers with headsets to 
compensate for their inability to read sign -- it makes you stop to wonder just 
exactly who has the handicap in this theater. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; 'MERCHANT OF VENICE' AS OVER-THE-TOP FARCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At last, a production that offers a new motive for Shylock's villainy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most modern versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" paint Shylock, 
the play's Jewish loan shark, as a pathetic victim who exacts his revenge after 
a life of religious persecution. Yet the new effort by Will & Company at Los 
Angeles Theatre Center's Theatre 3 gives another rationale: Poor Shylock is the 
only rational man in a sea of cartoonish clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the play's roots as a comedy, director Colin Cox has carried that 
notion to the extreme, yielding a kooky, over-the-top farce completely out of 
character with the text itself. Even a minor character like Gratiano (Armando 
Ortega) is here transformed into a scenery-chewing Daffy Duck who exaggerates 
his love of mirth into fits of prancing and hyena-like laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of nonsense is even more painful -- and noticeable -- because Gregg 
Daniel delivers such a serious and sensitive performance as Shylock, the 
money-lender who schemes to extract a pound of flesh from the merchant Antonio 
(the lifeless Jesus Nebot). 
</P>
<P>
 As an African American actor, Daniel gives added resonance to the role of a 
beleaguered minority figure in a brutally racist culture. Yet the humanity he 
brings to the part transcends considerations of color or religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel's Shylock is one of regal bearing and reckless pride. The eye patch he 
wears is an apt metaphor for the usurer's smugly one-sided way of looking at 
things, but this talented actor could probably play the part blindfolded, so 
captivating is his mixture of contempt, superciliousness and pathos. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Cox and the rest of the company, on the other hand, seem to be 
striding a wholly different stage. At various points, the actors scream, 
giggle, slap their foreheads, flex their muscles, do frenzied double-takes and 
generally behave like revelers at a MTV beach party. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend toward comic low-jinks even overwhelms Portia, the play's moral 
compass, here travestied by Erica Ortega as a vacuous Valley Girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, the show fails to take advantage of a beautiful thrust stage 
with nearly perfect sight lines. Cox stages virtually all the action downstage 
center, with messy entrances and exits. Dead space abounds. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, we never really care whether Antonio will be forced to pay his 
debt with a pound of flesh. These Venetians aren't flesh-and-blood anyway. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; UNEVEN 'DAD' OPENS WRITERS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heather Morgan's female characters should be on the verge of nervous 
breakdowns, but they're not aware of how pathetic they are. So they smile and 
deny and try to keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifted Morgan has assembled a gallery of them in "Dad, Cancer, Fear and 
Boys" at the Stella Adler Theatre. It's the first of four programs in Home Box 
Office's New Writers Project Festival, the staged culmination of a project 
aimed at developing "multicultural comic writers and performing talent," 
according to HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's show is an evening of laugh-so-you-don't-cry sketches. But, while 
individual pieces are funny, the extreme neediness on display is too one-note 
to sustain an entire program. 
</P>
<P>
 In three sketches, Morgan plays girlish Magic, who wakes up with different 
guys every morning but frightens most of them off by recounting her latest gory 
dreams. She appears twice as suburbanite Pearl -- hosting a party from inside 
the pen her husband keeps her in and showing off the new sequined leash her 
husband has given her. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's a very polite patient who generously awaits her turn in a doctor's 
waiting room despite remarkably graphic infirmities. She's a young woman who 
makes excuses for her outlandishly boorish boyfriend, and another woman whose 
inability to let her ex go is painful. In her least-developed sketch, Morgan 
asks strangers in a bar if they're her daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the mother of a 5-year-old, Morgan marks his birthday with a cake -- 
and with a catalogue of life's relentless horrors. And in voice-overs between 
sketches, we repeatedly hear a woman proposing oral sex to men she just met in 
a tone that sounds as if she were suggesting a date at the malt shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Groundling Morgan is assisted by a cast of four others with Groundlings 
ties. Some of these sketches have been seen in Groundlings shows, surrounded by 
more diverse material. Morgan's material is still sharp here, but it seemed 
sharper there, where it wasn't so repetitive. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think HBO would launch its live showcase of new writers with completely 
brand-new material. Nevertheless, Morgan is clearly a promising talent, and HBO 
is smart to encourage her. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dad, Cancer, Fear and Boys," Program A of the HBO New Writers Project 
Festival, Stella Adler Theatre, 6773 Hollywood Blvd. Tonight and Saturday, 8 
p.m. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.

THEATER BEAT: L.A. REP UNDERLINES CLARITY OF 'HAMLET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shakespeare's observation that "one man in his time plays many parts" is taken 
very much to heart in the Los Angeles Repertory Company's six-actor "Hamlet" at 
the L.A. Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic Director Robert Ellenstein's staging (now in its second revival) 
confidently steers us through the anguished Prince of Denmark's vengeful 
plotting without the accustomed continuity of a full cast or the usual 
landmarks of period scenery and costumes -- David Ellenstein's black-clad 
Hamlet being one of the few nods to traditional representation. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic and sharp-edged Ellenstein the Younger and Susan Angelo (a 
sensitive Ophelia and stalwart Horatio) are the only carry-overs from the 
company's original 1987 production, but the conceptual integrity holds as the 
new cast members prove adept at their chameleon metamorphoses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Larkin's pompous Polonius is the high point of his seven roles, while 
among their various characters Brendan Ford supplies well-timed comic relief as 
the obsequious Rosencrantz (with imaginary Guildenstern in tow like the 
Shakespearean equivalent of the invisible 6-foot rabbit in "Harvey"), and Janet 
MacLachlan plumbs the depths of sorrow as the Queen tormented by her son's 
apparent madness. Especially praiseworthy is William H. Bassett's Claudius, 
with his melodious voice and wonderful control of the scansion. 
</P>
<P>
 By design an abstract proposition, this "Hamlet" lacks some of the visceral 
impact and emotional range of a full staging, but the absence of clutter helps 
illuminate the text with remarkable clarity -- worthwhile viewing for anyone 
familiar with the play's terrain. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; MINTZ, ORCHESTRA EXCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way it looked on paper, it was going to be the Shlomo Mintz Show, with a 
little band called the Israel Chamber Orchestra serving his every need. The 
veteran violinist Mintz would appear in triple glory as violin soloist, viola 
soloist and conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 We had no need to worry. While the concert at Ambassador Auditorium on 
Wednesday did prove a display for his talents, this was only a byproduct of his 
keen attention to the music itself and the splendid playing of the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening with Mozart's Violin Concerto, K. 219, "Turkish," Mintz coaxed the 
orchestra through the exposition, turned and played, thereafter giving only the 
smallest smattering of conductorial attention to the group. No matter. This was 
a well-drilled performance, with all the interpretive niceties painted in. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra played with rhythmic elan, gentle lyricism and a precision that 
never sounded mechanical. Mintz, on a 1719 Stradivarius, offered a dashing, 
even bravura virtuosity, but strictly within a controlled, 18th-Century 
context. And, when called for, he threaded Mozart's cantilena clearly, warmly, 
vivaciously and poetically. 
</P>
<P>
 To the late and fervent Romanticism of Schoenberg's "Verklarte Nacht," Mintz 
brought his baton and a disciplined reading. Still relatively new to conducting 
(he's been at it five years), he might be accused of visually over-projecting 
his ideas, dotting every i, etc. On the other hand, he knew exactly what he 
wanted every step of the long way, and he achieved remarkable results. 
</P>
<P>
 The ICO gave him exactly what he wanted, showed themselves as first-rate 
musicians from top to bottom, and handled the considerable technical demands 
with little strain and much gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola in hand, Mintz and ensemble then presented Oedoen Partos' 1951 "Yiskor" 
(In Memoriam), dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust. The 10-minute work is 
an eloquent Bartokian flight of prayer, and it was delivered with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 To these ears at least, Mintz's musical talents seemed less well suited to the 
sturdy challenges of Haydn's Symphony No. 92, "Oxford," than they had been to 
Mozart's graceful classicism. At any rate, the performance unfolded with plenty 
of vigor and spirit, and the songful slow movement sang, but there was just a 
hint of stuffiness here and there, and some flatish phrasing. TIMOTHY MANGAN

ART REVIEWS; HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ACADEMIC WORKS OF EDWARD DUGMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Dugmore is a first-generation Abstract Expressionist who is often 
referred to as a second-generation member of the New York School. Although 
relegating Dugmore to the less prestigious status as a second-generation artist 
is incorrect (he was born in 1915 and began exhibiting regularly in 1950), it 
accurately conveys the sense that his paintings are derivative. 
</P>
<P>
 His abstractions rarely have the presence of original discoveries or 
inventions but instead seem to be personal translations of other, more 
influential artists' formal breakthroughs. At Manny Silverman Gallery, a survey 
of works on paper from 1948-85 presents a quick, historically interesting 
sketch of Dugmore's consistently academic explorations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 40 modestly scaled works here consist of attentive applications of 
lessons learned from Still, Rothko, Gottlieb and Motherwell. Dugmore's tendency 
to make slight adjustments and to fine-tune others' techniques regularly 
results in fully resolved works that often lack tension and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 A colorful triptych and a series of black-and-white ink washes depict 
schematic landscapes and register Dugmore's connection to Bay Area painting, 
which traditionally has maintained a strong link between abstraction and 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Several gestural acrylics from the early 1980s are unconstrained by the 
studiousness that otherwise constricts Dugmore's drawings. Looser and more 
fluid than the other works exhibited, these simple geometric configurations are 
translucent and seem to be lit from behind. They suggest that persistence might 
not win one a place in the spotlight but may pay off with quiet satisfactions.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MAKING SOME NOISE AT CREEQUE ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even when it's not packed five people deep at the bar, Creeque Alley is loud. 
The awning says bar and grill, but the menu says "bar & ball": Even on a 
quieter weeknight, multiple video monitors are apt to be broadcasting two or 
more ballgames, each with the volume cranked. Other times, there are muted 
prerecorded basketball games or Bill Cosby shows with Kool and the Gang, 
Prince, Marvin Gaye or Stevie Wonder blasting from speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Creeque Alley is also dark, although there's just enough light to see the 
place is pretty great looking: If you didn't know you were on Melrose Avenue, 
just a few paces west from its sister establishment, Georgia, you might think 
you'd found a primo back-alley haunt under huge shade trees not far from the 
town creek. The ceiling is all beams and lath, like a shade arbor or walls 
waiting for plaster. Windows and the bar are snugly shuttered. What light there 
is comes through slim gashes in clever sheet-iron wall sconces. There are also 
candles in quaintly hewn tin-can lanterns: If you hold them right, you can read 
your menu line-by-line with a beam of light rivaling the intensity of a 
near-dead flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the light of day, the menu, a single stiff laminated sheet, shows a 
dreadlocked, grinning figure playing football, hockey, soccer, basketball, 
records and the electric guitar. There is a handful each of appetizers, 
entrees, sandwiches and eight specialty drinks such as Jamaicanmecrazy (two 
kinds of rum, two kinds of liqueur, fresh juices, crushed ice), and the $15 Be 
Scatter and Vanish (light and dark rums, vodka, gin, tequila, triple sec and 
fruit juice served with flaming "151 rum" over ice).  
</P>
<P>
 With or without alcohol, the media bombardment and darkness challenge one not 
to be scattered and vanish. The food is what keeps us in our booth: Each dish 
seems better than the last. Fried calamari might not be the crunchiest, but 
it's well-seasoned, chewy, addictive. Beer-battered shrimp are crisper and even 
more flavorful, although the fruit-spiked tartar sauce tastes oddly like 
strawberry ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaican patties, plump, golden turnovers, come with one of two fillings: a 
hot, sweet, powerfully smoky bean, or a curried, rich, volatile beef. Both are 
so good, you'll keep eating them and trying to staunch the chile heat with 
anything on the table -- although if you reach for the heady house-made ginger 
beer, you're truly fighting fire with fire. Don't turn to that scoop of 
cucumber relish, either -- it's hotter than the patties! 
</P>
<P>
 Crab cake salad, with two of the teeniest crab cakes ever, is the least 
interesting item we try. Dumplings in a rich, peppery chicken dumpling soup, 
however, are dreamy: torpedo-shaped paragons of pleasurable gumminess, they 
taste like the thickest possible egg noodle. And the only reason not to order 
jerk chicken wings is that you might want the entree-portion instead. On the 
other hand, these wings, which are marinated in jerk spices and served 
unsauced, are subtly, increasingly hot, with a compelling scorch and stickiness 
-- in other words, the perfect drinking food.  
</P>
<P>
 Jerk spices also add punch to the house-ground "back alley" burger, which 
comes with excellent thin, crispy french fries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two good stewed chicken entrees, both cooked until the meat melts 
right off the bone: the Port-A-Prince, a light-handed, not very exciting curry, 
and the richer, sweeter brown-stewed chicken Negril. These and all entrees come 
with rice, dull fried plantains and buttery chayote squash. Don't miss the 
smothered pork chops: Who remembered that long-cooked meat, rice and gravy 
could be so wonderful? 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to these rich, gravied dishes, there's a mammoth slab of 
grilled-rare ahi tuna with a refreshing red pepper and onion sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 As for dessert, Creeque Alley has but one -- allegedly. Our waitress assured 
us the warm chocolate cake is moist, rich, divine, but the kitchen is 
invariably out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is friendly, but often lax. With good night vision, you'll spy a tiny 
note on the menu that says a 15% gratuity is automatically added to the bill, 
but this is confusing: Some waiters do add the tip, some don't. . . . 
</P>

dinner, Sunday for brunch. Full bar. Visa, MasterCard and American Express

 Team Players: Like All-American ghosts, nine young men in baseball caps hover 
in the white haze, their unblemished faces as bland as pudding. Some offer what 
would be come-hither smiles if they weren't so sexless; others have their jaws 
clenched not in determination, but in determination to look determined. All 
look familiar in an altogether forgettable way. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tri Gallery, Amy Adler's "Team" beckons to us only to rebuff our advances 
-- like the untouchable teen idols featured in magazines such as Tiger Beat, 
upon whom the "players" are loosely based.  
</P>
<P>
 Adler's process is interesting: She makes black-and-white drawings of young TV 
and movie stars; takes away telling details while adding others -- like black 
baseball caps stripped of any insignias -- and then takes photographs of the 
drawings. This results in a glossy, apparently impenetrable surface that 
heightens our alienation from those good-looking ciphers the media programs us 
to desire. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's subjects are many: the construction of heroes, the politics of fandom, 
the adolescent's fragile sexuality, the mechanics of identification. Yet the 
project is still rather fuzzy. The biggest problem is that the faces aren't 
recognizable enough to her post-adolescent audience; they might just as easily 
have been taken from rookie baseball cards of the 1950s. This compromises the 
work, and represents the danger of using the most ephemeral of pop cultural 
ephemera as the basis for conceptual practice. 
</P>

<P>
 Charming: At Craig Krull Gallery, a small show of Julius Shulman's classic 
photographs of early California modernist architecture is perfectly charming. 
Architecture -- especially the work of Schindler, Neutra, Soriano and other 
participants in the famous Case Study House Program -- is not usually described 
this way. Yet Shulman's photographs are anything but usual, and about lots of 
things besides architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Shulman is not merely a documentarian. He is an artist interested in creating 
a vision of a perfect world, where Eames chairs are arranged in perfect 
symmetry, Natzler bowls are placed with geometric precision, and the only signs 
of life are provided by the owners, who look immensely out of place, posed like 
dolls stuck in the wrong house. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Shulman shoots from the outside peering in; these images are essays 
in frustrated voyeurism. In others, he shoots from the inside looking out onto 
the magnificent landscape. These images are mischievous, for they represent 
architecture merely as the frame for nature. They are also the most nostalgic 
of the photographs, for they freeze in black-and-white perpetuity a post-war 
dream of California, the Golden State.

RESTAURANT NOTES: WILL HOLLYWOOD SEE TOWER'S STARS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wolfgang Puck was the first L.A. chef to make the move to San Francisco. Then 
Michel Richard and John Sedlar both opened spinoffs of their Los Angeles places 
there. Now it seems the tide is turning. Jeremiah Tower has been poking around 
down south. The California cuisine pioneer who owns the perennially trendy 
Stars in San Francisco, as well as the 50-seat Stars Oakville Cafe in Napa 
Valley, wants to open an L.A. branch. Sources say he's negotiating to take over 
the former Columbia Bar & Grill near Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Stars for 
stars? 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tower is not that desperate to come south. Only if the place and the 
price are right. According to a source, the cost-conscious chef was dumbfounded 
by the architect's preliminary estimates, which were twice what he had 
expected. Tower was unavailable for comment. His assistant Amanda Berks 
insists, "Nothing is happening at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's on First?: Eberhard Mueller, who was chef-partner for six months at the 
former Opus in Santa Monica and chef at New York's celebrated Le Bernardin, was 
slated to be involved as chef-partner in a 10,000-square-foot fish market and 
restaurant opening soon on New York's West Side. Manhattan super-chef 
Jean-Georges Vongerichten of JoJo and Vong fame is also a partner in the place. 
That was before Ark Restaurants Corp. called Mueller and the German-born chef 
came running. "Since we approached (Mueller) four weeks ago, he's been on a 
different course," says Michael Weinstein, president of Ark, the company that 
purchased Andre Soltner's famous New York French restaurant Lutece earlier this 
week. "Now he only wants to do Lutece. The fish market is not going to happen 
(for him)." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Mueller is coming on board doesn't mean Soltner is out of the 
picture. "Eberhard is going to be like a co-chef," says Weinstein. "He will be 
there when Andre is not. Andre will be there when Eberhard is not. But most of 
the time they'll both be there." Under the terms of the sale, Soltner and 
Mueller have equity in the restaurant. Weinstein refused to comment on how the 
partnership is divided. "We certainly have the majority," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Weinstein, he and Soltner have been negotiating the deal for the 
past year but only recently decided who they wanted to bring in. Each had 
someone different in mind. It was former California chef Jonathan Waxman, who 
now works for New York-based Ark, who recommended Mueller for the job. "I 
called Andre up and said, 'I have a guy,' " says Weinstein, "and he said, 'Come 
on over right away.' By then, we weren't talking on phones. When I told him who 
it was, Andre snapped his fingers and said, 'Your guy is better than my guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Re-Enlists: Venice won't be losing its best restaurant after all. Having 
shopped around for more elegant digs, Joe Miller, chef-owner of the tiny 
California-French restaurant that bears his name, has decided to stay put. "You 
know how fickle people get when you move," he says. "I've been here three years 
now, and my lease was up. I knew I had to do something." So Miller cut a deal 
with his landlord to perk up the place. 
</P>
<P>
 He's revamping the interior and turning the patio into a garden room. By 
leasing the adjacent outdoor courtyard, he'll be able to pick up another 20 
seats. Everything should be completed by next month. According to the first 
issue of "Joe's News," he has also planned a new fall menu for the occasion. As 
for the neighborhood, "it's completely safe," says Miller. "We have valet 
parking and a guard in our lot. No one has been mugged yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Hunt: So what if the House of Blues on Sunset Boulevard and 
Renaissance on the Promenade in Santa Monica have already opened private rooms? 
Or that there's going to be a VIP back room at Sanctuary, the supper club due 
to open next month in Beverly Hills? That hasn't stopped "Miami Vice" creator 
Tony Yerkovich from taking his sweet time opening the exclusive, swank Buffalo 
Club on Olympic near 17th Street in Santa Monica. He's been working on the 
place for three years now. (Don't be fooled by the dumpy-looking exterior or 
the neighborhood; the interior is said to be spectacular.) Although consulting 
chef Patrick Healy says no opening date has been set, sources swear the 
members-only Buffalo Club will quietly open next week for dinner Wednesday 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The closed-mouthed screenwriter would not return Calendar's calls. Nor would 
manager Tom Kane comment on the opening date. "It's entirely Tony's deal," he 
said. "I'm caught in the middle, and I don't want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Yerkovich and company aren't the least bit worried by L.A.'s 
sudden obsession with privacy. But are there enough real celebs to go around? 
"I don't have any idea what anyone else is doing, but I know it isn't going to 
be what we're doing," says manager Kane. "It can't be. It's a signature thing. 
I know this will be different." Sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Solo Act: Although former Pinot Bistro manager Doug Flohr is no longer a 
partner, Ramon Papa, who managed the dining room at the Ritz-Carlton in 
Pasadena, still plans to open a Mediterranean/Asian restaurant in the former 
Tra Fiori space in Pasadena. After minor cosmetic changes, Papashon, named 
after Papa and chef Sean Sheridan, will open Nov. 1. More Openings: The Texas 
Rib Joint, formerly located on Pico near Westwood, has a new name and new 
location. Ribs and chicken fans can now pick up their orders at the Western 
Smokehouse on Woodbine at Overland. . . . Buon Gusto now occupies the former Le 
Triumph on Devonshire in Mission Hills. . . . George and Donna Moussalli, who 
own the Sixth Street Bistro in San Pedro, will open Aioli in Torrance. The 
European-style bistro and bakery will debut in late November. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing: Indigo Restaurant closed Saturday after a 5 1/2-year run on Third 
Street. However, Breadworks, the bakery spinoff of Indigo located four blocks 
down the road, remains open. After a partnership breakup a year ago, Karen Salk 
and Tony di Lembo, the opening chef at Indigo, ended up with the bakery. 
"Breadworks has nothing to do with Indigo anymore," says Salk.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'O.J.' FITNESS TAPES IN STORES WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How does the notion of exercising with O.J. Simpson grab you? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, for obvious reasons, some people will find it weird or offensive. 
But Playboy Video is guessing that many will be intrigued by the idea. As a 
result, Playboy decided to go ahead with marketing "O.J. Simpson: Minimum 
Maintenance Fitness for Men." It will be out Wednesday at $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not for men who are going to the gym or men who are heavy 
weightlifters," said Jeff Jenest, Playboy's senior vice president. "The tape 
has information on diet and nutrition and nudges men into being more fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it is a good exercise tape, assembled under the guidance of fitness 
expert Richard Walsh, geared to toning with minimal exertion. There are 
cardiovascular and stomach/back workouts, plus sections with exercises to do in 
hotels, offices and airports. For 70 minutes, Simpson is at his personable 
best, particularly on the amusing outtakes at the end of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't some old video that Playboy dusted off and marketed to take 
advantage of Simpson's recent notoriety. He filmed it May 25-27, not long 
before he was arrested for the June 12 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Releasing it now, just as jury selection for Simpson's trial is getting under 
way, is not exploitative, Jenest insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had planned (all along) to put it out about now," he said. "Fitness tapes 
sell best in the fall because they're good Christmas gifts. We had plans to do 
an infomercial starring O.J. to launch the tape, but we never had a chance to 
shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tape wasn't edited until after Simpson was in jail, which, Jenest said, 
did not affect the final cut. "It's the program we would have produced anyway," 
he said. "There's nothing in it that wouldn't have been included otherwise -- 
and we didn't look to add anything that might be exploitative." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Playboy consider not releasing the tape? 
</P>
<P>
 "For a few weeks after the events of June 12, we pondered our options, but we 
decided in the final analysis it was worth putting out," Jenest replied. "If 
there had been a huge outcry against him, we might have thought twice about 
putting it out. But the response was balanced enough that we didn't feel it was 
risky to put it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finished editing it and it looked so good, we felt it deserved to be 
released. Also, we had invested a great deal of money in producing it, and we 
wanted to recoup our investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy chief Hugh Hefner did, however, screen the tape for representatives of 
Simpson's defense team. "If they had said to us, 'The tape will do great harm 
to O.J. in some way' and 'Please don't put it out,' I think Hefner would have 
gone along with that," Jenest said. "But the defense had no objections." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenest wouldn't comment on Playboy's financial arrangements with Simpson. It 
is typical with these sorts of videos that the host, like the author of a book, 
would share in the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenest said it was his idea to market a fitness tape for men who don't work 
out. "Most of the men's fitness tapes are the Dolph Lundgren types -- 
heavy-duty weightlifting for bodybuilders," Jenest explained. "But for busy men 
who aren't comfortable in the gym or don't have time for the gym, here's a way 
to reach those people with a program that will keep them more fit." 
</P>
<P>
 As to how Playboy settled on Simpson as host, he said, "We needed a star for 
the project -- someone men could relate to, someone who was not too young but 
not too old, a nice Everyman kind of guy. We considered Nolan Ryan and Joe 
Montana but O.J. was our first choice."  
</P>
<P>
 Jenest said that interest in the video is tough to gauge at this point. 
Retailers are being cautious about stocking it, he said. "They don't know how 
customers will react. They have to be sure customers won't be picketing their 
stores. So far, though, no retailers have said they won't carry it." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes there will be an audience for it. "Some people who would have 
bought it before the tragedy won't buy it now because they're opposed to him," 
Jenest said. "But there are people who wouldn't have bought it before but will 
buy it now because of the novelty value." 
</P>
<P>
 The tape also will be available through mail order: (800) SWEAT OJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most fascinating documentaries to come out in recent months is a 
90-minute tape showing choral director Robert Shaw at work readying a group for 
a Carnegie Hall concert. "Robert Shaw: Preparing a Masterpiece, Vol. 4" is $40 
on Carnegie Hall Video, (212) 247-7800. . . . If you want to bone up on 
etiquette or instruct someone -- probably your kids -- lacking in social 
graces, an invaluable guide is "It's Not Just Eating! A Guide to American Table 
Manners." A one-hour tape on Allan Fine Productions for $30, (212) 879-0805. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of veteran comedian Alan King should find most of the jokes on his two 
new comedy tapes amusing. "The Very Funny World of Alan King" available for $20 
(45 minutes) and $30 (90 minutes) from Consumer Video Marketing, (800) 
66-MUSIC. . . . A good way to get kids tuned into recycling is an informative, 
25-minute documentary called "Garbage Day," from Childvision Educational films, 
at $15, (800) 488-1913. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New 
</P>
<P>
 "The Paper" (MCA/Universal). A throwback to those frantic 1930s newspaper 
movies, this movie is about a day in the life of a New York tabloid, focusing 
on the investigation of two young blacks accused of murder and the torturous 
conflicts of an editor, brilliantly played by Michael Keaton. Part exciting 
drama and part hokum, it features an outstanding cast, including Glenn Close, 
Marisa Tomei and Robert Duvall. Ron Howard directed. 
</P>
<P>
 "BackBeat" (PolyGram). Set in the early 1960s, when the Beatles were playing 
small clubs in Hamburg and the band's leaders were art-school buddies John 
Lennon (Ian Hart) and bass player Stu Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff). Too much time 
is spent on the meandering romance between Sutcliffe, who eventually leaves the 
band, and a photographer (Sheryl Lee). The movie becomes supercharged when it 
centers on the trials of Lennon and the struggling Beatles. Both Hart and the 
re-created Beatles music are superb.

THEATER REVIEWS; EVER-PRESENT WITCHES MAKE FOR A JINXED 'MACBETH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all Shakespeare tragedies, "Macbeth" is the darkest,bloodiest and most 
elemental. 
</P>
<P>
 Macbeth's headlong plunge toward catastrophe is swifter than Othello's, more 
direct than Hamlet's, steeper than Lear's. And the play's demonic portrait of a 
heroic warrior consumed by malevolent ambition makes Richard in "Richard III" 
look like a piker, and that's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Alternative Repertory Theatre, which has opened its eighth season with 
"Macbeth," artistic director Patricia L. Terry writes in her program notes that 
she is "placing the entire play in Macbeth's unconscious." That way, Terry 
believes, she can better illustrate the nightmarish aura of the tragedy. It's a 
provocative conceit. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless you read her notes, you'd never guess from the production itself 
that you're in the depths of Macbeth's mind. To do that, you'd have to equate 
Halloween-style witches and their romper-room choreography with terrifying 
hallucinations. I don't think Macbeth would even blink. Maybe he'd give them a 
couple of Tootsie Rolls and tell them to get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The witches certainly do come equipped with chachkis , as they say in Yiddish. 
They're wearing all sorts of knickknacks -- horns and antlers, beak-nosed 
masks, goaty fur, colored tights with snaky ornaments, tails and cloven hoofs. 
And they stick around like psychedelic pests -- not content to come and go when 
Shakespeare bids them -- when Terry needs them for atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, unfortunately, is an artsy-craftsy production that comes off as 
juvenile.  
</P>
<P>
 This "Macbeth" also doesn't get much shading or depth from its principle 
actors, who tend to play every scene and every speech with the same intensity 
regardless of importance. On opening night you could see the entire company 
"acting" with every bone in their bodies. Instead of giving shape to the drama, 
they flatten it out and drain it of tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Dennis McLernon's stentorian Macbeth is contemplating murder or 
dissembling, feeling guilt or resigning himself to defeat, everything seems 
callow and lacking in weight. This is even more pronounced with Louise Moore's 
colorless Lady Macbeth, who can't galvanize herself, let alone her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 With air conditioning newly installed in A.R.T.'s tiny performing space and 
the audience's comfort level never better, it would have been nice to report 
equal artistic success. Maybe next time.

A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ARRANGEMENT; THEIR WORK FOR TINA GERSTLER'S 'GENDER' PAYS 
OFF FOR COLLABORATORS MEGAN WILLIAMS, BRAD DUTZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a successful relationship or enriching friendship, artistic collaboration 
can open new doors for all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with "The Translated Gender," Tina Gerstler's latest modern 
dance, to be premiered tonight at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's leading to a new batch of paintings," said artist Megan Williams, who 
has made sets for the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 The same holds for musician Brad Dutz, who has composed the bluesy, danceable 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have much saxophone in my recordings, so I learned a lot about 
writing for sax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet Pacifica will present Gerstler's piece on a mixed bill with works by 
David Allan of New York, troupe artistic director Molly Lynch, and Fokine as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstler's dance for 13 women explores women's roles in today's society from 
two viewpoints: the limiting, stereotypical notions of femininity often seen in 
the media, and the full scope of what women can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, (the work) has to deal with self-respect," she told The Times in an 
earlier interview. "And having gained more personal self-respect, I wish 
society's images (of women) would help to build that." 
</P>
<P>
 When Gerstler outlined these thoughts earlier this year to Williams and Dutz, 
fellow Angelenos with whom she's collaborated separately before, the team 
effort began. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams based her designs on the Exquisite Corpse, a parlor game she'd been 
playing with other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 To play the game, popular among Parisian surrealists of the 1920s, 
participants draw a head, torso or legs on a piece of paper that is repeatedly 
folded so the next artist can't see what anybody else has drawn. The randomness 
creates art and, "voila, you have this monstrosity," Williams said in a recent 
phone interview from home. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the artist tackled the Gerstler set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I designed three characters, an old, poverty-stricken woman, a young pregnant 
girl and a sword swallower." 
</P>
<P>
 She then painted each character's head, torso and legs on a nine-foot-tall 
panel composed of three interchangeable sections that the dancers mix and 
match. Only at the work's end are the characters anatomically aligned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference between making art work for a dance and making a set design," 
Williams said, "is that a set design is completely at the service of the dance; 
it's a backdrop, and we didn't want that. Tina asked me to work on this because 
my work interests her, so these are not stage sets in the traditional sense, 
they are gritty looking paintings. They're not supposed to fade into the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Tina's work," she added, "it has the same sort of roiling motion and 
continuous energy that I like to get in my drawings." 
</P>
<P>
 The new painting series she plans will possibly depict "feminized images," 
Williams said, noting that Gerstler's project gave her "permission" to break 
away from the sexually ambiguous figures she has favored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do (collaborations) because I find art-making to be very lonely at times 
and it kind of jolts you out of your own monotonous thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutz, a percussionist whose compositions have "a world music, improvised jazz 
style," said in a phone interview from Oregon that his 20-minute score blends 
rap or hip-hop, blues and reggae. Pots and pans and metal pipes are rattled for 
the "street feeling" Gerstler hoped for, he said, and sax, flute and clarinet 
melodies meet her request for something "bluesy with a good dance feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wanted to start a little slower because she wanted to build in 
intensity, so the music builds at the end to a little bit of a frenzy," he 
said, adding that the score includes the voice of his Japanese girlfriend Kaoru 
reciting what he called discriminatory Japanese want ads specifying weight and 
height for potential female employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about working with Tina and why we've worked together over 
and over, is that she gives me guidelines, like tempos and a certain feel, but 
she lets me be real creative and I have a whole lot of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ballet Pacifica will perform at 8 p.m. tonight and at 2:30 and 8 p.m. 
Saturday at Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. $15-$18. 
Student/senior tickets, $6, are available half an hour before each performance.

ART REVIEW; IRVINE ARTS CENTER'S 'VINE RIPENED' OFFERS SLIM PICKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unfortunate thing about the embarrassingly titled "Vine Ripened, Ready to 
Pick," a showcase of local art at the Irvine Fine Arts Center (through Nov. 6), 
is that it has so little to do with the city's one major contemporary art 
institution, the art department at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 A note in the accompanying catalogue says that 20% of the artists have degrees 
from UCI. But if work by promising current students had been included, the 
level of the show would have been much higher and its contemporaneity quotient 
much greater. 
</P>
<P>
 How likely is it, after all, that a gifted and motivated artist graduate will 
remain for years in a spic-and-span town that lacks either the usual amenities 
(and low rents and cheap hangouts) of an art center or the freedom of rural 
living? 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the show contains numerous examples of amateurish abstraction, a 
dose of bombast, a sprinkling of coy "naive" art and other mediocre pieces. A 
stale air hangs over the exhibition, as if most of the participants -- whose 
average age is 45, according to the catalogue -- haven't paid much attention to 
contemporary art for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Within these depressing parameters, the most arresting works are by Doree 
Dunlap, a professor of art at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, and Kristin 
Siracusa, who received her master of fine arts degree from Cal State Fullerton 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's debt to Frieda Kahlo is rather too obvious but the passions informing 
her apparent self-portraits in stark, dreamlike compositions seem deeply felt. 
</P>
<P>
 In her painting "Mi Arbol Familiar" (My Family Tree), a nude woman with a scar 
in place of one breast, a scarf hiding her head and the open palms of a saint 
going to her martyrdom is about to step into a grave containing a dead tree 
adorned with skulls. "Mi Vida Como Una Opuntia" (My Life as a Prickly Pear) is 
a more enigmatic vision in which signs of death seem to multiply as fast as 
living things. 
</P>
<P>
 Siracusa's linocut "Untitled (from Inventory series)" contains two images: a 
loosened knot and a bird holding a thread in its beak. Spare and precise, the 
style of the print is of a piece with its riddle-like format, which suggests 
comparisons between human and animal ingenuity, and intellectual and intuitive 
problem-solving. 
</P>
<P>
 Other brighter lights include Jonathan Burke's painting "Mult Nat Sm Cap," a 
wry fantasy in which multiple chimneys on a factory roof belch prettily colored 
wisps of smoke and fire into a tranquil landscape; May Swanson's eccentric 
untitled still lifes; Roanne Hickok's amusingly retro landscapes made of tiny 
collaged eyes and lips; Marcia Cox Holzman's ceramic piece "Soulmates," more 
emotionally specific than her other work in the show, and Ching-Woan Chen's 
luminous untitled painting incorporating a loose grid of individual brush 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Vine Ripened, Ready to Pick" continues through Nov. 6 at the Irvine Fine 
Arts Center, 14321 Yale Ave., Irvine. 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays through 
Thursdays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays, 1 to 5 p.m. 
Sundays. Admission: Free. (714) 724-6880.

NOBEL'S MODEST LEGACY; FOR SOUTHLAND'S LAUREATES, THE THRILL OF WINNING COMES 
IN SMALL WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What becomes a Nobel laureate most? A new Porsche? A sailing yacht? How about 
a trip around the world? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 A more modest and unusual legacy has awaited Southern California's Nobel Prize 
winners -- a small fraternity that grew by one this week when USC chemistry 
professor George A. Olah claimed the world's top intellectual honor. 
</P>
<P>
 For men of such achievement, the thrill of the award comes in small ways -- 
like acquiring that new parking space closer to the lab, buying a long-enduring 
wife a new watch or putting away some money for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 When Caltech chemist Rudolph Marcus returned to work after his 1992 Nobel, one 
would have hardly known his life had changed. Marcus remained so remarkably 
focused on his study of energy storage that colleagues quipped that he "must 
have spent his million dollars on a new sweater." 
</P>
<P>
 One colleague said he spotted Marcus one day not long after his return from 
Stockholm parking his car in a space, newly marked with his name and just 
outside his office. "He said to me 'Well, the Nobel Prize has to be worth 
something,' " recalled Stephen Mayo, an assistant professor of biology. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Marcus still walks to work most days from his home near Caltech's 
Pasadena campus. He still drives a clunky 1978 Oldsmobile and reports proudly 
that his wife, Laura, met King Carl Gustav XVI at the Royal Swedish Academy of 
Sciences she was wearing a dress that a friend sewed for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his $1.2 million in winnings sits in investments or in the bank. (He 
notes, in fact, that the prize had lost 20% of its value by the time he 
received his check because of a rapid devaluation of the Swedish krona .) 
</P>
<P>
 The flood of speaking requests and other offers has been so heavy that Marcus 
has had to take on an extra secretary half-time just to handle them all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's best if one doesn't think too much about prizes and things," Marcus 
said. "That puts the focus in the wrong place, which should be on your work . . 
. on a particular problem and how you should solve it." 
</P>
<P>
 If he has made one resolution in his two years since winning the prize, Marcus 
said it is to get better at saying "no." 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question you have to answer is whether you want to turn into a 
traveling salesman, or whether to use your time to produce something valuable 
and something new," Marcus said. "I like to answer questions." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Donald Cram shares much the same philosophy and, for years, has loathed 
the tendency of some Nobel prize winners to leave their scientific roots and 
wander off in other directions. He calls Linus Pauling, a onetime hero, a 
"fallen angel" for leaving the work that brought him a Nobel Prize in chemistry 
to promote, among other things, world peace and the curative values of Vitamin 
C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have looked on the Nobel Prize as an opportunity to do more of what I enjoy 
and what I am good at and that is science," said Cram, who received the honor 
in 1987 for his work in chemistry. "That is the central core of my life. It's 
not a youthful fashion. It is something that has stayed around." 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old scientist -- whose colorful bow ties and guitar concerts are 
legend at UCLA -- said that most of the time it is easy to remain true to that 
central core. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Korean newspaper association, for instance, wrote to him with a novel 
proposal, Cram knew he was out of his ken. The association wanted him to join a 
team of Nobel Prize winners to rewrite the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something just didn't fit there," said Cram, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his financial prize, Cram was not as big a winner as those in recent 
years. His $180,000 in winnings reflect the fact he shared the chemistry award 
with two others and that the bequest of Alfred Nobel has experienced a 
remarkable increase in value in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Cram hasn't put the money to good use. The professor this year bought 
a home overlooking Orange County's Monarch Bay, in part with his prize money. 
From there, he can see as far as the San Onofre beaches and the beloved waves 
where he has surfed for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cram insists that it is the non-material rewards that have been the most 
valuable to him. He doesn't have to teach classes anymore. He can attract 
grants now without the old strain and lure colleagues from all over the world 
to join his research team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has extended my scientific life," Cram said. And, most happily for him, 
Cram said the award brought long overdue recognition to his wife and longtime 
collaborator, Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the award money to act on a long-delayed urge to buy Jane a gold 
watch, too. Although Cram laughingly admits that even on that extravagance, he 
sought out the best buy that he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised in Vermont," he said. "Money doesn't circulate very frequently 
in New England and particularly in Vermont." 
</P>
<P>
 The area's third and senior surviving laureate is 1983 physics prize winner 
William A. Fowler who, like Marcus, lives within walking distance of the 
Caltech campus where he worked for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now a professor emeritus, he gave two-thirds of his $90,000 award to two 
daughters and put the rest into the bank and investments. 
</P>
<P>
 He had already retired by the time the prize came and a bad back and other 
ailments have long since led him to give up the lecture circuit. But even 
Fowler likes to keep a hand in the old game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler sightings are still a remarkable event on campus and his Nobel status 
allows him to keep on an assistant on campus who comes to his Pasadena home 
each afternoon to retrieve letters to be typed and to deliver the latest 
research papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 83-year old notes wistfully that a whole new field of nuclear study has 
opened up recently and that he still has a few ideas floating around. "I'm 
still hoping to get a second one," he sighed. "You never know."

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with disbelief Brian O'Leary Bennett's suggestion (Commentary, Oct. 7) 
that Californians look to Washington for a solution to the illegal immigration 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 As a veteran of Washington politics, Bennett knows the liberal Democrat 
majority in Congress will never allow a vote to exclude illegal aliens from any 
government program.I and my Republican colleagues from California have proposed 
dozens of bills and amendments aimed at controlling illegal immigration. 
Liberal Democrats have used every parliamentary trick imaginable to prevent 
needed reforms from being voted on, much less enacted. Similar legislation in 
Sacramento has fallen victim to liberal legislative roadblocks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 California voters are rightly addressing the issue by placing Prop. 187, the 
"Save Our State" initiative, on the November ballot. Prop. 187 doesn't demonize 
immigrants, nor stigmatize anyone. The question is simple: Should illegal 
aliens be entitled to free education, housing, medical and other government 
benefits provided at taxpayer expense? 
</P>
<P>
 The only answer that makes sense is no. We can no longer afford to provide a 
treasure chest of benefits to every person who manages to cross our borders 
illegally. If we continue this giveaway, we do so to the detriment of our own 
citizens and legal residents. For instance, the WIC (Women, Infant and 
Children) program provides benefits to only 75% of eligible mothers, yet 
illegal aliens continue to receive benefits. Every illegal alien serviced 
knocks an American or legal resident out of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that taxpayer-funded government programs should benefit our own 
citizens and legal immigrants is not hateful or nativist. The American dream is 
available to almost a million legal immigrants a year. Spending California, and 
America, into bankruptcy to provide benefits to illegal aliens denies everyone 
the opportunity America offers. And that hurts immigrants and citizens alike.

KEEPING FIRMS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest Adela de la Torre's column "Decent Wages for Economic 
Growth" (Commentary, Oct. 5). Without commenting on the principal thrust of the 
article, I would like to clarify a possible misimpression which De la Torre may 
have created in the first paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
 I am the president of the "Venice ceramics firm" referred to in that 
paragraph. Upon learning of Feltman-Langer's need for an improved facility and 
our opportunities to relocate outside of Los Angeles, Mayor Richard Riordan 
called to offer the support of his staff in penetrating the bureaucratic maze 
so we could remain in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While I am greatly flattered by the mayor's personal attention to the 
Feltman-Langer Co., I know that his call to me was but one of hundreds he makes 
on a regular basis. It was not, as suggested by De la Torre, a one-shot 
personal appeal. The mayor's personal intervention and the assistance of his 
staff are part of his administration's long-term economic strategy for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of our company, the mayor's assistance saved over 65 important 
jobs for Los Angeles, with more to come. As for minority involvement, what can 
I say? I am a woman and almost all of my employees have Spanish surnames.

USING SWEAT AGAINST QUAKES; VOLUNTEER LABOR CAN GO FAR IN IMPROVING SAFETY IN

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We know that many Los Angeles Unified School District buildings suffered 
extensive damage in the Northridge quake. We know that the LAUSD schools have 
found it difficult to climb a list of priorities that has included mending the 
freeways, the "ghost towns," housing and other damage. And we know that the 
schools haven't been able to remodel and meet building safety standards set 
after the 1971 Sylmar quake because the money just hasn't been there. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, some basic and necessary steps that can be taken now and 
that are not affected by fiscal limitations. These changes must be made to 
protect children, teachers and others in the event that the next major 
earthquake is not so kind in terms of timing and occurs during school hours. 
Right now, all we're hearing is a lot of griping and passing of the proverbial 
buck. Let's get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first anniversary of the Northridge temblor approaches, you can still 
walk into many schools and find bookcases that have not been bolted to the 
walls; boxes perched on high cabinets and filled with objects that could crash 
down; unanchored televisions on rickety carts; inadequately secured fans, 
overhead projectors and other large objects. In some science labs corrosive 
chemicals have not been strapped down. 
</P>
<P>
 Remedies are basic, and inexpensive for the most part. Nonetheless, there's a 
lot of complaining going on about whose responsibility is involved. We have an 
answer, and some schools have already taken appropriate action. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, administrators and other staff members, parents and students should 
join in to move unsecured boxes and poorly stored materials. They can spend an 
afternoon or evening with screwdrivers, pliers and a few hardware store items 
to anchor bookcases and heavy equipment. Afterward, they can all rest a little 
easier in the knowledge that the schools of the Los Angeles district are better 
prepared for the next big shake.

JOE CAMEL GOES TO GRADE SCHOOL; ARTICLE ON CIGARETTES IN NEWSPAPER FOR 
FIFTH-GRADERS SETS OFF A CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William F. Reilly, chairman of the company that publishes the Weekly Reader, a 
current-events newspaper for schoolchildren, says each of his publications has 
total editorial independence. Weekly Reader Editor Sandra Maccarone says 
corporate ownership played no role in her decision to run this week's cover 
story for fifth graders -- 10-year-olds -- entitled "Do Cigarettes Have a 
Future?"  
</P>
<P>
 Reilly and Maccarone may be entirely sincere. On the other hand, they may be 
engaging in spin control on behalf of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., the 
company that controls both K-III Communications Corp., Weekly Reader's 
publisher, and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., America's second-largest cigarette 
manufacturer and the maker of Camel. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, the cigarette article has ignited a billowing controversy for a 
publication that most schoolchildren see as anything but controversial. Whether 
or not RJR Nabisco or Kohlberg intervened, the subject matter is, in our view, 
inappropriate for 10-year-olds. And the article casts cigarette companies as 
linchpins of the American economy rather than as peddlers of what some call 
"coffin nails." 
</P>
<P>
 The Weekly Reader story focuses on "smokers' rights" and the harm to tobacco 
companies from smoking restrictions. The "critical thinking" question that 
600,000 or so fifth-graders across the country pondered this week: "How might a 
nationwide ban on public smoking affect people who now smoke?" 
</P>
<P>
 Among the costs of a ban: "Nearly 47,000 people who work for tobacco companies 
would lose their jobs" and the loss of cigarette tax revenue would mean "less 
money" for schools and health care. And on the other side? "Many scientists 
believe there is a link between smoking and a shortened life span." Yes, as in 
death from cancer or heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Included as supplementary material for this week's fifth-grade edition is a 
color poster that, indeed, graphically displays cigarette damage to lungs. But 
Joe Camel appears too, in a large illustration with the story. That choice 
raises disturbing questions not just because Camel is made by RJR Nabisco but 
also because the company has steadfastly denied it uses this cartoon character 
to hook children. Oh, the caption on the pictured Joe Camel ad: "It pays to be 
smooth." Sure seems to.

N. IRELAND WATCH; HOPE IN A WEARY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Combined Loyalist Military Command, an umbrella body for several 
Protestant terrorist groups in Northern Ireland, Thursday declared a cease-fire 
that will be, it promises, as permanent as the cease-fire declared in August by 
its Catholic nationalist counterpart, the Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second shoe that weary Northern Irish had been waiting to hear 
fall.Both sides want to believe that, at last, a generation of bloodshed is at 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
 The loyalist declaration was greeted with open enthusiasm by Irish Prime 
Minister Albert Reynolds. British Prime Minister John Major reacted with more 
guarded hopefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain promised a year ago that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political partner, would 
be welcome at multilateral negotiations after three months of unbroken peace. 
Major, himself once the target of an IRA assassination attempt, is under 
mounting pressure for an earlier start. Whatever his personal feelings, the 
news, which reached him at a Tory Party conference, is something of a political 
windfall, and he may capitalize on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalist terrorism has taken more lives in recent years than nationalist 
terrorism, and the Protestants' targets are typically civilians identified as 
enemies by their Roman Catholic affiliation alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear exists that leaders of the Combined Loyalist Military Command may be 
less firmly in control than Gerry Adams of the IRA's Sinn Fein. But their hand, 
like Adams', is strengthened by a popular feeling that even the hardest of the 
"hard men" may be forced to acknowledge: It's about time.

STANDING ALONE IN RESISTING IRAQ?; IF NECESSARY, U.S. SHOULD ACT UNILATERALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The firm international support that quickly gathered behind the bold 
American-led response to Iraq's most recent threats toward Kuwait has begun to 
show disturbing signs of slippage. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States wants the U.N. Security Council to limit Saddam Hussein's 
freedom of military action in southern Iraq. What Washington rightly fears is 
that without externally enforced restraints the Iraqi dictator could again move 
at any time to menace Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, U.S. officials floated the idea of a deep exclusion zone from which 
Iraqi heavy weapons would be banned. The other permanent members of the council 
-- Britain, China, France and Russia -- showed little interest in that notion. 
Now Madeleine Albright, the American ambassador to the United Nations, is 
trying to get a consensus for a simpler plan requiring only that Iraq's best 
troops, the Republican Guards, permanently leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The tactical merit in this idea is that the largely ineffectual regular Iraqi 
conscript troops that would remain could not be trusted to carry off anything 
as demanding as a second invasion of Kuwait. The real threat comes from the 
Republican Guards; it's their personal loyalty to Saddam Hussein that helps to 
make them so dangerous as a fighting force. That's why Washington wants them 
out of southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright has a lot of persuading to do, not least because France and Russia 
have powerful commercial reasons for going easy with Iraq, including relaxing 
the sanctions that were imposed four years ago. Both countries stand to gain 
billions when trade and investment with Baghdad again become legal. This 
consideration, of course, influences their diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the United States act to enforce its own restraints on Iraqi actions in 
southern Iraq without a specific new Security Council mandate? Washington has 
already indicated that it believes it has that authority, under both existing 
U.N. resolutions and Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which affirms the right of 
individual and collective self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saudi Arabia Thursday U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry said that 
while most American ground troops will probably leave Kuwait soon, a 
considerable U.S. air presence will remain in the region to make sure that Iraq 
behaves itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, strong international support for keeping Saddam in line is 
preferable; it is not, however, strictly required. The United States, weighing 
its own national interests, is apparently ready to act on its own if need be to 
protect its friends and vital world oil supplies in the Persian Gulf. That 
would be a tough decision to take, but a necessary one.

AID TO COMATOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oct. 3 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to let stand the Court of 
Appeals decision that requires medical personnel to provide ongoing medical 
care to hopelessly comatose people is another example of how our leaders are 
helping to make it impossible to properly allocate the limited resources for 
providing medical services to our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-too-common exercises in futility are continuing to deprive millions of 
Americans of needed medical services that could improve their health. Wake up, 
America!

SENATE FILIBUSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Talking Democracy to Death," by Elliot L. Richardson, Commentary, Oct 6: 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's commentary about the filibuster stalemates in the U.S. Senate 
addresses a symptom, rather than the fundamental illness that has made the 
103rd Congress truly deserving of Harry Truman's campaign epithet: the 
Do-Nothing Congress. Richardson's proposed cure of the symptom may ultimately 
be worse than the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The illness is ideologic poisoning. This disease is made more serious by 
chronic faintheartedness in the Democratic congressional leadership. A powerful 
Republican right wing, endowed with influence by Ronald Reagan and let run 
rampant under the fairly weak regime of George Bush, has had its way since 
1980. Until Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993, the GOP right pursued a 
program of dismantling government. During that time, the Democratic 
congressional leadership rarely fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's philosophy, on the other hand, is clearly that of an activist, 
involved government. The Republican right is truly religious in its utter 
hatred of, and implacable opposition to, anything in the Clinton White House. 
Clinton, for his part, has done little to clarify this situation of ideological 
opposition and the poisoning of the legislative process. Richardson's proposal, 
however, sounds suspiciously like an idea to guarantee Clinton will never have 
any influence if the GOP is able to take control of the Senate in the coming 
elections. Temporarily, the end of the filibuster seems a good idea. 
Ultimately, the solution to this problem is not to change the rules so that a 
simple majority holds absolute control of the legislative process. The 
filibuster has been used as much for good as for evil in the history of the 
Senate.  
</P>
<P>
 Richardson should lend his considerable influence to helping Americans and 
their legislature recover from ideological poisoning. This country, including 
our renowned (and sometimes infamous) Senate, cannot function in the present 
situation.

 * Bravo to Richardson's criticism of the continual U.S. Senate filibusters to 
which the voters have been subjected this term. I am sick and tired watching a 
41% minority overrule a 59% majority in the Senate. This is perhaps a naive but 
nonetheless serious question: Could Richardson's group, Action, Not Gridlock!, 
drag the Senate before the Supreme Court and get the court to force the Senate 
to operate according to the Constitution? After all, the Constitution says that 
a 51% majority is sufficient to pass a regular bill, not a 59% majority, which 
is in fact currently required. I'd be the first to make a contribution!

 * I have been recently reading about the Republican abuse of the filibuster in 
the Senate to defeat what I consider necessary legislation, the most important 
being campaign finance reform. In my opinion the filibuster is an abuse of a 
Senate rule originated to assure complete discussion and exploration of bills 
before a vote. This rule, in effect, gives a minority of senators the power to 
veto prospective legislation. The intent of this practice would seem to be in 
clear violation of the majority decision-making written into the Constitution.

 * Can anyone address this issue? I put forth 100% effort teaching the basics 
of algebra to my math classes. Recently, during my lesson, a student stood up, 
walked to the back of the room, and conversed with another student.I asked her 
to please return to her seat. She replied, "My friend has to explain it to me 
since you won't because I'm black." 
</P>
<P>
 Her classmates of all races told her she was way out of line. I knew there was 
no truth to her accusation. But I also know that our classrooms are full of 
students who come to school every day dragged down by this self-defeating 
attitude.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE MTA; IT'S NOT EITHER/OR; WE NEED RAIL AND BUS; CRITICS OF 
THE PASADENA BLUE LINE ARE WRONG TO MAKE IT A POOR VERSUS RICH, MINORITY VERSUS 
NON-MINORITY ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CROWFOO; BILL TAN, ; ERIC TORO, Bill Crowfoot is an attorney and a

<P>
 Having failed to kill the Los Angeles-to-Pasadena Blue Line project during 
budget deliberations of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, opponents of 
the project have gone to federal court to paralyze the ongoing construction of 
a system that twice was approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 When they adopted Propositions A and C in 1980 and 1990, respectively, the 
people of Los Angeles County issued an unmistakable mandate by choosing rail as 
part of the region's transportation future. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, of course, can support the MTA's fiscal and operational mismanagement 
that has led to serious budget shortfalls. Nor should the MTA budget and its 
inefficiencies be balanced on the backs of those least able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also important to differentiate between the Blue Line light rail, whose 
construction has been virtually problem-free, from the Metro Red Line 
heavy-rail subway train, which has been marred by construction-related 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents have skillfully and cynically twisted MTA problems, half-truths 
and inaccurate information to create phony dilemmas of bus versus rail and 
affluent versus poor. More than 63% of those living along the Pasadena Blue 
Line corridor are minorities, including lower-income Latinos and African 
Americans, who constitute the vast majority of transit users. But all 
residents, regardless of ethnic makeup, will enjoy the benefits that come from 
the expanded transit opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also completely ignore the economic implications of the Blue Line 
and overall light-rail program for Southern California. Today, traffic 
congestion and air pollution are a way of life. Without public transportation 
improvements, the average speed of rush-hour traffic will grind to 17 m.p.h. 
Wasted employee time and bottle-necked flow of goods and services will mean 
potential business losses of $2 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail lines would vastly reduce the region's smog problems and the regulatory 
burden placed on the economy. They would also attract future housing and 
businesses along rapid transit corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 The region needs more transportation. But we can no longer build ourselves out 
of our transportation quandary with more freeways. And buses alone cannot meet 
the complex demands. 
</P>
<P>
 A small group thinking only of its needs today has chosen to throw legal 
roadblocks in the path of Southern California's transportation future. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not about choosing bus over rail transit. It's about the clear 
mandate the people expressed when they voted for Propositions A and C.

WHO'S THE MODEL CHRISTIAN FOR THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT?; POLITICS: CLINTON IS MOCKED 
AS A WIMP FOR HIS PEACE-MAKING AND COMPASSIONATE POLICIES. WASN'T THIS CHRIST'S 
MANDATE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WARREN JOHNSON, Warren Johnson is a professor of geography at San Diego 
State University, specializing in environmental/economic linkages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The religious right, long in the forefront of opposition to President Clinton, 
has begun to draw blood with questions about his stature as a Christian, and 
even secular critics are joining in the feeding frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's waffling behavior is seen as a manifestation of a lack of 
principles. His association with Jimmy Carter lately hasn't helped. Both men 
are seen as soft in the head, especially after reaching compromises with thugs 
in Haiti and dictators in North Korea. They are not seen as real men, as making 
Americans stand tall -- as President Reagan did. 
</P>
<P>
 This is ironic since both Clinton and Carter are churchgoing Christians who 
try to act according to their faith. Reagan, in contrast, rarely went to 
church, was divorced and headed what was clearly a dysfunctional family, at 
least according to what his children have said about it. Yet the religious 
right loved him. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there something about being an avowed Christian that makes Clinton seem 
like a wimp in an age when strength is everything? Even George Bush's actions 
in Somalia, which saved hundreds of thousands of people from starvation, were 
ridiculed by those who saw nothing contradictory in demanding that the unborn 
be saved in this country while letting the living starve elsewhere. We had no 
national interest (read selfish interest) in Somalia. (Or in health care for 
poor Americans; we have too many of them anyway.) 
</P>
<P>
 I consider myself a Christian, but I fail to see anything Christian in the 
agenda of the religious right. All I see is fearful people who have allowed 
themselves to be used by right-wingers mainly interested in getting government 
off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe Clinton and politicians in general are being made the scapegoats for 
a country going in directions that deeply trouble Americans of all political 
and religious persuasions. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious right charges that government programs have weakened the family. 
In fact, the government has tried -- unsuccessfully, to be sure -- to patch 
together the broken families that this country is producing in such abundance. 
Child protective services cannot heal the injuries children suffer at home, not 
any more than prayers in the schools could. Welfare may not do much to improve 
the lot of the poor, but putting them out on the streets to beg and steal was 
rejected long ago, along with child labor and debtors prison. 
</P>
<P>
 If the family has weakened, it is mainly because people have become so 
absorbed in making a living that they have little time or emotional energy left 
for their children. For people to live simple lives built around family and 
community is hardly an alternative these days, and children suffer for it. 
Marriages do, too. It is the economy that is ordering our lives today, and by 
comparison, the government is just as ineffective as conservatives charge.  
</P>
<P>
 What does the Bible say about economics? It is not some sort of capitalist 
manifesto, as the right tries to suggest. Just the opposite: In all but the 
oldest books, the quest for wealth is a sin. In two of the Gospels, Christ says 
"You cannot serve both God and money," for "where your treasure is, there your 
heart will be too." In Matthew, Christ says, "It is easier for a camel to get 
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." 
We are told to concern ourselves with only the simplest of needs. In Paul's 
words: "Having food and raiment, let us therefore be content." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the free market has, in a real sense, become our religion, since 
what it brings forth is defined as good. In this view, government is a negative 
force, since it takes away from the incentive to create wealth. The free market 
demands a maximum of freedom to be most productive, and that appeals to a 
society that has come to see personal growth as life's purpose. The ties that 
held people together in the past -- community values, civic duty, family honor 
-- have collapsed under the weight of individual rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Our history books celebrate those who were most aggressive in taking advantage 
of the extraordinary opportunities created by the free market; under these 
movers and shakers, the economy became an awesome machine for the production of 
goods and services. The same market forces drive so much of what taints our 
society today: the violent films and music, pornography. Even crack dealers are 
classic entrepreneurs, except that their market niche is illegal -- the only 
reason it remains available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The market has also brought forth spectacular new technologies, but they also 
destroyed old freedoms, such as the freedom to be a small farmer or an 
independent craftsman or shopkeeper. The natural logic of a free-enterprise 
system unconstrained by higher values has given us the society we have now: 
cities abandoned by corporations, the destitute left to fend for themselves, a 
world where only the criminal and the politician can claim success. And our 
celebrated mobility, the freedom to "go west, young man," has brought us to a 
world in which loneliness and isolation are as inevitable as substance abuse 
and broken homes. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to think that the religious right is not representative, that 
most sincere Christians want to follow Christ's teachings. If so, they must 
read Christ's words more carefully, and then think about their application in 
our society. This is hard, given the point we have reached. The fearful things 
that are happening around us are driven by powerful forces. But to lash out at 
Christian presidents for doing things that are at least close to what Christ 
asks for is only going to make things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need a religious right, just as we don't need a religious left. We 
Christians need a religious center, a movement that strives to follow what 
Christ asks of us, wherever that takes us. We have to decide what the treasures 
in this life really are, since where our treasures are, there will our hearts 
be too.

BLAMING GENES TO EXCUSE SOCIAL INACTION; THEORY: UNABLE TO PROVE THAT IQ IS 
HEREDITARY, TWO CONSERVATIVES WON'T CONCEDE THAT ENVIRONMENT DOES MATTER.

 In "Losing Ground," the 1984 book that made his name, Charles Murray 
pooh-poohed the role of race in America's social pathology. Instead, Murray 
blamed liberal welfare programs that harmed black and white alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Focusing on blacks cripples progress," he declared in 1986, "because 
explanations of the special problems facing blacks nearly all begin with the 
assumption that blacks are different from everyone else, whether because of 
racism (as the apologists argue) or because of inherent traits (as the racists 
argue)." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was then. Now, it turns out that Murray indeed thinks blacks face 
problems "because of inherent traits (as the racists argue)" -- or, at any 
rate, because of immutable traits. In a new book, "The Bell Curve," Murray and 
his co-author, the late Richard Herrnstein, argue that blacks have, on average, 
significantly lower "cognitive ability" than whites. Murray connects this 
disability with all sorts of pathologies, including poverty, crime and lack of 
"middle-class values." 
</P>
<P>
 Just because many people (myself included) resist Murray's vision as alien and 
repellent doesn't mean he's wrong. It's possible that some ethnic groups have, 
on average, higher mental abilities than others (it would be odd if every group 
came out the same). But Murray's dishonest book shows that he is not a reliable 
guide to exploring this possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 To make their pessimistic "ethnic difference" argument, Murray and Herrnstein 
must demonstrate three things: (1) that there is a single, general measure of 
mental ability, IQ; (2) that IQ tests, on which blacks score roughly 15 points 
lower than whites, aren't culturally biased, and (3) that IQ is fixed across 
generations -- classically, that it's "in the genes." 
</P>
<P>
 As a lay reader of "The Bell Curve," I am unable to judge the first two 
claims. But it's pretty obvious that Murray and Herrnstein run into big trouble 
on step three, because they spend a lot of time trying to undermine a 
near-avalanche of evidence that the black-white difference in IQ is a function 
of "environment" rather than heredity. There is, for example, the convergence 
of black and white test scores over the past 20 years, which Murray admits has 
been so fast it is "likely" due to "environmental changes." There is the 
phenomenon of rapidly rising test scores worldwide. French researchers have 
boosted IQ 12 points by placing poor children in affluent homes. American 
researchers produced an eight-point gain by offering intensive day care. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all disastrously good news for Murray. What's an apocalyptic social 
critic to do? Here, Murray has a bold, even brilliant, idea. Having failed to 
show that race differences in IQ are genetic, he simply declares "it matters 
little"! After all, what counts isn't the source of IQ differences, but how 
hard they are to change. And there is a "statistical tendency" for bad learning 
environments to be passed down from parent to child. 
</P>
<P>
 With this one dramatic move, Murray achieves two seemingly contradictory ends. 
He preserves his scary extrapolations -- the prediction that the black-white 
gap will persist more or less indefinitely. And he defuses the charge that he 
believes in genetic inferiority. Just as by denying of the role of race in 
"Losing Ground" Murray made himself seem a reasonable, race-neutral scholar, so 
by denying the importance of heredity in "The Bell Curve" he seems a nice, 
non-racist fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with the assertion that "it matters little whether the genes 
are involved" is that it's crazy. It matters a lot if the black-white 
difference is genetic, because genetic differences in mental ability are almost 
certainly much harder to alter. Yes, there are simple cures for some hereditary 
conditions, like baldness. But as yet there is no Rogaine for the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent symposium on his book, Murray delivered a sweeping pronouncement 
about the irrelevance to policy of whether black-white differences are genetic 
or environmental. What about affirmative action? someone asked. Isn't the 
argument that if blacks are artificially vaulted into the middle class it will 
change the environment in which the next generation is raised? Doesn't it 
matter for that argument if environment is the key? Gee, Murray responded. He 
hadn't thought of that.  
</P>
<P>
 There are other, equally obvious policies that might change the black 
"environment" and therefore black IQ scores. Murray himself has proposed one of 
the more dramatic alterations: abolition of cash welfare, which he says would 
produce more responsible parents (which in turn might affect even prenatal 
nutrition). 
</P>
<P>
 If ethnic IQ differences are not genetic, there is a good chance that if we 
improve the awful environment in which many black children now grow up, the 
black and white average IQ scores will continue to move closer together -- 
close enough for Americans to live comfortably by emphasizing common values 
(work, family) rather than what Murray once denounced as "the assumption that 
blacks are different from everyone else."

PERSPECTIVES ON THE MTA; TRANSIT CAN'T THINK SHORT TERM; IF WE DON'T RAISE 
RATES NOW -- JUST TO CATCH UP -- RICH AND POOR WILL SUFFER FROM THE RESULTING 
GRIDLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKLIN E. WHITE, Franklin E. White is the chief executive officer of the 
MTA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claims that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's fare increase and the 
rail lines we are building are discriminatory are patently absurd. Such claims 
are offensive and insulting to all the dedicated MTA employees of all ethnic 
backgrounds who have worked for years to provide quality public transportation 
for their fellow Los Angeles County citizens. These claims should be firmly 
rejected by U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. at a hearing he has scheduled 
for Monday to consider lifting a preliminary injunction that prevents us from 
implementing a new fare structure. 
</P>
<P>
 While virtually every other major transit provider in the country raised fares 
during the last six years to keep up with rising costs, MTA kept its fare at 
$1.10. Inflation finally caught up with us, however, resulting in a 
$126-million deficit for 1995. Before we considered raising fares, we cut 500 
staff positions and reduced internal costs substantially. The new fare 
structure is firmly in line with those in other large urban centers. It was a 
reasonable and necessary business decision, completely free of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision not to allow MTA to raise its fares could actually hurt the 
people it was meant to help. MTA is losing about $110,000 each day the higher 
fares are not collected. Even if we are successful in court, as we believe we 
will be, the more time that passes before there is a resolution to this case, 
the harder it will be for MTA to balance its budget -- and the more danger 
there will be to existing service levels. 
</P>
<P>
 It is simply untrue to assert that our current and planned rail systems favor 
mostly white ridership. Ridership statistics and demographic information 
regarding the areas the rail lines will serve debunk any claim of racial bias. 
Three-quarters of all Blue Line riders are minorities; nearly 90% of Red Line 
subway riders are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the corridors to be served by future rail lines are populated by a high 
percentage of minorities. The Federal Transportation Administration defines the 
Pasadena Blue Line as a minority line, because it will serve an area with a 63% 
minority population. The Green Line, due to open next year, will serve an area 
in which eight of every 10 residents is a minority. Ninety-six out of every 100 
residents living along the Red Line's eastern extension route are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is the commuter rail line most cited by our critics. The MTA, 
however, doesn't operate Metrolink, and its fares are not set by Los Angeles 
County, but by a separate organization composed of all five counties served. We 
contribute a relatively small amount from funds that can only be used for 
commuter rail. These funds could not legally be used for bus operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Our critics' disenchantment with the rail program is shortsighted. The 
Southern California Assn. of Governments predicts population, employment and 
travel demand in our region will increase by about one-third in the next two 
decades. Even with the rail lines we are building, peak-hour freeway speeds are 
expected to decline to under 10 m.p.h. Such conditions will destroy the 
regional economy and make it impossible to meet clean-air mandates. Alternative 
modes, such as rail, will be needed to relieve gridlocked streets and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal court is no place for resolution of the funding priorities for the 
MTA. Our policy board is duly established as the authority for resolving 
funding priorities. The board must balance its decision between preparing for 
the future and meeting the current needs of our patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 How much riders should contribute to the cost of their trip and whether their 
future needs should be met by bus, trains or other new approaches are 
public-policy questions better left to the MTA board of directors, which is 
responsible to the electorate.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: WATSON, NBC PLAY PRESSURE SHOTS THAT GOLF DOESN'T 
NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the golf world turns:  
</P>
<P>
 The very week we learned that a letter from Tom Watson played a role in 
getting CBS' Gary McCord bumped off the Masters comes word from NBC that Dick 
Enberg will replace Jim Lampley in the 18th-hole tower next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was made Thursday in a conference call with reporters, and 
one of the questions directed at Tommy Roy, NBC's executive producer of sports 
and coordinating producer of golf, was whether Watson had approved the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and Enberg laughed, but neither commented. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the deal with Watson? 
</P>
<P>
 The letter he sent to CBS golf producer Frank Chirkinian and Masters chairman 
Jackson Stephens complaining about McCord, circulated among fellow golf pros, 
was printed in the November issue of Golf Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter ends: "(McCord) is the Howard Stern of TV golf and you (Chirkinian) 
should be ashamed, rather than champion his 'irreverent' behavior. Get rid of 
him, now." 
</P>
<P>
 If McCord is the Howard Stern of golf, then Watson has suddenly become the 
Howard Cosell, an infamous back-stabber. 
</P>
<P>
 The really sad part is that Stephens acted on Watson's letter. He got CBS, 
over Chirkinian's protests, to take McCord off next year's Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Golf World magazine had reported that Enberg might replace Lampley, 
Enberg said he is as surprised as anyone about his new assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 A non-golfer, Enberg said his role will be to personalize and humanize the 
game and that he will leave the analysis to partner Johnny Miller and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The others will include Lampley, who will become one of NBC's course 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second major demotion this year for Lampley, who was replaced on 
"NFL Live" by Greg Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease Lampley, NBC gave him a new contract, which, among other things, 
makes him the late-night host for the 1996 Summer Olympics at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy explained the change by saying, "I look at this as if I were a head coach 
and wanted to get both players on the field at the same time. This is not a 
demotion for Jim, it is a change of roles. I wouldn't try to read too much into 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there have been rumors that the U.S. Golf Assn., which recently 
awarded the U.S. Open to NBC, was not happy with Lampley and preferred Enberg. 
</P>
<P>
 So this could be a Gary McCord situation all over again, with the 
rights-holder telling the network what announcers are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Enberg: "My golfing friends say what irritates them the most is an 
announcer who talks too much. I'll certainly try not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lampley isn't exactly known for succinctness. The USGA might prefer a Pat 
Summerall type, but it shouldn't have a say in who announces any of its events, 
if indeed that was the case here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enberg said the new assignment will mean only that he will have to give up his 
role as an NBA play-by-play announcer during the regular season. He will be 
able to keep everything else, and also work NBA playoff games. Gumbel and Tom 
Hammond will fill the void during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he has ever played golf, Enberg said he tried it in his younger 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have the temperament for it," he said. "People who know me would be 
surprised at how I acted on the golf course. I think I still own the record of 
158 feet for longest nine-iron throw at Balboa Golf Course in the San Fernando 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add golf: Because of football, we're in the middle of a six-week lull of major 
golf. The last major competition was the Presidents Cup on CBS on Sept. 17-18, 
and the next will be the Tour Championship on ABC at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 But NBC this weekend offers a made-for-TV golf event, the Skills Challenge, 
which was taped in Phoenix on Monday. It will be on Saturday after BYU-Notre 
Dame football and on Sunday after the Raiders-Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the field is Chi Chi Rodriguez, who turns out to be the star of 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been quite a week for Rodriguez. On Monday, the Hilton Corp. gave him a 
lifetime achievement award and Wednesday he was named grand marshal of the 
Tournament of Roses parade.

BROWNS TAKE GLOVES OFF AGAINST OILERS; PRO FOOTBALL: DEFENSE DOMINATES IN

 But before Michael Dean Perry interrupts this story with one of those giant 
swats that filled television screens nationwide Thursday night, one more thing 
should be noted about the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 They have the second-best record in football after an 11-8 victory over the 
Houston Oilers at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you don't think this 5-1 team is a legitimate AFC Super Bowl contender, 
then you haven't been watching a conference in which nobody rattles facemasks 
like this anymore.

 "Sooner or later, people are going to start paying attention," said Cleveland 
cornerback Don Griffin after the Browns' fourth consecutive victory. "We're 
going to make them." 
</P>
<P>
 If they do, it will be with people like bland Coach Bill Belichick, erratic 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, prehistoric running back Earnest Byner and former 
New York Giant linebackers Pepper Johnson and Carl Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will mostly be because of team defense. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday the Browns came within 28 seconds of pitching their second 
shutout, nearly causing an Oiler team to leave the field scoreless for the 
first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 They have allowed only four touchdowns in their last four games and are 
allowing a league-low 11 points per game for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But their most impressive statistic Thursday was two . 
</P>
<P>
 That is the number of gloves that nutso Brown fans -- are there any other 
kind? -- stole from rookie cornerback Issac Booth as he left the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, who personally thwarted two fourth-quarter drives with an end-zone 
deflection and interception at the eight-yard line, made the mistake of 
sticking his hands in a makeshift end-zone "Dawg Pound" filled with Brown fans. 
</P>
<P>
 He has learned that with the team off to its best start since Jim Brown was 
playing -- 1965 -- the people in those pounds bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember watching the Browns on TV as a kid, seeing how their fans were 
everywhere," said Booth, a fifth-round pick from California. "But I never 
believed it would be like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he knows how the defending Central Division champion Oilers felt as they 
fell to 1-5, their worst start since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts to watch," said Sean Jones, former Oiler defensive end who attended 
the game during a day off from the Green Bay Packers. "They destroyed a great 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Depleted by injuries, salary cap and locker room dissension between the 
offense and defense, the Oilers started the game with 12 of the 22 players who 
started in their playoff game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 This group was harassed into two turnovers, five sacks, and just 183 yards 
until the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of their people played the game with one eye on the ball and one eye 
looking at who is going to hit them," said Eric Turner, Brown safety and former 
UCLA star who is having a Pro Bowl-type season. "You might say we intimidated 
them a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 This defense is so good, it intimidates the offense, which accumulated 193 
yards and the touchdown on a 25-yard pass from Testaverde to Mark Carrier in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 And then shut down. The Browns gained only 67 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're going to get the ball in good field position from our defense, 
and we know we had better capitalize," said Testaverde, who threw two more 
interceptions to give him a league-leading 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the games they are supposed to win with a third-place schedule, the 
Browns could finish the season at 11-5. And if they gain home-field advantage 
for the wintry postseason? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it all depends on whether they have any gloves left.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MCDANIEL GOT A HOT TIP FROM BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry McDaniel intercepted three passes in the Raiders' victory over New 
England last Sunday, but on one of them he benefited from a tipped pass by 
defensive tackle Jerry Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 1 and 310 pounds, Ball does not have the look of an explosive 
leaper.But his size is deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I can get up," said Ball, who with 14 tackles and two sacks has been a 
pleasant surprise for the Raiders after signing as a free agent from Cleveland. 
"I don't dunk anymore because jumping like that is too hard on your knees. But 
I can still get up and lay it over a goal post and you know that's (10 feet)." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry has good athletic ability," said Shell, who was one of the league's top 
mobile big men in his 15-year playing career. "It's all in the timing, which is 
something he is good at. Jerry's a big man but can move." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are in good shape physically going into Sunday's game at Miami. 
Safety Patrick Bates, wide receiver James Jett, cornerback Albert Lewis and 
defensive tackle Chester McGlockton are all listed as probable. . . . The 
Dolphins will start Bernie Parmalee at running back in place of Terry Kirby, 
who is out for the season with a knee injury. Recently signed former Ram 
Cleveland Gary might play, too. . . . Who said the Raiders don't have a 
1,000-yard rusher in their backfield? Quarterback Jeff Hostetler needs only 57 
yards rushing to reach 1,000 yards in his career. . . . Punter Jeff Gossett 
still leads the NFL with a 46.2-yard average. LONNIE WHITE

<P>
 Fullback Merril Hoge, brought to the Chicago Bears because of his durability 
and toughness, is hoping to save his career after two concussions in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, he says, is saving his health. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge, scheduled to see a neurologist in Pittsburgh, already has met with a 
specialist at Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
 "A week ago I was doing everything in my power to get back on the field," Hoge 
said. "Since this has persisted and lingered beyond my thinking, I've changed 
my tune." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge suffered his first concussion Aug. 23 in an exhibition game in Kansas 
City. His second concussion came in an Oct. 2 home game against Buffalo when he 
was kneed in the head as he was throwing a block. When he missed Sunday's game 
against New Orleans, his streak of 112 consecutive games ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Buffalo game he has suffered from post-concussion syndrome, amnesia, 
dizziness, headaches and flu-like symptoms.

 The Seattle Seahawks will be back in the Kingdome for their Nov. 6 game 
against Cincinnati. Closed since July 19 when four acoustical ceiling tiles 
crashed into the empty stands before a Seattle Mariner game, the Kingdome is 
undergoing a $32.5-million overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks played their first five home games -- two exhibitions and three 
regular-season games -- at the University of Washington's Husky Stadium.

</P>

 John Robinson on his Pacific 10-leading punter, John Stonehouse, who has taken 
some big hits lately: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a good punter, the penalty (for roughing the kicker) should be 30 
yards. He's as good a punter as I've been around. He's handled bad snaps and 
gotten the ball off well." 
</P>
<P>
 Stonehouse, a junior, tops the conference with a 42.8 average, just ahead of 
UCLA's Darren Schager. EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; LINEBACKER GLAD TO SHED REDSHIRT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea was to groom Tim Waddleton to be a pass rusher, to fatten him up a 
little to deal with opposing tackles and make him into a Jamir Miller type. 
</P>
<P>
 It was going to take time. A redshirt year was planned, which would give 
Waddleton, a junior college transfer, two seasons to play outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have been marked down to 1 1/2, because Waddleton has been rushed into 
a UCLA defense bereft of a pass rush and told to grow into the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine by me," Waddleton said. "It was getting to me, watching games 
instead of playing in them." 
</P>
<P>
 As it became increasingly apparent that, because of injuries or otherwise, 
Anthony Jones, a transfer from Notre Dame, was not playing up to his potential, 
defensive coordinator Bob Field decided to bring in Waddleton in the season's 
sixth game and burn his redshirt season. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddleton was immediately made a starter on UCLA's pass-situation defense, and 
on his first rush, he sacked California quarterback Dave Barr for a six-yard 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 There won't be many passing situations Saturday against Oregon State's 
wishbone offense, but there will be plenty of opportunities to use Waddleton's 
speed. It's a role he relishes and one he is ready to grow into. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the offensive line torn up by injuries, Mike Christensen has been moving 
all over the place, returning to his accustomed left guard after suffering a 
partially torn knee ligament, and also playing on the right side, replacing 
Mike Rohme, who is replacing Matt Soenksen. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen has also handled a few snaps at center, where he started in the 
first two games last season. He might not start on Saturday but is expected to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Gully is also playing up and down the line, taking a turn at every 
position except center this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Bruins returning include fullbacks Greg Ford and James Milliner, and 
just in time because starting fullback Daron Washington is nursing a bruise on 
his arm. Not playing will be wide receiver J.J. Stokes, for the third week in a 
row and fifth week in the last six, though he is expected to be ready for 
Arizona next week. JIM HODGES

 Sophomore walk-on quarterback Matt Turman probably will start for No. 2

 Tommie Frazier is out for the season with recurring blood clots in his right

SENIOR TENNIS; CONNORS DOMINATES FLEMING IN CHAMPIONS EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Connors used his trademark two-handed backhand returns and quick 
footwork to put away Peter Fleming, 6-3, 7-5, in the quarterfinals of the 
Digital PC Champions tournament before 3,000 at Sherwood Country Club in 
Thousand Oaks on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having some great rallies, but I wasn't winning any of them," said 
Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 "With most of the guys on this tour, I can stand back and rally and be fine. 
It took me a while to realize that was a ridiculously stupid thing to do with 
Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming didn't have much success at the net either and was repeatedly passed 
when he came in. 
</P>
<P>
 If the presence of Connors, who is the co-founder of the 35-and-over tennis 
tour, and Bjorn Borg, who played in a doubles match later Thursday night, gave 
the evening session emphasis, then Mansour Bahrami was the show-stopper of the 
afternoon. The 38-year-old Iranian defeated Tim Gullikson, 4-6, 6-1, 7-6, twice 
recovering from a three-game deficit in the final set to force and eventually 
win a tiebreaker, 8-6. TRIS WYKES

CLEVELAND FOOLS HOUSTON; OILERS EMBARRASSED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cleveland Browns left the Houston Oilers red-faced on prime time 
television -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland used trickery on a two-point conversion and Vinny Testaverde's 
25-yard touchdown pass to Mark Carrier for an 11-8 victory over Houston on 
Thursday night as the Browns reached 5-1 for the first time since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another embarrassing nationally televised moment for the Oilers, beaten 
30-14 on Oct. 3 by Pittsburgh. The Oilers face another prime time date on Oct. 
24 at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-5) were within 28 seconds of their first shutout loss in 18 
years in the Astrodome, but Billy Joe Tolliver threw a five-yard TD pass to 
Lorenzo White. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tolliver completed a two-point conversion pass to Haywood Jeffires, 
Houston trailed by the margin of Al Del Greco's missed 29-yard field goal 
attempt earlier in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolliver, who came in with 7 1/2 minutes to play, completed nine of 17 for 115 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns did just enough to get their fourth consecutive victory and a 
stronger hold on the lead in the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns missed two early touchdown chances when Testaverde twice underthrew 
Carrier after the wide receiver had beaten cornerback Darryll Lewis. Lewis 
intercepted the first pass and returned it 20 yards to the Oilers 49. Lewis 
also intercepted a pass in the fourth quarter but penalties by the Oilers 
killed that opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland scored its points in the second quarter on Testaverde's 25-yard pass 
to Carrier with 8:21 left, Tom Tupa's two-point conversion run and Matt 
Stover's 35-yard field goal as time ran out in the half.

GARDEN GROVE'S GROUND GAME RACES PAST LA QUINTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MADDY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news for La Quinta after a 34-0 loss to Garden Grove Thursday night 
is that the season probably won't get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs (1-5, 0-3) have been outscored, 124-19, in their first three league 
games while facing probably the three best teams in the league.They entered 
Thursday's game with their top three quarterbacks sidelined and James Nguyen, a 
converted wide receiver, taking the snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove (4-2, 3-0) thoroughly dominated the game, outgaining La Quinta, 
293-22, and holding the Aztecs to minus-10 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts did most of their damage on the ground. Manuel Millan ran for 
100 yards, including scoring runs of 50 and eight yards, and Ruben Reyna 
chipped in 49 yards. Reserve Paul Chapin added 67 yards, all in the final 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Argonaut junior quarterback Troy Haller completed only four of 11 passes, but 
three went for touchdowns. Brian Jones caught scoring passes of 33 and 32 
yards, while Reyna caught a 20-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight for the Aztecs was a 62-yard kickoff return on the final play of 
the third quarter by sophomore Jhamal Dawkins, putter La Quinta at the Garden 
Grove 33. However, a bad handoff five plays later turned the ball over to the 
Argonauts. La Quinta turned over the ball five times, twice inside the Garden 
Grove 20. ERIC MADDY

WALLACE LEADS WORKMAN PAST BOLSA GRANDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City of Industry Workman's Charles Wallace ran for 198 yards and scored three 
touchdowns to lead the Lobos to a 27-0 nonleague victory over Bolsa Grande 
Thursday night at La Puente High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande (1-5) struggled on both sides of the ball and lost its fifth 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace got Workman on the board first when, with four minutes left in the 
first quarter, he returned a punt 67 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Workman defense held the Matadors to only one first down in their first 
three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Workman (1-5) struck again on the second play of the second quarter when 
quarterback Ryan Graham ran a quarterback draw eight yards for a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande's best scoring opportunity followed, when Matador quarterback 
David Prince connected with David Ross on a 46-yard pass to the Lobos' 30-yard 
line. But on first and goal from the six-yard line, Prince fumbled the snap and 
Workman recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande's next drive ended when a snap went over Prince's head and 
through the back of the end zone for a safety and a 15-0 Workman halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace finished off the Lobos' second drive of the third quarter, scoring on 
an eight-yard run to give Workman a 21-0 lead. Both teams struggled on offense 
the rest of the game. Workman's Mark Diaz intercepted a Prince pass late in the 
fourth quarter to set up Wallace's final score, a five-yard run with 30 seconds 
remaining. JON CLIFFORD

EMPIRE LEAGUE FOOTBALL; LOARA CONTROLS BALL, DEFEATS CENTURY, 17-0

 Loara controlled the ball for more than 31 minutes in defeating Century, 17-0, 
in an Empire League opener Thursday night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons were stopped on no gain on their first possession but took over on 
the Century 30-yard line when Aaron Cruz recovered a fumbled punt. 
</P>
<P>
 On second and 11 from the Century 17, Loara Coach John deFries inserted 
seniors Carson Crucil (221 pounds) and Kerry Peoples (180) into the Saxon 
backfield and the pair went the distance on six plays, with Peoples scoring 
from the five, to give Loara the 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get our physical people in early, something we haven't done much 
this year," deFries said. It was the only time the two played on offense in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting backfield of junior Marcus McBride (165 pounds) and sophomore 
John Duhon (155) did the bulk of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara built a 14-0 advantage in the second quarter when Jim Kirkland connected 
on an eight-yard scoring pass to Aaron Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons increased their lead to 17-0 in the third quarter when Pat Marmaud 
made a 19-yard field goal after a drive in which the Saxons gained 27 yards 
themselves and 25 on penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Century showed some offensive spark in the fourth quarter. Stanley Villanueva 
hit Jorge Rodriguez with a 50-yard pass but the drive ended on the 16. MIKE

ORANGE LEAGUE FOOTBALL; KING'S THREE TOUCHDOWNS HELP SAVANNA WIN, 26-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Daven King rushed for 164 yards and three touchdowns on Savanna's first three 
possessions as the Rebels beat Magnolia, 26-7, in an Orange League opener 
Thursday at Western High School. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who scored on runs of seven, 89 and four yards, said the victory was 
important for the Rebels (5-1, 1-0) because their 16-game winning streak was 
stopped last week by Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to go 5-0 in (nonleague play), but we couldn't get it," King said. 
"It's like a clean slate for us to start all over." 
</P>
<P>
 King's seven-yard touchdown capped Savanna's opening drive, which covered 81 
yards in 11 plays. 
</P>
<P>
 After Magnolia punted to Savanna's 11, King swept right on the Rebels' next 
play, cut across the field to the left sideline and faked out Magnolia 
defenders Kris Cabunat and Sean Roy on his way to an 89-yard touchdown with 3 
minutes 40 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 King gave Savanna a 20-0 lead when he capped a 15-play, 67-yard drive with a 
four-yard run with 7:16 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia quarterback Robert Nicols scored the Sentinels' only touchdown on a 
two-yard run with 19 seconds left in the half, as Magnolia drove 64 yards in 
1:14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels had 395 yards offense, and held Magnolia (1-5, 0-1) to 108 yards 
offense. Alex Carbajal led the Rebels with three sacks and an interception.

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE FOOTBALL; HIGHFIELD, MAHONEY HELP UNIVERSITY SHUT OUT 
ESTANCIA, 20-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jarrett Mahoney's 35-yard touchdown run midway through the first quarter 
helped University defeat Estancia, 20-0, in a Pacific Coast League opener 
Thursday night at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney carried only four times, rushing for 39 yards for University (3-3, 
1-0).Estancia (3-3, 0-1) was led by Karlo Amaya, who rushed for 77 yards in 11 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked as if Estancia would tie the score when Amaya raced for 45 yards for 
a touchdown early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But touchdown was negated when the Eagles were called for clipping. The drive 
ended when University's Ray Davis tackled quarterback Frough Jahid for a 
10-yard loss at the Trojans' 36-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 University broke open the game when Tucker Highfield scored from one yard with 
7:48 remaining in the game. The kick failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Highfield was the game's leading rusher with 105 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 University's defense accounted for the other score. Cornerback Bryant Geary 
intercepted a pass by backup quarterback Jack Clark and returned it 80 yards 
for a touchdown to put the Trojans ahead, 20-0, with 15 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 University's quarterback Alan Price attempted only three passes, completing 
one for seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jahid completed five of 15 passes for 65 yards for Estancia.

GOLDEN WEST LEAGUE FOOTBALL; WESTMINSTER'S LONG, LATE DRIVE OVERCOMES WINLESS 
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first Golden West League football game of the season proved memorable for 
Westminster and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster will remember the game because the Lions went 99 yards in the 
fourth quarter to score a touchdown to win, 17-14.Santa Ana's memories will be 
less pleasant, thanks to a failed trick play and an 84-yard touchdown run that 
was called back because of a clip. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana (0-6, 0-1 in league) had a prime chance to put away the game midway 
in the final quarter. The Saints reached the Westminster five before an 
incomplete pass brought fourth down. Santa Ana lined up for a field-goal 
attempt but holder and quarterback Brian Schwalm flipped a shovel pass to Jose 
Sagrero, who tried to score around the right end. He was stopped at the one 
with 6 minutes 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster (4-2, 1-0) had little trouble moving in for the winning score. 
Leonard Ibarra capped the drive with a 27-yard touchdown run on which he broke 
two tackles, then put an impressive move on a third defender to get free. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other big plays in the drive were a 22-yard pass from quarterback 
Jerry Allison to Todd Mann on third down and a 31-yard run on a reverse by 
Jimmy Adkisson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann had caught a pass at the one and bulled past two defenders for a 
touchdown on the final play of the first half to put Westminster ahead, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana got the ball back with 2:06 left in the game and reached the 
Westminster 42 with 1:04 left to play. But on first down, Santa Ana was called 
for offensive pass interference and was backed up 15 yards. Santa Ana 
quarterback Brian Schwalm threw three incomplete passes and time ran out.

FOOTHILL STUNS NO. 9 VILLA PARK WITH 19 POINTS IN FINAL MINUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Foothill scored 19 points in the final five minutes to upset previously 
unbeaten and ninth-ranked Villa Park, 33-14, in a Century League opener 
Thursday at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Sveslosky scored two of his three touchdowns in the final quarter and his 
interception led to another score. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a matchup of two teams expected to contend for the league title. 
Sveslosky and Foothill's defense rose to another level late in the game, and 
the Spartans fizzled after playing to a 14-14 tie early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sveslosky, who rushed for 84 yards in 17 carries, scored on a four-yard pass 
from quarterback Tyler Lang with 4 minutes 57 seconds remaining, then scored on 
a 17-yard run with 3:19 left after a Villa Park fumble, giving Foothill (2-4) a 
27-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 His interception led to Foothill's final score -- a 10-yard run by Trammel 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park (4-1-1) led, 14-7, before the Knights rallied to tie late in the 
third quarter. A 44-yard touchdown pass from Lang to Mike Boyes bounced off 
Villa Park's Larry Hendrick and into Boyes' hands as he ran untouched into the 
end zone with 1:23 remaining in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's defense, led by Ruben Vaughan, Mark Mason and Tony Tuioti, also 
played well, limiting Villa Park to 95 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park got a strong effort from sophomore tailback Franklin Haynes, who 
rushed for 75 yards in 18 carries and caught three passes for 82 yards. He 
scored on a five-yard run in the first half. FORREST LEE

CENTURY LEAGUE FOOTBALL; ORANGE COACH HILL CHALKS UP HIS 200TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The smile belied what he had been saying all week. Dick Hill's 200th victory 
in Orange County wasn't just another game. 
</P>
<P>
 George Perez and Greg Overton and a couple of other players held Hill aloft, 
like some sort of trophy, while Hill grinned from ear to ear. And after being 
lowered to the ground, you couldn't have knocked that smile off with a 
two-by-four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it means very much, in relationship to having it over," Hill said as 
well-wishers encircled him as though he was a 65-year-old rock star. "The kids 
wanted it very badly. I feel very proud to accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was most proud of the way Orange carried out the historic 40-19 victory 
over El Modena. By the time the starters stepped off the field after three 
quarters, the Panthers had a 40-3 lead. They played their best game of the year 
and they're tied for first place in the Century League with a 4-2, 1-0 record. 
El Modena is 2-4, 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful to the Lord for giving me the special ability that I have, some 
special coaches, special teams and special kids so that we can enjoy the 
success that we've had," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three hours before kickoff, Hill said a 200th victory would be important 
"because it's our first league game and it's a win our kids need; outside that, 
it's just another ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is 200-90-3 as a coach in Orange County for Santa Ana Valley, 
Santa Ana and Orange, the victory was Hill's 212th as a varsity coach -- he 
went 12-1 at Downey his first season, 1956. He has been a winner at every 
level, including Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago) in 1957-58 (15-3-3), 
as an assistant varsity coach at Foothill in 1992 (8-5) and as a junior varsity 
coach at Savanna last year (10-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Hill told us last week there would be a lot of talk about his 200th 
victory and that it will be a good thing when it happens," said quarterback 
Andy Lauridsen, "but that (the 200th victory) wasn't our main concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater concern after last week's 20-15 loss to Anaheim was executing 
properly, and the Panthers fulfilled that task. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauridsen completed seven of nine passes for 137 yards and two touchdowns, and 
rushed eight times for 90 yards. Dick Hill in the County

 The Huntington Beach girls' volleyball team tried to ride the right arm of 
Melissa Wendt to victory Thursday, but the Oilers, ranked second in Orange 
County, ran out of gas and lost to third-ranked Edison in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison posted a 15-11, 16-14, 3-15, 13-15, 15-11 victory in a Sunset League 
match at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (10-0, 4-0 in league) used a balanced attack led by Shelby 
Clemens (15 kills), Kari Hogancamp (13), and Erin McCown (13) to offset a big 
night from Wendt, who had 33 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendt, a 6-foot-2 junior outside hitter, had 11 kills in Game 4, helping the 
Oilers score the final four points of the game to force a fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time Melissa goes up she scares the heck out of me," Edison Coach Dave 
Mohs said. "Jill Meyers also played well for them and when you get those two 
going . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (7-2, 3-1) looked as if it was heading for an early exit 
after the Chargers won the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chargers lapsed in Game 3, losing, 15-3, before their defense returned 
and made Huntington Beach struggle for its 15-13 victory in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ball control was the difference," Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said. 
"Their passing and defense was better tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 McCown and Hogancamp each had 23 digs and setter Jill Butts had 50 assists and 
10 kills. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

STOCKS SOAR ON DROP IN PRICES, THEN RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks and bonds rallied sharply Thursday on a surprise drop in September 
wholesale prices, but retreated later in the day as caution set in ahead of 
economic reports due out today. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting up 52 points within 15 minutes of the opening bell, the Dow 
Jones industrial average finished the day 14.80 points higher at 3,889.95. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether long-bond dropped 
to 7.85% from Wednesday's 7.90%. Its price, which moves in the opposite 
direction, was up nearly a point in early trading, but fell back later in the 
day to close up 19/32 point, or $5.94 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the early gains was a government report that producer prices 
fell a surprising 0.5% in September, the lowest reading in more than a year. 
Economists had expected a 0.1% increase from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate increases in wholesale prices indicated that inflation is under 
control, causing investors to hope that the Federal Reserve Board will not have 
to increase short-term interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
 James Solloway, research director at Argus Research Corp., called the data a 
"very pleasant surprise after all the fear in the buildup to the release that 
this number had created." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 3 to 2 on the 
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 337.91 million shares, up from 
270.34 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's composite index rose 1.08 to 257.43. The Standard & Poor's 
500-stock index rose 2.30 to 467.77. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly 
smaller issues rose 0.89 to 767.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market 
value index rose 0.07 to 458.57. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors' enthusiasm gradually faded as the focus turned to a raft of 
numbers due out today, including September consumer-price data, manufacturing 
production, and retail sales numbers. The Dow Jones industrial average spent 
all day posting solid two-digit gains, but lost ground late in the session as 
investors sold into Friday's numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Wachtel, a Prudential Securities market analyst, said the consumer-price 
report should confirm Friday's wholesale price data and suggest that price 
inflation is not rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachtel said the capacity utilization data will be more important because they 
will give a forward reading on inflation. Analysts are concerned that if 
manufacturing plants are shown to be operating at 85% of capacity or higher, 
that could suggest that inflation may heat up in the future and prompt the Fed 
to tighten policy soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Capacity utilization hit 84.7% in August. Economists expect the September 
reading to be between 84.7% and 84.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed's not watching the current situation, but it's trying to anticipate 
inflation in the future," Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings reports continued to provide a lift to many issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hasbro Inc. gained 1 1/4 to 30 1/4 on the American Stock Exchange. Its 
third-quarter earnings beat Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Altera Corp. surged 5 5/8 to 33 5/8 on the Nasdaq market after it posted 
solid third-quarter earnings and strong sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS Inc. sank 20 to 309 1/2. Prudential and PaineWebber downgraded the stock 
amid concern over CBS's television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software maker Intuit Inc. leaped 3 1/4 to 50 1/4. It said it was in talks 
with Microsoft Corp. about a possible business combination. Microsoft rose 1 to 
57 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three-Five Systems plunged 11 3/8 to 38 1/2 after saying that price pressure 
on some products will bring further reductions in its gross margins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks dipped after Thursday's September wholesale prices report pegged 
a decline in passenger car prices. Ford Motor fell 1/8 to 28 7/8; Chrysler, 1/2 
to 46 1/4, and General Motors, 1/8 to 47 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets rose, with London's Financial Times 100-share average 
jumping 41.4 points to 3,141.9 and Frankfurt's Dax-30 share average closing up 
5.06 point at 2,082.63. In Tokyo's Nikkei-225 average finished 59.11 points 
higher at 20,148.83. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended 18.79 points higher at 2,759.61. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency markets, meanwhile, the dollar finished lower against most 
major currencies, faltering after a rally inspired by the favorable inflation 
data. The dollar closed in New York at 99.46 Japanese yen and 1.529 marks, down 
from 99.77 yen and 1.5410 marks, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold prices lost ground at home and abroad. On the Comex, gold for 
current delivery slid $1.90 an ounce to $386.10.

VISA, AMERICAN EXPRESS REHASH THEIR BATTLE; MARKETING: NEW OPTIMA CARD PROMPTS 
MORE SWIPES IN FULL-PAGE NEWSPAPER ADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Express' introduction of a new credit card has prompted another 
flare-up in its bitter brawl with Visa, with each company again taking 
full-page swipes at the other in major newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express ran advertisements Thursday, responding to two 
sardonic-sounding Visa ads that have been seen in 11 major cities since 
American Express' new Optima True Grace credit card was introduced in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads renew the longstanding fight over the number of merchants that take 
the cards and they also battle over interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Visa ads says -- in big, bold-faced letters -- that, "American 
Express is offering you a new credit card, but you don't have to accept it. . . 
. Heck, 7 million merchants don't." 
</P>
<P>
 A second features a globe with dots on it and says, "The places that accept 
the new American Express Optima True Grace Card dot the world." Then, beneath a 
second globe with many more dots on it, the ad says, "We just have 7 million 
more dots than they do." 
</P>
<P>
 One of American Express' new ads takes a positive tone, hawking the merits of 
its new card, but the other lashes out at Visa, asking: "Why is Visa 
incorrectly claiming 7 million more merchants than American Express? (We 
challenge them to name them.) Answer: So you won't notice the $1.5 BILLION 
unnecessary interest they charge you." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ryder, an American Express official, acknowledged there is a gap in 
merchants that take the company's cards, but he said it is "substantially less 
than 7 million," and he contended Visa's figures are inaccurate and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe that Visa knows how many merchants they have," Ryder said, 
adding that Visa's use of statistics from banks and other organizations that 
issue its cards are "notoriously unreliable." 
</P>
<P>
 David Brancoli, a spokesman for Visa International, said his company stands by 
its numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be happy to list those merchants if American Express would pay for the 
ad space," he said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: VENTURA; FATHER FIGHTS OFF CARJACKING ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura man on a family outing to the beach thwarted a carjacking after 
disarming and fighting the knife-wielding man who threatened to kidnap his 
baby, Ventura police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got real desperate because he had my little girl," Juvenal Herrera, 
32, said of the struggle at 6:15 p.m. Wednesday in the parking lot by the 
Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera was leaning into his car to lift his 10-month-old daughter, Cristina, 
from the rear infant seat when a man in his late 20s approached, Ventura Police 
Sgt. Bob Anderson said. Herrera's wife was walking on the beach and his two 
older children were riding their bicycles nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, described as a small Latino with black clothes, dark sunglasses 
and a Yankees cap, held a five-inch knife and demanded Herrera's keys and 
wallet, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera complied. As the man slid behind the wheel, Herrera pleaded that he be 
allowed to get his baby, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man said no. "She's going with me. You can pick her up in Oxnard," Herrera 
told police the man told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera struck the man with his fist, pulled his daughter out of the car and 
put her on the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant grabbed Herrera and, using the butt of the knife, struck him 
three times on the forehead. Herrera was finally able to wrench the knife free 
and fling it to the sidewalk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera said they fought in the parking lot before the man -- described as 
about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 120 pounds -- fled, leaving behind his knife, 
cap and backpack, along with Herrera's keys and wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 During the struggle, three joggers the same man had tried to rob moments 
earlier picked up the baby and returned her to Herrera's wife, Maggie, who was 
rushing across the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera suffered minor injuries in the fight. Anderson said the baby was 
unharmed. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PLAN TO LURE NEW BUSINESSES UNVEILED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to increase tax revenues and improve the city's overall economic 
outlook, Camarillo officials have unveiled a marketing campaign designed to 
lure new businesses to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The $15,000 campaign involves a new "fast-track" streamlining of the city's 
permit processes and a toll-free hot line to assist business owners considering 
relocation to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign unveiled Tuesday also included an economic report that charted 
the city's progress over an 18-month period that ended in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The report showed that industrial and office occupancy rates in the city 
improved during that time, with office vacancies dropping from 24.4% to 17.4% 
and industrial vacancies dropping from 17.5% to 9.7% 
</P>
<P>
 The report, however, also indicated that in that time, retail vacancy rates 
increased slightly by nearly half a percent to 9.4%. Officials said they will 
concentrate on improving the retail occupancy area of the city's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Stan Daily said the campaign, organized with the cooperation 
of the Camarillo Chamber of Commerce, will position the city to reap the 
benefits of new businesses as they expand into larger facilities and move from 
the urban centers of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specifically, we are launching a search for new or expanding start-up 
companies that are environmentally sensitive, long-term employers," Daily said. 
"This effort will create jobs as well as revenue for the city -- revenue 
essential to maintaining the qualities that make our city attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to head the city's campaign, along with Daily and Councilman Dave 
Smith, is longtime Camarillo resident James Jevens, hired as the city's 
economic development consultant last summer. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: OXNARD; $2.2 MILLION IN FUNDS SOUGHT FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council has voted 3 to 1 to seek $2.2 million in federal funds 
for a new public housing program that keeps homeless parents from losing 
custody of their children by giving the family a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have invited the Oxnard Housing Authority to apply for the 
Section 8 Family Unification Program, which would provide funding for 50 rental 
units for separated families. 
</P>
<P>
 The $77.5-million program, administered by the U. S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, provides Section 8 rental vouchers to parents whose children 
are at risk of being put in foster homes or are already in out-of-home care due 
to the family's inadequate living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Families must meet regular Section 8 requirements for income to be eligible. 
Ventura and Camarillo already receive HUD family unification funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Public Social Services Child Welfare Agency would refer 
homeless families to the program. The agency prepared a report in 1992 
detailing the need for a unification program. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Plisky voted against seeking the funds Tuesday, and Councilman 
Bedford Pinkard abstained. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: VENTURA; WOMAN TO FACE TRIAL IN FIANCE'S STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura woman accused of stabbing her ex-fiance 22 times as he was moving 
her out of his house was ordered Thursday to stand trial on an attempted murder 
charge. But the judge dismissed an allegation that the attack was premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette Smith, 32, is scheduled to appear in Ventura County Superior Court 
on Nov. 10 to set a trial date. She remains in custody on $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing that lasted more than a day, Ventura veterinarian 
Jeffrey K. Saur testified that he and Smith were driving when she suddenly 
kissed him, blocking his view of the road. He then got out of the car, and 
Smith began stabbing him, Saur said. 
</P>
<P>
 After stabbing Saur once, Smith cut herself and then launched an attack on the 
41-year-old veterinarian, stabbing him 21 more times before she was stopped by 
an amateur wrestler who happened by, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Donna Forry asked Municipal Judge Vincent J. O'Neill to 
reduce the attempted murder charge to assault with a deadly weapon. Saying that 
Smith was suicidal at the time of the attack, Forry argued that her client 
wanted to win back Saur, not kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a premeditated attack, but a reaction to this loss she was 
experiencing, the loss of her dreams," Forry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said it is possible that Smith used her suicide 
threats as a way to manipulate those around her. There is no evidence, other 
than the defendant's statements, that Smith was suicidal, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only person that she tried to kill was Dr. Saur," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the attempted murder charge, O'Neill held Smith to answer to 
allegations that she inflicted great bodily injury on Saur, used a knife in the 
attack and battered the wrestler who stopped the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping the premeditation allegation reduces the potential sentence to 14 1/2 
years from 25 years to life, Fox said. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: OXNARD; SCHOOLS, CITY WILL SPLIT COST OF LAND

<P>
 Oxnard city and elementary school officials have agreed to split the purchase 
price of 14 acres for a school and a playground that will double as a city 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the land, in northeast Oxnard near Rose Avenue, will be used as a 
playground during school hours, then as a park when school is not in session 
and on weekends.The remainder will be the site of an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the purchase Tuesday; the Oxnard School District 
voted for the plan last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, you would have a school site and a park," Councilman Tom Holden 
said. "Basically, we're combining the two to save money." 
</P>
<P>
 The recreational area will contain swings, baseball and basketball facilities, 
restrooms, a tot lot and grass fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will fund design and construction of the recreational areas, and the 
school district will maintain them. Negotiations on the purchase price are 
still under way. Maintenance costs are expected to reach $20,000 for the school 
and playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had that kind of agreement where we buy land together," said 
Sandra Herrera, assistant superintendent of business and fiscal services for 
the district. "It means that less land is taken up by public use." MIGUEL 
BUSTILLO

 Twenty-foot-tall Mexican fan palm trees, a fountain and fancy new light 
fixtures will grace a new plaza at the end of California Street in Ventura, 
according to a plan that city leaders approved this week. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, acting in their capacity as the city's Redevelopment 
Agency, voted 6 to 0 Monday night to spend $545,000 on the project.They also 
told administrators to go ahead with plans to spend an additional $87,000 on a 
fountain for the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20,000-square-foot site is bordered by the Holiday Inn, Harbor Boulevard, 
a city parking garage and an existing beachfront promenade. 
</P>

 The Redevelopment Agency awarded the contract for the work to CNM Paving of 
Camarillo, the lowest of nine bidders.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: VENTURA; SCHOOLS TO SURVEY ATTITUDES ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura schoolchildren will soon be asked to reveal to school officials the 
sort of information students generally tell only to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But their answers will be anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 To gauge the effectiveness of the Ventura Unified School District's drug- and 
alcohol-education program, school officials will survey students about their 
experiences with substances ranging from cigarettes to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 And because some schools also run support groups for children with personal 
problems, the surveys will attempt to evaluate students' sense of self-worth by 
asking how they feel about themselves and their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know, 'Is our prevention program working?' " said Sandra Holmgren, 
the district's health program specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials will not see the completed surveys, Holmgren said. "They go 
directly into sealed envelopes in the classroom and are sent to the lab," which 
will evaluate the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will give the 10-page questionnaires to students at both high 
schools, the local continuation school, three of the district's four middle 
schools and 10 of the 17 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At the elementary schools, only fourth- and fifth-graders will receive the 
surveys, which take about 35 minutes to complete, Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionnaires for elementary schoolchildren differ from those for middle 
and high school students, asking less-detailed questions about prior drug use 
or attitudes toward drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 All students have the option not to take the survey, Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by Southwest Regional Laboratories in Los Alamitos, the 
questionnaires will be given to students again this spring and twice in each of 
the next two years. MAIA DAVIS

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A MORALISTIC TALE OF AVARICE, REDEMPTION; IN SEARCH OF 
SATISFACTION BY J. CALIFORNIA COOPER ; DOUBLEDAY $21.95, 351 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J. California Cooper's second novel is a mostly absorbing work, off-putting 
only when the author's trademark folksiness gets a bit cloying. What rescues it 
is Cooper's facile storytelling, as straight-ahead as a freight train but 
marvelously textured and layered with voices that weave in and out of each 
other but never collide.  
</P>
<P>
 Characters are shaken up plenty on this bump-ridden ride, but only truly touch 
at the journey's end when the many cars chug to a grand, overarching stop. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a tale about tracks, about the perils of navigating the wrong and 
right sides of them in the search for truth. Set in the deep South, it features 
two half-sisters, Ruth and Yinyang, who share one father and two bloodlines -- 
black and white -- but don't know of each other's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The story traces their disparate but parallel lives, the hardships of black 
Ruth and the luxurious but hedonistic times of fair-skinned, pointedly named 
Yinyang. The miscegenation forces itself to light with melodramatic results. 
</P>
<P>
 Josephus Josephus, the father and freed slave who is the source of the story's 
tangled roots, has buried a fortune beneath a chicken house, which he expects 
to be dug up by future generations. Who gets the gold -- and what they do with 
it -- is another engine that drives this zestfully earnest story, built as it 
is on such biblical themes as avarice and redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the weightiness, this is at heart a game. Whenever Cooper gets heavy 
(as she frequently does when she makes Christian pronouncements on her morally 
confused cast of characters), Satan pops up like a whimsical Greek chorus, a 
Southern-style Puck who lingers at the edges of the tale, biding time, waiting 
for opportunities to create mischief.  
</P>
<P>
 Observing troubled Richard Bafoe after he's just confessed an awful secret to 
his mother, Satan thinks to himself, "I give those people everything! Why 
aren't they happy? Busy as always, he flew off to finish giving suggestions to 
the scientists he was helping to discover something in the earth that might 
finally destroy the earth. He went happily." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the strengths of "In Search of Satisfaction" -- clearly drawn characters 
and plenty of plot swings per chapter -- are also its weakness. The story is 
colorful but life is ultimately drawn in black-and-white. Good and evil are the 
main characters here, even though the most fascinating human is the white 
matriarch Carlene Bafoe; ironically, the most interesting character is the most 
pernicious.  
</P>
<P>
 But even as Carlene's actions catapult her toward certain doom, you get the 
feeling Cooper empathizes with Carlene more than she can say. Cooper examines 
her thoroughly, tracing in detail her life, how she wound up steeped in 
bitterness, a larger version of the old black widow spider that slumbers 
unnoticed in her bedroom, gorging on its own progeny. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost a shame that so deft a writer as Cooper so firmly takes the side 
of good, too often wet-blanketing things just as they're getting deliciously 
sinful. Yet she often does have fun with the morality-tale genre she's created. 
</P>
<P>
 She plays good and evil against a backdrop of racial and sexual taboos that 
guarantee sparks: Yinyang's attempt at "passeblanc" leads her down the path of 
destruction. Cooper relishes downfalls -- sexual undoings, self-deception, 
pretentiousness of all sorts. She clearly displays an affinity for the 
womanizing jazzmeister Bowlegs, the fatally weak Richard Bafoe, the lovely but 
self-aggrandizing Yinyang. 
</P>
<P>
 The ugly pall cast by perverted sex is disturbing. Incest and molestation are 
rampant; fathers sleep with daughters, uncles with nieces, and newborn babies 
are silently whisked away. 
</P>
<P>
 These are, I suppose, more cautionary notes from Cooper, but I balked at the 
implication that sex indiscriminately blows love all to bits, and that love is 
best practiced from afar. Such blatant admonishments remind you that you're 
essentially reading a fairy tale, albeit a sophisticated one. "In Search" 
zigzags like mad but finally stops on a dime. Unlike life, it ends like it's 
supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some proselytizing, Cooper keeps things fresh by constantly 
juxtaposing her once-upon-a-time perkiness with the frequent tawdriness of her 
tale. That combined with her fluid style makes for a titillating read, which, 
while it may not convert readers, mostly satisfies.

 DOGGIE HEAVEN? What happens when too many complain about your dog at city 
parks? Dog owners band together and form a park of their own. In Costa Mesa, 
they've raised $8,000 to open a "Bark Park" in a section of TeWinkle Park off 
Newport Boulevard. . . . Saturday's grand opening includes reduced-priced 
vaccinations, licensing and adoption information. Caution: You still have to 
clean up after your dog. Mutt mitts available.

<P>
 MUTUAL ART: Ballet Pacifica of Laguna Beach will present two premieres on its 
program tonight and Saturday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre in Irvine. One is a 
collaboration among choreographer Tina Gerstler, composer Brad Dutz and artist 
Megan Williams. She's painted tall panels bearing images of women as sets for 
"The Translated Gender," a modern dance about women's varied societal roles. . 
. . How do such joint efforts succeed? "You try to look for where your mutual 
strengths lie," says Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 PULP TONES: The new gangster movie "Pulp Fiction," which opens today on 21 
screens here (F1), has produced a wide array of critics' opinions how well its 
message comes across. But none of them knocks the music, which is vintage 1960s 
surf-rock. . . . Included are instrumentals "Miserlou" by Dick Dale, above, and 
his Del-Tones, and "Surf Rider" by the Lively Ones, both Orange County-based 
groups. . . . The music of "Miserlou" is even being used in the movie's 
television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAINAGE THEATER: How many times have you sat down in a dark theater to 
discover your feet sticking to the floor, where the person before you spilled a 
soda? That won't happen at the new Four Star Cinema that opens today at 12111 
Valley View St. in Garden Grove, says manager Lisa Cunningham. . . . The new 
four-screen theater -- renovated site of the old Valley View Twin -- has a 
floor drainage system. They hose it down between movies. Grand opening bonus on 
Saturday: a free showing of "Lassie" and "Black Beauty" and free popcorn.

 HORROR: Two of their sons were shot to death four years ago in a Van Nuys 
apartment. But that wasn't the end of the nightmare for Awwad and Mariam 
Samarneh. On Thursday, another son, Mawan Awwad Samarneh, was convicted of 
killing his brothers (B4). . . . A trial will begin next week to determine 
whether he was legally sane at the time of the murders.

 FIRST TIME: They've performed thousands of times, but never together. Until 
Sunday, that is. John Raitt and Ann Blyth will sing at the Academy Plaza 
Theatre in North Hollywood in "Show of the Month," the series for older 
audiences (Valley Life! Page 3.) . . . Says Blyth about the show's repertoire: 
"It's hummable, whistleable -- all those nice things that much of today's music 
isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 APPLAUSE: TV sitcoms leave you in stitches? Heck, that's nothing. For real 
laughs, go watch the actual taping of the shows at local studios. The 
ad-libbing is the best part . . . Many of the stars themselves, such as Will 
Smith (above) of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" spend time rapping with the 
audience before the taping begins. See Valley Life! Page 12.

 DYNASTY: The McKeon family is big in Santa Clarita, and not just in politics 
and Western wear. Their other battleground is the football field, where the 
newest member in the spotlight is Hart High quarterback Steve McKeon, nephew of 
U.S. Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon (C8). . . . He has a chance to make history. 
None of his brothers beat Canyon, which he faces tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 BURNS ON FIRE: Former CSUN star golfer Bob Burns was on fire Thursday at the 
Texas Open. He shot a 65, and is just three shots off the first-round lead 
(C2). . . . Burns is having a strong rookie season. He's made $142,293 to place 
119th on the earnings list. If he finishes in the top 125, he'll qualify for 
next year's tour. Michael Arkush

 UP AND DOWN: Ventura County mopped up after its first skirmish with malathion 
in the war against the Medfly (B1) . . . But the roller-coaster ride may have 
just begun for the county's farmers. After a bleak year in 1992, crop sales hit 
$848 million last year. Throw in the Medfly, however, and the financial future 
looks murky for farmers . . . The success of eradication efforts and this 
winter's weather are factors. It may be 1996 before the impact is known, said 
farm bureau head Rex Laird. "We're not going to walk away from this unscathed," 
he said.

 HAITI TALK: Census figures for 1990 show there were only 18 people of Haitian 
descent living in Ventura County. But the tiny nation has moved to the world's 
center stage as it struggles for democracy . . . Events in Haiti will be 
tonight's topic when the local World Affairs Council hosts Guillermo Belt, 
special adviser to the secretary general of the Organization of American 
States. . . . A lawyer and former professor, Belt is "a heavy hitter" in 
Caribbean affairs, said council head Cindy Cooke.

 AMGEN MONEY: Seven months after Gov. Pete Wilson toured Amgen, the giant 
Thousand Oaks biotechnology firm has donated $25,000 toward the governor's 
reelection campaign, county finance statements show . . . Amgen officials were 
unavailable for comment, but the Wilson camp, eager to beef up the incumbent's 
pro-business image, welcomed the donation.

 SHOOT OUT: Simi Valley is looking to open its first indoor shooting range 
(B5), a move that could squelch future complaints from city residents who had 
worried that a proposed outdoor range would be too noisy . . . Rifle owners, 
however, often need wide-open space to fire their long-range weapons, said Bob 
Railey of Ventura's Coast Gun Shop. Indoor ranges have advantages such as 
lighting and, usually, longer operating hours. But for rifle practice, "you 
need the great outdoors," he said. Cash Crop

CALIFORNIA DATELINE / PATT MORRISON: SNAPSHOTS OF LIFE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. ; 
FOR BALANCE, HOW ABOUT A BE KIND TO WEASELS WEEK?

<P>
 As rough as these weeks have been for voters, weasels have had it even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 How would you like to have your good name, the name of a small mammalian 
carnivore, likened to politicians? 
</P>
<P>
 First there was that honky-tonk, 10-second commercial from the Kathleen Brown 
campaign comparing Gov. Pete Wilson to a weasel for not having consented to 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Then "A Bunch of Weasels," an art exhibit made up of a dozen stuffed and 
mounted weasels framing caricatures of the Santa Cruz County supervisors, was 
set up outside the county offices--and who could miss that connection? 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Mike Duffy was told to pack up the weasels, and a large black flag and 
painting of Christ. "It is a public building. It's not like an art museum where 
you have a choice of whether to go. People come here because they have to," 
said Supervisor Jan Beautz. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, in that Santa Cruz style we've all come to cherish, she added that 
she wasn't offended by the depiction, but "is it mean to the weasels?"

 A man for all . . . seats: Republican Richard L. Mountjoy is running for 
reelection to his Assembly seat in Arcadia . . . and for the state Senate in 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate seat was left vacant when Republican Frank Hill was convicted of 
federal corruption charges, and state law allows a candidate to run 
simultaneously in a regular election and a special election. He'll have to 
forfeit one if he wins both; no moonlighting between the chambers. 
</P>

 Another two-fer from the Riverside County Sheriff's Assn., which has endorsed 
both candidates for county supervisor: The leadership had endorsed Moreno 
Valley council member Cynthia Crothers, but then the rank-and-file agitated for 
former sheriff's Deputy Tom Mullen. In the least startling observation of the 
season, a Crothers spokesman told the Riverside Press-Enterprise, "Politics got 
involved."

 Yankee stay home: The free trade agreement with Mexico may not extend to the 
person of the former mayor of San Diego--now California's governor. Tijuana's 
city council declared Pete Wilson "persona non grata" for his support of 
Proposition 187 and a border crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 No guards will be posting Wilson's photo at the border. But the council 
declared that "Many Tijuananses have relatives in California and vice versa," 
and they reject Wilson's policies "against our fellow Mexicans, be they illegal 
or not."

 Pig heaven: Remember Orwell's "Animal Farm"--Some pigs are more equal than 
others?

 In Hesperia, a San Bernardino County city of 59,152 people and an unknown 
number of companion swine, female and neutered male potbellied pigs will 
henceforth have the same rights and privileges as pet dogs. But unfixed male 
potbellies must stay down on the farm--too aggressive for domesticity. So Many

 Don't laugh, this is science: The migratory habits of 29,000 pelagic 
toys--ducks, turtles, beavers and frogs, spilled 10 months ago from a 
freighter--are helping researchers trace winds and ocean currents in the big 
bathtub of the north Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The rubber-duckie report, just published in a scholarly journal by an 
oceanographer and a computer modeler, lets scientists compare how currents and 
winds move floating ocean debris. The two men also analyzed the movement 
patterns of 61,000 Nike shoes that fell off a ship in 1990 and floated toward 
the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 400 surviving toys have beached themselves in Alaska; the remainder 
are evidently destined for the Arctic ice pack, to be rotated around the pole 
and into the North Atlantic. The shoes--probably cross trainers--have headed 
the other way, past Hawaii, toward Japan.

 I'll take what's behind door No. 1: In a kind of supermarket-sweep justice, 
Vista Municipal Court Judge David Ryan has sentenced a woman convicted of using 
a stolen credit card to 60 days in jail and to let the victim take one item of 
her choice from the defendant's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyra Ann Veltri pleaded guilty after joining three companions in allegedly 
stealing Sarah Lang's purse, using credit cards to buy a vacuum cleaner, 
jewelry and shoes for her 3-year-old daughter. She surrendered after a 
companion was arrested, and returned the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Domenic Lombardo says the judge is trying to "balance the 
moral scale. . . . But there's no provision for balancing the moral scale in 
the Penal Code. There's no provision for an eye for an eye."

CAMARILLO MOPS UP IN WAKE OF AERIAL ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Equipped with rags, high-powered spray nozzles and painter's ladders, 
Camarillo residents lost little time Thursday in wiping away the sticky residue 
left by aerial malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers converged on schools within the spray zone at sunrise, joining 
custodians in scouring jungle gyms, picnic tables and water fountains with 
antibacterial soap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are children," said John Miller, a PTA member who pitched in with 
the cleanup at Dos Caminos School after working a night shift at Procter & 
Gamble in Oxnard. "They're going to put their fingers in their mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, city employees hosed down parks, homeowners pulled tarps off their 
cars and patios, and carwash employees did a brisk early morning business. 
</P>
<P>
 A few residents within the 16-square-mile spray zone voiced concern about 
possible long-term health effects of malathion. Others complained about the 
hassles of mopping up. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, however, declared the whole episode a hype, saying they found little 
evidence of the malathion-bait mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went running at 5 o'clock this morning and I didn't notice anything," said 
Gretchen Light, a Mission Oaks resident who was out for a midmorning walk with 
her 4-month-old daughter and two golden retrievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose I'm relieved that there weren't huge blobs of goo all over and that 
I'm not fighting to breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Pellerino, a cafeteria manager at tiny Somis School, said the spraying 
was a source of entertainment for her two children -- Sarah, 9, and Wesley, 7 
-- who watched the copters pass overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Light, Pellerino thought the spraying anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't bad at all," she said. "I expected to find everything all sticky 
and messy. But you could hardly tell." 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Nogales School on the western edge of the spray zone, parents and 
custodians donned thick gloves and carefully removed plastic bags that had been 
wrapped around each doorknob and over sandboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a parent of a child who goes here, I knew that I would feel better with 
the playground equipment cleaned off," said Caprice Kelton, who was washing 
down a steel jungle gym in preparation for students' arrival at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Nogales and other schools within the spray zone planned to keep students 
off the grass and some blacktop surfaces, even after a thorough watering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always good to take precautions. Ten years down the road, we might learn 
something we don't know today," said Sam Love, assistant principal of Las 
Colinas School in Mission Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make sure the kids are safe. That's the important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar cleanup operations took place at 10 parks within the spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In Adolfo Park, workers for the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District 
wiped down the tot lot with a mixture of water and chemical neutralizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way we could cover everything, so we're going to spray 
everything," said Dan O'Connell, a park district worker. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Leisure Village, retirees affixed spray nozzles to garden hoses to 
blast the yellow drops off their skylights and awnings. At a community meeting 
Monday, state officials had warned residents to clean the opaque sky boxes 
before the malathion mixture could bake in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the top step of his ladder in shorts and shirt sleeves, 
75-year-old Vic Sledge sprayed down his roof and patio cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell if this is old stuff or if there are yellow spots," Sledge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's my imagination, but I can still smell a little bit of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, Bea O'Brien had rinsed out her hummingbird feeder and was 
rehanging it in a pine tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many residents, O'Brien said the inconvenience of cleaning up was a small 
price to pay for saving the county's orchards and fields from the 
crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's something that had to be done, but I'm glad the first one's 
over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about damage to the paint on their vehicles, some residents headed 
straight for the nearest carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a deluge of customers, the Camarillo Car Wash on Adolfo Road 
opened 30 minutes early at 7:30 a.m., called in extra workers and lowered its 
rates by $3 to $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Frank Lopez said one construction company planned to bring in a fleet 
of 40 cars. Nearby St. John's Seminary, where most of the Medflies have been 
found, also planned a high-volume visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, however, employee Dave Wendell said the carwash had 
something less than a windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the longest line we had was four cars deep," he said. "We were 
expecting to be bombarded." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated assurances that the minute amount of malathion dispersed over 
each acre posed no health risks, some residents remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Odile Kulscar decided to pass on her usual morning jog. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulscar was washing her two cars, her sidewalk -- everything outside her house 
-- because her grandchildren were coming over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are not concerned, but I am," Kulscar said. "I don't even want to 
breathe out here." 
</P>
<P>
 But for other residents, the spraying was already a non-event. 
</P>
<P>
 At Arneill Ranch Park, Bill and Dorothy Guntner soaked up the sunshine as 
their 2-year-old granddaughter, Alisa, played on a jungle gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who live outside the spray zone, said they were not worried about 
lingering effects of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I really haven't given it a great deal of thought," 
Bill Guntner said. 
</P>

INITIAL MALATHION SPRAYING DAMPENS BUSINESS FOR MANY 
</P>

 Debbie Meeks figures that the war against the Medfly already has cost her 
about $40. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When El Tecolote Cafe closed early Wednesday so that customers and employees 
could get home before the start of an aerial assault on the fruit-ravaging 
pests, Meeks lost a few hours of wages plus tips. 
</P>
<P>
 For Meeks, head waitress at the landmark eatery on Lewis Road, Ventura 
County's fight against the fruit fly has hit her right in the pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just Round One. She's not happy about this happening every other 
week for the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to lose all kinds of money," she lamented Thursday. "I think it's 
horrible. It's awful." 
</P>
<P>
 At small businesses throughout the 16-square-mile spray zone, similar stories 
repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a squadron of malathion-dumping helicopters lifted off from Camarillo 
Airport about 9 p.m. Wednesday, some businesses normally open after that hour 
closed for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 And many of those that stayed open past 9 p.m. got few customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the blue-eyed insects were discovered in an orchard in eastern 
Camarillo, the spraying program was pitched as the best way to rescue the 
county's $848-million agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some smaller businesses -- such as carwashes and stores that sell car covers 
-- have profited from that decision. But, after Wednesday night, many others 
discovered that they stand to lose money during the six-month program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant in a strip mall near Las Posas and Lewis 
roads, employee Rosa Rosales said late Wednesday that only five customers came 
in after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a holiday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even dollar night at Harley's Camarillo Bowl could bring people out of 
their homes during the aerial assault. 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when the promise of $1 a game usually packs the place with bowlers, 
only about 10 people hit the lanes Wednesday night. And half of those were 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we're going to have to close early," said Assistant Manager Claudia 
Andrade, who looked on in frustration Wednesday night as most of the 20 lanes 
stood empty. "We're running a special already. We can't go any lower than $1 a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 After figuring lost sales of food and beer, Manager Roger Jewell estimated 
that the bowling alley lost between $600 and $800 in business Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They picked the wrong night for us, that's for sure," Jewell said Thursday. 
"I don't think they considered all of the factors as far as small businesses 
are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Nordahl, executive director of the Camarillo Chamber of Commerce, said 
Thursday that the chamber had received only one call from a merchant concerned 
about lost business because of the aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordahl said in the two weeks before the next scheduled spraying, chamber 
officials will discuss such concerns with state officials, who are directing 
the eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult situation," Nordahl said. "There is no real easy 
solution for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants in the spray zone said business did not drop off at all 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were staying out looking for the helicopters," said Leng Tang 
at Four Season's Donuts, a 24-hour operation. "I think it's probably exciting 
for some people." 
</P>
<P>
 And at O'Connor's Sports Bar & Grill, on the western edge of the spray zone, 
Manager Donna Hegg said business was a little better than usual Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people, if they were in the spray zone, didn't want to get stuck at 
home," she said Thursday. "It was a lot busier than I thought it was going to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, customers or no customers, some businesses decided to shut down 
altogether before spraying started. Carolyn Rossetti, general manager of a 
couple of Subway Sandwich shops in the spray zone, closed both before 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that it would be really slow," Rossetti said Thursday. "Also, I didn't 
want the employees driving around in that stuff. I wanted them to get home 
before they started spraying." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she probably will close the stores each time the spraying takes 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably be losing about 20 customers (a night), but it's worth it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Tecolote, owner Dave Jones says he figures that he lost hundreds of 
dollars by closing an hour early Wednesday. At 8 p.m., he turned away a party 
of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he, too, will continue to close early as long as the 
pesticide-dropping helicopters continue to take to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six months of this is going to hurt my business," Jones said. "But I want all 
my customers and all my employees to be under cover prior to the start of 
spraying."

STATE PANEL TELLS VENTURA, FAIR BOARD TO MOVE COASTAL BIKE PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura and the Ventura County Fair Board must move a portion of 
beachside bicycle path away from the encroaching ocean within 30 days, the 
California Coastal Commission ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also gave city and fair officials two years to remove five to 
six tons of rock that they had placed along the coastline beneath the bicycle 
path in 1992, when the ocean ripped away a portion of the path during a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had asked for permission to maintain the rock sea-barrier for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But commission staff said Ventura agreed 10 years ago that it would not build 
coastal bicycle paths or hiking trails that require the construction of 
protective barriers. Meeting in Los Angeles, commission members voted 8 to 1 to 
hold the city to that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the commission, coastal program analyst Rebecca Richardson said 
the 15-foot-wide rock pile takes up space on the beach and may contribute to 
the erosion of sand from the rest of the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Steve Bennett said city, fair and state representatives 
will meet in November to try to plot a new course for the 220-foot-long section 
of bicycle path that the commission ordered relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling did not specify how far inland the path must be moved, saying only 
that it should be "a sufficient distance from the top of the (rock pile) to 
ensure public safety." The decision also did not affect a second portion of the 
path about a quarter of a mile to the east where the ocean has taken a bite out 
of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, a detour near the rock pile sends cyclists and pedestrians into an 
empty parking lot on the landward side of the path. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett said a web of jurisdictions complicates the issue. "The state runs 
the bike path, the fair owns all the land and people who are concerned about it 
call the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the state Department of Parks and Recreation, which oversees 
the path, said he favored moving inland not just the small portion required by 
the Coastal Commission, but the entire mile-long stretch between the Ventura 
River and the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move would require a cooperative planning effort between the state, 
city and fair, which owns the oceanfront land along the path, said Steven B. 
Treanor, superintendent of the Channel Coast District of the state Parks 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking areas and access roads owned by the fair are now inland from the path. 
Bennett said the fair has been reluctant to sacrifice parking spaces. Fair 
officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Treanor said the most likely new location for a path would be along the road 
to the parking lots -- giving walkers and cyclists a view of cars rather than 
of sand and surf. 
</P>
<P>
 The most powerful force in the matter, Treanor said, is not the state, city, 
fair or even the California Coastal Commission, but rather the mighty Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the area is going to go," Treanor said, predicting that much of 
the 5-year-old path adjacent the fairgrounds would eventually be washed away to 
sea.

MEDFLY SPRAYING DECLARED A SUCCESS; AGRICULTURE: HELICOPTERS SPRINKLE AREA WITH 
MALATHION AND CORN SYRUP MIXTURE. FIVE RESIDENTS FILE ILLNESS REPORTS.

<P>
 The first of 12 aerial malathion applications to combat Ventura County's first 
Medfly infestation was declared a success Thursday by the state and federal 
agriculture officials who engineered the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly hot line, which took 1,266 calls during the day before it closed at 
1 a.m. Thursday with the end of spraying, and another 400 calls from 7 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Thursday, reported that five residents had filed illness reports. 
</P>
<P>
 They complained of watery eyes, pulmonary pain, headache, skin rash, thick 
tongue, swollen glands or irritated nasal passages, a hot line spokesman said. 
No one went to the emergency room at Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other residents called the hot line to complain that their homes had 
been sprayed, even though they were outside the 16-square-mile eradication 
zone, which covered the homes of 32,400 residents in eastern Camarillo and 
Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors were sent to all three locations to test residues to determine 
whether the areas had been sprayed. No results were available Thursday, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying began on schedule just after 9 p.m. Wednesday, with three 
helicopters sprinkling the area with a combination of malathion and corn syrup 
used as bait to attract the flies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although helicopter pilots were concerned about night flying over hilly 
terrain, there were no problems, said Patrick Minyard, who is coordinating the 
aerial spraying program for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Minyard said lights were placed on top of the hills south of Las Posas Valley 
to identify them. When spraying resumes Oct. 27, there will be a beacon on top 
of the hills just north of the Conejo Grade as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "But these pilots are pros," he said of the staff of San Joaquin Helicopters, 
the Delano outfit hired by the state for the aerial applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities said there may be as few as 10 applications, Minyard said 
12 are more likely, with the last outing during the first part of April. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there were a very warm winter, that would shorten the life cycles of the 
fly," he said. Barring that, "we will go through 12 sprays." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no plans to use sterile Mediterranean fruit flies in Ventura County 
to mate with fertile females to stop reproduction, Minyard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to use aerial treatment was made at the highest level of 
government," he said, adding that it is the fastest and most efficient method 
to rid the area of the crop-destroying pest. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety over spraying may decrease now that residents have been through it 
once, said Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, when the second spraying comes, there won't be as much Angst ," 
Laird said. "And then with the third and fourth, it will be as commonplace as 
something like this can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said they never were anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the dangers are overrated," said Milton Nadel, an 80-year-old Leisure 
Village resident who went out during the spraying for an ice cream bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident who lives in the eradication zone called the Medfly hot line 
to complain that "he had covered up his property and then didn't get sprayed," 
said the hot line's manager, who asked not to be identified. "He wanted to know 
what was the point." 
</P>
<P>
 The first application came nearly two weeks after two egg-carrying Medflies 
were found in an orchard on the grounds of St. John's Seminary in eastern 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, 63 flies have been found. The finds prompted the state and federal 
governments to impose an 86-square-mile quarantine and begin the aerial 
spraying program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spraying may help convince a delegation of Japanese officials touring 
the county that the state's program will prevent exports of Ventura County 
fruit to Japan from contaminating Japan's agriculture industry, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation will visit area packinghouses and the quarantine zone in the 
county for another two days, Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese have already said they will accept no fruit from the quarantine 
zone. But county agriculture officials fear that the Japanese, who import 
one-third of the county's $216-million lemon crop each year, will cut off trade 
relations with the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their opinions are critical as far as our exports are concerned," Laird said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; VICTIM'S FAMILY SUES CITY OVER CAR 
CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a Simi Valley woman who fell into a coma after a speeding police 
cruiser crashed into her car has filed a $27-million claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim alleges that Officer Rick Reinhart acted "negligently and 
carelessly" in April when his police car hit Margaret Sphar, 45, as she drove 
out of the Metrolink parking lot onto Los Angeles Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Sphar, who was thrown from her compact car, suffered major head injuries and 
remains in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim also names the Simi Valley Police Department, Metrolink, Ventura 
County, the Simi Valley Transit Authority, the Metropolitan Transit Authority 
and Reinhart. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the crash, Reinhart was driving between 67 and 83 m.p.h. without 
turning on his flashing lights or siren, a study by the California Highway 
Patrol showed. The speed limit on Los Angeles Avenue is 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim charges that the city is responsible for hazardous road conditions 
that led to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 After the crash, the City Council agreed to install a traffic signal at the 
driveway to the Metrolink station within two years. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; PLANNERS OK LAW TO PROTECT RIDGELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new law to protect Moorpark hillsides and ridgelines has been approved by 
the Planning Commission and sent to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance, unanimously passed by planners this week, would allow 
development on slopes with up to 20% grades; a perfectly vertical cliff has a 
gradient of 100%.But the city would severely limit the number of homes on 
slopes of between 20% and 50%, Commissioner Ted Martens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most important thing about this ordinance is that people 
understand it is not meant to be a growth-control ordinance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martens said the new law is meant to protect steep slopes from erosion and to 
maintain the view of the ridgelines that dominate the horizon on the north side 
of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers with projects before the city said they liked the long-awaited 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approach taken by the city on this has been pretty logical," said Gary 
Austin, vice president of Messenger Investment Corp., which plans 3,221 homes 
on the city's northeast edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is more lenient than similar measures in Simi Valley and 
Thousand Oaks, commission Chairman Michael Wesner said. "In some respects, it 
is more lenient and in others it is not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesner said the new ordinance is stricter in the setback rules for homes near 
ravines and barrancas, but more lenient about the steepness of the slopes on 
which homes may be built. 
</P>
<P>
 He said rules to protect the city's ridgelines have been discussed since 1987. 
But the City Council did not direct planners to draw up an ordinance until last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for City Council consideration. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DEPUTIES TO GET 2 MOUNTAIN BIKES 
</P>

<P>
 Pooling their money for their own protection, 17 Thousand Oaks merchants have 
donated two heavy-duty mountain bikes to the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department for bicycle patrols on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitted with high-powered lights and tough shock absorbers, the two $750 
Raleigh Police Specials will allow deputies to cruise stealthily down the 
boulevard's business strip, where crime has increased recently, according to 
one of the donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty beefy bikes, and they'll take a lot of abuse," said Dennis 
Carlson, owner of Carlson Building Materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson and others donated $100 apiece to pay for the bikes, which will be 
delivered to the Sheriff's Department on Nov. 15 from Mark's Conejo Cyclery, 
Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money will go toward repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real pleased at the support of the business community along Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard," said Lt. Mike Brown, who is working on a community policing 
plan for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Two specially trained deputies will be sent out on bike patrols as needed, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't have enough officers to assign them full time to a bicycle 
patrol. We'd have to take them out of patrol cars, and we're spread pretty 
thin. We'll use the best mode of transportation we think is necessary for a 
given duty." 
</P>
<P>
 The department's two bike-trained deputies have been patrolling periodically 
on reconditioned bikes that were unclaimed stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 But those bikes tend to break down more often than the new bikes are expected 
to, Brown said. MACK REED

 We thought this was why the Green Giant was so jolly: Since we've been on the 
subject this week, we should point out that the October issue of Harper's 
Magazine mentions another urban folk tale -- that green M & Ms are 
aphrodisiacs. Ain't so, the article adds. 
</P>
<P>
 But so persistent is this myth that in Santa Monica, entrepreneur Wendy Jaffe 
packaged green candies into a product called The Green Ones a few years ago. 
They were passed out on St. Patrick's Day along with green condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mars Candy, the maker of M & Ms, went to court and forced her company to 
change the name to The Greenies.  
</P>
<P>
 This warning was put on the The Greenies' wrappers: "Not recommended for 
prisoners, priests or frat guys." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More urban legends: Harper's lists some other oft-told tales, which were 
culled from the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file, an Internet group 
maintained by Terry Chan, an economist in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 A few examples (and the results of Chan's research): 
</P>
<P>
 * "If mold grows on a Twinkie, the Twinkie digests it. (False)" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Welding while wearing contacts can cause them to stick to your eyeballs. 
(False)" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Microwaving panties kills yeast infections. (Believed false but not 
conclusively proven)." 
</P>
<P>
 * "A congressional page or an elevator operator asked U.S. Rep. Fred ('Love 
Boat') Grandy (R-Iowa): 'Lido Deck, sir?' or 'Promenade Deck, sir?' and was 
subsequently fired. (False)" 
</P>
<P>
 We knew Congressman Gopher would never do that.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 600-MILE TRIP IN WHEELCHAIR RAISES 
MONEY

 Ken Cummings' method of getting to San Francisco drew curious looks from 
motorists on Ventura County's streets Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated in a 200-pound, emerald-green motorized wheelchair, the 38-year-old San 
Diego man, who is a quadriplegic, is on a 600-mile fund-raising trip for the 
American Paralysis Assn., collecting nickel pledges for every mile he logs in 
the chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings hopes to raise $30,000 to fund research on spinal cord injuries. The 
group's goal is to make spinal cord injury victims such as Cummings able to 
walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 He left San Diego on Sunday and expects to reach San Francisco by Oct. 21. He 
is accompanied by a four-member crew, including a trained medic who rides 
beside him on a mountain bike, and three riding in a van equipped for rest 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings people closer together," he said during a break Thursday in a 
Thousand Oaks parking lot off Hillcrest Drive. "And I have fun doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 He became paralyzed after breaking his neck in a 1982 diving accident, one of 
the more common causes of spinal cord injuries. Of the 500,000 people paralyzed 
in the United States, 82% are men, according to the association. Nearly half 
the injuries stem from car accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 6 feet 5 and I weighed 235 pounds then," Cummings said. "I hadn't been on 
a diving board in a long time. I went through the water pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
 He hit the bottom eight and a half feet below, breaking first his arm and then 
his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard at first, when I was beginning to adjust to my disability," he 
said. "But I've always been pretty active." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, with Cummings leading the way, is trying to stick to bicycle trails 
and side streets. But for brief stretches, they will be on busy streets, 
including business routes along the Ventura Freeway. At the Conejo Grade, he 
got into the van; the wheelchair does not have adequate brakes to handle the 
steep downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Cummings raised $20,000 in a similar trip from San Francisco to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He said people have treated them well along the way, waving, honking and 
donating an additional $800 at gas stations and rest stops. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem has been the changing temperature, Cummings said. His 
injury makes him particularly sensitive to heat and cold. He had to put on a 
thick pair of sheepskin boots for the stretch from Thousand Oaks to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Awaiting him in San Francisco is a police escort into the city and a 
seven-course Italian meal in North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a neat way to see the state, " he said, squinting out into the sunlight. 
"I might just do it again next year." MARY F. POLS

Education, a conservative watchdog group they claim is biased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their intention is to advocate their views and not educate the public," 
Hushka said Thursday of the group."They don't lend themselves to be a neutral 
body that could conduct a public gathering." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurachi, board president and the only incumbent in the race, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group's chairwoman, Coleen Ary, said Kurachi sent a letter indicating 
that she would not participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all in their own minds," Ary said. "If they are going to be elected 
by a broad constituency, they have to recognize a broad constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Glenn Woodbury, Janice DiFatta, Norman Walker and Jacquie 
Richardson are expected to take part in the forum, Ary said. The three-hour 
discussion will be held at 7 p.m. Thursday in the City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will also be televised on Comcast on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am surprised that they pulled out," DiFatta said. "Just because you 
participate in their forum doesn't mean you want their endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens for Truth in Education was created in December to fight the teaching 
of birth control in Simi Valley schools. The group has since opposed the CLAS 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the organization has only about 25 active members, Ary said its 
monthly newsletter reaches about 840 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's event will be the group's first candidate forum. The moderator will 
not be affiliated with the organization. TRACY WILSON

TEEN-AGER NOT GUILTY OF MURDER; COURTS: JUDGE CONVICTS 17-YEAR-OLD OF LESSER 
CHARGE OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER IN ACCIDENTAL SHOOTING OF HIS GIRLFRIEND, 
16. 
</P>

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks teen-ager who fatally shot his girlfriend while playing with a 
loaded gun is guilty of involuntary manslaughter rather than murder because he 
did not expect the weapon to fire when he pulled the trigger, a judge ruled 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he called the behavior of the 17-year-old defendant "unthinking and 
callous," Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. said the youth's actions 
did not meet the legal definition of murder, which requires that a person know 
that the conduct is dangerous to human life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that he had any concept, at the time that he did it, that 
there was any reasonable possibility the gun would go off," Campbell said after 
the five-day Juvenile Court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge based his decision on the fact that the defendant had been pointing 
the 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun at teen-agers all afternoon July 13, but 
it never fired until he pointed it at 16-year-old Jacqueline Reay and pulled 
the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 She died after being shot once in the eye while standing in the kitchen of her 
Las Casitas condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant showed no emotion as Campbell announced the acquittal to the 
second-degree murder charge. But his mother and grandmother, seated directly 
behind him in the courtroom, burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the courtroom from the youth's family was Ingrid Reay, mother of the 
dead girl. Although she also showed no emotion as the verdict was announced, 
she expressed her anger outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might not be happy with the judgment, but there's a higher judgment than 
any court in the world, and he will be judged by that," Reay said. "He will 
have to live for the rest of his life knowing that he killed my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Victor Furio said he will seek counseling and treatment for 
his client at the sentencing hearing Nov. 18. Although Campbell could order the 
teen-ager confined to the California Youth Authority until he is 25, Furio said 
he will ask for the youth's immediate release. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said the burly defendant squeezed his hand when Campbell 
announced the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left this courtroom today feeling that someone believed him, and he wasn't 
a murderer," Furio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors conceded that the killing was accidental; that was the reason the 
defendant was tried as a juvenile rather than as an adult. But Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Donald C. Glynn argued that the crime was second-degree murder. And he 
said the defendant was a bully and a showoff who did not care whether the 
handgun was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn declined to comment after the verdict, except to say he will seek the 
maximum sentence for the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses to the shooting testified that the defendant pointed the loaded gun 
at Jacqueline Reay repeatedly the day she died, and he ignored her pleas to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness testified that the defendant told the girl: "If I shot you in the 
leg right now, it would hurt so bad that you would want me to kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant also testified, at one point breaking down in tears as he 
described the fatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he admitted pointing the gun at Jacqueline and several other 
teen-agers, the defendant said that it was a joke and that he never intended to 
harm or even scare anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell ruled that the teen-ager knew "in the abstract" that it was dangerous 
to point a loaded weapon at someone and pull the trigger, but he did not apply 
that concept to his own behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant suggested during testimony that the shooting occurred because he 
let a friend play with his gun, and the other youth may have moved a bullet 
from a clip into the firing chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the defense was that the defendant suffers from attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, an affliction marked by poor judgment and inattention. 
Furio, in asking that the youth be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, 
argued that the disorder left the teen-ager with no common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides convicting the defendant on the manslaughter charge, Campbell also 
found him guilty of three battery charges involving other incidents over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant had previously pleaded guilty to two other assaults and one 
count of brandishing a firearm.

ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; SCHOOL BOARD ACCUSED OF SPENDING ILLEGALLY; 
MOORPARK: COUNTY COORDINATOR OF MEASURE SAYS TAX DOLLARS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county coordinator of a state ballot measure that would deny a public 
education to illegal immigrants has accused the Moorpark school board of 
illegally using tax dollars to campaign against the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative political consultant Steve Frank maintains that the trustees' 
decision to report on the initiative's local impacts is an attempt to cut voter 
support for Proposition 187 in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to use tax dollars to campaign against (187)," Frank said. 
"That's outrageous. They should be spending their money on school books, not on 
a biased impact study." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board has not only directed staff analysts to report on the "Save 
Our State" initiative, but also plans to discuss its local effects in a 
televised meeting and to distribute the staff's report at district 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the five-member board -- Tom Baldwin, Gary Cabriales and Clint 
Harper -- has opposed the measure in public comments, while trustees Pam Castro 
and Greg Barker have expressed concerns about how much money it would cost the 
Moorpark Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said the board has acted properly by ordering an economic analysis of 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is within our legal rights, and it's not an improper expenditure of 
district funds," Baldwin said. "This is an important issue that will have a 
great impact on the district, and we want to get information out to voters so 
they can make an informed decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said the board could not use district funds to campaign against the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales said he will urge the board to formally oppose 187 at its televised 
Oct. 25 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to worry about Moorpark's schools," Cabriales said. "I think it's 
important to let people know how bad this would be for the district. We should 
stay away from the partisan politics, but I think we're obligated to inform 
people of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales said the district would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if it 
is forced to expel illegal immigrants from class. He also objects to making 
teachers and principals check students' immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said he would vote with Cabriales, although a formal board resolution 
against Proposition 187 might "push the envelope" of what is legal because it 
could be construed as a political act. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark trustees' conclusions on what is permissible in a political 
campaign are based on legal opinions by attorneys for the California School 
Boards Assn., board members said. Several school boards countywide have opposed 
the initiative. But no east county board has taken a position. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro also said she could support an anti-187 resolution at the Oct. 25 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would support it as long as it's based on the facts," she said. "We first 
want to look at the facts and get a clear picture of what the impacts will be. 
That's our job."

PANEL TO DECIDE IF PROPOSED SHOOTING RANGE HITS BULL'S-EYE; SIMI VALLEY: THE 
INDOOR GALLERY WOULD BE OPERATED BY AN OXNARD-BASED COMPANY AND GIVE POLICE 
OFFICERS A PLACE TO PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Simi Valley police would have their target practice and neighbors their peace 
and quiet if a proposal to construct the city's first indoor shooting range 
wins approval from the Planning Commission next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan culminates four years of work by city officials to open a local 
shooting gallery that police can use and residents will tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, Shooters Paradise, an Oxnard-based company, will operate the 
10,000-square-foot range and gun shop at 440 Easy St. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President George Rice said the former warehouse needs about $400,000 
in modifications to meet the city's strict sound and safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, who hopes to have the range up and running seven days a week by late 
December, said he expects the gallery to attract the same sort of patrons who 
frequent the Oxnard facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have everyone from the mayor of Oxnard to lawyers, doctors and Navy 
personnel," Rice said. "No gangbangers. We have no tolerance for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Piper, a planning commissioner who formerly served on the City 
Council, said he welcomed the chance to bring a shooting range to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what grief we had in trying to find an outdoor site that would not be 
a detriment to the community," he said. "So obviously a good indoor range that 
meets all the requirements would be the perfect solution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials began trying to open a new gallery in 1990 after the only range 
in Simi Valley shut down at the former Corriganville Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After several proposals for outdoor sites were opposed by residents who did 
not want a shooting range in their neighborhoods, the city began seeking a 
contractor who would open an indoor range. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb, a member of the National Rifle Assn., pressed the 
city to find a business willing to open a gallery in the city, so that police 
officers would not have to travel out of town to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a place close to home for our officers," she said. "It seems 
reasonable to me that a city of this size should have its own range." 
</P>
<P>
 If the range is opened, the city expects to save an estimated $25,000 a year 
in overtime and travel costs that it pays to the department's 110 officers to 
drive to ranges in Camarillo and Ventura. The city's 1994-95 fiscal budget 
takes into account the savings a local range would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Neighborhood Council 1 recently gave the proposal unanimous 
support, saying they liked the fact that the range would be in a 
non-residential area in an existing building. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are buying guns now, and it's better for them to have a place 
to practice," Neighborhood Council President Mike Antoun said. "Also, it is not 
new construction; it is soundproofed and there's nothing visible from the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council in February agreed to change its development code to allow 
the shooting gallery to operate at that site. Under city code, the Planning 
Commission must approve an additional special-use permit before the gun range 
can be installed. The commission will consider the matter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to pay the range about $100,000 a year to provide shooting 
lanes for the Police Department, which will use the facility during off hours. 
The range will also be open to the public.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: REDEVELOPMENT IS PAYING OFF FOR FULLERTON; VOTERS WHO 
RECALLED COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE RIGHT THAT IT COSTS MONEY, BUT FORGET BOTTOM LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G.J. BROWN, G.J. Brown is a Fullerton resident. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heroes are born, not made, we have been told. Sometimes campaign issues are 
made, not born. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems to be the case in Fullerton, where redevelopment became an issue in 
the successful campaign to recall three City Council members earlier this year. 
It has become an even larger issue in the campaign to elect the successors to 
the recalled council members. Many of the council candidates are trying to 
convince voters that the abolition of the city's Redevelopment Agency will 
solve many business and social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Orange County cities have a redevelopment agency. Proponents say that 
redevelopment helps to eliminate blight and to develop, reconstruct and 
rehabilitate areas needing help. The process can include commercial, retail, 
industrial and residential projects. 
</P>
<P>
 When a redevelopment area is formed, the assessed valuation of the area's 
property is frozen. Taxes resulting from an increase in assessed valuation 
above the base year value become the agency's main source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of council candidates say they would abolish the Redevelopment Agency 
as soon as they are elected. But an out-of-hand termination of the agency is 
illegal under state law.  
</P>
<P>
 The slate of candidates endorsed by the Fullerton Recalls Committee says that 
"Every year the Fullerton Redevelopment Agency takes $1.8 million of property 
taxes away from Fullerton!" Because of the tax increments that finance the 
redevelopment agency, that is true. But the Redevelopment Agency has spent $2.8 
million on the Fullerton Town Center; for that $2.8-million investment, 
Fullerton got $883,500 in sales taxes in fiscal 1992-93 alone, a return of 
about 33% on its investment. Before the investment, annual sales tax revenue to 
the city from that property was but $58,836. Since the 1984-85 fiscal year, the 
city has received $9 million in sales taxes from Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Harbor Boulevard, the Redevelopment Agency has invested $1.45 million 
in Metro Center and is getting $532,400 in annual sales taxes from property 
that produced only $235,651 eight years ago. By next year, every sales tax 
dollar from the Metro Center will be net profit. There are other similarly 
successful projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Another criticism of redevelopment by the recall-endorsed slate is that "every 
year the Fullerton Redevelopment Agency takes $3.6 million of property taxes 
away from local schools. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 That's true -- as far as it goes. But under state law, tax-increment financing 
that funds a redevelopment agency does not reduce a school district's revenue 
because state school-funding formulas offset any gain or loss in property tax 
revenue. Also, school district and community college districts receive a 
portion of the redevelopment tax increments.  
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment has brought new business to Fullerton, may have kept some 
business in town and certainly brought in enough new tax revenues that the city 
for years was able to avoid new fees and taxes to maintain public safety 
levels, library and park services and street repairs.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A CALM SPACE FACES THE SHOTGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the treats of living in Orange County is being able to escape quickly 
into rural areas, there to wander for hours in solitude, the only sounds coming 
from birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Coal Canyon is one of those tucked-away areas of respite. Considering its 
nearness to the Riverside Freeway, it is surprising how peaceful and relaxing 
an atmosphere it offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state Fish and Game Commission has proposed designating 952 acres of 
Coal Canyon an ecological reserve and allowing hunting with bows and arrows and 
shotguns. That would be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials point out that hunting in Coal Canyon is not barred now. 
However, few hunters go there because the canyon is relatively unknown and 
difficult to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the state plan said designating the area an ecological reserve 
open for hunting would publicize its availability and make it more popular for 
the shotgun brigade. That, without a doubt, would increase the potential for 
accidents and would drive many nature study groups and hikers out of the canyon 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 One state official said hunting is a "historical activity" in the area and 
noted that the proposed reserve is next to the Cleveland National Forest, where 
hunting is allowed. That may be so, but raising oranges in Orange County was a 
historical activity too, as was the blasting of tens of thousands of birds from 
the sky by hunting parties based at the Bolsa Chica wetlands. Times change and 
the uses of land change with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the nearness of the Cleveland National Forest is an argument against 
hunting in Coal Canyon. Let hunters go a few miles farther, into the forest, a 
much larger expanse than the canyon and one that offers more room for 
coexistence between hunters and hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's 1991 purchase of the land was a good use of bond money authorized 
under Proposition 70, the California Wildlife, Coastal and Park Land 
Conservation Act. Rather than tell hunters to "come and get it," the state 
would be better off banning hunting in the canyon.

CONNORS BLISTERS FLEMING; CHAMPIONS TENNIS: CROWD-PLEASING EFFORT PUTS HIM INTO 
QUARTERFINALS OF DIGITAL PC TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a deliciously soft shot by Peter Fleming, the kind that should have 
given him ample time to prepare for Jimmy Connors' return. Connors, however, 
had different plans. With several quick steps to his left, the co-founder of 
the Champions Tour reached the ball and lobbed it back over both the net and 
his charging opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming let out a loud groan and heaved his racket skyward as the ball landed 
in play and the crowd of over 3,000 erupted in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having some great rallies but I wasn't winning any of them," Fleming 
said, shortly after Connors closed him out, 6-3, 7-5, in the quarterfinals of 
the Digital PC Champions tournament at Sherwood Country Club on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "With most of the guys on this tour I can stand back and rally and be fine," 
he said. "It took me a while to realize that was a ridiculously stupid thing to 
do with Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors roared out of the gates in the first set, using trademark two-handed 
backhand returns to whip passing shots past Fleming whenever the lanky New 
Yorker ventured to the net. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second set, Fleming gained better control of his volleys and made the 
match competitive, though he spent much of the night slouching around the 
baseline wearing a disconsolate expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made for good tennis," Connors said. "Peter's hitting his ground strokes 
better now than he did 15 years ago. The play we get off each other is good for 
us and good for the crowd. They deserve to be warmed up by what's happening in 
front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night's second match was a 6-4, 6-4 doubles victory by Bjorn Borg and 
Mel Purcell over Roscoe Tanner and Johan Kriek. 
</P>
<P>
 If the presence of Connors and Borg gave the evening session emphasis, Mansour 
Bahrami was the show-stopper of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year old Iranian defeated Tim Gullikson, 4-6, 6-1, 7-6, by twice 
recovering from a three-game deficit in the final set to force and eventually 
win a tiebreaker, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahrami blew 15 aces past Gullikson and relentlessly hunted down shots, but it 
was his showmanship that thrilled the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to see people happy," said Bahrami, whose antics included 
whistling like a train after long points and flipping his racket end over end 
while waiting for Gullikson's serves. "If I play it straight and I see people 
have no fun, it is a loss for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bahrami-Gullikson match followed the day's opening engagement, a 6-7, 6-1, 
6-1 victory by Mel Purcell over John Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's continuing quarterfinals feature Bahrami against Kriek at 1 p.m.

 Pasadena quarterback Chris McAlister carried six times for 90 yards and two 
touchdowns and returned a punt 68 yards for a score to lead the Bulldogs to a 
42-3 rout of Hoover in the Pacific League opener Thursday night at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlister, a senior, ran 57 yards down the right sideline on a bootleg play 20 
seconds into the second quarter to open the scoring.He ran the same play for a 
21-yard score with 9 minutes 17 seconds left in the third quarter to put 
Pasadena (4-2) ahead, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our coaches had a good scheme to try and stop him," Hoover Coach 
Dennis Hughes said, "But he had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really stop a guy like that anyways, just try to contain him. We 
were in the right place to do that, but he had the athleticism to get into the 
open field." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the first half, Pasadena linebacker Lester Town twice stopped 
ballcarriers for losses, forced a fumble, and blocked a 50-yard field-goal 
attempt by Marco Mesrobian with 1:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover (2-4) avoided a shutout when Mesrobian kicked a 31-yard field goal with 
7:01 to play. Emre Ozgur gained 83 yards in 19 carries for Hoover.

VERBUM DEI RALLIES TO EDGE BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank High football team got sucker-punched. So said Bulldog wide 
receiver/defensive back Carlos Baker after a 15-14 nonleague loss to Verbum Dei 
at Burroughs High on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said the Eagles lulled Burbank (3-3) into a state of euphoria by 
spotting the Bulldogs a 14-0 lead in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the unexpected knockout blow by the team that gained only 39 yards 
in the first half. Quarterback Corey Redeaux slipped four tackles and scored on 
a 34-yard run to make it 14-7 in the third quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Then with 1 minute 32 seconds remaining, Redeaux, who started 0-for-5 passing, 
found Ali Henry over the middle with an 18-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, also the Eagle kicker, then faked and threw a pass to Damion Wright for 
the winning two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we started to dominate in the first half, we kind of let down," said 
Baker, who rushed for 112 yards in 12 carries, caught two passes for 38 yards 
and intercepted a pass to kill a late Verbum Dei drive. "To tell you the truth, 
I feel I gave this game away." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker got burned on the play that set up the winning touchdown, as Desmond 
McInnis streaked past him on a 48-yard completion.  
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei (5-1) scored the game-winner on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank quarterback Jason Jonas completed 13 of 26 passes for 144 yards, but 
was sacked four times in the second half and threw an interception with 23 
seconds left after Burbank had marched to the Verbum Dei 17.

SIDELINES; PAIR OF ALEMANY PAINTBALL ENTHUSIASTS RAISE HUE AND CRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with an uphill battle, the Alemany High football team can say it has two 
veteran soldiers on its side. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Lovato and Steve Nunez have combat experience that should come in handy 
tonight when Alemany travels to Bishop Amat High for a Del Rey League opener 
against the top-ranked team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovato, a defensive back, and Nunez, a receiver, are paintball commandos. 
</P>
<P>
 Paintball is an increasingly popular mock military contest in which 
participants plaster each other with paint pellets fired from guns with the 
goal of capturing the opposing army's flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovato and Nunez have taken part in competitions with as many as 100 soldiers 
on each side. In the past several years, paintball fields have popped up all 
over Southern California, including in Azusa, Newhall and Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my own gun and everything," Lovato said. "I've been doing it for about 
a year. We enter tournaments at different fields. Steve got me into it. " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nunez: "We used to play every single weekend until football started. Now, 
all the guys on the team want to play. We're trying to get a team together so 
we can take on someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat, perhaps? Alemany probably would stand a better chance in 
paintball than football. Bishop Amat has outscored its five opponents, 161-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed emotions: After throwing the winning touchdown pass in San Fernando 
High's 21-20 comeback victory over Kennedy, quarterback Keijuan Douglas was 
laughing and dancing with teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a reporter approached, he quickly turned earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to dedicate this victory to my grandmother, Theo Houston, who died 
three months ago," Douglas said. "I've dedicated this whole season to her. I 
loved my grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas spoke in measured tones for several minutes before a smile crossed his 
face and euphoria once again took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost forgot to say," he added, "we're better than Sylmar! We're the best 
team in the Valley!" 
</P>
<P>
 Worn pair: Sam Cvijanovich, a former Cal Lutheran star and Canadian Football 
League rookie of the year, last week delivered a rather unusual good luck charm 
to Cal Lutheran Coach Joe Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Cvijanovich, who lives in Oxnard, gave the coach a pair of blue slippers. 
Supposedly, they were the same pair that the team carried for good luck from 
1964 into the 1980s, before they disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The slippers -- Harper isn't sure if they're the same ones -- were hung over 
the door of the Cal Lutheran locker room Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, it looked like their luck hadn't run out. Cal Lutheran led 
undefeated La Verne, 6-3. Alas, the story lacks a fairy-tale finish. Cal 
Lutheran lost, 23-6. "I guess the slippers only work for a half now," Harper 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Show biz: Assistant Darrell Smith of Westlake High was the football technical 
adviser for the upcoming film "Little Giants," and Warrior Coach Jim Benkert 
was his assistant. Smith and Benkert spent the summer coordinating football 
scenes in the film, which is about a bumbling youth football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Benkert even make brief on-screen appearances as officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look real closely to find us," Benkert said, "but you can if you 
know what you are looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Look what I found: When Simi Valley High football Coach Roger McCamy arrived 
at school Monday, he was surprised to see The Bell already there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell goes to the winner of each year's game between Simi Valley and 
Thousand Oaks highs, schools that were rivals before the opening of newer 
schools such as Royal, Westlake and Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley had just won back The Bell with a 24-20 victory over the 
Lancers last week. How, McCamy wondered, did it get to Simi Valley so soon? And 
already painted maroon and gold? 
</P>
<P>
 McCamy found out a few days later: "In 1992, we beat them and got The Bell 
back," he said, "then in 1993 they beat us and we never gave it back to them." 
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High can't seem to get any respect. Earlier this season the Tornadoes 
snapped a 16-game losing streak, and last week they won again, 17-12, over La 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did La Canada Coach Jim Clausen have to say: "We're not a very big 
football team. Maybe that's why we're losing to Hoover." Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Valley College's Brian Comer, already the school's career leader with 92 
receptions, 1,617 yards and 17 touchdowns, can zero in on another milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore from Chatsworth High has scored 102 points and is within 
striking distance of second place on the career list. Comer is fourth behind 
Dondre Bausley, who scored 194 points in 1986-87, Howard Blackwell, who scored 
138 in '92, and Terrel Ray, who scored 110 in 1964-65. 
</P>
<P>
 They're consistent: The Cal Lutheran football ranks in the bottom half of the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in every category 
except one: penalties. The Kingsmen, who average 32.5 yards in penalties a 
game, are the best-behaved team in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Whack attack: Outside hitter Missy Clements is closing in on the Northridge 
volleyball career record for kills. Clements has 1,220 kills, placing her 31 
behind Nancy Nicholls (1989-92), and 107 from breaking Kathleen Dixon's school 
record set from '87-90. Things to Do 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, 11:59, at Cal State Northridge and Ventura College gymnasiums: The 
Northridge and Ventura men's basketball teams hold their traditional Midnight 
Madness practices, signaling the start of fall workouts. Northridge opens 
against UCLA on Nov. 26. Ventura was runner-up in the 1993 and '94 state junior 
college championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, 7 p.m., at the Cal State Northridge gymnasium: Northridge plays host 
to Cal State Bakersfield in a nonconference women's volleyball match. 
Bakersfield, the top-ranked team in the NCAA Division II, last month suffered 
its only loss of the season against the Matadors.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; THOUSAND OAKS ENDS AGOURA GIRLS' RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The reign has ended for the Agoura High girls' cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
 After being the region's dominant team -- and one of the state's best -- for 
the past seven years, the Chargers lost to Thousand Oaks in a Marmonte League 
double-dual meet at Agoura on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks (4-0, 4-0 in league matches) defeated Agoura, 20-41, and Channel 
Islands, 15-50. Agoura defeated Channel Islands, 15-40. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the first for Agoura (2-1, 2-1) in league competition since 1986, 
when the Chargers dropped a Frontier League meet to Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe it or not, I thought we could run pretty competitively with them," 
Agoura Coach Bill Duley said. "But they were definitely stronger than I 
anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
 Charger senior Amy Skieresz remained undefeated with a course-record time of 
17 minutes 57 seconds over the three-mile distance, but Thousand Oaks showed 
why it is the No. 1-ranked team in the state by sweeping the next six places. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancer juniors Kim Mortensen and Tara Marsden were second and third in 18:46 
and 18:48, and they were followed by senior Bridget Roy (19:16), junior Katie 
Scherrei (19:47), junior Alison Feinstein (19:49) and freshman Erin Sorensen 
(19:55). 
</P>
<P>
 "We got some monster races out of a couple of girls today," Thousand Oaks 
Coach Jack Farrell said. "Tara Marsden might have run the best race of her 
career and Erin Sorensen also ran great. With (Erin), our girls team now (has 
six top runners), just like our boys." 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' meet, Thousand Oaks, the No. 2-ranked team in the country by The 
Harrier magazine, defeated Agoura, 19-30, and Channel Islands, 18-31. Agoura 
defeated Channel Islands, 21-36. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancer senior Keith O'Doherty won his third consecutive race with a 
course-record time of 15:09, breaking the previous best of 15:38 set by 
Agoura's John Greene last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene was second in 15:29, followed by Thousand Oaks' Jeff Fischer (15:37) 
and Channel Islands' Francisco Sandoval (15:48). 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Disney (15:59), Josh Carolan (16:09) and Kevin Marsden (16:29) placed 
fifth, sixth and seventh for the Lancers (4-0, 4-0), the defending State 
Division I champions. JOHN ORTEGA

Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway classic "Carousel," after replacing star 
Alfred Drake as Curly in the national company of "Oklahoma!" He scored another 
Broadway hit in 1954 with "Pajama Game" and has performed in numerous other 
musicals on Broadway, on tour and in summer stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyth, 66, was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Joan Crawford's vicious 
daughter Veda in the 1945 film "Mildred Pierce." She had made her film debut 
the previous year in the Donald O'Connor musical "Chip Off the Old Block," and 
went on to appear in such MGM movies of the 1950s as "The Great Caruso," "Rose 
Marie," "The Student Prince" and "Kismet." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's pair of hourlong concerts, which feature Blyth's longtime music 
director Harper MacKay on piano and are preceded by the antics of comic pianist 
Dale Gonyea, spotlight the singers' personal film and Broadway favorites. There 
are solo or duet selections from "Showboat," "South Pacific," "Annie Get Your 
Gun" and "The Phantom of the Opera," along with Raitt's rendition of 
"Oklahoma!" From "Carousel," he performs his signature songs, "If I Loved You," 
with Blyth, and "Soliloquy." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is particularly appropriate for inclusion on the "Show of the 
Month" roster; the series, geared to audiences older than 50, debuted in 
September, 1993, at Cal State Northridge but was moved after the earthquake. 
"It's their music," says Raitt by phone from Florence, Italy, where he and wife 
Rosemary are vacationing. "They say, 'Now you're singing my kind of music.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Blyth, from her home in Rancho Santa Fe: "It seems to me that for such a 
long time, older people didn't have a place (in the Valley) to go to hear this 
music. I get a wonderful response to it across the country -- they say, 'Thank 
you so much for bringing that music again.' It's hummable, whistle-able -- all 
those nice things that much of today's music isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The two have proven to be as long-lasting as their repertoire. For almost five 
years now, Blyth has appeared in a patter- and tune-filled cabaret act with 
former "Days of Our Lives" soap star Bill Hayes, including stints in Las Vegas 
and at the Rainbow & Stars club in Rockefeller Center in New York. She had 
retired from movies after "The Helen Morgan Story" in 1957 in favor of family 
life: She and her husband of 41 years, Dr. James McNulty, an obstetrician, have 
three daughters and two sons, with their seventh and eighth grandchildren due 
by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Raitt performs about 20 concerts a year, among them this year's televised 
Fourth of July celebration in Washington, D.C., and appearances with pop / 
blues singing daughter Bonnie at Radio City Music Hall in New York and at the 
Hollywood Bowl. His other singing partners include Constance Towers and Anna 
Maria Alberghetti, and he regularly headlines concerts by the Hollywood-based 
American Center for Music Theater -- a training program for aspiring performers 
-- of which he is board president. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although they have sung many of Sunday's selections numerous times, both say 
the songs remain fresh. "In almost every phrase, there's such emotion that it 
would be difficult not to feel it when you sing it, and hopefully, pass it on 
to the audience," Blyth says. "It's the best way to communicate to those who 
are perfect strangers; suddenly, they're not strangers any more." 
</P>
<P>
 "These songs are just a part of me," adds Raitt, who in January was inducted 
into the Theatre Hall of Fame in New York. "That's your training. It's your 
life's work. You always try to bring something new to it, even if it's a song 
you've sung a thousand times. I love to sing. People say 'You look younger,' 
and I feel younger, when I'm on stage. I love performing, and if people want to 
hear me, that's even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he says, in mentioning upcoming commitments, "I think it's wonderful 
to have something to look forward to. At my age, I like firsts." Having 
recently participated in a recording of the new show "Jekyll and Hyde" by Frank 
Wildhorn, in November he guests on opera star Thomas Hampson's Broadway album 
and will record his own album early next year, for Angel Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyth, meanwhile, is assembling a new act of Broadway music with Hayes. She 
could be speaking for Raitt as well when she says: "I've always enjoyed the 
joy, the excitement, the pure pleasure of singing this music. It's so easy to 
listen to, it stays with you. Isn't any art supposed to do that -- to climb 
inside you and give you a wonderful feeling?" Where and When

SINGING HER HEART OUT; SLOW, EMOTIONAL BALLADS ARE A SPECIALTY OF JULIE KELLY. 
THE ARTIST CAN SWING BUT SHINES ON MOVING, MAJESTIC TUNES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When she was a fledgling jazz vocalist in her early 20s, Julie Kelly 
moonlighted as a waitress at the famed San Francisco club the Jazz Workshop, 
and heard many of the greats: pianist Ahmad Jamal, bassist Charles Mingus, 
conga drummer Mongo Santamaria, and so many others. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was blues tunes like "Goin' Down Slow" and "Ain't Nobody's Business," 
sung by Jimmy Witherspoon -- that barrel-voiced, jazz-influenced baritone -- 
that really floored her. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this beautiful connection between Jimmy and his audience. There 
wasn't a separation between the stage and the people," Kelly says. "Everybody 
knew what he was going to say in his songs, but they came to hear him say it. 
It was like he was telling their story. I feel lucky to have witnessed that 
kind of communication." 
</P>
<P>
 It's that directness that Kelly, 46, seeks when she works, as she will 
Saturday at Le Cafe. She says she's able to get it more often -- she reveals a 
powerful immediacy on "Stories to Tell," her aptly titled new release on Chase 
Music Group Records -- and that she's more comfortable being on stage as the 
years go by. Now she feels that she can just stand there and sing, but it's 
still no easy feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singing is frightening," she says in a phone conversation. "You're naked. 
There's no instrument in front of you, nothing separating you from the notes, 
just you and your skin. And what you're trying to do is subtle and vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, an Oakland native who has been in Southern California since 1980 and 
who lives with her husband, Sam DiMaggio, in Studio City, says the art of 
singing -- be it jazz or classical, the two genres she reveres -- captivates 
her because of its totality. "You use every single part of yourself, from your 
toenails to your hair follicles," she says. "You breathe in and then breathe 
out and sing, summoning everything that you are and putting it out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly has sung professionally since she was teen-ager. A mezzo soprano who 
offers a rich tonal quality that lights her intimate tales, she can swing hard 
-- "Stories to Tell" includes walloping versions of "Surrey With the Fringe on 
Top," "When in Rome" and Charlie Parker's "Billie's Bounce." But it's on the 
ballads, the slow, somber, packed-with-emotion essays such as George and Ira 
Gershwin's "My Man's Gone Now" from "Porgy and Bess," that the singer is heard 
to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That song -- in which Bess reveals, in a mournful yet majestic lyric by Ira 
Gershwin, her anguish over the death of her love, Porgy -- is her kind of song, 
Kelly says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a song has a lyric that strikes me as a wonderful story, then I can sing 
it well," she says. "In a tune like 'My Man's Gone Now,' I can visualize the 
whole story before I start to sing. It's all laid out for me. It's a tale of 
hope and courage, and yet it's poignant and sad. So it's a story that can be 
told again and again. I always find something new in it, and it's worth telling 
again because of the beauty, the way the lyrics and melody work together." 
</P>
<P>
 At Le Cafe, Kelly will sing material from "Stories to Tell," and other classic 
jazz and pop tunes, accompanied by a group she says is "magical with a capital 
M": Larry Koonse (guitar), Darek Oles (bass) and Joe LaBarbera (drums). "With 
them, anything can happen. There's all this room when we play," she says. "It's 
sort of like looking into a raindrop and seeing this other world, and you can 
go in there and feel free. The music just kind of happens. And it felt that way 
the first time we played together." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Jaffe, owner of Le Cafe, has long enjoyed having Kelly at his Room 
Upstairs. "She continued to grow, over time," he says. "It's great to hear her 
making such good music." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly lists Thelonious Monk, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie and June Christy 
among her jazz influences. She sings songs associated with Christy at radio 
station KLON-FM's "Jazz West Coast" bash in Redondo Beach later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who says singing has led her to find "something limitless inside," says 
she's constantly enchanted by the mystery of music. "It's so magical when you 
hear a note, and the way it actually enters your body," she says. "I don't 
understand it, but it seems like a miracle." Where and When

A SPACE OF THEIR OWN; LISA ADAMS AND ROD BAER CREATE SEPARATE BUT COMPLEMENTARY 
INSTALLATIONS AT PIERCE COLLEGE GALLERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It is not often that artists are given the opportunity to come into a gallery 
and do whatever they desire with the space. But that is the proposition that 
the Pierce College Art Gallery offered Los Angeles artists Lisa Adams and Rod 
Baer. 
</P>
<P>
 They have created separate, intriguing installations that meet under the 
title, "Aleatoric Circumstances." Before one decries the title as 
unintelligible artspeak, one should know that it is not art aficionado lingo, 
but a word that Adams, an avid dictionary reader, found and noted for future 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 A Random House dictionary defines aleatory as "pertaining to luck or chance; 
unpredictable." Baer described it as "random events that cause their own 
composition, their own sense, creating their own spontaneous energy." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Adams said, the independently made installations "turned out to work 
together." Both she and Baer used a "spare, wall-to-wall approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallery director Joan Kahn offered these artists, who are friends, the space 
because "I like the eccentric poetry and cryptic lyricism in both their work," 
she said. "I thought that their work was similar in spirit, but very different 
in the way it is constructed. I was interested to have them do installations 
and see what happened. Rod constructs objects; Lisa is a painter. I felt it 
would be an interesting combination, and interesting for two friends to work 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 For Adams' untitled installation, you "stand in the middle and walk around," 
Kahn said. "To me it's about architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' 24-by-15-foot work grew from a scale model. "All the images are culled 
from the abstract images I've been working with in my painting," she said of 
the black paint on white walls. 
</P>
<P>
 These include two circular images that appear like the eyes of a cartoon 
character or tearful clown, and a gathering of elliptical shapes that float on 
the wall as if matter moving through space. At the bottom of house-shaped 
structures and other geometric shapes, sinuous paths flow like a river that 
seems to go nowhere and maybe everywhere. Large footprints seem to disappear 
over the wall leading to Baer's installation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like Alice 'Through the Looking Glass,' an unbridled fantasy land, 
vignettes that dovetail together," Adams said. "The more I am here, the more I 
think it has a lot of different components emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that there was no color seemed real appropriate for working in a 
spatial mode. The flat black (images) retain their object-ness. They are voids, 
but they cast shadows. There's a lot of animation in here. There's an absurdity 
to (the installation) that I really like." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams found painting on the gallery walls a "curious or exhilarating primary 
experience," she said. "Paintings you take to have and to hold. Painting on the 
wall, you can't take it with you. It's going to be painted over. I like that I 
can't take it with me. It was a challenge to work with something that big. It 
informed me of my capacities. Now I feel I could do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the gallery, viewers will first observe Baer's installation, "Bamboo 
Tides." The long, horizontally placed bamboo poles surround a construction 
resembling a buoy that seems to bob along in ocean waves. But above viewers is 
a bamboo reed, part of it wrapped with a brilliantly blue rope that "reinforces 
a water line, a tidal line," Baer said. "You go from observer to (being) in it 
and under it. It's linear and almost graphic, and yet it's organic." The 
segmentation of the bamboo suggests "linear growth, the movement of time. I 
think of cycles, everything from life to death." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the way Rod used the space," Kahn said. "It's the first time someone 
has used the space successfully." 
</P>
<P>
 Attached to the buoy-like structure are many bound-up newspapers, wrapped in 
copper. "Copper is one of the few materials that lasts forever," Baer said. He 
sees daily newspapers as a "whole attempt at creating this factual mode, taking 
something so transitory and attempting to make it permanent. A web of 
communication goes out over the world, but maybe it isn't realistic. The 
newspaper doesn't relate to the real issues of our time, yet it's there. The 
real stuff is experience, our senses. We need to reopen that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to make things that are imbued with the way I look at the world," he 
said. "The first and primary responsibility of an artist is to be honest about 
what you see." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Lisa Adams / Rod Baer: Aleatoric Circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Pierce College Art Gallery, 6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; PLAYING IN THE PARK; ROGER MCGUINN OF THE BYRDS WILL OPEN 
FOR FLEETWOOD MAC AT KLSX CONCERT IN VAN NUYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's rare for the San Fernando Valley to host a rock concert featuring some 
major figures in rock music history, but it's happening Saturday at Woodley 
Avenue Park in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio station KLSX-FM, in association with the Los Angeles Department of 
Recreation and Parks, will present a free concert from 1 to 4 p.m. featuring 
Fleetwood Mac plus Roger McGuinn, former leader of the Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth year that KLSX has sponsored its free Classic Jam concert. 
Almost 30,000 people attended last year's event, which featured Stephen Stills, 
Kansas, Dave Mason and Greg Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleetwood Mac, which started in the late 1960s as a blues band and evolved 
through many personnel and style changes over the years, enjoyed its greatest 
success in the mid-1970s and early '80s with a mellow pop-rock sound. 
</P>
<P>
 That lineup -- which, besides mainstays Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, 
included Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie and Lindsay Buckingham -- broke up in 
the late 1980s. But it briefly reunited to perform one tune at the Clinton 
inaugural in January, 1993: Christine McVie's "Don't Stop Thinking About 
Tomorrow," Clinton's unofficial campaign song. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicks and Buckingham have long since pursued solo efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine McVie will not appear Saturday, but Fleetwood said she's still 
involved with the band in a songwriting capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's recording the album with us," Fleetwood said. "She just doesn't want to 
go out on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Filling the void is Dave Mason, a singer and guitarist formerly of Traffic and 
author of hits such as "Feelin' Alright" and "Only You Know and I Know"; singer 
Bekka Bramlett, daughter of the 1970s rock duo Delaney & Bonnie (Bramlett); and 
Billy Burnette, son of 1950s rock pioneer Dorsey Burnette. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleetwood said the band has been in the studio for about eight months, but 
took a brief summer break for a short tour with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The 
band played about five nights a week for two months, about 40 dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave everyone a bit of confidence, especially Bekka, who is an unknown 
quantity," Fleetwood said. "But, every night out on the road before a lot of 
people, I've seen this young lady has the goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleetwood said the time on the road convinced him about this latest 
incarnation of the "Mac." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the only way to do it: You get out there and you play, and if 
you're not going over, you have to get something happening," he said. "It was a 
calculated risk, but we found this band can go out and cut the mustard." 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the show will be McGuinn, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member. 
</P>
<P>
 The Byrds, featuring McGuinn, David Crosby, Gene Clark, Michael Clarke and 
Chris Hillman, created a hybrid folk-rock sound in the mid-1960s with such hits 
as Bob Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man." McGuinn's electric 12-string guitar 
provided the band's signature sound. 
</P>
<P>
 He later helped expand the boundaries of rock again by incorporating elements 
of country music into the Byrds' repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuinn was nominated for a Grammy last year for his performance with Neil 
Young, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Dylan on Bob Dylan's 30th 
anniversary album.  
</P>
<P>
 His performance Saturday will include the old and new. "I'm going to be doing 
a timeline," McGuinn said. "A musical history of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 The KLSX Classic Jam, featuring Fleetwood Mac and Roger McGuinn, will be from 
1 to 4 p.m. Saturday at Woodley Avenue Park in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation 
Area, 6330 Woodley Ave., Van Nuys. Admission is free. Call (800) 448-KLSX for 
parking and other information.

 CLASSICAL PICKS: San Fernando Valley classical music fans will have several 
concerts to choose from in the next few weeks, including the Glendale Symphony 
Orchestra's debut Oct. 22 at the newly refurbished Alex Theatre, Mozart's "Cosi 
Fan Tutte" Oct. 21 to 30 at Cal State Northridge, and Valley Symphony 
Orchestra's concert Wednesday evening at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Symphony Orchestra's program will include Mozart's Symphony No. 41 
in C, Dvorak's Symphony No. 8 in G and "Diversions for Orchestra" by composer 
Irving Fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two symphonies (Mozart and Dvorak) were written 101 years apart," said 
Robert Chauls, the Valley Symphony Orchestra's musical director. "They're each 
one of the finest examples of each composer's art." 
</P>
<P>
 Chauls says his ensemble is a community orchestra based at Valley College but 
not limited to the college's students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Symphony Orchestra performs at 8 p.m. Wednesday in the Little 
Theatre , Valley College, 5800 Fulton Ave., Van Nuys. Admission is free. Call 
(818) 781-1200, Ext. 349.

THEATER; FANG IN CHEEK; 'DRACULA' HOLDS THE BLOOD, POURS ON THE LAUGHS. LEAD 
ACTOR SAYS THE VAMPIRE IS OLDER, WISER AND HAS A BETTER SENSE OF HUMOR.

 Grab your garlic and cover up your neck: The world's most popular vampire is 
on the loose again, as "Dracula, A Tale of the Nosferatu" opens tonight at the 
Ventura Court Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by George Luce and George McGuire, the seven-character show is billed 
as a "fang-in-cheek" retelling of the Bram Stoker legend. "There are no buckets 
of blood," assures co-producer Chris Edsey. "It's campy but thrilling, a real 
family show -- although it's not recommended for children under 7." 
</P>
<P>
 The show marks the first in-house production of the Ventura Court Theatre 
Alliance, a collaboration of two married couples -- Edsey and Vaughn Armstrong 
(who's playing Dracula), and Shannon Monahan and Frank Ashmore (Dracula's 
nemesis, Van Helsing) -- who took over the newly renovated 50-seat space in 
April and have since hosted a handful of rental shows, including "Hurlyburly" 
and "The Wives." Armstrong and Edsey discovered this version of the Dracula 
story in 1981, when they co-starred in a staging for friend and co-writer Luce 
at his Barn Dinner Theatre in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm now too old for Mina," the vampire's love interest, Edsey says with a wry 
laugh, "but he can still play Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so much fun," recalls Armstrong, who revived the role in 1984 at 
the DeLacey Street Theatre in Pasadena. "There's magic, mystery, pathos, camp 
-- for parents and kids. It's just scary enough, and a lot of laughs." Quoting 
a description from the play, he refers to his Dracula as "a magnificent evil 
beast" who's evolved over the years. "He's bitten a few more necks, tasted a 
few more blood types; his preferences are more well-defined," says the actor. 
"And he has a better sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong obviously holds a soft spot for this notorious character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love vampire features -- I grew up with them," explains the actor, who has 
previously essayed Dracula five times in three different versions. "He's 
someone who falls in love with every crystal beauty he sees, and for that 
moment, he's completely enamored. He's been around for 400 years, sought the 
perfect love -- and each one is , until he sucks them dry and has no further 
use for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as much animal as human, a snake seeking his prey. It's not his fault; 
it's part of his being. He's as intelligent as he is evil, a victim of 
circumstance -- and yet he loves it." Born in Sonora, Calif., Armstrong grew up 
in Redlands, and got into acting as a teen-ager. "I was a little rowdy," he 
allows, "so my mother offered me $10 to get into a school play." He quickly 
discovered the ratio of girl-to-boy thespians was way in his favor. "It was 
like, 'Money and women -- yeah, this is the place for me.' And I got a lot of 
positive response. I had a drama teacher who taught me responsibility, the joy 
of being involved." After high school, he was drafted into the Army infantry 
and shipped off to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to shoot people," Armstrong says, "so I built a theater in Cam 
Rahn Bay." Later, he was transferred to an Army base in Colorado Springs, 
Colo., where he was in charge of the Fort Carson Little Theatre -- and 
performed his first "Dracula."

 Moving to Kansas, he met Edsey in 1974 -- "We had a great romance in every 
cornfield," he says -- and together they relocated to Los Angeles. Married 17 
years, they have two sons, 8 and 10.

 Although he's worked regularly in TV and film, Armstrong is proudest of two 
local stage outings, Bill Cain's "Stand-Up Tragedy" (Taper, Too and Mark Taper 
Forum, 1989) and the group-created Vietnam drama, "Tracers" (Coronet, 1985) -- 
whose stage version he filmed last month. "When you do a lot of television, a 
lot of commercial things, you usually don't get to say anything important," the 
actor says. "Of the hundreds of plays I've done, they are the only ones of real 
social relevance." 
</P>

 Armstrong pauses. "Let's be clear," he says cheerily. " 'Dracula' is not that. 
'Dracula' is just fun." Where and When

CLUB SCENE; ROCK NIGHT AT DOWN UNDER DIGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERIE SAUNDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 "KNAC Night" debuted Oct. 6 at the Australian Beach Club, a large, two-story 
dance club in Burbank that will have "rock nights" every Thursday, with no 
cover or dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: To the left of the entrance sits the dance floor and bar. The game 
rooms are on the right and upstairs. Surrounding the dance floor are tables and 
stools as well as patio tables and chairs. The DJ booth overlooks the dance 
floor, and a rounded beach bar like the one in the movie "Cocktail" sits to the 
left. Spray-painted pictures of marine life decorate the walls. A real palm 
tree sits in the lounge area along with two TV monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: While the place rocked with music ranging from Pearl Jam to AC/DC, 
everyone seemed content to just sit around, drink and talk to friends. The 
dance floor didn't see any action until 11 p.m. Other nights include '70s disco 
on Tuesdays, alternative on Wednesdays and a mixture of all kinds of dance 
music, including disco, alternative, R & B and hip-hop on Fridays and 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The waitresses are friendly, fun and flirtatious, serving up drinks 
in cutoff denim shorts and leather bustiers. Anything goes on rock night, which 
brought out the men in black T-shirts, snug jeans and long hair, and the women 
in tight dresses, pumps and permed tresses. The majority of men and women wore 
jeans, flannel, white T-shirts, vests and button-down shirts or blouses. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Games galore. The downstairs game room has a Ping-Pong table, an 
air-hockey table, two pool tables, Foosball, a basketball hoop, four hanging TV 
monitors and an aquarium that resembles the one on MTV's "Real World." An 
upstairs room has its own full bar and holds three more pool tables, a pinball 
machine, video games and a view of the entire dance floor below. This room is 
often rented to private parties -- Jay Leno celebrated his 500th episode of 
"The Tonight Show" here. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "They should have dance nights on more nights of the week," said Tom 
Monette, 23, of Burbank, comparing the number of people this Thursday to the 
standing-room-only weekend crowds, when the music ranges from hip-hop to 
alternative. "I think they have too many (specialized) nights. If they had 
dance nights more often, this place would always be packed." 
</P>
<P>
 THE DESPERATION: The DJ, in a last-ditch attempt to entice patrons onto the 
dance floor, said he would play songs from the pop group Ace of Base all night 
if people continued to stand against the wall. Before anyone could even say, 
"Yeah, right," the bouncy intro to "The Sign" blasted through the speakers to 
everyone's shock and dismay. Once the song was abruptly stopped and the music 
switched back to rock, the crowd realized the DJ was serious, and the dance 
floor started to fill up . . . a little.  
</P>
<P>
 Australian Beach Club, 237 E. Olive Ave., Burbank. Open seven nights a week 
with dinner at 4 p.m., dancing at 8 p.m. $5 cover on Wednesdays, Fridays and 
Saturdays. Happy hour from 4 to 8 p.m. Free buffet for Monday Night Football.

COVER STORY; SHOW TIME; AT TELEVISION STUDIOS IN THE VALLEY, AUDIENCES GET A 
BEHIND-THE-SCENES GLIMPSE AT HOW SHOWS AND THEIR ACTORS GET THE JOB DONE -- 
GAFFES, GUFFAWS AND ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lady in the back row wants to know Brett Butler's reaction to making People 
magazine's worst-dressed list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," Butler snaps, "they can bite me." 
</P>
<P>
 The offhand exchange comes minutes before a taping of the comedienne's ABC 
sitcom "Grace Under Fire." She has climbed into the bleachers to chat with her 
studio audience. The conversation ranges from earthquakes to ex-husbands to the 
benefits of starring in a hit TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got these," she says, gesturing toward her recent and much-publicized 
breast implants. "They're four-wheel drive." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience applauds. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next three hours, these people will watch the taping of an episode. 
They will see the machinations of lights and cameras, directors and actors. 
They will laugh at the scripted punch lines. But their response will be loudest 
when Butler slips out of character: when she talks with them or tosses an 
ad-lib their way. It is the same on the set of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" as 
Will Smith raps before taping. At the Walt Disney Studios, the crowd roars when 
Ellen DeGeneres dissolves into laughter during a serious scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my second time to this show," a man in the "Ellen" audience says. "I 
love it when she makes mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a studio audience is a uniquely Hollywood experience. It offers a 
side of television that most of America never sees -- the quips and gaffes made 
for recounting to co-workers around the water cooler or the family back in 
Iowa. And it is free. 
</P>
<P>
 So the waiting list to see the top-rated "Home Improvement" stretches into 
December, 1995. Other programs have shorter waits but, on the day of the show, 
people stand in line for hours to get the best seats. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new TV season in full swing, and production sets located from Burbank 
to Agoura, the San Fernando Valley offers dozens of sitcoms and talk shows. A 
sampling of these programs suggests that each one provides a slightly different 
brand of entertainment. "THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR" 
</P>
<P>
 Will Smith's grinning face flickers on television monitors suspended above the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to Willy's playhouse," he says. "Here we have actors who very rarely 
say their lines right and I'm going to lead the pack." 
</P>
<P>
 Errors from previous tapings are replayed. They set the mood for this loose 
and friendly set. Smith arrives in person a few minutes later, climbing over 
the railing to get to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you ready to party?" he shouts. "Where's my party section?" 
</P>
<P>
 The audience numbers 285, which is average for a sitcom. Some are tourists 
hungry for a taste of celebrity. Some are locals wanting a behind-the-scenes 
look at their favorite program. Once the taping begins, they wait through a 
fair amount of inaction -- camera adjustments, set and wardrobe changes. Some 
scenes are repeated. And some of the sets are out of view, forcing the crowd to 
watch on monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith and his co-stars keep the evening interesting by turning their 
attention to the people. Alfonso Ribeiro, who plays Carlton, offers a Michael 
Jackson impersonation. James Avery, the father on the NBC show, dances 
ballroom-style. Even the production executives tap their feet to music that 
thrums over loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
 And when someone in the audience breaks out in a song between takes, Smith 
dances along on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm backing you up," he tells the singer. "I'm here for you." "ELLEN" 
</P>
<P>
 Television producers insist that it is vital to keep the audience enthusiastic 
and happy. That is why they employ stand-up comedians to work between takes. 
The actors want a lively crowd, too. They say it energizes them. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you guys holding up out there?" Ellen DeGeneres asks, squinting to 
see past the bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The filming of her ABC show, "Ellen," has stretched past three hours and the 
sound stage feels only slightly warmer than a Minnesota winter day. The people 
cheer all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeneres does not pay as much attention to the crowd as do Smith and his 
cohorts. But she ad-libs from one take to the next. Each repeated scene brings 
the possibility of a surprise laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio audience inspires such modifications, says Tom Cherones, the show's 
director. During the first take, he says, both cast and crew listen for a 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the actors the correct timing if the joke is working," Cherones 
says. "And if it's not working, Ellen will try something else or the writers 
will quickly come up with a new line for the second take." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Mike Hernandez, who has brought his girlfriend, Ilene Vasquez, to see the 
show: "I like the little funny stuff she does. I like the modifications." 
"HANGIN' WITH MR. COOPER" 
</P>
<P>
 Some producers go to great lengths to keep the audience buzzing. "Hangin' with 
Mr. Cooper" is one of several shows, including Fox's "Martin" and "Living 
Single," that offer a comedian and a disc jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Danno Metoyer spins records from a booth in the corner of the bleachers. The 
fans, young and boisterous, have come to see stars Mark Curry and Holly 
Robinson but Metoyer knows how to grab their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 He blasts 69 Boyz' "Tootsee Roll" over the loudspeakers and the kids jump from 
their seats to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a wedding or a club, you have to sustain the energy for hours," Metoyer 
says. "Here, you hit 'em. You snap 'em. It is like an electric shock, like 
those things they use when you have a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd's enthusiasm is infectious and nearly as entertaining as the show 
itself. Warm-up comedian Lewis Dix chimes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relax," he shouts. "You're like an out-of-control Tupperware party." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Curry steps in front of the camera, everyone hushes. His ABC sitcom 
is funny and fast, even with repeated takes. And the audience gets some 
real-life drama: Dallas Cowboys quarterback Rodney Peete walks onto the set 
and, on bended knee, proposes to Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the actress shouts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sort of thing audience members can tell their friends the next day. 
It is the reason they have taken the trouble to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 And Metoyer promptly spins a romantic tune on the turntable. "LATER WITH GREG 
KINNEAR" 
</P>
<P>
 Garnsey Sloan is making her second visit to "Later With Greg Kinnear" at the 
NBC Studios in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep coming here until I get him to call my girlfriend in 
Philadelphia," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 That friend, Karin, visited Los Angeles several months ago and got tickets to 
see Kinnear on a night when the taping was unexpectedly canceled. So Sloan 
pursues a personal quest. And when Kinnear pays his usual visit to the 
audience, answering questions before the show, she makes her plea. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want me to call somebody?" Kinnear asks. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk show host agrees. Sloan scampers onstage to sit at his desk as he 
dials. But they get an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exciting," Kinnear quips to the crowd. "Isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, "Later" is a blur of activity compared to other shows. After 
Kinnear's visit, warm-up comedian Bob Perlow works the crowd into a lather. The 
ensuing half-hour program runs straight through with no repeats. The commercial 
breaks are filled with blistering rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a show like this," Perlow says, "they want to hear the excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging purely by decibel level, that excitement comes through loud and clear. 
Sloan, however, remains unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep coming back until he gets through." "BLUE SKIES" 
</P>
<P>
 Some sitcoms tape each episode twice, once in the afternoon and again at 
night. "Blue Skies" is one of those shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon tapings draw smaller audiences, says Steve Sheets, a guest relations 
coordinator for Audiences Unlimited, a company that distributes tickets for 
most of the television shows in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is from out of town, the afternoon is a better time to see a 
show," Sheets says. "It's easier to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 For the early version of "Blue Skies," a new entry in ABC's fall lineup, 
Audiences Unlimited has enlisted a busload of Marines from Camp Pendleton to 
fill the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I've never seen this show," said Lance Cpl. Matthew Landvatter. 
"But it sounded like a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoons pale in comparison to evenings, the sitcom's producers say. The 
actors treat the session as a dress rehearsal. There are differences in the 
crowd, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a tourist attraction in the afternoon," said John Peaslee, the 
executive producer. "In the evening, they come to see a show. They get the 
jokes faster." 
</P>
<P>
 It is up to the warm-up comic to inspire. He pleads. He offers $20 to whoever 
claps loudest. He glares at row after row of military men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you guys think this was 'Major Dad'?" "DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN" 
</P>
<P>
 This set, located at the public-owned Paramount Ranch, offers fresh air and no 
waiting in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful place to be able to work, in the unspoiled wilderness of the 
Santa Monica Mountains," Jane Seymour, the show's star, recently told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But catching a glimpse of the filming is a hit-and-miss proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures first opened the ranch in 1926, building a colonial Salem 
village, a historic San Francisco set and an old German village across 436 
acres. In 1952, the studio destroyed the sets and sold the property to a 
private owner who constructed a Western town for his own amusement. Producers 
soon returned to film television Westerns such as "The Cisco Kid" and "Bat 
Masterson" at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the National Park Service acquired the land, making it public 
property, but producers continued to come. CBS' "Dr. Quinn" uses both the 
Western town and several adjacent sound stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can watch, but only sometimes," explains Katherine Saunders, a 
spokeswoman for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. "It 
depends on whether they are filming indoors or outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 The park's visitor center keeps track of the production schedule but not which 
type of scenes will be filmed on a given day. When the action strays outdoors, 
onlookers can stand within earshot to watch both spoken scenes and horse 
riding. Rangers offer tips on the best vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 However, guards are on hand to keep visitors from getting too close and from 
taking pictures or asking for autographs. "GRACE UNDER FIRE" 
</P>
<P>
 Fans are not the only ones who crave interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 On the set of "Grace Under Fire," Butler says the studio audience's laughter 
amounts to a payoff after a week of rewrites and rehearsals. And laughter is 
not the only thing she listens for. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are the non-sounds, the times when we do something serious and you can 
hear a pin drop in here," she says. "As a comedienne, I never heard that." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors on this show commiserate with the audience between takes. Co-star 
Julie White, who plays Nadine, laments about a plumbing problem. She wants to 
know if there is a plumber in the crowd. Butler, like other sitcom actors who 
started in stand-up comedy, likes even closer contact. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why she wanders into the bleachers. She recalls a recent taping that 
came on the heels of a troubling story about her in a tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody asked me about it in a real nice way and I got to say something 
funny about it," she says. "I know this sounds corny . . . it just feels like 
some authentic way to bond." Valley Productions

SEASONS IN THE WIND; TEHACHAPI'S SPINNING TURBINES -- A MAJOR SOURCE OF 
ELECTRICITY -- ADD TO THE PICTURESQUE LANDSCAPE. AND THE WEATHER CHANGES, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA HOWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rebecca Howard is a frequent 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before you reach the fruit orchards of Tehachapi, you'll see groves of 
windmills along the Antelope Valley Freeway past Mojave, a testimony to the 
area's harvesting of a different energy source. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tehachapi-Mojave area is one of the world's largest producers of 
wind-generated electricity, and the hundreds of spinning turbines stand like 
sentries guarding the land where the desert meets the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Veering off the freeway and heading northwest on California 58, you'll notice 
the winds start to lose their burning edge during the 17-mile drive. The desert 
begins to fade away as the elevation rises. The land takes on a pastoral feel, 
with green mountains swelling up to relieve the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tehachapi is called "the land of four seasons," boasting snowy winters and 
mild summers. The 20-degree drop in temperature is reason enough to drive the 
100 miles north of the San Fernando Valley. Festivals, outdoor recreation and 
historical sites provide an alluring getaway as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny town of Tehachapi sits in the Tehachapi Mountains. It was founded 
when the railroad went through the pass between the San Joaquin Valley and the 
desert to the east. Railroad enthusiasts may want to check out the Tehachapi 
Loop, 10 miles north of the town. The loop was completed in 1876, allowing 
trains through the valley to cut over the Tehachapi Mountains. Take California 
58 to Woodford-Tehachapi Road and journey three miles to the Loop Viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first apple orchards were planted in the 1880s, the area also has 
been known for its cherries, pears, peaches, raspberries and squash. In 
addition, Tehachapi has been the site of the California Institute for Women, 
the 1952 Tehachapi earthquake and the Monolith-Portland Cement Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating harvest time, Tehachapi's October Applefest last weekend included 
an array of fresh apples, as well as apple pies, candied apples, apple crisp 
and other apple dishes, in addition to a plethora of arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 You can still get an autumn feel from the many orchards in the area -- and 
there are 1,200 acres of them -- devoted to fruit production. Local orchards 
offer a chance to pick your own apples, and some apple farms offer the chance 
to browse among baked goods, jellies, cider, crafts and other gifts. A guide to 
area orchards may be picked up at the Tehachapi Museum or from the local 
chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The town of Tehachapi during non-festival time is pleasantly sleepy, 
especially on a Sunday, when many shops are closed. In the downtown area along 
Tehachapi Boulevard, gift shops and antique stores offer relaxed browsing. 
</P>
<P>
 On a side street off Tehachapi Boulevard, you can renew or buy licenses to 
hunt deer, bear, dove, quail, chukar (an Asian and European partridge) or wild 
pig. You're not in the big city anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tehachapi Museum, 310 S. Green St., although small, houses an interesting 
array of items to illustrate the history of the area. These include a femur 
from a giant mammoth, tiny school desks from 1910, old photographs, a safe with 
its door blown off from a robbery, one of the first gasoline-powered tractors 
and the model of a hut used by Tehachapi's first residents, the Native American 
Kawaiisu tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cafes in this shopping district, such as Kelcy's Restaurant on 
Tehachapi Boulevard, provide a small-town atmosphere and home-style food. More 
healthful offerings may be found at Apple Jack's Yogurt Plaza Cafe.  
</P>
<P>
 If you'd like a more sophisticated lunch, Sky Mountain Lodge in Stallion 
Springs, about 16 miles northwest of Tehachapi, has a restaurant in a 
lodge-type setting with views of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sky Mountain Resort includes a golf course, horseback riding, biking and 
various hiking trails. The "Top of the World" hike is about three miles long 
and somewhat strenuous, but offers good views of the surrounding valleys.  
</P>
<P>
 Every August the town holds its annual Mountain Festival, featuring a parade, 
barbecue and food booths, an arts and crafts show in the city park, a rodeo, 
musicians, dances and a potentially world-record-setting cow-chip toss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tehachapi area offers a number of other outdoor recreation options. Brite 
Lake is open for fishing and camping from April through November. Tehachapi 
Mountain Park is a tree-filled area perfect for camping, picnicking or walking. 
</P>
<P>
 The winds harnessed by the wind turbines also serve recreational needs. For 
example, those interested in trying a sailplane can visit Fantasy Haven Airport 
to feel the free-flowing effects of a ride in one of the small aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closest feeling to riding in the sailplane is that of sailing," said one 
airport employee. For $30 to $70, you can spend from 10 to 30 minutes in the 
front of the sailplane, with an experienced sailplane operator in the seat 
behind you controlling the flight once the sailplane is released from the power 
plane that towed it.  
</P>
<P>
 And on a clear day, it may be the ideal way to get a good perspective of 
Tehachapi and beyond. Where to Go

FUN IS BREWING; AT HAMILTON GREGG, YOU MIX AND BOTTLE YOUR OWN BEER WHILE STAFF 
TAKES CARE OF CLEANUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the talk of body and aroma -- lofty terms that brew enthusiasts employ 
-- beer retains a rudimentary appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely your first alcohol of choice, a bicycle with training wheels that 
will carry you into the world of margaritas and martinis. It is the stuff you 
drink from the bottle, in large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer is fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the charm of Hamilton Gregg Brewworks, a refurbished storefront 
off the Strand in Hermosa Beach. This do-it-yourself brewery, a rarity in the 
United States, offers amateurs access to stainless-steel kettles, hydraulic 
bottlers and a temperature-controlled fermentation room -- equipment that 
smacks of gourmet beer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamilton Gregg avoids a highbrow ambience. Customers arrive in threes and 
fours, dressed casually for the sweet mugginess inside the place. They seem as 
eager to converse as to brew. And they tend to laugh rather than fuss while 
stirring the malty wort with long wooden paddles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come to have a good time with your friends," said Richard Wong of 
Lakewood, watching over a nascent batch of Halloween pumpkin-flavored brew. 
</P>
<P>
 His compatriot, Steve Siedentop, explained: "This is a party place." 
</P>
<P>
 The brewery charges $100 or more for such frivolity. For that price, it 
provides both guidance and a choice of 45 recipes ranging from common American 
lagers to more expensive porters and ales. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton Gregg opened in July, 1993, the creation of three partners inspired 
by the popularity of "U-Brew-Its" in Canada. Since then, customers have cooked 
up some 2,500 kettles, or almost 37,000 six-packs, on the premises. That 
amounts to a lot of partying -- and a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two hours of measuring, pouring and stirring go into each 8 
1/2-gallon batch. Brewers return after two weeks to fill and label their 48 
22-ounce bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton Gregg's owners try to make such tasks enjoyable. They want to attract 
more than just home-brew fanatics. So they have designed the 1,500-square-foot 
brewery like a nightclub, sleek and industrial, with brick walls and rock music 
playing from stereo speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also emphasized a hands-on experience, promising customers a chance 
to scoop grain, turn steam valves and operate noisy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like playing in your father's workshop," says Patricia Spiritus, an aptly 
named co-owner. "You can play with all the toys. You can make a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, men comprise the majority of customers. On a weeknight, 
three women look out of place bottling their beer. Larissa Funtas explains that 
she and her friends first stumbled in on a Friday evening, mistaking the 
brewery for a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were, like, why isn't anyone in here?" she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the notion of brewing appealed to them. They chose a recipe for a wheat 
beer with a hint of raspberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like we're back in home economics class," Funtas says. 
</P>
<P>
 It can also feel daunting to a beginner, what with all the kettles and kegs, 
the scales and metal bowls. But Brian Wright and Ryan Aikens, two of the 
brewery's seven employees, specialize in nudging first-timers through the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you like beer?" Brian asks. Receiving an affirmative reply, he smiles. 
"Then I like you." 
</P>
<P>
 The first step involves selecting a recipe. Most have been copied from 
well-known beers. Others were devised through the staff's tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 With a decision made, the necessary grains are measured out. Hamilton Gregg's 
recipe for Oktoberfest beer includes a type of hops known as Hallertau, which 
sounds like an unfortunate physical condition. But it tastes harmless: 
Customers are encouraged to sample, whether it be a dry grain pellet or the 
brown brewer's concentrate, a syrupy mixture of barley and water that has gone 
through the mashing process. 
</P>
<P>
 These ingredients are poured at varying intervals into a steamy mix -- the 
wort -- and stirred. At the same time, customers swig from recent batches or 
store-bought beer they have brought along. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tough part is staying sober," says Mike Davy, who visits regularly with a 
friend, Lester Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men tried home brewing but disliked the mess. At Hamilton Gregg, 
employees clean up so customers are free to joke and to drink. Davy and 
Davidson have brought crackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To clear the palate," Davidson explains. 
</P>
<P>
 In and around the conversation, not to mention the quaffing, the wort is 
prepared. Brewer's yeast is added and the batch is poured into a plastic vessel 
for fermentation and aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend holds that the Egyptian god Osiris first taught humans to brew. His was 
a myth of treachery, fratricide and dismemberment, activities which may or may 
not be readily associated with beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiritus offers more cogent trivia. The term "ale," she explains, is linked to 
the word "bridal" and derives from the English tradition of toasting the bride 
with beer. The wooden paddle used to stir the wort is called a "rouser" after 
the term "rabble rouser." 
</P>
<P>
 Romance and fighting seem entirely appropriate. This much becomes evident in 
the labels that customers design for their concoctions. 
</P>
<P>
 When Spiritus opened the brewery with Anthony Gregg and John Hamilton Scudder, 
they offered customers the use of a personal computer to produce 
black-and-white labels. They doubted many would bother. 
</P>
<P>
 But customers go to the opposite extreme, often hiring a printer to create 
intricate color logos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are poetic," says Scudder, an heir to the Laura Scudder's potato chip 
empire. "Some are profane." 
</P>
<P>
 Most include pictures of -- or references to -- naked bodies, weddings and / 
or weaponry. These creations are plastered across the walls of the bottling 
room. When customers return after two weeks, they glue these labels to the 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottling is a time of celebration. Most customers savor the fruits of their 
efforts. Some are veterans and have tinkered with the established recipe, 
adding fruit or chili peppers. Others have brewed the equivalent of Michelob. 
</P>
<P>
 For Siedentop and his friends, taste had little to do with the recipe they 
chose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went for the highest alcohol content," Siedentop says. 
</P>
<P>
 A compatriot, Ann Voorhies, explains: "You come here because you're an avid 
beer drinker. That's the fun." Where and When

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MAKING A BIG IMPRESSION; SISLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
PAINTER ALFRED. IT'S A NEW ITALIAN TRATTORIA THAT SERVES GOOD FOOD IN HUGE 
PORTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Max Jacobson review restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life! 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I cruised up the Golden State Freeway in the general direction of Magic 
Mountain, I couldn't help wondering why Sisley, a smart new Italian trattoria 
perched on the edge of Valencia Town Center, had been named for the well-known 
Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley. During dinner, it was explained to me that 
the name is actually a cute corruption of Sicily. Ahem. I'm putting in for the 
Forrest Gump Fellowship in Deductive Reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you already knew better. New Yorkers Francine and Jamie Alba have 
another Sisley in the Westside Pavilion, and the name is close to becoming a 
household word around Los Angeles. (The proper name for this place is Sisley 
Italian Kitchen, but the words "Italian Kitchen" are in small letters on both 
the sign and menu, so everyone refers to the restaurant as Sisley.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening and on weekends, count on this enormous, high-ceilinged 
restaurant to be a madhouse. One Saturday evening, hungry mall shoppers were 
signing up with gusto for a 45-minute wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula? Snappy decor has a lot to do with it: exposed black ducts, Tuscan 
colors like rust and beige, designer fabrics, blond wood. Squiggly wrought-iron 
light fixtures hang down over the tables like snakes of mystical import. A 
sharply attractive semi-circular copper bar provides a perfect vantage point 
from which to view chefs in the open kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decor wouldn't be enough without a well-conceived menu of Italian 
standbys, generously served -- and that glass deli case showcasing several 
terrific desserts by the front entrance. Sisley's Gargantuan menu is abundant 
in every course, from antipasto to dessert. I recommend that you nibble, rather 
than nosh, on the sweet, yeasty baked rolls the waiters bring soon after you 
sit down, because no one leaves this place hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fine appetizers are a light, Japanese-inspired tuna tartare (perfectly 
flavored with olive oil, coarse salt and green onion) and expertly blackened 
grilled vegetables -- razor-thin slices of eggplant, slightly bitter radicchio, 
mildly caramelized onion, broccoli, mushrooms, tomato and zucchini -- all on 
one glorious platter. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu lists 18 pizzas, but the kitchen will make just about any topping you 
can dream up, as long as they have the ingredients. One featured category is 
large, thin-crusted pizzas, the lead item from that list being bacon, potato 
and egg, which I rate a noble miss. When I've had pizzas made from these same 
ingredients in Italy, the crust was cracker-thin and the potatoes sliced 
ultra-thin. This crust is too thick to make these toppings work, and the potato 
isn't quite crisp enough to make you forget how much starch you are eating. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, the restaurant sells lots of salads. The Gorgonzola salad, for 
instance, is above reproach, a pungent mixture of romaine, mushrooms, sliced 
onions and juicy Roma tomatoes, tossed with a handful of walnuts and the right 
amount of crumbled Gorgonzola. 
</P>
<P>
 It sells even more panini (Italian sandwiches), and you can't argue with a 
sandwich when it employs one of the best homemade rolls anywhere -- a giant, 
golden, sesame-topped dome that is soft and yielding in the center. Good 
fillings like Papa John's (light, flavorful meatballs) or smoked salmon (with 
fresh dill and cream cheese) end up playing second fiddle to this bread, which 
soaks up marinara sauce with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastas are chewy, saucy versions that would make an Italian mutter 
something about excess (they come in big bowls). My friends fancy the chicken 
and goat cheese linguine, a typically excessive dish. Personally, I think olive 
oil, garlic and maybe a little tomato is all that good linguine needs, and that 
throwing in sun-dried tomatoes, big chunks of chicken and dollops of soft goat 
cheese is overkill.  
</P>
<P>
 The other pastas are in the same spirit. Hearty New York-style sausage 
ravioli. Linguine carbonara with out-sized hunks of pancetta. The inevitable 
pasta al pesto , the sauce rich and grainy with chopped basil. Bow-tie pasta in 
a white wine sauce dosed with Dijon mustard. An overloaded primavera saved by a 
delicious white wine sauce and a pile of deftly prepared penne . 
</P>
<P>
 Fish are well-prepared -- orange roughy broiled with a delicate crumb crust 
and served with a frothy red pepper coulis, halibut cooled with a lime cilantro 
dressing. Roast chicken is also dependable, properly blackened and 
crackling-crisp on the skin side. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts you spotted in the glass case are all big hits. Our waiter was 
quick to mention that Bon Appetit magazine had just voted the tiramisu the best 
in Los Angeles. Me, I'm going for some of these wonderful biscotti , some lemon 
meringue cake or a rich slice of chocolate pecan pie. Where and When

COUPLE PLEDGE $500,000 TO CIVIC ARTS PLAZA; DONATION: GIFT IS THIRD LARGEST TO 
ENDOWMENT FUND FOR THE CENTER, WHICH WILL OPEN OCT. 21. IT PUTS THE FUND ABOUT 
$1 MILLION AWAY FROM SPRING GOAL. 
</P>

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks auto dealer announced Thursday that he is pledging $500,000 to 
the Civic Arts Plaza, the second major private donation to the complex in 
little over a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift from longtime Conejo Valley resident Gary Nesen and his wife Karla is 
the third largest gift to date to the endowment fund for the $64-million arts 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of the donation to the Alliance for the Arts, the reflecting 
pool outside the plaza's Charles Probst Performing Arts Center will be named 
for the Nesens. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst announced last week that he will give $2 million to the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Arts officials praised the Nesens' gift, saying they are elated to edge even 
closer to the $10 million they had hoped to raise by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nesens' gift brings the total raised for the alliance to about $9 million, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful that Karla and Gary decided to make this donation," 
said Richard Johnson, campaign director for the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nesens have already been very involved in our efforts leading up to the 
grand opening," he said. "This contribution just adds to that involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 pledge will include cash and other gifts to the center that will 
be announced later, according to John Mooers, the Nesens' spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Nesens also agreed to sponsor a series of events for the plaza, including 
fund-raisers, special concerts and sales promotions in conjunction with Gary 
Nesen's Thousand Oaks car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooers said the Nesens timed the announcement to help build public confidence 
in the plaza as the Oct. 21 grand opening draws near. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to draw more attention to the fact that this center, which 
everyone has been waiting for, is now about to be reality," Mooers said. "The 
success of the plaza is something the Nesens have been committed to for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Nesen could not be reached for comment Thursday, but he said in a 
prepared statement that he hoped to give back to the community where he grew 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our love for the arts and our community has prompted this involvement," he 
said. "Everyone in the Conejo Valley can be proud of this state-of-the-art 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Nesen is the son of Ambassador Robert Nesen, who moved to Ventura County in 
1947. In 1986, Gary Nesen became president of the Thousand Oaks car dealership 
that his father started in Oxnard and built to prominence in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a member of the arts plaza's Founder's Circle, which had raised more 
than $8.6 million before Thursday's announcement, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since fund-raising began, major gifts to the plaza have included Probst, $2 
million in cash; the Los Angeles Times, $1 million in cash and advertising; 
Gary and Karla Nesen, $500,000 in cash and gifts, and the Janss family, 
$270,000 in cash, according to the alliance.

THE SCENE / ORANGE COUNTY: POETIC JUSTICE; YOUNG WRITERS SHARE WITH THEIR 
PENSIVE PEERS A DEDICATION TO THE CRAFT AND A MATURITY THAT COMES OF EXAMINING 
ISSUES AND EXPRESSING FEELINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Manuel Schwab fumbles with a Camel cigarette before tucking it behind his 
right ear. His waist-long hair is tied into a ponytail, away from a face that 
resembles those of artists who talk expressively over smokes and espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel, however, is not like those artists. He might share their affection for 
nicotine and caffeine. He might tell a fellow poet that if this woman from the 
L.A. Times wants to interview him, she can walk over to him. But Manuel turns 
out to be one of those few people without an attitude, unpretentious almost to 
a fault.  
</P>
<P>
 Like not mentioning that he spent two weeks touring with Lollapalooza, reading 
his poetry to concert-goers in six cities. (That was offered up by a poet 
acquaintance who saw him at the show at Cal State Dominguez Hills.) Or that he 
took the prize at the poetry slam -- a nonstop competitive run of spoken word 
-- held that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even finding out that he was commissioned to write a piece on Los Angeles for 
a Propaganda Films production directed by David Lynch turns up only in a chance 
conversation a day after the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did I realize that I was already familiar with Manuel's work. The latest 
tango at the Kuwaiti border reminded me of an anthology of regional poets 
published during the conflict three years ago. In "Journal of the Gulf War: 
Poetry from Home" (Poets Reading Inc., 1991), one writer penned two lines that 
caught my attention: 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 A dry-cleaned american flag  
</P>
<P>
 waves in the exhaust of a porsche.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, it was this Manuel who wrote these lines. He was 13 at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 16, the sophomore at University High in Irvine has collected a number of 
accolades in his short career as a poet. But to Manuel that is less significant 
than his devotion to writing, as well as the drive shared by other poets in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 These young bards walk the halls or find a quiet spot during lunch armed with 
worn spiral notebooks filled with tiny writing, maybe doodles in the margins 
and folded loose sheets of laser-printed material stuck within. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the more dedicated ones tend to speak articulately, revealing their 
love for words beyond common adolescent favorites such as "like, uh" or "you 
know." And they reveal a maturity beyond their age, no doubt from having 
thought through issues and feelings that most of their peers either don't face 
or prefer to blow off.  
</P>
<P>
 It's usually around freshman year that the poetry begins. It's then that 
anxieties and frustrations seem to develop overnight and amplify with each 
semester. Most poets, however, stay in the closet, reluctant to share their 
notebooks with friends or family. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only would it mean exposing their secrets. It would open them up to 
possible literary criticism that, for some, is secondary to the exercise in 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many people write in high school," observes Manuel, "but they keep it 
to themselves, which I think is fine if that's what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Father turned transparent red with turbid rage because he had just dropped 16 
years of impromptu breeding, of introverted runts becoming radiant in his eyes, 
of bringing up a son.  
</P>
<P>
 (from Manuel's recent "Atheism Was Inherent at My Birth and I Deny the 
Existence of God with Reckless Passion") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel's experience is unusual among his peers, partly due to parents who have 
supported his interest by taking him to readings and offering guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother is a professor of comparative literature at UCI, and his stepfather 
teaches English at Loyola Marymount. But Manuel considers the two years he 
attended the UCI Farm School, a private elementary school on the university 
campus, as the point he realized poetry. At age 10 he was introduced to Jack 
Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and the other beats and assigned to write his first 
poem for a school show. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed with his first public reading on his 12th birthday at the Laguna 
Art Museum. A year later, he published his first work, "Yellow Bliss," in the 
anthology. Since then, his works have appeared in poetry magazines such as 
Caffeine and Dance of the Iguana put out by the Iguana Cafe, a poetry haunt in 
Los Angeles where he will read on Nov. 27. He also tried his reporting hand 
with an article on Lollapalooza in Next magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry, says Manuel, "is a much more concise way for me to get something 
across. It's a form that I can combine quickly different senses, experiences, 
emotions into one unified piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing in general is vital to my mental and spiritual health."  
</P>
<P>
 Already, notes Manuel affectionately, his 5-year-old brother, Leon, is 
discovering poetry by accompanying him to open readings. "He's getting a lot of 
the flavor," he says. "After a reading he gets a book and says 'I'm going to do 
poetry now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Doing poetry now for Manuel includes his friend Dave Youssef, 16, on acoustic 
guitar. Also a University High sophomore, Dave joined Manuel on a reading he 
did for a KUCI radio show two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "I play a progression and just mess around from there as it applies to the 
words," Dave explains. Their practice is limited to the day of a reading. Any 
more would take away from the spontaneity of the creative mood.  
</P>
<P>
 Other friends in their circle jam with them instrumentally or in other 
creative ways. Weekend nights are spent at the local nature conservancy, 
coffeehouse or someone's home. "When it's in the air the urge to express is 
contagious, I guess," Dave says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contagious? Maybe among those prone to creativity, but sometimes it's tough to 
find those people, notes Mission Viejo sophomore Beth McIlvaine. She caught up 
with Manuel at Lollapalooza and considers him an inspiration because of 
everything he's achieved in his young life. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth consumed every minute of the two-day "Writings on the Wall" spoken word 
fest last weekend at the Lab in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here is a poet; they're on the same vibe. I don't feel isolated 
with them. Before, I accepted (the idea that) I'd never fit in. Now I've found 
a new world where I can make friends. It's really strange to have people to 
talk to who can relate to what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old turned to poetry in eighth grade during a period marred by 
family deaths and other personal tragedies. "I had a lot of repressed emotions, 
pain. I needed to write about my isolation and loneliness. I just slammed down 
on the floor one day and thought 'I'm either going to kill myself or I better 
start writing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 in this atmosphere i feel almost at home but not quite * 
</P>
<P>
 Because she discovered rock 'n' roll at the same time, she initially wrote 
what were essentially song lyrics. Eventually it evolved more into poetry form, 
she says. There's still a hint of music to her writing, especially while 
performing, which she did for the first time to a crowd this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get up there to do it was like being born again," says Beth, bringing 
together her fingers with the chipped black nail lacquer. "I get up there, and 
any fears just wash away when I grab the mike. A few days ago I felt like I had 
this inspiration, but I didn't know where to go with it. Now I feel I know 
where to take it; I have defined goals. I feel kind of older in a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Her poems still explore a darker side, as well as hopes for a another world. 
Coupled with her head-to-toe black wardrobe, she personifies the assumed image 
of a troubled kid. But Beth cautions that it's not escapism she's after. "After 
a poem is done, it's done. I've worked it out in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, except for reworking the poem itself. She reviews her writing 
incessantly. "I'm always going back to my poems and putting words that would 
work better. If I just let it sit, I feel it will just get worse with time, 
until it deteriorates.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she admits, "sometimes there's a finality to it, and I say it's 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 . . . someone had better feed my head,  
</P>
<P>
 my mind is eating itself.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetry builds your mind," says Beth's friend Rhiannon Erbach, a Mission Viejo 
High sophomore who recently authored the above coda to an unnamed poem. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old has long kept a journal and dabbled in poetry. But since 
moving from New Jersey last year with her mother, stepfather and two toddler 
half-sisters, Rhiannon has been replacing her journal entries with poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more interesting to write poetry than write down events. You can 
get across your point much more powerfully in less words." 
</P>
<P>
 At first it took discipline to write every day. But writing, she says, has 
"become almost addictive. It's easier for me to express myself this way instead 
of having to (verbally) explain things. Since moving out here, my life's more 
active; my thought patterns have changed, I have more to write about now. But I 
think it's because of my age." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the themes Rhiannon confronts are the negative influences and effects 
usually associated with growing up. "Some people read my writing and think I'm 
totally crazy," she says. "I'm not a really sad person all the time. It's just 
easier to write about the pain and confusion. Confusion doesn't always have to 
be considered sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Laying out her inner thoughts in poetry enables her to sort matters out and 
release the pressure, she says.  
</P>
<P>
 And she admits to slightly exaggerating at times for dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'll live with my conclusion  
</P>
<P>
 with the cynicism I've been taught,  
</P>
<P>
 I'll swim in disillusion.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at the Lab event, she performed a poem for the first time in front of 
strangers, and in front of her family. The typed paper she held quivered in her 
hands. At first, her voice was barely audible over the sound system. But after 
but a few lines, her confidence emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience, to say the least, enthralled her. When Mom decided it was time 
to leave -- an hour before the day's poetry slam -- Rhiannon was distraught. 
She had seen her first slam at Lollapalooza and "it was intense," she 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen people perform with such energy." 
</P>
<P>
 School has been less than helpful in this area, says Rhiannon, who also 
contributes to her school newspaper. Although there is a campus poetry club she 
recently visited, she wishes the same emphasis would be placed on the arts as 
is on athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "At our high school the focus is completely on sports, and people like us 
become outcasts. Schools should focus more money and energy on being creative 
instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that that has deterred her, especially after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole week I've started thinking about writing more and preparing myself 
for public presentation. Letting others see your poetry is really personal and 
scary. You don't want to be rejected." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she adds: "I think I'm going to learn to type better so I could send 
stuff to magazines."

BEHIND THE WHEEL: JIMMY'S BACK -- BOLDER AND BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a new visitor on Rodeo Drive, outside Morton's, on the northbound 405, 
and in other areas of urban wilderness where four-wheel-drive vehicles are more 
popular than cowboy boots and about as appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the 1995 GMC Jimmy, a vastly improved brush-crusher with sufficient style 
and pugnacity to cause nervous twitches among the reigning monopolists: Jeep's 
Grand Cherokee and the Ford Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 When introduced in 1983, Jimmy was a pioneer of off-roading in town and could 
easily have been a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 It spit squarely in the eye of station wagons and performed splendidly; 
wallowing through country muck and chugging through suburbs beneath large loads 
of lumber and big families with Labradors. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't grow with the decade. Or defend itself against minivans. It 
remained a sport-utility more utilitarian than sporty. Even the 1994 model was 
a square tower with relatively small windows, a drunken gait and small, 
mispositioned, unlighted power-window controls that disappeared into the door 
once the sun went down. 
</P>
<P>
 And while customers asked for more conveniences in friendlier vehicles, Jimmy 
and its Chevy Blazer clone continued to roar and roll, drink gas like it was 
Gatorade, plod wherever they went and deemed air bags were for sissies. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Cherokee and Explorer took the smoother road, leaving GMC to blink in 
the dust behind a battalion of nicely sculpted Troopers, Trackers, Rodeos and 
4-Runners with picture windows. Even haughty Land Rover, with sales no larger 
than any other fashion of Brentwood and the Hamptons, got close enough to sniff 
Jimmy's spoor. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, GMC has seen the flaws, sorted through the whining and attacked 
the known. 
</P>
<P>
 So for 1995, Jimmy's engineering has been improved by borrowing from GMC's 
better selling, more refined Sonoma compact pickups. Occupants have been given 
priority equal to purpose, which means an expanded interior, better insulation 
to dampen mechanical gnashing, larger windows and a stiffer frame for more 
educated handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Handling. It's the bane of all sport utilities as manufacturers attempt to 
offer some middle ground for suspension setups. They typically fail. 
</P>
<P>
 For a soft, long-traveling, large-leaved suspension works well over hummocks 
and gumbo, but in town requires map pockets with barf bags. Tamer tires and 
taut shocks are great for interstates, but will whack frames and crack crowns 
when the going gets rural. 
</P>
<P>
 So GMC lets owners do the choosing. Whether buying a two- or four-door Jimmy, 
two- or four-wheel-drive, buyers can pick from four suspension packages -- 
base, off-road, Euro-ride or luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one engine. But it's last year's optional power plant -- a 
hard-pulling 200-horsepower V-6 that is larger than engines in Explorer or 
Grand Cherokee and only 20 ponies shy of Cherokee's optional V-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices also wrestle favorably with the competition; the sticker stretch is 
from $18,274 for the 2WD, two-door Jimmy SL to $22,205 for the 4WD, four-door 
Jimmy SLT with a seven-inch-longer wheelbase. 
</P>
<P>
 And our snooty SLT tester -- a glossy candy apple with a steel gray skirt and 
smoked glass adding mystery to whatever might be going on inside during rainy 
commutes -- barely topped $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That cleanly undercuts the Limited editions of Ford Explorer and Grand 
Cherokee. And the SLT arrives with a similar load of primary luxuries, 
including leather bucket seats that fit better than dentist chairs but with 
less pain, overhead console for garage-door remote and goggles, a compass for 
anyone venturing past Ventura, two additional 12-volt power outlets for your 
Champion blender and baby-bottle warmer, push-button 4WD shifting on the fly -- 
everything, in fact, but winches and a complimentary Winchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are standard. So is a driver's-side air bag. The 
spare wheel is now tucked under the vehicle instead of being wedged inside the 
cargo bay or bolted to the rear door. This Jimmy is longer, wider, and 
thankfully lower for entrances and exits that don't require stopping alongside 
a big rock. 
</P>
<P>
 It also comes with a brand-new measurement of cargo capacity. Sheets of 
plywood are out. So are nursing elephants. The roomy Jimmy with 36.8 cubic feet 
of interior space, GMC says, is large enough to swallow a Sears Kenmore washing 
machine. Still in the box. 
</P>
<P>
 We have no idea how much Sears paid for being plugged in at least 3.6 million 
press releases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jimmy has the square, purposeful looks of all sport utilities but with the 
flush, curved glass and smooth, rounded contours essential for snaring today's 
suburban buyers. Bumpers are integrated, headlights are wraparound, and these 
cast alloy wheels were made for stomping. With absolutely nothing to be ashamed 
of, GMC's bold, bright, distinctly oversized lettering remains dead center on 
the grille. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior easily fits five adults with no crushed shoulder pads. There's 
room to stretch, space to look around, enough cubbies for a month's motoring 
litter, and cup holders to grab everything from a single cappuccino decaf to a 
half-liter of Evian. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What it all represents is a full court press by GMC to scrape out a berth in a 
popular, expanding market involving those who like security and muscle with 
their motoring. Finesse is where the vehicle falls a little short. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft, luxury suspension still gives the fractionally top-heavy Jimmy an 
opportunity to wander in freeway lanes. Steering has been tightened 
considerably from earlier models, but its bias is still toward the floppy. 
</P>
<P>
 Push buttons for shifting into 4WD on the fly have little discernible movement 
and feel almost non-functioning. Press hard to make sure something is happening 
and their surrounding dashboard plastic flexes inward. 
</P>
<P>
 But all things considered, as a satisfying meld of price, performance, comfort 
and purpose, the Jimmy is back among the contenders 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy? Maybe this second generation is sophisticated enough to be renamed the 
GMC James.

 It's Gary Norman who answers the phone, explaining: "My brother's on the floor 
picking up lint." 
</P>
<P>
 Lint ? 
</P>
<P>
 Lint. The brothers Norman -- Gary and Michael -- are the T-shirt titans of 
West Hollywood, a merrily irreverent duo who immortalize Angelenos' politically 
correct and incorrect thoughts on pre-shrunk 100% cotton.

<P>
 Good taste is not an issue, Michael says, "because we have no taste." As the 
Wizard, he's been turning out custom Ts for 27 years. You say it, they'll print 
it -- on shirts, bats, sponges, rolling pins. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't ask for Snoopy or that perky mouse (copyright laws). And they won't 
print anything blatantly racist or truly mean-spirited. (It was "no" to someone 
wanting Nazi flags on Ts). 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise -- well, this is Hollywood. Where an aspiring screenwriter may send 
a producer a script wrapped in a T-shirt hyping his masterpiece. Where a job 
resume may arrive on a T. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael likes to tell about the time a studio ordered a T-shirt printed all 
over with dirt. It seems a very big star wouldn't wear a truly dirty shirt for 
a fight scene. "We took a shirt outside and ran over it a few times with a 
car," Michael recalls, before popping it into the laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, artist Richard Cronin was picking up a handful of 
shirts with which he hopes to woo backers for his self-published book, "How to 
Tap Into Your Unlimited Self." His design: An androgynous black-and-white 
figure, arms outstretched to the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
 John Gowans of Van Nuys, a member of the American Mt. Everest Expedition, came 
by to pick up 3,000 shirts with which the team hopes to help fund its 1995 
climb. The design, a whimsical landscape of snow-capped Everest and a Tibetan 
village, is by a Sherpa guide. The slogan: "Because It Is There!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eclectic hardly describes the Wizard's clientele. Says Michael: "We're a 
neighborhood mom-and-pop shop. It's just that our customers aren't Mom and 
Pop." They include top-rated TV shows, blockbuster movies and chart-topping 
rock groups. 
</P>
<P>
 And bears. A publicist once ordered a customized shirt for a trained bear 
featured in a movie; the bear was going to the Cannes Film Festival. No 
problem, said the Normans, who ordered an XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-Large shirt from 
a supplier in (where else?) Texas. Within seconds of lumbering off a cargo 
plane in France, it was reported, the bear ripped off the shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case another bear came along, the Normans stocked several mega-shirts 
and hung one outside. "Some Arabic sheik came along and bought it," says 
Michael, a bit bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
 As he talks, Michael is at the Mac, playing around with a slogan about Judge 
Lance Ito and his feud with the media. (No orders -- yet). 
</P>
<P>
 He's recalling the time the Wizard silk-screened salad plates with the 
likeness of a big TV deal-maker for a big deal dinner. Everyone was happy -- 
until the vinegar and oil salad dressing dissolved the silk screening. "When 
they got to the bottom, there was this pool of black ink." 
</P>
<P>
 He boasts cheerily: "We've ruined one of everything." They've turned fabric to 
soup, shipped blank shirts. "If it's misspelled, I probably made it," Gary 
says. He did a job for a constuction company and, Michael adds, "We also did 
stuff for the mayor of Palm Spings ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans did not set out to be T-shirt makers. Michael wanted to be a 
psychologist. (A part-time counselor, he's been working on his doctorate for 
20-plus years.) 
</P>
<P>
 But, early on, life interfered and, to survive, he opened a plant shop, the 
Wizard of Plants. Custom iron-ons were a little sideline -- until the day a gas 
leak killed the plants. "So we were in the T-shirt business." 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined a few years later by Gary, who for a while was a professional 
handicapper billed on cable TV as "Galloping Gary Norman." 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to know what people , what they'd rather be doing, or what 
their other car is, the brothers will help you tell the world.

 Maybe you've seen these shirts?

 Whether shtick or statement, the T is often the gift of choice for those who 
already have cashmere. Peter Lawford used to pick up funny shirts on his way to 
Kennedy clan parties. When Sammy Davis Jr. was terminally ill, friends had a 
robe printed with their get-well wishes.

 A couple of big sellers from the past may be in for a rerun. There was the 
Saddam Hussein dartboard. And the Official Iraqi Army Surrender Shirt. White, 
so the wearer could rip it off and wave it. Some Things About Bowling Never 
Change 
</P>
<P>
 I can't explain what cosmic force drew me to Tarzana for last weekend's gala 
reopening of quake-devastated Corbin Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 On the excitement scale, I put bowling right up there with that Olympics thing 
where they ski forever, stopping now and then to shoot at things. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I haven't bowled since it was done in something called an alley. Now, it 
seems, alleys are "centers." And scores are kept by computer, not paper, pencil 
and projector. 
</P>
<P>
 New technology, old image: "People seem to think that the only people who bowl 
are the Archie Bunker crowd," said Sheldon Krechman, chairman of Recreation 
World (the Ice Chalet people, and Corbin Bowl's new owners). 
</P>
<P>
 Krechman, having taken time out to hurl a strike, asked: "Did you know that 35 
million people bowl in this country?" 
</P>
<P>
 In lane one, wearing bowling shoes and a yarmulke, was Moshe Cohen, the 
Irish-born rabbi of a West L.A. Jewish outreach group, with his wife, Judith, 
and four children -- first-time bowlers, all. 
</P>
<P>
 In lane three were Jim Altman, a marine parts salesman from Tarzana -- and a 
pre-quake regular here -- and Debbie and Gary Scholz. One lane over, Ingrid 
Altman was keeping an eye on the gigglers -- daughter Alison and a gaggle of 
friends celebrating her ninth birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking her score, Debbie Scholz groaned. "Fifty-four. The year I was born." 
But: "This is just fun, clean fun." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Jim Altman explained above the thud of ball on wood and the 
unrelenting clattering of pins, "It's the only sport where they bring you food 
and booze while you're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, you get drinks by pushing D on a computer. Hurl a strike and the 
screen flashes a big red X for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Balls are color-coded by weight -- pink, purple, blue, green, orange. And, get 
this, some lanes have rubber bumpers that keep the ball out of the gutter. (Not 
considered sporting for adults.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some things never change. Bowlers smoke. Bowlers drink beer. (Bud 
regular, mostly.) Bowlers even wear plaid Bermuda shorts.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; CRASH COURSE IN REALITY; WHEN SIX CAPISTRANO 
VALLEY STUDENTS WERE IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT TUESDAY, DRIVING BECAME THE HOT TOPIC 
ON CAMPUS. BUT OPINION IS SPLIT ON WHETHER THE HARSH LESSON WILL GET THROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSLIN GEMSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Joslin Gemsch is a senior at Capistrano 
Valley High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The news arrived as a telephone call Tuesday morning to the principal's office 
at Capistrano Valley High in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Six students had been inside a car that apparently was speeding to school that 
morning when it tumbled out of control and crashed. Parents, students and 
teachers heading to school passed the gruesome wreckage, many fearing that no 
one could have survived it. 
</P>
<P>
 All the students did survive, some just barely, but the shock of the sight and 
the revival of long-held fears have made driving the No. 1 topic on this 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical education teacher Don Cholodenka remembered the week before when he 
called roll. Someone was absent, and a student cracked, "Well, he's dead." Not 
funny, Cholodenka told his class. "I really got on them, because I have lost 
many students to car accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Now this. Wednesday's class, with one of its own at home nursing injuries, was 
quiet and saddened, Cholodenka said. "I think they finally realized it could 
happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Principal Jessica Gorman had been trying to achieve when two years 
ago she brought a mangled car on campus for a drama to be played before the 
school's 2,800 students, complete with blood-soaked, teen-age victims, panicked 
parents and grim paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to re-enact an accident as realistically as possible," she said. "I 
think it really impacted the students. They were just really quiet during this 
whole hourlong theatrical." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Gorman said, maybe it's time to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes an accident like this to really hit home and for everyone to realize 
what can happen when you don't take driving seriously," said Ryan Hawkins, 
student body president at Capistrano Valley High. "I think people may drive 
safer now. In my group it seems like it hit home. I think they're going to 
watch what they're doing. A few of my friends got speeding tickets. They say 
they're going to slow down and everything, but I don't know what it'll take to 
get through to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins tried. Wednesday, a day after the accident, he was on the classroom 
public address system urging students to be more careful, to use safety belts 
and to leave home a little earlier so there would be no need to rush for the 
first bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried not to sound too much like a commercial. The principal and I thought 
it would hit home better if a student would give this message." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, a senior, said most students his age have driver's licenses and use 
of a car, so they do their own driving. But younger students must depend on 
parents and friends for a lift, especially if after-school activities keep them 
past the time school buses depart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the kids worry as much as the parents about who's driving 
them," Hawkins said. "I remember when I was a freshman, getting rides home with 
kids on my soccer team. Mom always worried who was driving me. Kids are just 
concerned with getting a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lindy Broberg, a senior, considers herself one of the exceptions, but she 
admits it may be because of the onslaught of warnings she has received at home. 
Her father has warned her about the dangers of driving, and her older brothers, 
both paramedics, have filled her with horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always heard the stories," she said. "One night my brother came home 
covered in blood from this accident. I mean, that's not for me." 
</P>
<P>
 She avoids riding with other teen drivers if she can do the driving herself, 
she said. "Then I feel like I'm in control. A lot of my friends, they're not 
the best drivers. I've almost gotten into a couple accidents with my friends. 
We didn't, but we came close." 
</P>
<P>
 Only once has she refused to get into a friend's car, she said. He had drunk 
one beer, and to be on the safe side she begged off and called her mother for a 
lift home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a feeling I'm going to be in an accident -- a bad one -- ever 
since I've gotten my license. I had a couple chances to get a car last year, 
but it didn't have an air bag, and I told my parents to forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Broberg now has her own car, willingly provided by Mom and Dad. Her father, 
Richard Broberg, says he believes she is safer because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the kids think they're immortal, that nothing's going to 
happen to them. One of Lindy's friends has a reputation for driving fast. It 
did bother me when she rode with her, but what can you do? They have things 
they have to do. That's pretty much why we provided the kids with cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion about whether the spectacular crash will change any driving habits is 
divided among students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking about it in my government class, and a lot of people were 
talking like it didn't bother them," said Lindy Broberg. "But I saw it -- I 
drove by it -- and I couldn't get over it. It could have been me." 
</P>
<P>
 The shock of the crash "has made me very aware and more cautious," said Alicia 
Lopez, a sophomore. Her brother died in a car accident. He wasn't wearing his 
seat belt, so seat belts have become a family cause. "I always wear a seat 
belt, and I yell at people who don't," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Weyler, a sophomore, said the crash has made her vow never to go without 
seat belts again. She had never thought about being in a traffic accident 
before, "but this made me think it could happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Norman Ruiz, a freshman, said the crash did not frighten him. "I don't 
think it will ever happen to me. If I drive, I'll be driving carefully. I won't 
get that many people in my car, and if I have to, I'll make them wear their 
seat belts." 
</P>
<P>
 Those kids who drive recklessly probably will not change, Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them, they'll just keep doing it. They just, like, keep driving 
fast." 
</P>

TECHNOWATCH: TODAY'S SPECIAL: A PIZZA-SIZE TV SATELLITE WITH THE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's here at last -- a satellite dish no bigger than a large pizza. RCA's 
Digital Satellite System, with its 18-inch dish, is available nationwide this 
month, offering TV viewers a nifty alternative to a big, ugly disk that takes 
up half the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The DSS was launched in Los Angeles stores last week by RCA/Thomson Consumer 
Electronics, DIRECTV, a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, and USSB (United States 
Satellite Broadcasting Co.), a division of Hubbard Broadcasting. Through the 
compact RCA dish, viewers can get about 150 to 175 channels of digital 
programming from two satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 DSS buyers will have the option of ordering USSB and DIRECTV programs in 
combination or separately, with programming packages ranging from $5.95 to 
$34.95 a month. Among those offered are popular subscription channels such as 
CNN, ESPN, TBS and USA Network and premium services such as HBO, Showtime, the 
Movie Channel, Cinemax and FLIX. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is a pay-per-view movie setup and extensive sports programming, 
with more in the works. With DSS, parents also can lock out channels they don't 
want their children to see. 
</P>
<P>
 The only drawback -- because DIRECTV and USSB are national programming 
distribution services -- is that DSS won't serve up local channels. To receive 
local stations, DSS owners must maintain a basic cable service (usually about 
$7-$10 a month) or use an antenna. (The DSS has a simple switch that enables 
viewers to go easily between DSS and local stations.) The basic DSS ($699) 
includes the 18-inch satellite dish, a digital receiver and an interactive 
remote control for hookup to one TV set. The Step-Up System ($899) allows for 
multiple television hookups. 
</P>
<P>
 DSS is available at a number of chain stores and selected electronics stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional installation costs $150 to $200. Do-it-yourselfers can buy an 
installation kit for $69.95 at any authorized DSS dealer. A Faster Cup of Joe 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee fanatics will want to check out a new automatic brewer that hooks up 
directly to the home's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Built by AquaBrew in Santa Ana, the Thermo Express is a commercial-grade 
brewing system constructed of stainless steel with an appliance white finish. 
Installation is similar to hooking up a refrigerator's ice maker. 
</P>
<P>
 AquaBrew President Patrick Rolfes says Thermo Express uses less coffee than 
other machines because of a consistent high brewing temperature (205 degrees 
Fahrenheit) and accelerated brewing time. It brews a 10-cup pot or half a pot 
at the push of a button and shuts off automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee goes into a removable Thermos carafe that will keep it hot up to 
eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Thermo Express ($299) is available from AquaBrew, 3421 W. Fordham Ave., Santa 
Ana, Calif. 92704; (800) 888-BREW. A Killer Sponge 
</P>
<P>
 3M has just developed another innovative way to improve a lowly household 
product: The O-Cel-O StayFresh Sponge kills germs and odors in the sponge 
before they can be spread on kitchen counters and cutting boards next time you 
use it. 
</P>
<P>
 The sponge resists common kitchen bacteria, including E. coli, salmonella and 
others known to cause food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 3M scientists and independent laboratories did a number of tests comparing the 
StayFresh to other sponges. In one, a StayFresh sponge and two regular sponges 
were subjected to 100 minutes of continuous use wiping out heavily soiled 
dishwashers and left damp for five days. By the end of the second day, all the 
bacteria in the StayFresh sponge were killed; bacteria counts in the other 
sponges stayed the same or increased. 
</P>
<P>
 O-Cel-O StayFresh sponges and scrub sponges are available nationwide in a 
variety of sizes, shapes and packages at groceries, mass merchandisers, 
discount stores, hardware stores and drugstores. They're priced reasonably. For 
example, the "handy" size is sold in four- and six-count packages at $1.29 and 
$1.59.

THE GOODS; SERVICE CENTRAL; NOW CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS HAVE A ONE-STOP HOT LINE 
TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS. AND THE VOICE ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE ISN'T A 
RECORDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rhonda Bolden has a good idea of what bugs California consumers. They're 
worried about failing an auto smog check. They wonder if the roofer who 
submitted the ridiculously low bid can be trusted. They bought a hearing aid 
that squawks, but the dealer won't take it back. And they're tired of being 
bounced from one department to the next in the labyrinth of state regulatory 
agencies as they seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people really feel like they've hit a brick wall. They can be very irate 
and upset," says Bolden, a program technician at the California Department of 
Consumer Affairs, whose job is answering questions on the phone. But that brick 
wall is coming down. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolden is one of more than 50 technicians now staffing the department's new 
Consumer Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line is an attempt by the sprawling department -- the state's largest 
-- to consolidate information about the 180 industries and 2.1 million 
Californians it regulates through state licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, whose responsibility is consumer protection, hopes the new hot 
line will address complaints and answer questions on everything from 
acupuncture to veterinarians, and ease consumer frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing worse than calling and getting kicked around," says J.P. 
Fish, the Consumer Information Division's chief of operations. "We want to be 
the public's first point of contact and we work very hard at keeping our 
information updated. Our staff will really go the extra mile, even if it's not 
an area we specifically regulate." 
</P>
<P>
 The streamlined service is part of the department's ongoing push to be more 
consumer-driven, department spokesman Louis Bonsignore says.  
</P>
<P>
 Until now, he says, consumers with questions or complaints first had to wade 
through the alphabet jumble of agencies to figure out where their concerns 
would fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do most people even know there is a Respiratory Care Committee? Or a Bureau 
of Electronic and Appliance Repair? Or a Tax Preparer's Program? First you had 
to figure it out, then work through the local telephone book, or call 
Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the department offers one-stop shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Information Center was formally unveiled recently in Sacramento, after a 
shakedown period of several months. Located on the first floor of the Consumer 
Affairs building on R Street, it combines sophisticated technology with the 
welcome innovation of a human voice on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 In a large, open room, 40 staff members sit at workstations armed with 
computers, headphones and giant consumer reference-guide Rolodexes. 
</P>
<P>
 They take calls in English and Spanish and, through an AT&T special service 
line, can provide answers to questions in 180 other languages and dialects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our old equipment had recorded information on a 24-hour basis, but we felt 
that people preferred to get a real person, even if they had to wait," says 
Arnold Hamilton, deputy chief of the Consumer Information Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, using an automated call distributor, two electronic marquees display 
which operators are busy, how many calls are waiting and how long each caller 
has waited. 
</P>
<P>
 The center already has about 60,000 calls a month coming in; officials expect 
that the number to grow as the word gets out. By next year the hot line number 
will be included in all California telephone directories. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bolden and other technicians will have even more information in their 
ever-growing consumer references. 'We're constantly in a training and updating 
mode," Fish says. "That's half the battle."  
</P>
<P>
 The range of questions, he notes, offers a snapshot of life in California, 
where finding a registered acupuncturist can be an everyday health-care issue; 
dependency on the car is reflected in constant complaints about auto repair 
services, and perpetual rebuilding from earthquakes, fires and mudslides 
generates ongoing interest in architects, contractors and builders. 
</P>
<P>
 (Not only can the hot line technicians verify licensing in many fields, they 
can also track any history of complaints about a firm if the request is made in 
writing.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're up and coming," Bolden says. "We have such a large amount of 
information available to us, we can be helpful to almost everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 She likes her job with its combination of complaint taker, consumer researcher 
and crisis counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a patient person, and I have one of those voices that just kind of calms 
people down. We get such a variety of questions the job never gets redundant. 
And I've never told anybody that I can't help them, no matter what the 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 The department wishes more people would ask questions, says Joanne Kozberg, 
secretary of the umbrella State and Consumer Services Agency. "We do a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, we have so many people making home improvements now -- they 
should make sure the contractors are licensed. Ask more questions. I think if a 
bid sounds too good to be true, it usually is." 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, homeowners don't realize the value of licensing until they've 
already been burned, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't realize there are a lot of laws in California to protect them."  
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the department handle licensing and testing, she says, "We have 
a strong enforcement role and we're trying to improve that all the time." (In 
response to consumer complaints, the Bureau of Automotive Repair cracked down 
on the Big-O Tire Franchise in Orange County and Sears Auto Repair Centers, 
among others, in recent years.) 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the department's news conferences throughout the state have 
publicized such issues as Halloween costume flammability, smog certificate 
fraud, cemetery and funeral fraud, and earthquake and fire safety. The 
department distributed more than 170,000 consumer information publications 
throughout the state last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also sponsors, or lobbies for, consumer legislation, such as 
last spring's price-gouging bill. Passed in the wake of the Northridge 
earthquake, it provides penalties for jacking up prices on critical goods and 
services after an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "A natural disaster points up consumer issues very quickly," Kozberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other issues of current concern include pending legislation to control 
gender-pricing (such as barbers or dry cleaners who charge different prices for 
comparable services to men and women) and a lemon law protecting car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozberg hopes the new hot line will encourage even more consumer feedback than 
the department gets now. "We try to educate, enforce, and work out solutions 
with lawmakers."

 For anyone interested in green shopping, the 10th edition of "The Consumer's 
Guide to Planet Earth" is just out. Publisher Randy Schultz of Schultz 
Communications in Albuquerque, N.M., scouts the country for companies that 
manufacture earth-friendly products. 
</P>
<P>
 He's found the usual recycled paper gift-wrap, organic foods, and 
energy-efficient doors and windows, along with some new entries -- serving 
trays made of recycled plastic and a new line of soft drinks that come in 
bottles consumers refill at self-serve dispensers in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the nicest things happening is that the environmental movement keeps 
moving mainstream," Schultz says. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz says his consumer guide is deliberately positioned as middle-of-the 
road environmentalism. "We recognize that living in America means you have to 
consume things, but we also think many of these choices can be greened up and 
we want to promote that." 
</P>
<P>
 The guide is carried in natural food stores or can be ordered by sending $7 to

VIDEO GAME REVIEW: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; MORTAL KOMBAT II; FOR SEGA 
GENESIS AND GAME GEAR, NINTENDO SNES AND GAME BOY  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM SCHIFFMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's how good Mortal Kombat II is: Put it in the ring with MKI, and the 
original gets carried out in a body bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Mortal Kombat, which earned a place in the video game Hall of Fame 
(behind the lawn mower in my garage) both for general excellence and for pretty 
much single-handedly forcing the industry to implement a rating system, is 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Long live MKII! 
</P>
<P>
 You remember Mortal Monday, when the first game was released. Well, Sept. 9 
was sort of Mortal Friday, the day four versions hit the streets -- Sega 
Genesis and Game Gear, Nintendo SNES and Game Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 One change from the original is important to SNES owners. The Nintendo version 
will be just as gory as the one for Genesis. In Round One, Nintendo refused to 
permit some of the bloody "finishing" moves. 
</P>
<P>
 The two 16-bit games have all 12 characters, plus two bosses. If you've played 
MKII in the arcade, backgrounds and moves will be familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Played side by side, the SNES version boots Sega's cart into the weeds. Sound 
and graphics are as close as you can get to arcade quality, while Sega suffers 
with poor sound and lesser graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's not like you're stuck with dreck if you're a Genesis fan. This 
time, SNES is just better. You won't be disappointed if Sega's your bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The story: Some five centuries ago, shape-shifter Shang Tsung was banished 
from the Outworld to Earth because he was bad. With the help of his sidekick 
Goro, he was supposed to so unbalance the planet that his boss, Shao Kahn, 
could stroll in and take over. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 But he convinced Shao Kahn he had a plan that might work. He lured his key 
enemies to the Outworld by setting up a martial arts tourney. Of course, the 
folks he invited are a bit better than your average street fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have to be. To win the tournament, you first have to defeat all the 
other fighters from Earth. Then you have to get past Shang Tsung. 
</P>
<P>
 Say you beat Tsung. Next up is Kintaro, a half-human, half-dragon relative of 
Goro. Then, the final fight -- Shao Kahn himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat him and you've saved the world. Until next time, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 MKII gives you a lot of flexibility. You can choose a difficulty level from 
very easy to very hard. You can use a three-button or six-button controller, or 
the activator, if you're playing the Genesis version. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphics are excellent. Gouts of blood gush when punches or kicks land. Bodies 
dissolve in slimy green pits or are hurled aloft to be pinned on spikes 
embedded in the ceiling. Heads go flying from lethal blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning MKII is pretty much a career thing; it could take you forever to 
learn all the controller combinations calling up the various moves, 
Friendships, Babalities and Shang Tsung's morphing ability. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can have a great time wrecking your opponents without mastering the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to hand-to-hand fighting games, MKII rules. There is nothing to 
compare it with, and that bodes well for gamers.

 Tired of the same faces and places to go on the weekend? Check out Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders has books, music, videos and an espresso bar, all under one 
30,000-square-foot roof. Tom and Lewis Borders opened their first store in 1971 
in Ann Arbor, Mich., and now 60 locations are scattered across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 61st store opened its doors a month ago in Mission Viejo, at Cabot and El 
Paseo roads, and is the first Southern California location.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to add to the culture here," manager Cory Bol said. Two Los 
Angeles sites will open next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast book section is the first thing you see when entering. Thousands of 
books -- literature, philosophy, religion, horror, mystery, history, computers, 
science fiction, health, travel, psychology, art and children's offerings -- 
are available. Special genres, such as those on gay and lesbian topics and 
untranslated texts, also are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also sign up to be part of a book club. Each month, Borders selects a 
genre and sells those books for 30% off. Members meet once a month at the store 
to discuss the selected books. October's selections include young adult, women 
studies, mystery and science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also philosophize with friends over a mocha at the espresso bar, just 
two steps from the book section. The monthly activity calendar gives times of 
live performances at the mini coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the back of the store, visitors can browse through the music section or 
check out new video releases. Music supplies, such as blank tapes and headsets, 
are for sale, and you can listen to CDs at the information desk before buying 
them. Near the video section is a big-screen TV that plays movies throughout 
the day. Children or adults can sit on couches and listen to the movie with 
earphones. 
</P>
<P>
 Special events are held about three times a week. They range from 
author-signing parties, readings for children to meetings of special interest 
groups and band performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders is open 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday. Call (714) 367-0005 for

R S V P; A TIRELESS GIVER TO BREAST-CANCER RESEARCH

 As people started lining up, holding three, four books apiece and insisting 
that she sign every one of them before she even so much as popped a pea pod in 
her mouth or had a drink, Evelyn Lauder was utterly unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that it was dinner time and she had been wearing the same beige 
Giorgio Armani suit since she boarded a plane in Boston early that morning. 
Launching her book of nature photographs, "The Seasons Observed," said Lauder 
-- who already had made similar appearances in four cities and had 18 more to 
go -- was easier than doing the cosmetics rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Leonard and I do a trip to see the accounts, it's so much faster," the 
Estee Lauder Cos.' senior corporate vice president explained Wednesday night at 
the home of Vanity Fair magazine contributing editor Wendy Stark and her 
husband, John Morrissey. Lauder's husband, Leonard, is the company's president 
and chief executive officer and was en route to New York from a business trip 
in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that day, Lauder estimates, she signed 70 copies per hour at Neiman 
Marcus in Beverly Hills. All of her royalties from the book will be donated to 
the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which she founded last year. The year 
before, Lauder was the force behind opening the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 The daughter-in-law of cosmetics queen Estee Lauder was in the sell mode now. 
"I saw your beautiful bride at lunch," she chirped to a man who must have 
walked down the aisle in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 When a kindly aide arrived, asking her if perhaps she'd like a chair, Lauder 
replied, "I can stand. I can stand on my head ." 
</P>
<P>
 Why the push? "That is to try to sell the book and raise money for the 
foundation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was no surprise that women outnumbered men at the party. Among the 
guests were Joanna Poitier, Jane Semel, Michelle Phillips, Connie Wald, Barbara 
Davis, Stephanie Barron, Carla Kirkeby, Lynn Vandifrif, Van Venneri, Annie 
Gilbar, Ginny Mancini and Shirlee Fonda as well as Justine and Robert 
Bloomingdale, Nancy and Tim Vreeland, Jayne and Henry Berger, Gary Pudney, Jane 
and Marc Nathanson, and Ed and Danna Ruscha. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much interested in breast-cancer research, having gone through a bit 
of a scare myself," Marsha Hobbs said. "All of us feel the statistics are such 
that you want to help the research." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue that really affects us and our children. I have three 
daughters," said Ann Jones, wife of Foreigner's Mick Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get a whole batch of books and give them as Christmas presents with 
a little note saying, 'It is a pleasure to give you this beautiful book because 
it has a special meaning.' Every gesture makes a difference."

UCLA MERGES ARCHITECTURE AND ARTS INTO A NEW SCHOOL; EDUCATION: IT'S A 
CONTROVERSIAL MOVE TO SAVE MONEY, BUT INCREASED FACULTY STRENGTHS ARE CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA has launched a School of the Arts and Architecture, merging the 
university's Department of Architecture and Urban Design with its former School 
of the Arts. Looking toward a community-involved future and boasting what Dean 
Robert Blocker calls "stellar new faculty appointments" -- including Daniel 
Libeskind, architect of the Berlin Museum, a closely watched project currently 
under construction in Germany -- UCLA's architecture program has joined the 
other arts under an expanded umbrella on the sprawling Westwood campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes in response to massive cuts in funding that have shaken the 
entire University of California system and slashed UCLA's 1994-95 budget by $34 
million. The new school is part of UCLA's effort to save $8 million a year 
through a controversial plan known as the Professional School Restructuring 
Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other provisions, the initiative has dismantled the Graduate School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning but preserved its educational programs, saving 
more than $1 million a year in administrative costs. The Department of Urban 
Planning has shifted to a new School of Public Policy and Social Research, 
while Architecture and Urban Design has allied with five other artistic 
departments -- Art, Design, Dance, Music and Ethnomusicology and Systematic 
Musicology. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Charles E. Young's announcement of the plan, on June 3, 1993, was 
greeted by noisy protests. Under the surveillance of police in riot gear, about 
50 architecture and planning students banged on doors of the alumni center 
where Young held a press conference to explain the initiative. Although 
architecture wasn't slated for extinction, some students, alumni and faculty 
feared the department would be eviscerated and eventually abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's proposed change was essentially structural, "but structure confers 
status," Blocker said in an interview in his office. "It was essential that the 
status of architecture not be mitigated in any way. If anything, it would be 
strengthened." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrative jobs have been lost during the financial crunch, and less staff 
assistance is available to both students and faculty, he said. But now that the 
new school is a reality, Blocker contends that the Department of Architecture 
and Urban Design is among the best in the nation. He attributes the 
department's strength to faculty, past and present. Filling vacancies with 
Libeskind, Mark Mack and other architectural luminaries has renewed a tradition 
of leadership in a department that already claimed such well-known figures as 
Franklin Israel and Charles Jencks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Blocker said, unlike many universities that import big names for 
brief tours of duty, UCLA maintains a permanent full-time faculty of leading 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Department Chair Jurg Lang concurred. Although seven faculty members left in 
an early retirement program, most have been retained on an emeritus basis so 
that students can work with them, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and faculty are attracted to the department's relatively small size 
(with an enrollment of just over 200) and its well-established program, which 
is restricted to graduates, Lang said. But he thinks the biggest draw is UCLA's 
location. "As a city of the 20th and 21st centuries, Los Angeles is one of the 
best places to study architecture and design. It doesn't just extrapolate from 
the past; it pursues a vision of the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with all that going for it, UCLA's architecture program is fighting a 
public perception that it died in the restructuring process, Lang said. He 
hopes that outreach programs -- including exhibitions, lectures and community 
projects -- will correct that misconception and help people to see architecture 
as part of their lives. The first event is a show of Austrian architect Peter 
Noever's work, at the Wight Art Gallery through Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Blocker, the new school is poised to move into the future with 
more use of computers, more interdepartmental cooperation and fewer 
bureaucratic encumbrances. But major challenges remain: developing funding for 
student aid, building friendships with businesses and community groups and 
recruiting gifted students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say we have turned the corner. Every time we do that, we see another 
corner," Blocker said. "But we have turned a corner."

MASTER CHORALE SETS 31ST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven subscription concerts in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music 
Center, plus four special events in various locales, mark the 31st season of 
the Los Angeles Master Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 The season begins with a Brahms program Oct. 30 in the Pavilion, when music 
director Paul Salamunovich conducts the "Ein deutsches Requiem," the Alto 
Rhapsody and "Ave Maria," with soloists Claudine Carlson and David 
Arnold."Canciones para Los Angeles," Nov. 19, features works by Schifrin, 
Chavez, Berger and others. "Home for the Holidays" is the chorale's 
Christmas-season offering, Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chorale's pops program, Feb. 18, is titled "From Stage to Screen" and will 
be followed, March 5, by a guest appearance by the touring Seoul Ladies' 
Singers from Korea, conducted by Hak Won Yoon. Guest conductor Jon Washburn 
leads the Master Chorale in Bach's "St. John" Passion, April 2. Singing the 
role of the Evangelist will be Banjamin Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The season closes, May 14, when Salamunovich conducts works by Libby Larsen 
and Carl Nielsen, and Walton's "Belshazzar's Feast." 
</P>
<P>
 A children's holiday celebration, Dec. 17, two different "Messiah" 
sing-alongs, Dec. 9 and 11, and a major fund-raiser, called "Romance a 
Versailles," complete the 1994-95 Chorale schedule.

 Few stars in the world of Latin music are better known and loved than Tito 
Puente.  
</P>
<P>
 The 71-year-old New York-born percussionist, bandleader and composer has 
recorded 104 albums since the late 1940s, ranging from simple salsa to complex 
Latin jazz and covering virtually all the many Afro-Cuban rhythms.  
</P>

 Although the two-time Grammy winner is best-known for his hits "Para Los 
Rumberos" and "Oye Como Va" (popularized worldwide by Santana in the early 
'70s), he is much more than the "Mambo King." Puente's challenging spirit and 
energetic versatility have been an inspiration to those who know the dance part 
is only a fraction of the magic of Latin music.  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Puente and 17 other artists will appear at Hollywood Bowl in the 
"La Combinacion Perfecta" ("The Perfect Combination"), an all-star concert 
based on the 1993 RMM Records release of that name featuring salsa duets by 
some of today's best soneros, singers known for their improvisational skills.  
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Puente talked about his career, the state of Latin 
dance music and his plans for the future.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: Were you ever uncomfortable with the title of "Mambo King"? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It doesn't bother me to be associated with mambo, but I'm not the king 
of anything (smiles). I've played all kinds of styles with all types of 
musicians, and all I ever wanted to do was to become a good musician and create 
good music. That's all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your impression of today's tropical music? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Colombia is producing very good salsa orchestras like Niche and Guayacan. 
Puerto Rico has advanced greatly in arrangers and recording quality. But the 
New York orchestras are different, more exciting, and I don't know why. Puerto 
Ricans are good but lack what Americans call the d-r-r-r-r-ive , when the mambo 
picks up and everybody feels it. Puerto Ricans are lighter, more subtle. In New 
York it's different, maybe because of the presence and influence of jazz. Now, 
the Cubans . . . what else can I say about them? Orchestras like NG La Banda, 
Los Van Van. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Those Cuba-based orchestras seem to be miles ahead of everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Way up! They sound like Weather Report! When things get solved in Cuba, the 
Cuban musicians will scare a lot of musicians from here. I always tell 
everybody: As soon as the Cubans come, a lot of people are going to have to go 
back to school all over again. In Cuba it's different -- there they really 
study music. If you are a musician in Cuba, that's all you do. Brazilians also 
play a lot of jazz, but I think Cubans are the more advanced in both jazz 
technique and rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the last few years you've concentrated on Latin jazz instead of dance 
music, and now you're playing with the Golden Latin Jazz All Stars, a sort of 
Dream Team. 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can't get much better than that. Every time we play with any major 
Anglo jazzmen, as Americans say, "We put 'em away." It's because we are playing 
Latin jazz, and it gets very interesting for the congas and all that. We beat 
everybody because we have the clave (the distinct rhythmic pattern essential 
for Afro-Cuban rhythms). That's why I say Americans can't and will never be 
able to play Latin jazz properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That'll be hard for many American players to digest. 
</P>
<P>
 A: But it's the truth! I have never heard any good American Latin jazz 
orchestra, never . You can know lots of music, but the clave is something you 
can't learn anywhere. I go to universities all over the place for Latin jazz 
workshops and I see that. They don't even know what a drum is.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the idea that music is a universal thing, that you can feel it 
no matter where you come from? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I only talk about what I see. Of course there must be exceptions, but in 
America I still haven't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who is your favorite sonero (salsa singer) today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think (Venezuela's) Oscar D'Leon is the best of them all. He is much 
superior to all others. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After 104 albums, what's left for you to do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have a crazy dream -- to stay alive in the year 2000 and have the first 
Latin orchestra to play on the moon (laughs). I'll put my timbales instead of 
the flag. My chops are still good, but performing is the most difficult part -- 
it gets harder every time. You go around the world and find more and more 
people who can play better than yourself. But I still have enough for a couple 
of more years. After that I'll give my timbales to the younger generation and 
concentrate on producing. 
</P>

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: A CUSTOM TOUCH; ACCESSORIES LIKE THOSE FOUND IN RESORT 
GIFT SHOPS ARE AVAILABLE CLOSE TO HOME -- WITHOUT THE BOUTIQUE PRICES. 
</P>

<P>
 If you love the jewelry, hats and accessories you see in the gift shops of 
resort hotels, you'll love the inventory at A Touch of Spring. The owners, 
Sherry Sidiropoulos and her cousin Susie Reitman, design and sell many of their 
creations to various resort and hotel shops across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 They often emblazon the hotels' logos on caps and are set up to customize 
their products, which they do at their combination studio / warehouse / 
showroom in Tarzana. The consumer here can get the same customized products -- 
but at wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hat styles are wonderful, with the emphasis on a Western motif. You'll 
find an assortment of straws and felts that range in price from $25 to $55. 
</P>
<P>
 For $55, there is a large, floppy felt that comes in jewel tones and several 
styles, from a huge antique flower on a pushed-up front to one embroidered in 
gold all over and down all around. Garbo would have loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sherry mentioned that they love this style in Chicago, I asked, "What 
about the wind?" Her answer came in the form of a tray of lovely Austrian 
crystal hat pins priced from $6 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Caps and visors can be customized to your interests, whether they be golf, 
tennis, cards or animals. Just pick out the style and color, and state your 
desire. For this customizing, the price range is $12 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
 A collection of hair accessories and bridal headpieces, fitting either for the 
most demure bride or the glitzy, black-feathered siren, also sell at wholesale 
prices. (They're even cheaper if you order in volume). Figure $15 for demure 
and $25 for glitzy. 
</P>
<P>
 The costume jewelry rates among the best. A very lightweight gold necklace 
with the appearance of crocheted yarn is a Greek import at $25. Both 
Sidiropoulos and Reitman are experts in beadwork and make a collection of 
Swarovski crystal earrings to your specifications, an order they often fill for 
bridal parties. The earrings range from $15 to $48. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time I visit A Touch of Spring, some delicious little surprise is 
revealed, and this time it was "sleeve-holders" -- elasticized metal bands 
designed to keep one's sleeves out of one's soup. At $5 a pair, I bought three 
-- one for me and two for a couple of deserving friends. Since the owners 
attend trade shows from time to time, it's wise to call before you go. 
</P>
<P>

DANA PARSONS: A DIFFERENT POSITION ON QUALITY OF AMERICANS' SEX LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if you were under the misguided notion it was none of your business, you 
probably haven't avoided hearing about the new national sex survey. The results 
debunk America as the promiscuous, sex-drenched society that we all thought we 
lived in. As dispiriting as that may be to some, facts are facts. Deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, designed by researchers at the University of Chicago, concluded 
that Americans are more monogamous and less prolific than commonly thought. 
Sexual tastes and behavior are fairly conservative. In fact, Time magazine 
devoted its cover story to the survey and said the findings suggest "the sex 
lives of most Americans are about as exciting as a peanut butter-and-jelly 
sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
 Alysia Batchelder, the 24-year-old office manager of The Pleasure Company in 
Irvine, isn't so sure. "The $4.5 million we made last year tells me a lot," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Who better to talk to about the new survey on sex in America than the 
proprietor of an "adult boutique" like The Pleasure Company? 
</P>
<P>
 And how appropriate that it be located in that citadel of rampant sexuality: 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The boutique Batchelder runs is wedged into one of those Irvine industrial 
parks and is surrounded by printing companies, graphics firms and places with 
futuristic high-tech names that give you no idea what they do. The lone 
exception among her neighbors is the stripper business next door that, 
according to Batchelder, is being run out by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Batchelder's boutique, which has been in business 13 years, sells such things 
as lingerie, sexual aids and adult "toys." 
</P>
<P>
 With a clientele that's split about evenly between men and women, Batchelder 
says people's sexual interests aren't as bland as the survey suggests. The 
survey, for example, found the missionary position is far and away the most 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary clientele is businessmen and women," she says. "The large 
majority of our customers are married and are looking for something just to 
spice up their love life, usually toys and lotions." 
</P>
<P>
 She agrees with the survey findings that people are more monogamous these 
days, attributing that to a fear of AIDS or other transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Batchelder has worked at the shop for three years and is also a psychology 
major at UC Irvine, hoping to be a marriage and family counselor with an 
emphasis on human sexuality. As such, she pays attention to what her customers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say people are pulling away from monogamy," she says, "but I would 
say they're pulling away from boring missionary positions in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that customers might be self-conscious, the store tries its darndest 
to be friendly. "It's not like we're a dark, dingy Harbor Boulevard-type 
place," she says. "It's well-lit and we have lingerie in the front half of the 
store, we have a man and woman working in the store at all times, so if a 
person prefers to speak to a man or woman, you have them there. A man probably 
doesn't want to come up to me and say, 'I have an erection problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Batchelder's reaction to the survey's finding that 54% of American men 
think about sex daily, compared to 19% of women who do. "I would assume that's 
incorrect. I think women have been socialized to not talk about sex, and 
they're not supposed to think about it, but they do." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, she also thinks the 54% figure for men is too low. 
</P>
<P>
 If outsiders have a misconception about her business, she says, it's that her 
customers are weirdos. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will come in and say, 'I bet you see some strange ones in here,' but, 
really we don't in Irvine. It's more middle-of-the-line people. It surprises a 
lot of people that we're in such a conservative area of Orange County, and yet 
we do such a good business." 
</P>
<P>
 Your explanation for that, I inquired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody needs some," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving quickly along, I asked if the general mood at the shop is serious or 
light. "Over the lunch hour, we get a lot of girls from the offices around 
here, coming in and having a good time laughing and giggling. Everything from 
that to husbands coming in, very serious, needing something to keep romance 
alive. Primarily, it's just people wanting something to add a little spice, but 
we do have some people who have marriages on the blink who say, 'I need some 
help.' I think most of those people, especially being where we're located in 
Irvine, have shrinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Batchelder says the city of Irvine seems to be trying to curtail adult 
businesses. Listening to her talk about the ordinariness of her customers makes 
you wonder who the city is trying to protect us from. 
</P>
<P>
 From each other, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't say if it's good or bad that Batchelder's observation is that middle 
America isn't nearly as "peanut butter-and-jelly" as the survey reports. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, maybe that had some hidden meaning. After all, consider the 
possibilities for peanut butter and jelly. . . .

LIFE AMONG THE NOBELITY; FOR SOUTHLAND'S LAUREATES, THE THRILL OF WINNING COMES 
IN SMALL WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What becomes a Nobel laureate most? A new Porsche? A sailing yacht? How about 
a trip around the world? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 A more modest and unusual legacy has awaited Southern California's Nobel Prize 
winners -- a small fraternity that gained one member this week when USC 
chemistry professor George A. Olah claimed the world's top intellectual honor. 
</P>
<P>
 For the handful of local men who have won the prize, the greatest thrills have 
come in small ways -- such as acquiring that new parking space closer to the 
lab, buying a long-enduring wife a new watch or putting money away for the 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be buffeted by demands for money, entreaties of friendship and 
speaking requests from around the world, but members of this rarefied company 
take greatest pride in how little their personal lives have changed. Their 
highest compliment for one another is that they are "mature" and that they have 
remained unsullied by the seductive allure of more wealth, power and acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after Caltech chemist Rudolph Marcus returned from Stockholm in 1992 
with the Nobel Prize for chemistry, for instance, a colleague saw him parking 
his car in a newly painted space not far from his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudy said to me, 'Well, the Nobel Prize has to be worth something, ' " 
recalled Stephen Mayo, a Caltech assistant professor of biology. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Marcus still walks to work most days from his home just off the 
Pasadena campus. He still drives a clunky 1978 Oldsmobile. And he reports 
proudly that when his wife, Laura, met King Carl Gustav XVI, she was wearing a 
homemade dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his $1.2 million in winnings is invested, or in the bank. He notes, in 
fact, that the prize had lost 20% of its value by the time he received his 
check, because of a rapid devaluation of the Swedish krona. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Caltech campus, Marcus remains so unchanged and so focused on his 
study of energy storage that one colleague quipped that he "must have spent his 
million dollars on a new sweater." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Marcus: "It's best if one doesn't think too much about prizes and things. 
That puts the focus in the wrong place, which should be on your work . . . on a 
particular problem and how you should solve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he has been forced to hire a second secretary to handle the flood 
of speaking requests and other obligations. The oddest request he has 
encountered came from a murder mystery writer who wanted to use Marcus' name 
for a book character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see the point," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands are so intense, at times, that Marcus has resolved to get better 
at saying "no." 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question you have to answer is whether you want to turn into a 
traveling salesman, or whether to use your time to produce something valuable 
and something new," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Donald Cram has much the same philosophy, loathing the tendency of some 
Nobel Prize winners to leave their scientific roots and wander off in other 
directions. He views the late Linus Pauling as something of a "fallen angel" 
for leaving the work that brought him a Nobel Prize in chemistry to promote, 
among other things, world peace and the curative values of vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have looked on the Nobel Prize as an opportunity to do more of what I enjoy 
and what I am good at, and that is science," said Cram, who received the honor 
in 1987 for his work in chemistry. "That is the central core of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old scientist -- whose colorful bow ties and guitar concerts are 
legend at UCLA -- said that most of the time it is easy to remain true to that 
central core. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take him long, for instance, to reject a strange offer from a Korean 
newspaper association. The group wanted him to join a team of Nobel Prize 
winners to rewrite the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something just didn't fit there," Cram said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cram's $180,000 prize was not as large as those of others in the last few 
years, partly because he shared the chemistry award with two others. Prizes 
also have increased substantially as the bequest of Alfred Nobel has become 
more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Cram hasn't put the money to good use. The professor this year bought 
a home overlooking Orange County's Monarch Bay partly with his prize money. 
From there, he can see as far as the San Onofre coastline where he has surfed 
for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cram insists that the prize's value goes far beyond the money. He doesn't 
have to teach classes anymore, he can more easily attract grants for his 
research, and new colleagues are lured from all over the world to join his 
research team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has extended my scientific life," Cram said. And Cram said the award has 
brought long-overdue recognition to his wife and longtime collaborator, Jane. 
Cram also used the award money to act on a long-delayed urge to buy his wife a 
gold watch, although he laughingly admits he sought out the best buy he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised in Vermont," Cram said. "Money doesn't circulate very frequently 
in New England." 
</P>
<P>
 The area's third and senior surviving laureate is 1983 physics prize winner 
William A. Fowler, who, like Marcus, lives within walking distance of the 
Caltech campus where he worked for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a professor emeritus, he gave two-thirds of his award to two daughters and 
invested the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was awarded the prize, he already had retired, and a bad back 
and other ailments have since caused him to give up the lecture circuit. But 
Fowler still likes to stay in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 His Nobel status allows him to keep an assistant on campus who comes to his 
Pasadena home each afternoon to retrieve and type his letters and to deliver 
the latest research papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 83-year-old notes that a new field of nuclear study has opened up recently 
and that he still has a few ideas floating around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still hoping to get a second one," he said, chuckling. "You never know."

REINVENTING THE BLACK PANTHERS; ACTIVISM: A NEW COALITION IS DEDICATED TO 
COMMUNITY WORK BUT WITHOUT VIOLENT RHETORIC. FOUNDERS HOPE L.A. WILL BE A 
LAUNCHING PAD FOR RENEWED MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are no shotguns here. Huey Newton's menacing stare and Afro are buried 
somewhere deep in the Oakland Hills. Bobby Seale's cool, calm looks and Elaine 
Brown's piercing eyes are just a memory. Dashikis are still in fashion, but for 
the most part the black leather jackets and tilted berets have been replaced 
with tight-fitting baseball caps and baggy blue jeans.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the Black Panther Party of the '90s, or the New African American 
Vanguard Movement, a coalition of ex-Panthers who, along with a new batch of 
eager young black kids of the '80s, have come together to reinvent Black 
America's most radically flamboyant group of a quarter-century past. 
</P>
<P>
 Still dedicated to community activism but without the rhetoric of violent 
self-defense, the group is using a smoldering Los Angeles as a backdrop for 
what it hopes will become a national movement again. Members believe that Los 
Angeles, after the last few years of turmoil and racial introspection, may be 
the perfect launching pad for a new generation of Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If L.A. rocks, then the whole nation can rock," said Shareef Abdullah, an 
organizer of the group who worked with the Panthers in Los Angeles from 1975 to 
1980 and believes the city was the "strongest and most capable chapter in the 
Black Panther Party."  
</P>
<P>
 The Panther revival effort -- like previous, unsuccessful efforts elsewhere in 
the nation since the Panthers disbanded in 1981 -- seems likely to raise a 
political question that still divides historians: Who were the Panthers? Were 
they gun-toting opportunists posing as a community movement, whose clashes with 
police resulted in the deaths of 28 party members and 14 law enforcement 
officers in the late 1960s and '70s? Or were they a revolutionary attempt by 
African Americans to control their neighborhoods, with feeding programs as well 
as guns -- an effort so threatening to the Establishment that the FBI launched 
a program to destroy them? 
</P>
<P>
 This dichotomy flared earlier this month when, after much controversy, the 
city Cultural Affairs Commission approved a city-funded mural, titled "To 
Protect and Serve," that pays tribute to the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 The New African American Vanguard Movement's first formal event, a grocery 
giveaway and festival, will be Saturday afternoon at the Vision Complex Theatre 
in the Crenshaw district's Leimert Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Members said the day will highlight the Panthers' contributions to black life 
in the past, such as free breakfast programs, escorts for the elderly and 
alternative schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you use the words Black Panther Party, people conjure up so many bad 
images, they don't understand exactly what the Panthers were about," said Kizzy 
Brown, an organizer of the coalition and mother of two teen-age boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdullah and other founders of the new group said the foundation the Panthers 
built can be used to politically organize African Americans from all 
backgrounds. They want to work closely with Latino and Asian community groups 
as well as reach out to disaffected youths such as gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to reinvent the wheel," organizer B. Kwaku Duren said. "The 
NAAVM will simply try to unify existing organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Panther Party was begun in Oakland in 1967 by Huey Newton and Bobby 
Seale, at the peak of an era in which blacks rebelled against established 
political and social organizations. While the movement ended in a wave of 
bitterness and recriminations, leaders like Newton and Seale have become icons 
in recent years, with at least five Panther-related films in development and 
increased curiosity among young people. 
</P>
<P>
 The new group's organizers have been planning their program for more than a 
year. Whether their efforts will eventually do what the Panthers did for black 
politicians in Oakland -- set up a greater political power base for people like 
Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Oakland) and former Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson -- can't 
yet be gauged. But group members say they realize it will take more than merely 
an assembly of new activists using a familiar name to bring together African 
Americans in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are learning in L.A. that just as other communities are coming together, 
so must we," Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 The group's eight-point program, patterned after the Panthers' original 
mission statement, contains many of the same messages about police brutality, 
fighting hunger and providing medical care for inner-city residents. But there 
are some differences. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, for most Americans the image of the Panthers is often one of 
brandishing weapons and clashes with police. While group organizers say 
self-defense "should always be a priority for African Americans," they will try 
to downplay violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis will not be on guns," Abdullah said. "That alienated some black 
folks; we don't want to repeat that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Policing the police," a confrontational tactic that the Panthers became 
nationally known for, will not be an immediate goal, Abdullah said. 
Nevertheless, he said the group will monitor the Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the new organizing attempt features Panther veterans with 
knowledge of the party's struggles -- from the death of Fred Hampton in Chicago 
at the hands of the FBI to Newton's bout with drugs -- is what attracted 
23-year-old Michael Allen.  
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a senior at UC Irvine, is in charge of recruiting students and other 
youngsters. A native of Los Angeles, he grew up with images of the Panthers at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was a kid and my mother telling me she was heading to 
Panther meetings in Watts," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing his generation of young African Americans, which is often dismissed 
as apathetic and unfocused, into the group will be imperative to its success, 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say the crucial elements that split up the Panthers were dissension among 
members coupled with harassment from the FBI and its Counter Intelligence 
Program, or COINTELPRO, which targeted what it labeled "black hate groups." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Panthers said they are aware of what it will take to keep this effort 
free from distractions. "We've learned from the past. We won't make those same 
mistakes again," Kizzy Brown said. "Especially in turning against ourselves."  
</P>
<P>
 Former Black Panther Ericka Huggins, who worked in the founding Oakland 
chapter from nearly its inception until its end, said she supports the new 
effort but hopes organizers are honest with themselves. Huggins, whose husband, 
John, was gunned down on the UCLA campus in 1969 in a struggle over who would 
control the university's black studies program, said people who want to lead 
must first "look deep within themselves and deal with their own personalized 
oppression."

THE ODD COUPLE; JEWS AND ARABS SHARE A STAGE AND A WISH FOR PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She starts with a story about the deep sadness and pain of being born Jewish 
in a world that persecutes Jews. "That wound was healed by the existence of the 
state of Israel," says Janina Frankel, 36, an American-born writer who lives in 
Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 He starts with a story about Jews grafting their homeland onto a country full 
of Palestinians, Christians and Muslims. "Of course, all that was done without 
consulting them (the non-Jews)," says Sam Alameddine, 32, an Arab American 
engineer who was born and raised in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people sitting in front of an afternoon class on world political 
leadership at USC talking about the Middle East may not sound unusual. But the 
notion of a Jewish speaker going out on a speaking engagement with an Arab 
American remains practically avant garde. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel and Alameddine, who appeared together at USC this week, are just two 
speakers from the newly formed Arab-Jewish Speakers Bureau, one of the informal 
ripples of last year's Arab-Israeli accords. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers are not expected to solve or erase half a century's worth of violence 
and pain. They do not have to think the same, they can agree to disagree, they 
can disagree on how they disagree. The only requirement is that they be 
committed to a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict -- and that they 
show they can share a stage in a kind of small-scale peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The McLaughlin Group it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surprise is that we can get together and there are no fireworks," said 
David Waskow, an American Jewish Congress staffer and member of the speakers 
bureau who sat in on the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the audience is angry that the speakers are not angrier. "When was 
the last time she was there?" one student -- recently returned from a summer 
trip to Israel -- asked skeptically after Frankel said she basically agreed 
with Alameddine's main points. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Berg, a 19-year-old sophomore in the audience whose father was born in 
Israel, said: "I don't think she presented the Israeli side as strongly as he 
presented the Palestinian side." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very painful for me," admitted Frankel afterward. "It's hard to be 
looked at as a traitor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Frankel, who lived in Israel in 1976 but has visited more recently, harsh 
commentary is part of the process of putting peaceful disagreement on display. 
And she will not debate the factual history of the Mideast, a subject that has 
long generated tirades on both sides. "That becomes an argument of who has been 
hurt more deeply and I don't think anyone can win that argument." 
</P>
<P>
 These are not the first Jewish and Arab groups in Los Angeles to attempt 
dialogue, but they do appear to have created the first speakers bureau. Their 
efforts were sparked by the September, 1993, accord between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, which called for Palestinian self-rule to 
begin in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, and the extraordinary handshake on the White House lawn between 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, gave the 
speakers bureau legitimacy, said Arthur Stern, a businessman, survivor of the 
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and co-chairman of the speakers bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel added: "The idea that Rabin and Arafat (who, according to some 
published reports, will receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize today) would 
shake hands -- 10 years ago I would have told you that you were out of your 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The four groups sponsoring the speakers bureau are the American Jewish 
Congress, Americans for Peace Now (a Jewish group thatwas supporting a 
negotiated settlement in the early 1980s, when it was considered practically 
subversive), the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the National 
Assn. of Arab Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 They started working a year ago, giving presentations to each other, acting as 
probing audiences. Since May, they have been sending out speakers to schools, 
colleges and civic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've spent the year trying to understand each other," said Rita Lowenthal, a 
member of the bureau's steering committee and of both sponsoring Jewish 
organizations, "knowing we would never agree completely, but that we all 
believed in the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Their first meeting was at the El Amir restaurant in Beverly Hills. "We sat 
alternately -- Arab-Jew-Arab-Jew," said Tony Amsih, president of the Los 
Angeles chapter of the National Assn. of Arab Americans and a member of the 
bureau's steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the past year's meetings have forged intense and ultimately warm 
relationships with people they had learned to distrust. Some perceptions went 
out the window -- even innocuous ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the first session, we couldn't tell who was with which group," said 
Lowenthal, who noted that she had always believed she could identify someone as 
Jewish at a glance. "I realized I had my own stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
 This does not come without some pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main things Arab speakers want to do with Jewish audiences is 
acquaint them with why Arabs are angry," said Donald Bustany, president of the 
Los Angeles chapter of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the 
other co-chairman of the speakers bureau. "It's not the Palestinian people who 
went to where the Jewish people were living and took their land from them," he 
said, sitting in a USC classroom with other organizers after the speeches. "It 
was the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal smiles ruefully at Bustany's comment. It is not the first time and 
it won't be the last that she hears something so discordant to her ears. 
"That's one of our tensions," she said. "We see the history a little 
differently."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MID-CITY; BOY DIES, 
COMPANION SHOT IN APPARENT GANG ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age boy was shot to death Thursday and his companion seriously wounded 
on a sidewalk in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles after a carload of apparent 
gang members confronted them, shouted a challenge and then opened fire, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two youths, both 15, were attacked at 4:05 p.m. as they were walking on 
Queen Anne Place near Pico Boulevard, said Los Angeles Police Officer Edmund 
Rodriguez.One youth was shot in the head, shoulder and chest; the other was 
shot in the abdomen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys were taken to a nearby hospital, where one died and the other 
remained in serious condition. Their names were not released by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said it was unclear what sparked the confrontation, but said it is 
being investigated by police gang specialists. The assailants left at least 10 
shell casings at the scene, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
REJECTS BASINGER'S SETTLEMENT WITH FILMMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday refused to approve a settlement between 
actress Kim Basinger and her creditors, calling a proposed payout to Main Line 
Pictures "too rich."  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Geraldine Mund cited last month's 2nd District Court of 
Appeal ruling that overturned an $8.1-million Los Angeles County Superior Court 
judgment against Basinger for reneging on a promise to appear in Main Line's 
box office bust, "Boxing Helena." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement set the film company's claim at $3.8 million, which 
Mund found too high. The agreement would have given Main Line another $2.2 
million if any so-called hidden assets were found.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's too rich, at this point," Mund said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said there was "no assurance that another jury (in a Superior Court 
retrial) would come in in favor of Main Line."  
</P>
<P>
 Mund ordered attorneys for the company and trustee Ronald L. Durkin and 
Basinger to work out another settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia-born actress's other creditors have made claims totaling $1.7 
million, said John Reitman, the trustee's attorney.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; PAROLEE WHO 
KILLED MAN IN CLUB GETS 30 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal prison parolee who shot a man to death at a Downtown Los Angeles 
nightclub during an argument about a woman was sentenced Thursday in Torrance 
Superior Court to 30 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy David Summers, 29, was convicted of first-degree murder last month in the 
slaying of Thomas C. Williams, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Summers -- who had been released from federal prison two 
months earlier after serving six years for drug trafficking and a weapons code 
violation -- shot Williams to death at the Mayan club at 11th and Hill streets 
on May 20, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers was captured in North Carolina earlier this year after being featured 
on the television show, "America's Most Wanted."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
SIDES WITH FIRED PRESS CLUB BOARD MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has ruled that a dozen board members of the Greater Los Angeles Press 
Club fired by the club president for being "non-journalists" must be returned 
to their posts -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien ordered squabbling club leaders to more 
closely follow the 48-year-old organization's bylaws next time they try to 
reduce the size of its board or change the voting status of members. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien declined to define the difference between "journalists" and 
"non-journalists" -- the key issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Dusty Brandel, a Glendale newspaper advertising saleswoman and 
sports writer, fired public relations people from the 420-member group's board 
in July. After that, the fired directors formed their own board and attempted 
to fire Brandel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's ruling, O'Brien ordered both sides to work together. That may 
take some doing, the two sides indicated Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be one or two more skirmishes, but I think they will be forced by 
the judge to sit down and negotiate," said Eric Troff, lawyer for those fired 
by Brandel. Replied Brandel's lawyer, Kate Neiswender: "I think the judge 
thinks we're all adults. I think the judge gives us too much credit."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDIO CITY; RENTER OF 
'PARTY PALACE' HILLSIDE MANSION SUES CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Bolduc, master of the revels at the "Party Palace" -- a controversial 
hillside mansion where annoyed neighbors say the fun never stops -- has sued 
the city of Los Angeles for $1 million, complaining that city officials are 
harassing him and ruining his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are making all these wild accusations about things I haven't done," said 
Bolduc, who also goes by the name "Jerry Bo.""Girls that I wanted to date think 
that I have wild orgies now," he said. "After all this, who is ever going to 
rent to me again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc has been at odds with city officials, who sided with neighbors 
complaining that the sprawling 7,500-square-foot mansion he leases on 
Wrightwood Drive houses a commercial venture where hundreds of people at a time 
paid admission to attend all-night parties where they buy drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office sued to put an end to the parties. The mansion's 
owner, Paul Campbell, and the mortgage holder on the $2-million house signed a 
settlement two weeks ago. It promised that any parties would be limited to a 
maximum of 25 guests, wind up by 10 p.m. and no alcohol would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc said after the settlement that he, as lessee of the building, was not a 
part of the agreement and scoffed at the limits. His lawsuit against the city 
asks for damages for infliction of emotional distress, libel, slander, 
defamation, trespassing and invasion of privacy.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; SCIENTISTS 
BEGIN SEARCH FOR QUAKE FAULTS IN OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists on the research vessel Maurice Ewing began firing bursts of air 
into the ocean Thursday in an experiment to try to find hidden fault lines such 
as the one that caused the Northridge quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Geological Survey and the Southern California Earthquake Center are 
co-sponsoring the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Air bursts from a battery of guns placed 30 feet below the surface will be 
fired every 20 seconds for the next eight days. The boat from which the bursts 
are fired will be miles offshore, so residents will not hear the blasts.  
</P>
<P>
 "These bursts of air will generate seismic waves in the water, which will, in 
turn, enter the earth at the bottom of the ocean and will propagate through the 
earth much as X-rays would propagate through your body from an X-ray source," 
scientist Tom Henyey said. The waves "will be picked up on land with receivers 
in the L.A. Basin, the mountains and as far away as the Mojave Desert."  
</P>
<P>
 The receivers are arrayed in three separate lines that wind throughout the 
basin. One extends from Santa Monica through Northridge to the western Mojave. 
Another begins in Redondo Beach, and ends in Colton; the third goes from Seal 
Beach northeast to an area near Barstow. A similar experiment in Northern 
California found several faults.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN WHO 
SAID HE FOUND 2 BOYS CONVICTED OF KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who said he found two lost boys was sentenced Thursday to eight years in 
prison after a judge convicted him of kidnaping.  
</P>
<P>
 In a two-day trial, Mario Sosa, also known as Enrique Lopez-Palma, was 
convicted by Superior Court Judge John Reid of two counts of kidnaping a child 
under 14 and two counts of child-stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa, who had waived his right to a jury trial, was arrested Jan. 10 after an 
investigation into the Christmas Day disappearance of a 3-year-old boy and the 
Dec. 4 disappearance of a 4-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Lopez said the younger boy vanished from his father's 
side at a video arcade at 7th Street and Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
 The youngster, subject of a wide search, showed up nine days later in the 
custody of Sosa, who told police he had found the boy under a pay phone about a 
block from the arcade. The child was unable to say where he had been, Lopez 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks earlier, a 4-year-old boy had disappeared from the Downtown 
Greyhound Bus Station and turned up the next day with the defendant. Sosa told 
authorities he found the boy wandering in the street, Lopez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sosa was praised for "finding" the first child and hailed as a hero, garnering 
widespread media attention. Lopez said Sosa had expected to get a $25,000 
reward posted for the second boy.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; STUDENTS 
STAGE WALKOUT TO PROTEST OVERCROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several hundred students at Pasadena's John Muir High School left classes 
Wednesday to protest overcrowded conditions and a dearth of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bell sounded at 9 a.m., the students poured out of their classrooms, 
waving banners and yelling.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to say that right now we're all crowded in our classrooms," one 
student bellowed through a loudspeaker. "We've got 48 people in our classroom. 
How crowded are we going to get?"  
</P>
<P>
 The protest lasted about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Vera Vignes, superintendent of the district, said, "I'm going to work with 
the school on looking at the schedule, trying to balance those classes."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WHITTIER; 12-YEAR-OLD 
CHARGED WITH MURDER IN DEATH OF FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old boy has been charged with second-degree murder in the August 
shooting death of his 13-year-old friend, which sheriff's detectives had 
initially ruled an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were filed this week against the boy, whose name was withheld, said 
sheriff's spokesman Matthew Rodriguez.  
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Barrera, 13, slept over at a friend's house the night before he died. He 
and two buddies were playing with guns that his friend had found in a locked 
gun cabinet.  
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old put one round in a .357 magnum pistol, "pointed it at Jorge 
and pulled the trigger," Rodriguez said. "The gun fired and struck Barrera in 
the chest."

CITY CRACKS DOWN ON LIVING CONDITIONS IN HOUSING CLUSTER; INSPECTION: OPERATION 
TARGETS 21 OWNERS OF 80 BUNGALOWS ALONG WESTERN AVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Rosa Maria Gutierrez Diaz goes to get clothes for her grandchildren, she 
has to be careful she doesn't scoop up a handful of roaches along with tiny 
shirts, blouses and socks. 
</P>
<P>
 The insects swarm through dressers in the family's South-Central Los Angeles 
bungalow, scurrying through the kitchen and under the beds. "Sometimes it feels 
like they're carrying me," Gutierrez Diaz, 41, said through a translator 
Thursday as building inspectors examined the cramped quarters, which house 14 
members of the extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 The bungalow, and Rosa Maria's place next door, were among the 80 units that 
inspectors from the city's health, fire and building and safety departments 
swept through Thursday in an operation dubbed "Slumbust Plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas after neighbors and residents 
complained about the conditions in the cluster of bungalows along Western 
Avenue between 94th and 92nd streets, the operation targets the 21 owners of 
the units. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should have to hover over their infants to protect them from flies and 
roaches," said Ridley-Thomas, who led reporters through the bungalows. He said 
the operation would be a "full-court press to force the owners to comply with 
the law and display human dignity toward these tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 citations were issued for violations ranging from electrical and 
plumbing problems to faulty foundations. Owners will face up to six months in 
jail and a $1,000 fine if they don't fix the problems, city officials said. But 
some of the owners say they're not to blame for the poor living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid extra money for waste collectors to pick up the trash from the 
property, but the tenants themselves would throw garbage wherever they wanted 
to," Martha Figueroa, co-owner of four bungalows, said in Spanish. "I live in a 
rented house and I take care of it, fumigating for cockroaches or fleas when 
needed," said Figueroa, who owns Gutierrez's bungalow. "Many times it seems 
that tenants burden the landlords with 100% of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants will be taught to keep the area clean, said Leo Fuller, a building 
inspector who added that living in substandard conditions saps tenant morale 
and discourages them from keeping sanitary residences. The area's upkeep is the 
responsibility of both tenants and property owners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bags of rotting trash and hordes of flies clog the alleys between the rickety 
units. The grass in front of the bungalows has grown up to knee level, rising 
over more trash bags left by the sidewalk. Many bungalows have holes in the 
walls, and some units lack heat and have little, if any, electricity. Residents 
and police say the area is troubled by gangs and drug dealers as well as by 
rodents and cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't do anything about it, they should tear it down," said Steve 
Batiste, 63, as officials toured the slum. Batiste has lived in a nearby house 
for 31 years, and said the dilapidated buildings used to be tidy and quiet 
senior citizen residences.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside the buildings, tenants said they were frustrated with their living 
conditions. Uriostosui Villanueva said she and her family of four have had to 
get along with no running water in their bungalow. She stopped paying the $460 
rent in May. When she calls her landlord to complain about conditions, she 
added, he hangs up on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hicks, a city housing department official, said fixing the problems along 
Western is a daunting task. "In my other neighborhoods I don't have as dramatic 
a problem as I do on 92nd Street," he said, citing the "deplorable" conditions 
inside the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the buildings are technically one-family units, they are only 
inspected when complaints are filed, city officials said, and none have been 
filed until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Keith Thomas of the LAPD's 77th Street Division said that while he 
doesn't know if any residents of the bungalows are drug dealers, the area is a 
favorite dealing ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a place that's bad. Dope dealers say, 'This is so run down, people 
wouldn't care if we live here,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hector Canino, Villanueva's landlord who was cited by Ridley-Thomas as the 
worst offender, said he has tried to improve living conditions in the area, 
only to see gangs and drug dealers destroy his property and chase out 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a thing I can do unless I take the law into my own hands," said 
Canino, who added that he once spent a night in one of the bungalows to see if 
it was as bad as people said, and was terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained that police have not responded to requests to stop vandals from 
ripping out carpeting and appliances, as well as Villanueva's water system. "I 
cannot have a security guard over there all day," he said, pointing out that 
he's no longer getting rent from his sole remaining tenant. "I don't know what 
to do anymore. I am not a millionaire."

EX-CHIEF'S AIDE TO RUN SUBWAY PROJECT; TRANSIT: MTA NAMES JOHN J. ADAMS AS 
CONSTRUCTION CHIEF TO REPLACE OUSTED MCSPEDON. INTERIM MANAGER SAYS HE WILL NOT 
SEEK THE POST PERMANENTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Thursday named a top 
aide of ousted MTA executive Edward McSpedon to serve as interim construction 
chief while the agency works to win back federal funding for the Los Angeles 
subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White named John J. Adams, 61, vice 
president of construction with the MTA's Rail Construction Corp., as McSpedon's 
temporary replacement. Adams will serve until a nationwide search for a 
permanent construction chief is completed. He said he will not apply for the 
$131,833-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' former boss was removed this week by White, who said the agency needed 
a new direction in light of the Federal Transit Administration's decision last 
week to suspend $1.6 billion in funding for the subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Adams served as a top aide to McSpedon, White stressed that the 
appointment was temporary and would provide the "experience and continuity the 
MTA needs in its rail construction programs while we seek a permanent 
executive." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a respected professional with decades of experience who will give us 
strong interim leadership as we move forward with our efforts to restore public 
confidence in the rail program," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, who joined the now defunct Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
in 1985 and became vice president of construction in 1990, said: "I'd like to 
focus on the future, not the past." 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting Adams, White said he took into account the morale at the RCC. He 
said Adams is a construction veteran who is well respected by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said he had no objections to Adams' 
appointment so long as it is temporary. "He's part of the old guard," Katz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz has called for elimination of the RCC. White has said that the agency 
still needs a construction chief even if the RCC is eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, urged that the state also freeze funding for subway construction 
until local transit officials show that they can competently manage the 
project.

68 TEACHERS GET REPRIEVE ON TRANSFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half the Los Angeles teachers facing transfers because of low 
enrollment won a temporary reprieve Thursday, but about 70 will be sent to 
other campuses, leaving schools to reorganize classes and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson agreed Thursday to leave in place for at least four months 
68 Los Angeles Unified School District elementary teachers at schools where 
enrollments fell short by eight or fewer students. The four months would give 
the affected schools time to see if enrollment increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers will be transferred immediately from schools where the gap between 
actual and expected enrollment is more than eight students. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher transfers have become an annual rite in the massive school 
district, but the January earthquake left campuses -- especially those in the 
San Fernando Valley -- with lower than expected enrollments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At those campuses, dozens -- even hundreds -- of students failed to enroll 
when classes began a month ago; teachers at those schools will be transferred 
after the district takes its official enrollment tally today. They will be sent 
to campuses with higher enrollments and not enough teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was met with anger at some campuses that did not meet the enrollment 
requirements, and joy at others. Over the past several weeks, parents worked 
feverishly to try to persuade the district to keep the teachers at all the 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a one-semester, one-time waiver for the fall semester," Assistant 
Supt. Irene Yamahara said. "There still will be teacher movement . . . but it 
won't be nearly as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several weeks, Valley parents, teachers and students have held 
rallies to protest the transfers, saying that more disruption -- on top of the 
trauma suffered by students from the earthquake -- would be too much for the 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein, who tried to persuade district officials 
to keep the teachers at the schools in the hardest-hit areas, said she was 
delighted by Thompson's decision. "I am very pleased that we are able to help 
many of these schools," she said. "We're all sighing with relief -- especially 
in the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful -- absolutely wonderful," said Lorie Norwalt, principal at 
Calabash Street School in Woodland Hills, where one first-grade teacher would 
have been transferred because the school was one student short. "It's a relief, 
really. We're elated." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to leave teachers at the 64 schools will cost the district about 
$800,000. If Thompson had kept all the teachers at the campuses with low 
enrollments, it could have cost the system $2.3 million, officials said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY TO SPRAY TREES TO ERADICATE INSECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prolific insect that lives in Indian laurel trees, also known as laurel 
figs, has sparked numerous complaints to the city's Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban laurel thrips, which are tiny and black with a shiny surface, do not 
seriously harm trees but do cause leaves to curl where the bugs incubate. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers have been increasing in Southern California. The bug migrated 
from Cuba to the United States in 1955 and arrived in Orange County in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spray trees to control the insect. Spraying will be done on an 
on-call basis only. Residents can call (714) 536-5480 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
Monday through Friday to schedule a spraying appointment.

SOME TV STATIONS DROP ANTI-SMOKING AD; HEALTH: STATE-FUNDED COMMERCIAL SHOWS 
TOBACCO EXECUTIVES TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS. R.J. REYNOLDS CHAIRMAN HAS 
THREATENED LIBEL ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some California television stations, including KABC in Los Angeles, have 
dropped a state-funded anti-smoking ad after being threatened with a libel 
action by the chairman of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. -- one of four top 
tobacco industry executives shown testifying before Congress that nicotine is 
not addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to S. Kimberly Belshe, director of the state Department of Health 
Services, which paid for the commercial, lawyers for R.J. Reynolds Chairman 
James W. Johnston say that the ad falsely makes it appear that Johnston was 
lying to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar letters were sent to the 22 California television stations carrying 
the ad -- one of a series in an anti-smoking education program paid for by a 
special 25-cent-a-pack cigarette tax approved by the state's voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad begins with top tobacco company executives taking an oath to tell the 
truth in their testimony before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In one brief sequence, Johnston is shown testifying: "Cigarettes and nicotine 
clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction. There is no 
intoxication." 
</P>
<P>
 Faintly in the background, the segment repeats the voice of the congressman 
who chaired the hearing saying the words "under oath." 
</P>
<P>
 After other executives also deny that nicotine is addictive, an announcer 
states: "Now the tobacco industry is trying to tell us that secondhand smoke 
isn't dangerous." Then appearing on the screen are the words: "Do they think 
we're stupid?" 
</P>
<P>
 In their letter to state health officials, Johnston's attorneys contend that 
the producers of the ad took "electronic liberties" in making the commercial. 
"The effect intended, and accomplished, was to suggest to the viewers that the 
words 'under oath, under oath,' were said at the hearing," they wrote. "The 
addition of these words creates the perception that Mr. Johnston committed 
perjury." 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded response, Belshe denied that the ad defamed Johnston. She 
complained of heavy-handed tactics. "It has come to my attention that threats 
of legal action have been used in an attempt to coerce individual stations to 
remove these commercials from the air. This strong-arm tactic to subvert the 
intent of the voter-approved Proposition 99 media campaign constitutes an 
objectionable act of desperation." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Belshe reiterated that the health department sticks 
by its ad. "We flatly deny allegations of defamation," she said. "The issue of 
the ads is not the veracity of any individual. The issue of the ads is the 
credibility of the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the repetition of the words "under oath" was "an artistic device" not 
intended to be taken for what was said during Johnston's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC official Georgia Seid said her station's reasons for halting the 
commercial would have to come from Capital Cities-ABC in New York. But she 
confirmed that the station had asked the Department of Health Services to 
modify the commercial, which state officials refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
 According to department spokesman Kenneth A. August, station KBHK in San 
Francisco also dropped the ad.

HUFFINGTON RENEWS POLITICAL ATTACKS; CAMPAIGN: IN NEWPORT BEACH SPEECH, SENATE 
CANDIDATE GOES ON OFFENSIVE. HE ALSO DEFENDS HIS LEGISLATIVE RECORD AND 
DEFLECTS QUESTIONS ABOUT ROLE OF FAMILY BUSINESS IN POLLUTION AT OIL REFINERY.

 Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington preached more family values, 
less government and repeatedly assailed opponent Sen. Dianne Feinstein's record 
during a luncheon address Thursday at the Le Meridian Newport Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a mostly partisan crowd of about 500 people, Huffington said he sees 
his campaign as "an opportunity to send shock waves not only through California 
but across America." 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to a question from the audience, he vowed to announce his position 
on Proposition 187 -- the anti-illegal immigrant initiative, before Election 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by his wife, Arianna, and their two daughters, the Santa Barbara 
congressman also said the breakdown in the family is the root of many of the 
country's ills, from crime to teen-age pregnancy to low SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to turn this country around, we can't depend on the U.S. 
government," he said. "It comes back to us. To our children and teaching them 
the virtues and values that we grew up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington called for abolishing the current welfare system, contending that 
money for the poor should be allocated by local governments using funds made 
available from Washington through community block grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the old system doesn't work," said Huffington, who also said he 
supports giving a bigger tax break for charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of Huffington's speech, however, focused on Democrat 
Feinstein, who is battling him in a close contest for the Senate seat. 
Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992 to complete the truncated term of 
Pete Wilson, who resigned to become governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington accused Feinstein of flip-flopping on several issues, including the 
death penalty and health care reform, and criticized her for voting against the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, saying she was swayed by contributions 
from labor unions, which opposed the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had $3 million worth of reasons for voting against it," he said. "That's 
why I don't take Political Action Committee money." 
</P>
<P>
 He also blasted Feinstein for supporting cuts in the nation's defense budget, 
which he said has resulted in the loss of 179,000 jobs in California and caused 
low morale in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first priority of the United States government should be the defense of 
the United States," he said, "We have a President and two senators who don't 
agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he would support cuts of up to $60 billion in the defense 
budget and said Feinstein favored $135 billion in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign spokesman Bill Chandler responded by accusing Huffington of 
sour grapes and said the senator is a staunch supporter of the state's defense 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He simply hasn't told the truth about his own record or Sen. Feinstein's 
record," Chandler said. "It will be interesting when he puts aside the cue 
cards and speaks from the heart. It will be interesting to see if he has 
anything to say. Right now, all he is doing is trying to trash his opponent and 
her record without providing a vision for California." 
</P>
<P>
 During the question-answer session, Huffington was asked about Proposition 
187, which would deny social services, education and all but emergency health 
care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for immigration, but legal immigration," he said. "My wife had to wait 
five years to become legal. People should go through the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington grew testy when asked about his own legislative record. He 
attributed his inability to get legislation passed to the Democrats' control of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me give a short course in Government 101," he said. "The Democrats 
control the House, the Senate and the White House. The deck is totally stacked 
against us." 
</P>
<P>
 On his way both in and out of the hotel appearance, reporters asked Huffington 
about a report in Thursday's Times disclosing that his family's company had 
owned a 20% stake during the 1980s in a Paramount refinery that left behind a 
trail of environmental damage. Pollutants have spread into local ground water 
and soil, and it may now cost millions of dollars to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a minority shareholder and had no management role whatsoever," 
Huffington said, charging that the Feinstein camp aims to create a shadow issue 
out of the refinery.

POP NOTES: SECOND SHOW TO LIGHT UP FIRECRACKER LOUNGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some good news from the grass-roots arena: The Firecracker Lounge hasn't 
fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, after about two months of operation, promoter Tom Dumont is expanding 
from one show a week to two at the cozy all-ages venue, which is the upstairs 
lounge at the Cattleman's Wharf restaurant, 1160 West Ball Road, Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been really happy with it," reports Dumont, who is the guitarist in the 
popular Anaheim ska-rock band No Doubt. "We've been nicely full pretty much 
every night," drawing an average of about 70 or 80 people to the Sunday night 
shows. With that modest success, Dumont will light up the Firecracker Lounge on 
Thursdays as well, starting Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled shows include: Gameface and Enswell, this Sunday; Boxcar Wino and 
Dashboard Prophets, Oct. 23; Supernovice and Iron-Ons, Oct. 27; the Canid Show, 
Oct. 30; the Grabbers, Nov. 3, and Larry and Joker Pickles Reaction, Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows start at 10 p.m., and admission is $3. Taped information: (714) 
502-9827.

<P>
 John Easdale's mostly acoustic show at the Firecracker Lounge on Sunday night 
marked the start of a new career phase for the former Dramarama singer. 
</P>
<P>
 With Dramarama having split, or, depending which ex-member you talk to, gone 
on indefinite, long-term hiatus, Easdale has been working up new songs to 
launch a new band and win a new recording contract. He'll be playing a few new 
songs, along with a bunch of Dramarama oldies, at his next show, Oct. 27, at 
Club 369 in Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 Easdale's backup consists of one new associate, lead guitarist Brian Williams, 
and one old one, guitarist-keyboards player Tom Mullaney, who served as an 
unofficial, adjunct member of Dramarama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to do the big showcases. I just want to start from the 
grass-roots," said the La Habra-based Easdale, who is wary of venturing into 
Hollywood until his new direction has become well-established. "I haven't 
pegged it yet, so I don't want anybody else to." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides trying to write his own next career chapter, Easdale (who doesn't rule 
out a Dramarama reunion at some unspecified time in the future) has been 
helping some fledgling Orange County bands launch careers by producing demo 
recordings. So far, he has done production for Redpoint and Shiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama, meanwhile, may be placing its legacy in hands that have served many 
a deserving but underappreciated rock band. Easdale said a deal is close with 
Rhino Records, the highly regarded archival label, to re-release Dramarama's 
first two albums, "Cinema Verite" and "Box Office Bomb," as well as a "Best of" 
compilation, spanning the band's career and including rare and previously 
unreleased tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhino's interest means that eggBERT Records, a Fullerton label run by 
Easdale's friend, Greg Dwinnell, will not proceed with "Senseless Fun," the 
Dramarama rarities album that had been set for a late September release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legally, I could put the record out this minute," Dwinnell said, but that 
might sour the prospective Rhino deal. "John Easdale is my friend. He has four 
children (actually three, with a fourth on the way) and does not have a job or 
a major contract right now. There's a fair amount of change on the table, and I 
don't want to be pigheaded." 
</P>
<P>
 eggBERT recently released "Looking Through," a 1989 album that Dramarama 
originally issued only in Europe under the pseudonym Bent Backed Tulips. 
eggBERT's recent Bee Gees tribute album, "Melody Fair," has won strong reviews, 
and Dwinnell said he is now busy compiling a similar tribute project in which 
contemporary alternative-underground rockers cover their favorite Hollies 
songs.

COMPANY TOWN; TOP DOLLAR FOR MOVIE IDEA; SCREENWRITER ESZTERHAS GETS A 
RECORD-SETTING DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Star screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, best known for penning the erotic thriller 
"Basic Instinct," wowed Hollywood on Thursday with another record-breaking 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line Cinema agreed to pay him $2.5 million cash upfront and additional 
$1.5 million when cameras roll for four pages of "notes and thoughts" on a love 
story that he and director Adrian Lyne will " shape into a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Eszterhas -- already one of the highest-paid screenwriters in 
the business -- will receive 2.5% of all revenue New Line collects from the 
movie after $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas' agent, Guy McElwaine of International Creative Management, said, 
"No one has ever paid this for a movie idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyne, whose directorial screen credits include the hits "Indecent Proposal" 
and "Fatal Attraction" -- will direct the Eszterhas story, titled "One Night 
Stand." Eszterhas describes the piece as "a small-scale love story with a 
universal theme that explores marital fidelity and intimate relationships in 
the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas, whose controversial off-camera life became highly public when he 
left his wife of 24 years for one of their best friends (whom he married in 
July), concedes, "It's my own personal script written from the heart." However, 
the writer says that while he was inspired by his real-life experiences, the 
story of "One Night Stand" does not exactly parallel that situation. Rather, 
the movie centers on the ramifications and complications that arise when two 
married people meet and have a one-night stand on a business trip in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line, owned by Ted Turner, will pay Lyne a $250,000 development fee to 
work on "One Night Stand" and a director's fee of $7 million once the movie 
starts shooting. That is $1 million more than the $6 million Lyne will be paid 
to direct "Lolita" for Carolco Pictures and $2 million more than he received to 
direct last year's "Indecent Proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Line Chairman Robert Shaye says he expects to shoot "One Night Stand" 
early next year and have it ready for release in 1996, when the company also 
plans to have such high-profile movies in the marketplace as the sequel to its 
summer hit, "The Mask." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why New Line would pay such a huge sum for a movie proposal, Shaye said, 
"With Joe Eszterhas and Adrian Lyne, you're more than investing in an idea, 
you're investing in a film with a world- class screenwriter and director who 
can attract world-class talent." The New Line chief said he regards the 
four-page pitch more as "a completed package than notes on a piece of paper." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of "One Night Stand," in which New Line beat out Cinergi 
Prods./Hollywood Pictures and Savoy Pictures, marks the second high-ticket 
piece of material for the New York-based independent company in the last 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 In late July, New Line paid a record $4 million for Shane Black's script "The 
Long Kiss Goodnight," which Renny Harlin is to direct with his actress wife, 
Geena Davis, in the lead role. Production on that movie is also pending the 
fate of the couple's soon-to-shoot pirate movie, "Cutthroat Island," which is 
in pre-production in Malta. It is in jeopardy of having its plug pulled if 
Carolco fails to get sorely needed production funds to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Carolco is in the process of selling off rights to Eszterhas' 
script "Showgirls" to French media giant Chargeurs, to help fund the production 
of "Cutthroat." 
</P>
<P>
 It was last year that Eszterhas sold a pitch for "Showgirls," a rock musical, 
for more than $1.5 million. He subsequently auctioned the actual script to 
Carolco Pictures for $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Eszterhas became the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood with his 
record $3-million sale of "Basic Instinct" to Carolco. He later sold the 
courtroom thriller "Jade" to Paramount for $2.2 million. It is set to begin 
production Jan. 10 with William Friedkin directing and former "NYPD Blue" star 
David Caruso in the lead role. It too was originally sold as a four-page 
outline to Weintraub Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5 million upfront for "One Night Stand" is the highest price anyone has 
ever been paid to write an original script from an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 That beats the $1.6 million against $3.4 million that producer Jon Peters 
agreed to pay Eszterhas to adapt a book about Mafia kingpin John Gotti for 
Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, the high-profile screenwriter made a ground-breaking deal when he 
sold the rock 'n' roll mystery "Foreplay" to Savoy for $1 million against a 
total of $3.5 million. HOLLYWOOD THRILLER 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Eszterhas is one of Hollywood's leading screenwriters, with sexually 
charged thrillers such as "Basic Instinct" to his credit. He also penned the 
screen adaptation of "Sliver," which failed domestically but attracted big 
audiences overseas. Eszterhas' latest idea brought in record-setting fee from 
New Line Cinema.

STARLINE/GRAY LINE TOUR BUSES ARE SEIZED BY THE IRS; TOURISM: AN AGENCY 
SPOKESMAN SAYS THE COMPANY FAILED TO TURN OVER $733,191 OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Starline/Gray Line Tours in Los Angeles, which provides tours of movie stars' 
homes and other Southern California attractions, ceased operations Thursday 
after many of its buses were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have suspended all tour and charter operations at this point," said Neal 
Saltzer, a tour representative for the company. "We are not taking 
reservations." 
</P>
<P>
 By late Thursday, telephone calls to the firm's Hollywood office were answered 
by a recording that asked anyone who wanted future reservations to leave a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS padlocked Starline/Gray Line's depot in South-Central Los Angeles, 
where many of the firm's 200 buses are parked, at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, Saltzer 
said. He said the exact number of buses seized was unclear, because some of the 
firm's vehicles were still on long-distance trips and not in the depot. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS spokesman Keith Kimball in Los Angeles confirmed the seizure, saying it 
occurred because of Starline/Gray Line's failure to turn over $733,191 owed to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The sum covered funds withheld from employees' paychecks for federal income 
taxes and Social Security, along with the firm's matching Social Security 
payments, for the period April, 1993, through March, 1994, Kimball said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour operator employs about 300 people, Saltzer said, adding that there 
have not yet been any layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the IRS' claim, Saltzer said the issue of tax liability "is pretty 
much acknowledged by everyone within the corporation" and that the firm is 
scheduled to meet with the IRS on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray Line, a venerable name in the sightseeing business nationwide, is also 
perhaps the best-known among dozens of lines in Southern California that offer 
tourists an up-close look at greater Los Angeles and its attractions, as well 
as providing charter transportation for groups traveling to Disneyland, 
Universal Studios and other amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Starline/Gray Line also provided long-distance tours to such areas as San 
Francisco and Yosemite National Park, Saltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its tax troubles, Starline/Gray Line is not supposed to even be 
using the Gray Line name, according to Gray Line Worldwide in Dallas, the 
association that licenses the trademark to privately owned tour operators and 
provides general sales and marketing assistance for the Gray Line system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ordered them to cease using the name about a month ago because they were 
in violation of the association's bylaws," said Jack Haugsland, president of 
Gray Line Worldwide. He declined to describe the alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Starline/Gray Line is believed to be owned by Vahid Sapir, among others, 
though neither Saltzer nor the IRS would identify the owners. However, 
Starline/Gray Line was created in 1989 when Starline Sightseeing Tours, then 
owned by Sapir and his brother, acquired the Gray Line operations in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties.  
</P>
<P>
 Sapir and his brother, Fred, started their transportation company in the late 
1960s when they bought a fleet of limousines to chauffeur guests of Sid 
Grauman, builder of what is now Mann's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. 
Neither of the Sapirs could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gray Line system began in 1918 as a single tour bus in Washington, which 
provided customers with a two-hour tour of the nation's capital for 10 cents. 
By the mid-1970s, more than 10,000 buses carrying the Gray Line logo were 
providing tours across North America.

WHOLESALE PRICES DIP, EASING INFLATION FEARS; ECONOMY: FIGURES ARE SURPRISING 
AFTER HEFTY INCREASES OF JULY AND AUGUST. WALL STREET STARTS OFF GIDDY, CALMS 
DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wholesale prices took a surprising fall in September, their biggest 
month-to-month drop in more than a year, the Labor Department reported 
Thursday, temporarily easing investor fears that inflation is getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.5% from August on a 
seasonally adjusted basis, due mainly to lower energy and food prices and an 
unexpected fall in the price of automobiles, the department said. It was the 
largest decline since a 0.8% drop in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline was especially surprising because it came on the heels of a 0.5% 
increase in July and a 0.6% jump in August. Through September, wholesale price 
inflation was running at a 1.9% annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when volatile energy and food prices were excluded, the so-called core 
component of the index increased only 0.1% in September, well below both 
economists' expectations and August's 0.4% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that inflation really doesn't look as bad as everybody thought," 
said Labor Department economist Scott Sager. "This month's report should put a 
lot of fears to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors initially welcomed the news before moderating their enthusiasm later 
in the day in anticipation of key government price and economic reports due out 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 50 points in the first 15 
minutes of trading, triggering the New York Stock Exchange's program-trading 
controls, before settling down and closing 14.80 points higher at 3,889.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the 30-year Treasury bond yield dropped to 7.85% from 7.90% on 
Wednesday. Earlier in the day, the yield -- a bellwether of long-term interest 
rates -- fell as low as 7.76%. 
</P>
<P>
 How significant is Thursday's news? That will depend in part on a raft of 
indicators to be released today, including September consumer price data, 
manufacturing production and retail sales numbers. Economists doubted the 
consumer price index would reflect the sharp decline in wholesale prices, at 
least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, economists believed that Thursday's news would not deter the Fed 
from boosting short-term rates again when its rate-setting Open Market 
Committee meets Nov. 15. They foresaw the Fed bumping up rates between a 
quarter to half a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (August's) producer price index probably grossly exaggerated how high 
inflation was, and this one overstates the weakness in inflation," said Anthony 
Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. "We're 
probably somewhere in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Falling energy prices contributed most to the decline in the producer price 
index, Sager said. Prices of finished energy goods, including gasoline and 
heating oil, fell a sharp 2.9% in September, their biggest decline since 
December. Prices also declined for residential electric power after rising in 
August. The declines reflect a worldwide glut of crude oil on the world market 
relative to demand, Reaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the surprises in the index was the fall in the price of passenger cars, 
since the industry has been touting its lean inventories. They dipped 1.1% in 
September, the largest decline since a 2.6% drop in October, 1993, the Labor 
Department said. They had increased 0.7% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline was all the more striking since the figures are seasonally 
adjusted, taking into account the normal price declines that come with the end 
of the automobile model year. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers competing for year-end business have been discounting their 
leftover 1994 models more than usual in an attempt to clear them out before 
1995 models arrive, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for finished foods dropped 0.2% after rising 0.7% in August. The 
largest component of that was coffee, which reported a record 10.3% drop in 
prices. Prices of roasted coffee had soared 12% in August and a whopping 42.8% 
in July in the wake of damaging frosts in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for state 
unemployment benefits fell to 314,000 in the week ended Oct. 8, from a revised 
319,000 the week before. Producer Price Index

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: HOLLYWOOD TRIO'S OPTIONS: BUY MCA OR BUILD A DREAM

<P>
 If you want to give yourself a crushing migraine, try figuring out what 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen truly have in mind for 
their new company. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days ago they announced grandiose plans to create a studio from the ground 
up -- something no one has successfully pulled off in years. Now, with the din 
of Hollywood's hosannas still ringing in their ears, there are reports that the 
three are actually lying in wait to buy an equity stake in MCA Inc., the parent 
of Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there's no point in building a full-service studio if you're already 
buying part of an existing company, one of the scenarios has to be wrong. But 
don't look for any quick clarification. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen on Thursday said the three 
remain fully committed to creating their dream company. At the same time, the 
sources conceded that their position could change -- should MCA or another 
company become available down the line. That suggests their stand-alone studio 
will move ahead -- until it stops . . . or doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington that's called doublespeak. In Hollywood it's called keeping your 
options open. "Buying a piece of a studio is not what they're looking to do," 
said one observer. "But building one will take five to seven years, and these 
are impatient guys." 
</P>
<P>
 They are also very rich, talented guys who are likely to succeed at whatever 
they do. But there's a big difference in the strategies. Creating a studio out 
of whole cloth is an audacious move that could change the fabric of the 
industry. Glomming onto an existing studio structure is not nearly as daring or 
revolutionary, even though it might be more sensible -- since the three 
executives could have MCA's resources at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, the former Walt Disney Studios chairman; Spielberg, Hollywood's 
most successful director, and Geffen, the industry's savviest entrepreneur, are 
seen as the most formidable entertainment team to band together in decades. 
Rumors that the trio might back an MCA bid are tied to reports that Chairman 
Lew R. Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg are in troubled negotiations 
with parent Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita is said to have infuriated Wasserman and Sheinberg by repeatedly 
denying their bids to expand the company, most recently their plan to seek a 
25% stake in General Electric's NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level sources say Wasserman and Sheinberg could try to lead a 51% buyback 
of the company they sold to Matsushita in 1990. The popular scenario has 
Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen joining in the acquisition to further their 
pre-existing relationships: Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment is already based 
at MCA's Universal, and Geffen is under contract there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say that playing the Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen card would also be a 
great way for Wasserman and Sheinberg to strengthen their hand in the 
negotiations, since Spielberg is responsible for most of the company's recent 
movie hits, including "Jurassic Park" and "Schindler's List," and Geffen for 
many of its top music acts, including Counting Crows. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources confirmed that Wasserman and Sheinberg are flying to Hawaii for 
meetings with Matsushita executives Tuesday. But one knowledgeable executive 
said Matsushita called the meeting, not MCA, and that the buyback plan might 
not be discussed there. Another said Matsushita had been open to selling part 
of the company, if it could be done in a way that would not cause the company 
to lose face, until word of the possible sale leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA and the Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen team declined to comment on the talks. 
Asked if the company is for sale, Matsushita issued a statement in Japan saying 
" . . . we have no knowledge about it, and it cannot be true . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts value MCA at about $12 billion, based on recent entertainment company 
deals. That means a buyer would need more than $6 billion to acquire a majority 
stake. Naysayers question why Wasserman, at 81, and Sheinberg, at 59, would 
want to mount such a costly bid. Moreover, they say that if MCA wanted 
Katzenberg so badly, it could have offered him a job before he had time to put 
together his partnership with Spielberg and Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 Others flatly reject the idea that so many pieces will fall into place -- 
starting with Matsushita selling and ending with all of the parties agreeing on 
power sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg, Spielberg and Geffen have said they plan to rely on MCA for some 
services initially, even if they aren't involved in a company acquisition. If 
Wasserman and Sheinberg depart, the new company would probably align with Time 
Warner, where they also have ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps only "E.T." understands what's going through their minds as they weigh 
the options. People close to the executives say they may be more committed to 
the romantic ideal of reinventing Hollywood than to actually following through 
with their plan to create a streamlined, artist-friendly company. Katzenberg's 
divorce from Disney came only six weeks ago, and the three agreed to form their 
company just two days before their announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has no name, budget or business plan. Still, it's hard to imagine 
that Katzenberg had MCA in mind when he told a hushed news conference 
Wednesday: "There's an opportunity for us here to have a revolution."

 Earth to The Biz: Lew Irwin takes issue with this column for crediting 
James-Paul Brown for the Earth News Radio program that ran from 1972 through 
1984. Irwin says he carried the creative burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Irwin says it's unfair to describe Earth News Radio's "consciousness" 
as "psychedelic." Oh, well. It seemed psychedelic. Maybe it was just the times. 
What's in a Name? 
</P>
<P>
 In case the new "dream team" of Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David 
Geffen has trouble coming up with a name for its new studio, here are a few 
possibilities:  
</P>
<P>
 1. The Pep Boys 
</P>
<P>
 2. Hakuna Matata This, Michael 
</P>
<P>
 3. Egos R Us

JUDGE DISMISSES SUITS AGAINST CIGARETTE FIRM; COURTS: HE TELLS FAMILY OF WOMAN 
WHO DIED LAST YEAR OF LUNG CANCER THAT ONLY ONE WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION CAN BE 
FILED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles small claims court judge Thursday blocked an attempt by the 
family of a woman who died of lung cancer to use the Municipal Court to pursue 
damages against the Lorillard Inc. tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
 In dismissing the case in which the family of the late Della Koenigshofer 
sought to pursue a novel strategy for making cigarette companies liable for 
smoking-related deaths, Municipal Court Judge Carl J. West said, "This isn't 
the court to hear these arguments."  
</P>
<P>
 The case against Lorillard, which makes the Kent cigarettes Koenigshofer 
smoked for years before her death last year, could not be pursued because the 
"breach of warranty" claim brought by the family would have had to have been 
filed by the consumer of the cigarettes, West told the Koenigshofer family. 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuing actions against five cigarette companies that produced brands 
Della Koenigshofer smoked, the Koenigshofer family filed a flurry of lawsuits 
in different small claims courts. Della Koenigshofer's husband, George A. 
Koenigshofer, his son, George Allen Koenigshofer and grandson Paul Koenigshofer 
filed the Los Angeles suit dismissed by West. 
</P>
<P>
 A Koenigshofer daughter and three other sons filed several still-pending suits 
in small claims court in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 West told the family members that only one wrongful death action can be filed 
and that the suits would have to be consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 The family expressed frustration at not being able to produce what it says is 
evidence that the tobacco company failed to adhere to the provisions of the 
civil code. 
</P>
<P>
 "They failed to meet the conditions for immunity, and we will prove that if 
given the chance," said George Allen Koenigshofer. 
</P>
<P>
 The family may appeal to a higher court but may not refile in Los Angeles 
small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 James G. Bohm, an attorney for Lorillard, said the company was pleased with 
the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Della Koenigshofer was 70 when she died but came from a long-lived family, her 
children said. Koenigshofer smoked Lorillard's Kent cigarettes during the years 
she lived in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, while living in Hemet, the family said, she smoked various brands made 
by Philip Morris, Reynolds, American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson and Liggett 
Group -- all of which are named in the Riverside cases.

MCI, 2 BABY BELLS REPORTEDLY IN TALKS FOR JOINT WIRELESS BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MCI Communications Corp. is in talks with regional Bell companies Bell 
Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. about joint bids for wireless licenses being 
auctioned in December, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though talks with MCI were "substantive," it would be premature to rule out 
Sprint Corp. as an ally of the two Baby Bells as well, said the sources, who 
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are moving so rapidly, the talks are turning on dimes," one of the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen at each company declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government will hold the "personal communications systems" auction 
in December to sell off frequencies now used for taxi dispatch and similar 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 With modern technology, these frequencies can be used to build networks of 
mobile phones, which have the features of cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 For both MCI and Sprint, each of which has little in the way of mobile 
communications assets, this will be a vital opportunity to build a national 
network to rival AT&T Co.'s following its $11.5-billion takeover of McCaw 
Cellular Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 But with industry estimates that up to $30 billion may be thrown into the ring 
to win the available frequencies, even the big long-distance carriers need 
deep-pocketed allies to share the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic and Nynex are already in the process of merging their wireless 
licenses, which run along an essentially unbroken corridor from Boston to 
Washington in an area with 25% of the nation's population. 
</P>
<P>
 For MCI, an alliance would mean access to the Baby Bells' substantial cash 
reserves and would allow that money to be targeted at less expensive, less 
densely populated areas outside existing license areas.

CONVERSION INDUSTRIES CEO QUITS IN WAKE OF COMPANY'S DELISTING; SECURITIES: THE 
HEAD OF THE MERCHANT BANKING FIRM CITES ADVERSE PUBLICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief executive of embattled Conversion Industries resigned Thursday, two 
days after the American Stock Exchange decided to delist the Pasadena-based 
company's stock over disclosure issues. 
</P>
<P>
 John P. McGrain, 49, said in a statement that he decided to leave Conversion 
because "the adverse publicity I have received as chairman has detracted from 
shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion has operated as a merchant banking firm since 1991, investing in 
small companies and facilitating public stock offerings for those firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But shares of many of those companies, and of Conversion itself, have 
plummeted in value this year. Financial ties among McGrain, Conversion, its 
spinoff companies and Colorado brokerage Tamaron Investments have also 
generated controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare action, the American Stock Exchange said Tuesday that it would 
delist shares of Conversion and one of its spinoffs, Beta Well Services. The 
Amex said the firms failed to comply with certain disclosure requirements, 
which were not specified. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Conversion spinoff, Pasadena-based CVD Financial, requested a trading 
halt in its stock on the Amex on Thursday, after McGrain quit his seat on its 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Amex trading in Conversion and Beta remain suspended pending hearings the 
companies have requested with exchange officials. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrain said in his statement that he would be available to Conversion as a 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion's board, meanwhile, had no comment on McGrain's resignation or on a 
potential successor as CEO, but it is expected to make an announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion stock last traded at $1.38, down from a peak of $33.25 in 1993.

FCC CHIEF WANTS TALK RADIO SHOWS TO DEAL IN 'TRUE FACTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt called on the nation's 
broadcasters Thursday to conduct a more responsible "electronic public 
discussion" on talk radio and to improve minority hiring policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech to members of the National Assn. of Broadcasters, who were 
meeting in Los Angeles for their annual convention, Hundt urged broadcasting 
executives to ensure that talk radio focuses on "true facts" and avoid 
sensationalism and "engendering skepticism and disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
 "One-third of all talk radio listeners say they listen in order to keep up 
with current issues of public importance; only 1% say they listen because of 
the host," Hundt said in the speech, his first to the group since he became FCC 
chairman in November, 1993. "It's terribly important to the whole country that 
radio help keep us informed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt stressed that the FCC should not be the judge of content or quality in 
radio's public discourses. Rather, he urged station owners and management to 
"assume the role of publisher or even editor in chief," emphasizing accuracy 
and truth over a quest for ratings and advertising dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a society, we need solutions to public disinformation and misinformation, 
but solutions that don't involve governmental intrusion and yet don't leave us 
callously indifferent to truth or falsity," Hundt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he took the job, Hundt has established a reputation for implementing 
tough equal employment opportunity policies and has repeatedly stated his goal 
of promoting minority participation in the communications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the FCC's primary mission is to promote competition in the 
communications industries, and to that end, he encouraged radio broadcasters to 
work with the commission to develop ways to hire and promote women and 
minorities in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are our hopes for the way the picture of employment in this industry 
should look? The answer is, gee, it would be great if it could look like the 
people it serves," Hundt said in an interview with The Times on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt cited the employment potential of newer industries, such as personal 
communications services, as another way to improve minority hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have brand-new opportunities exploding left and right," he said. "If you 
deal with an established industry, like broadcasting for example, it's so 
difficult to do much of real significance about ownership, because few stations 
change hands over the course of a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the new generation of lightweight portable telephones will cause the 
growth of subscribers of mobile telephony to go from 20 million to about 100 
million over the next 10 years," Hundt said. "That growth means dozens and 
dozens of new companies, tens and literally hundreds of thousands of new jobs, 
including contracting to build the new infrastructure. In 10 years we'll be 
looking at a $50-billion-a-year mobile phone business. That's to be contrasted 
to the local telephone business today, which is about $100 billion a year." 
</P>
<P>
 In this area -- as well as in broadcasting -- Hundt sees the commission's role 
as that of watchdog. "The FCC is in effect working to become the Federal 
Promotion of Competition in All Communications Markets and Protection of 
Consumers from Monopoly Commission," he said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS SOAR ON INFLATION NEWS, THEN RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks and bonds rallied sharply early Thursday on a surprise drop in 
September wholesale prices, but retreated later in the day as caution set in 
ahead of economic reports due out today. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting up 52 points within 15 minutes of the opening bell, the Dow 
industrial average finished the day with a gain of just 14.80 points, to 
3,889.95. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond 
plummeted as low as 7.76%, then rebounded to close at 7.85%, down from 7.90% on 
Wednesday. Shorter-term yields fell by about the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the early gains was a government report that wholesale prices 
fell a surprising 0.5% in September, while economists had expected a 0.1% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 For the inflation-paranoid bond market, the report suggested that worries 
about a new upward spiral in prices as the economy expands have been grossly 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 That may eliminate the need for additional hikes in short-term interest rates 
to restrain the economy, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Solloway, research chief at Argus Research, called the data a "very 
pleasant surprise after all the fear in the buildup to the release that this 
number created." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while buyers flocked to stocks and bonds early in the day, they began to 
reconsider as trading wore on, jittery about several key economic reports due 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The government will report this morning on September consumer inflation as 
well as industrial production and retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullish analysts, noting how strong investors' appetite for stocks and bonds 
was at the outset of trading Thursday, said favorable news in today's economic 
reports could set the stage for a dramatic rally, especially in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But longer-term, some analysts warn that bond yields may not be finished 
rising, if the economy continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty likely we are going to see inflation trends worsen somewhat and 
pretty likely we'll see upcoming reports showing the economy has a fair amount 
of momentum to it," said Dana Johnson, head of market analysis for First 
Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better bet is that this isn't the end of the bear market" in bonds, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one year ago this week that the yield on 30-year T-bonds bottomed at a 
20-year low of 5.79%. The subsequent surge in interest rates over the last year 
has resulted in some of the worst bond market principal losses in history for 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Most broad stock market indexes closed with marginal gains. The NYSE 
composite index added 1.08 points to 257.43, and the Nasdaq composite index 
inched up 0.89 point to 767.89. Winners topped losers by 13 to 9 on the NYSE, 
in heavy trading of 338 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among stocks getting a lift from quarterly earnings reports, toy maker 
Hasbro gained 1 1/4 to 30 1/4, computer chip maker Altera surged 5 5/8 to 33 
5/8, chemical firm B.F. Goodrich gained 1 to 43 1/8 and publisher 
Houghton-Mifflin rocketed 3 1/8 to 43 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks falling on earnings news included Inland Steel, down 1 1/4 to 37 1/2; 
Bausch & Lomb, down 4 3/8 to 34 1/4; Three-Five Systems, off 9 1/2 to 38 1/2, 
and Raytheon, down 1 3/4 to 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, CBS tumbled 20 to 309 1/2. Prudential and PaineWebber downgraded the 
stock to "neutral" amid concern over weak earnings and disappointing TV 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many brokerage stocks got a big lift from the market's early rally. Morgan 
Stanley closed up 1 3/8 to 62 5/8, Charles Schwab soared 1 3/8 to 33 3/8 and 
PaineWebber added 5/8 to 14 7/8. But Merrill Lynch lost 3/4 to 34 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ford Motor eased 1/8 to 28 7/8 despite news that it raised the cash dividend 
on its common stock 15.5%, to 26 cents per quarter. It marks the auto giant's 
second increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas markerts, London's FTSE 100 index resumed its stunning recent 
rally, surging 41.4 points to 3,141.9. In Frankfurt, the DAX index added 5.06 
points to 2,082.63. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei-225 index gained 59.11 points to 20,148.83. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index added to Wednesday's big gains, rising 18.79 points 
to 2,759.61. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar finished mostly lower, faltering after a rally 
inspired by the favorable inflation data. The dollar closed in New York at 
99.46 Japanese yen and 1.529 German marks, down from 99.77 yen and 1.541 marks 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold prices lost ground at home and abroad. On the Comex, gold for 
current delivery slid $1.90 an ounce to $386.10. December silver futures 
dropped 13 cents to $5.39 an ounce.

MORE FREEDOM TO ORGANIZE IN EXCHANGE FOR HELPING TO DEVELOP COST-SAVING RULES.

 Levi Strauss & Co. and its main union announced an unconventional plan 
Thursday under which the company will give labor officials greater freedom to 
organize workers in exchange for the union pledging to work with management to 
develop cost-saving work rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact between the nation's biggest apparel manufacturer and the Amalgamated 
Clothing and Textile Workers Union is modeled on a program that has been 
running for about three years at Levi's plant in Harlingen, Tex. At the Texas 
factory, workers have accepted a pay plan that has cut wages in some cases but 
has also given employees a stronger voice in the plant's management. 
</P>
<P>
 The Levi-ACTWU agreement, in calling for greater labor-management cooperation, 
embraces workplace policies encouraged by the Clinton Administration. But it 
was also greeted with some skepticism in the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the difficulty in crafting and maintaining a cooperative 
labor-management pact was evident Thursday when union and company sources 
differed somewhat on the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, a company spokesman said the union will be able to enter 
non-unionized plants to recruit new members -- but only with the approval of a 
joint labor-management steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Other activities, such as business planning and budgeting, will also be guided 
by representatives of labor and management. 
</P>
<P>
 But a union spokeswoman, Jo-Ann Mort, emphasized that the so-called landmark 
partnership agreement would give labor organizers a free hand to enter 
non-union facilities. She portrayed the policy as being in sharp contrast to 
those at many other companies, where organizers solicit new members outside the 
plant gates. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Levi Strauss employs 22,000 production and warehouse 
workers at 37 facilities in the United States -- mainly in southern and western 
states that have traditionally been unfriendly to unions. Only 44% of those 
employees belong to unions, and only 17 of the locations are represented by 
organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Mort said, new union recruits at Levi Strauss will only need to 
sign authorization cards to join -- the company will not insist on National 
Labor Relations Board-supervised elections. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of receptiveness to union organizing "is almost unheard of at other 
U.S. corporations," Mort said. She said that as recently as five years ago, 
Levi Strauss "was not that different from other companies." 
</P>
<P>
 "The union was the union, the management was the management, and it was 
adversarial," Mort said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said such labor relations are a thing of the past. "An 
adversarial relationship won't work in a rapidly changing marketplace that 
demands flexibility and innovation," Bob Rockey, president of the company's 
Levi Strauss North America division, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to forge a partnership that will add value to our business and 
enhance employment security by continuously improving our operations," he said.

 Drug Company to Sell $5 Cough Medicine in $50 Version: Carter-Wallace Inc. 
plans to sell sufferers of asthma and emphysema a new version of a $50-a-bottle 
drug without telling them the same medication is in common cough remedies 
selling for about $5. The pharmaceutical company says it has complied with 
medical rules concerning the prescription drug Organidin by informing doctors 
about the formula change.But lung disease specialists say Carter-Wallace is 
guilty of at least a breach of medical ethics. The United States ordered 
Carter-Wallace to change the formula this year after tests showed the main 
ingredient causes cancer in rats. The main ingredient in the new version is the 
same one in Robitussin DM, Vicks Formula 44E and a variety of generic cough and 
cold medicines.

 Hilton 3rd-Quarter Profit Up 32%: The Beverly Hills-based company said better 
results from its hotels offset lower casino earnings.Hilton Hotels Corp. said 
it earned $27 million, or 56 cents per share, during the July-September 
quarter, compared to $20.5 million, 43 cents a share, for the same period a 
year earlier. Revenue rose 10%, from $346.7 million to $380.9 million. The 
hotels benefited from a rebounding economy and improved business and leisure 
travel trends, Hilton said. Declines at Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nev., 
hotel-casinos were partially offset by income from Hilton's New Orleans 
riverboat casino; its casino in Windsor, Canada, and its Gold Coast, Australia, 
hotel-casino.

 U.S. Avoids First Fight With Mexico Over Labor Rights: The Labor Department's 
National Administration Office said it has decided not to take action against 
Mexico over workers fired in two Mexican plants. It said it had not found the 
government at fault.Two U.S. unions, the Teamsters and the United Electric 
Workers, in February filed protests to the NAO regarding 34 Mexican workers 
they said had been fired for organizing unions at U.S. subsidiaries in northern 
Mexico. The cases were the first under side agreements set up, mostly at union 
behest, under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican workers were 
employed by General Electric Co. and Honeywell Inc. The U.S. unions had sought 
rehiring of the fired workers, as well as increased pressure on the Mexican 
government to uphold worker rights.

 New Shaving System: Gillette Co. has launched SensorExcel, a new shaving 
system that has already been for sale in Europe and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The SensorExcel builds on the spring-mounted twin blade technology of the 
original Sensor with a skin guard made of five soft, flexible "microfins."The 
fins touch the face before the blade and stretch the skin, causing beard hairs 
to spring up so they can be shaved more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 The new razor also has a larger lubricating strip and a handle designed for 
better grip and control, Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillette said the new blades will fit on the original Sensor razor. 
</P>
<P>
 The SensorExcel shaving system, consisting of razor, organizer and two 
cartridges, will sell for about $3.99. The refill cartridges will sell for 
$4.49 for a five-pack and $8.49 for a 10-pack. Gillette said the prices are 15% 
higher than the Sensor prices.

Q & A; SEC CUTS OUT PLAN TO ALLOW MUTUAL FUND BUYS VIA 'OFF-PAGE' COUPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In a surprise reversal, a much ballyhooed proposal to allow investors to buy 
mutual funds directly through detailed advertisements has been indefinitely 
tabled, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. revealed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called off-the-page advertising, which parts of the fund industry have 
pushed for years, would have allowed individuals to buy no-load funds by simply 
clipping coupons that accompanied new detailed disclosures of fund performance, 
risk and fees. Now a prospectus must be mailed out first. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt previously supported off-the-page proposals but now says he is 
convinced that the single page advertisements would not provide investors with 
enough information to make an informed decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt says he changed his mind after listening to investors in focus groups, 
but some fund executives speculate that he backed off after the summer 
derivatives scare. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the SEC will launch a pilot program that would have mutual fund 
companies include a one-page fund summary -- similar to the "off-the-page" 
advertisements -- with the full prospectus. And the agency says it will 
encourage fund companies to write investor documents in plain English. 
</P>
<P>
 While some no-load fund companies are disappointed that Levitt was backing off 
the more aggressive off-the-page rules, fund experts agreed that the SEC's 
actions should still make it easier to compare funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrific idea," says Diane Coffey, spokeswoman for Dreyfus Corp. in 
New York. "It makes the prospectus more user-friendly by putting all the 
pertinent information upfront. This is clearly an improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the nation's top securities regulators said they're also beefing 
up proxy disclosures for publicly-held mutual fund companies and opening up a 
consumer hot line where prospective investors can call for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is what these changes mean to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the point of the new fund summary? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is aimed at ensuring that you can read the pertinent information about a 
fund before you invest. It should also give investors an easy way to make 
apples-to-apples comparisons between funds because you could essentially line 
up various fund summaries side-by-side and compare them in a glance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Exactly what will be disclosed? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's currently being debated. But industry executives believe the 
summaries will include: investment performance over one-, five- and 10-year 
periods; the fund's goals, objectives and strategies; sales loads, redemption 
fees, management fees and other expenses; investment minimums, and information 
on how investors can buy or redeem their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are all fund companies going to provide these summaries? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's the eventual goal. However, right now, only seven fund companies -- 
Capital Group, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Scudder, Dreyfus and IDS -- 
are involved in the pilot program to produce them. And these companies say 
that, initially, the summaries will only be provided with some fund 
prospectuses. It's likely to take a year -- or more -- before all funds include 
an easy-to-read summary with investment documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does this differ from the previous proposals? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The biggest difference is that the off-the-page proposals would have 
allowed no-load fund investors to buy a fund before they'd actually received 
the full 30-40 page prospectus. If you saw an off-the-page advertisement, you 
could clip the coupon, send a check and get back a prospectus with the 
confirmation that you were a fund shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will the SEC be doing to encourage fund companies to write their 
lengthy prospectuses in English? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The SEC has to review and approve any investment document sent to fund 
shareholders -- or prospective shareholders -- including prospectuses and 
annual reports. Levitt promises that fund companies will get speedy review and 
approval of documents that aim to simplify discussions of the fund's risks and 
rewards. That could be a dramatic change from the agency's reputation. In the 
past it has spent up to a year to approve a "simplified" prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the agency doing to beef up proxy disclosures? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Publicly held mutual fund companies will be required to give their 
investors more information about compensation paid to directors and brokers. 
These rules are aimed at ferreting out possible conflicts of interest between 
fund managers and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can I reach the SEC to get information about the new rules or about 
investing in general? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The agency is launching a toll-free investor hot line, which can be reached 
after Oct. 24 at (800) SEC-0330.

 This year's hottest toys, according to industry experts, don't all cost a 
fortune. Anything related to the hit films "The Flintstones," "The Lion King" 
or "Jurassic Park" is bound to be on this year's wish lists, but Christopher 
Byrne, toy consultant and editor of Market Focus: Toys magazine, says that if 
you look past the Hollywood tie-ins, some of the best can be had for the least. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few of the newest, moderately priced toys this year: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pez Watch (from Dream Castle). This all-in-one Pez candy dispenser and watch 
costs about $4.99. 
</P>
<P>
 * Native American bead, rings and jewelry craft kit (Pastime). This starter 
kit is part of a new line of crafts, for beginners through experts, and sells 
for about $5.99. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nickelodeon Laserlight (Just Toys). Kids can create their own laser light 
show with this hand-held toy that produces beams of light with the flip of a 
switch. It sells for about $9.99. 
</P>
<P>
 * Double Pump Football (Weiss Twice). This six-inch football can be inflated 
or deflated at the push of a button for $6.99.

 Stereogram Books: Blue Mountain Press, publisher of alternative greeting 
cards, is introducing a series of books of 5-D stereograms, which are pictures 
that change to reveal hidden images. 
</P>
<P>
 The pages at first appear to be a series of blurry, multicolored images, but 
as the eye lingers, the images change to reveal a pictorial message. The series 
includes "Endangered Species in 5-D Stereograms," "Love in 5-D Stereograms" and 
"Reach for Your Dreams in 5-D Stereograms." 
</P>
<P>
 Five percent of the proceeds from the sale of "Endangered Species," which 
sells for $12.95, will be donated to Defenders of Wildlife, a group dedicated 
to the conservation of wildlife and natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love in 5-D" and "Reach for Your Dreams" sell for $17.95.

COMPANY TOWN; REDSTONE SAYS VIACOM MAY GET INTO RECORD BIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LOUISE McELVOGUE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The record business seems to be music to Sumner Redstone's ears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viacom Inc. chairman, speaking in France at the international television 
marketing conference, said the company is edging toward record distribution, 
prompted by recent efforts by major record labels to form a competitor to 
Viacom's MTV music channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone said Viacom previously thought it would not go into the business. It 
released records from its "MTV Unplugged' series with major record labels, he 
noted, earning a royalty payment. But the company believed it should not 
compete with its suppliers, the record companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the record companies are interested in competing with us, it is no 
longer a forbidden agenda," Redstone said. "They have already taken a shot at 
us, and even though I doubt their channel would ever get past the Justice 
Department, that is the way they have decided to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertelsmann Music Group, which owns the RCA and Arista labels, and cable giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. announced plans last year for a music video network 
but scrapped them in June. Warner Music, Sony, EMI and PolyGram, along with 
Ticketmaster, later announced similar plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone said any Viacom record company would probably involve a distribution 
joint venture with another label. He also said a number of promotional 
opportunities involving Viacom assets exist, including its newly acquired 
Paramount Communications and Blockbuster Entertainment operations. Sources say 
one possibility is that Viacom will strike a deal with Walter R. Yetnikoff, the 
former CBS Records chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount, which for years was criticized for not acquiring a record company, 
came close on several occasions, but talks always fell through. Blockbuster has 
diversified from video rentals into music retailing and is now one of the 
nation's largest music store chains.

COMPANY TOWN; CAROLCO-LIVE MERGER LOOKS DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another setback for big-budget movie producer Carolco Pictures, the company 
disclosed Thursday that its proposed merger with video distributor Live 
Entertainment has fallen apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash-poor Carolco has warned that because it is so highly leveraged, raising 
money on favorable terms would be substantially more difficult if it failed to 
complete its merger with Live.It has also warned that it might not survive due 
to its funds crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The unraveling of the Live negotiations comes at a bad time for Carolco, which 
would say only that the deal was called off for "a number of factors." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which produced such box office hits as the "Rambo" series, 
"Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "Basic Instinct," is scrambling to nail down 
funds needed to launch its big-budget picture "Cutthroat Island," starring 
Geena Davis and directed by her husband, Renny Harlin.  
</P>
<P>
 The company is trying to sell its interest in another film, "Showgirls," and 
sources said France's Chargeurs is planning to buy it. Carolco declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has also said it arranged a $63-million production loan for 
"Cutthroat Island" with a group of lenders, but it lacks the necessary 
completion bond, which guarantees lenders that the film will be delivered on 
time and on budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco once held a majority interest in Live, but it has been reduced 
steadily over the years. Under the proposed merger, Live stockholders would 
have owned as much as 28% of the surviving company; Carolco stockholders would 
have owned the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in both 
Carolco and Live as the firms fell below the criteria of net tangible assets.

MISSION OF LOVE; ANAHEIM WOMAN OPENS HER HEART AND HOME TO YOUNG PROSTITUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just before midnight, Mercedes Ballon is ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing walking shoes and comfortable clothes, her red hair teased and her 
long nails painted crimson, she grabs her black purse and a straw basket 
bulging with her most important accessories: packs of condoms and brochures 
about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, she's in a dark Anaheim park or a Santa Ana alley doing what has become 
a life mission: warning young prostitutes about AIDS and trying to get them off 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Ballon, 41, an immigrant from Peru, has gone on this 
mission in predominantly Latino neighborhoods almost nightly. And some of her 
targets listen. 
</P>
<P>
 They have come to know Ballon as a mother figure and occasionally gather at 
her apartment in Anaheim for a charla (talk), during which they often express 
fear of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night, Ballon passed out sheets of typing paper and asked five 
young prostitutes to write or draw what they knew about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio, 22, wrote in Spanish: "Having AIDS is like being dead in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yerika, 17, drew a picture of a girl crying and another picture of a family 
with a slash through it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the participants, 17-year-old Miguel, shared his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stepfather used to beat me and abuse me in Mexico until I couldn't take it 
anymore," he said. "So I came here when I was 15 and have been on the streets 
trying to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel said Ballon persuaded him to quit the streets, get a job as a 
dishwasher and enroll in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody cares what happens to you, you start to care about yourself," 
he said, describing Ballon as a "very good woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Ballon formed Que Tan Grande Es Tu Amor Por Un Nino? (How Big Is 
Your Love for a Child?), a group of about 60 volunteers, including doctors, 
nurses, teachers, students, business people and artists, who counsel the young 
prostitutes about disease, listen to their troubles and try to console those 
with AIDS. Some provide free services such as haircuts, manicures, art lessons 
and physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also offers its services to the sick or needy children Ballon finds 
on the streets or hears about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to offer emotional refuge and let these kids know that they 
are not alone, that people love them and care for them," said Ballon, a 
divorcee with four grown children. "Some of them feel like there is no hope, 
and I cry with rage every day because they have dreams. . . . They have 
feelings, and I want those sentiments to be happy while they're alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she lived in Peru, Ballon volunteered for the Red Cross and helped an 
aunt who is a nun open a home for orphans. The aunt, she said, inspired her to 
help young people in her new homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballon, a former nurse, teacher and social worker, was prompted to start Que 
Tan Grande Es Tu Amor Por Un Nino? after failing to find an organization or 
hospital in Orange County where she could volunteer her services, she said. 
Some groups told her she needed to speak English to become a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People told me I was crazy and that my program would be impossible to launch, 
especially because I don't speak English," Ballon said. "OK, I don't speak 
English, but I do speak the language that all mothers speak: love. . . . As I 
see it, there is a gigantic need for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Her group, she said, "is growing faster than I ever imagined." 
</P>
<P>
 To lend credibility to her work, Ballon recently completed a program sponsored 
by a private, nonprofit agency in Santa Ana that teaches Latinas about AIDS and 
safe sex and encourages them to teach others. She also completed a special Red 
Cross training course and an American Cancer Society course in supporting the 
terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 And she is taking English classes in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballon's mission "is a tremendous load," said Irene Martinez, director of the 
program for Latinas. "There's a lot of suffering out there and not enough 
people like (Ballon) who want to help and heal these people who are hurting." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Hoskins, a director of the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange 
County, calls Ballon "a dynamo." 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very dedicated to her cause," Hoskins said. "She strikes me as really 
very serious about her mission." 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Ballon, who makes wedding decorations for a living, said she is 
trying to raise money to rent a building where she can provide free shelter and 
activities including dance classes, music lessons and sports clinics for 
children to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she will begin teaching free classes on AIDS awareness at the 
George Washington Community Center in Anaheim on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers in Ballon's organization praise her commitment and dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone with common sense can appreciate what she is doing," said volunteer 
Emma Maligon, a real estate agent from San Juan Capistrano. "Everything she 
does she does with her heart. She could use a lot more support financially, but 
even if she doesn't get it, she's not one to stop helping the kids."

CHURCH GROUP WILL RENAME VOTER'S GUIDE; POLITICS: UNDER THREAT OF COMPLAINT TO 
THE IRS, MEMBERS OF CALVARY CHAPEL OF COSTA MESA WILL DISTRIBUTE THE 
PUBLICATION AS THE 'CONCERNED PARENTS OF ORANGE COUNTY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to avoid legal action that could threaten their church's tax-exempt 
status, members of Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa have decided to rename the 
voter's guide they plan to publish before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hocking, a pastor at the church, said Thursday that the group will 
distribute the guide under the name "Concerned Parents of Orange County" to 
avoid charges that the church itself is engaging in political action, which is 
prohibited by Internal Revenue Service rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide was originally called the "Calvary Chapel Voter's Guide," but by 
weakening its connection to the church, Hocking hopes to avoid criticism that a 
religious institution is inappropriately venturing into the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "The title will reflect what it is. Our church isn't exactly involved in it. 
It's a group of parents and volunteers," Hocking said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word church needs to be defined," he added. "If you mean 'the church' as 
an organization or staff, no, none of that was involved. If you mean 'church' 
as people, yes, there were people from the church putting (the guide) 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 The name change was prompted by a complaint from John Duran, a West Hollywood 
civil rights attorney who, in a letter to the church Tuesday, threatened to 
file a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service if the church published its 
guide as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran said Thursday that by taking its name off the guide, the church would 
solve the legal problem and there would be no need to report the matter to the 
IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran filed a similar complaint against the Traditional Values Coalition, 
another tax-exempt, nonprofit group, five years ago. That complaint is still 
pending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is whether a tax-exempt organization is using any of its resources 
for political activity," Duran said. "If a group of individuals who all just 
happen to belong to that church use their own labor and resources to put it 
out, then it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented foray into local politics, Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa -- 
one of the largest churches in the nation -- mailed surveys last month with 
pointed, yes-or-no questions on controversial moral issues to candidates for 
city council, school board, special district and county positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though several Christian political groups have published similar voter's 
guides for years, Calvary Chapel was the first church in Orange County to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rules governing their tax-exempt status, churches are not allowed to 
endorse candidates or political positions. Though the voter's guide is intended 
to be purely informational, some candidates and political consultants 
complained that the surveys made the church's position clear, providing tacit 
endorsements to candidates who agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hocking said last month that the guide would be distributed to 50,000 Orange 
County residents through local churches. But on Thursday the pastor said that 
publicity about the surveys has brought the church unwanted attention and 
criticism from the community, jeopardizing publication of the guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although about 250 local candidates have responded to the survey, Hocking said 
Thursday that the project has spun out of control and that church members are 
now unsure whether they will be able to finish the guide in time for 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of people have called the church wondering about its position on state 
and national candidates and issues -- despite the fact that the guide deals 
exclusively with local races, Hocking said. Meanwhile, candidates who agree 
with the church's stance have asked for money, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just worn out with it," Hocking said Thursday. "The church is very 
burdened. The church is very overloaded with people trying to make this more 
than it really is. . . . Frankly, I don't think we're ever going to do it 
again. It's too much. We just can't handle it -- and that's sad."

DORNAN HAS RIGHTS ANSWER; POLITICS: CHALLENGED BY FOE ON CLAIM HE JOINED REV. 
KING ON HISTORIC 1963 MARCH, CONGRESSMAN FINDS PROOF IN BLACK AND WHITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For weeks, Democrat Mike Farber has been waiting for Rep. Robert K. Dornan to 
repeat the claim that he had participated in the civil rights movement of the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, the eight-term Republican congressman from Garden Grove whom Farber is 
trying to unseat in the Nov. 8 election, had said on a national radio program 
and elsewhere that he had helped register black voters in Mississippi and had 
participated in a historic civil rights march with the Rev. Martin Luther King 
Jr. Farber did not believe it and hoped to prove him wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 And then last week Dornan said it again. 
</P>
<P>
 In responding to Farber's charge that he had not paid attention to the needs 
of Latinos in his largely ethnic 46th Congressional District, Dornan said he 
supported the efforts of minorities and pointed out that he had participated in 
the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a poker player holding aces, Farber this week produced a letter signed by 
participants and historians of the civil rights movement who "strongly 
question" Dornan's claim of participating in the cause, particularly in light 
of what they allege is Dornan's "dismal voting record on civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan pulled out a wild card of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 He produced a black and white photograph of the 250,000-member crowd gathered 
in front of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963 -- the day of King's historic 
march on Washington. Seated in the midst of Hollywood celebrities who flew to 
Washington for the march is Dornan, wearing his Air Force captain's uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said he remembered marching from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, 
hand-in-hand with a 7-year-old African-American boy -- a day, he said, that was 
one of the proudest in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's true, it's a sad day," Farber said after being told of the 
photograph's existence. "These people that were associated with King had some 
element of doubt (about Dornan's participation). . . . They were asking for 
proof because of his record on civil (rights) matters, which is pretty dismal." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said he has nothing to prove. 
</P>

 "I don't have to prove this to Jesse Jackson or to this unknown person," he 
said, referring to Farber. "(Farber has) no life, no resume, no biography, no 
background, no history on civil rights, human rights, crime fighting. . . . He 
has never done anything in his life except help and advance himself."

 Dornan said he had anticipated that his attendance at the 1963 march on 
Washington would be questioned. So he had his staff search for photographs at 
the Library of Congress. He said he made 50 copies of the photo, and plans to 
autograph them and send them to members of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he does not have proof that he went to Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964 
for two weeks to register black voters, Dornan quickly recites the dates, names 
and places of key events to demonstrate his knowledge of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Mississippi, Dornan explained, because he felt he "owed it to my 
black commanders who taught me to fly." He served in the Air Force from 1953 to 
1958, and in the reserves and National Guard until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia), who signed the letter to Dornan and was the 
youngest speaker at the march on Washington, conceded that while it is possible 
that Dornan was at the march, he doubts Dornan was in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to know most of the individuals (in the Mississippi voter registration 
project). I recruited many of them," he said. "Especially, if (a volunteer) was 
white, I think I would have known that person." 
</P>
<P>
 In their letter to Dornan, civil rights leaders said that film clips and news 
coverage of the civil rights movement were reviewed at the Martin Luther King 
Center, the Memphis Civil Rights Museum and at UCLA, but no evidence was found 
of Dornan's participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, Lewis, the Rev. Fred L. Shuttleworth of Cincinnati, who was a former 
adviser to King, and Itibari Zulu, a historian at UCLA, agreed to sign the 
letter to Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who either participated or are academic experts in those marches 
and registration drives . . . have absolutely no recollection of your 
presence," states the letter, which asks Dornan to provide proof. "The 
existence of your dismal voting record on civil rights also leads us to 
strongly question your claims." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said that while Dornan has often commented to him that he was a 
participant, Dornan's name does not appear on the extensive lists of volunteers 
that were maintained during the voter registration drives. He said that 
volunteers held a 30-year reunion this year and Dornan was not there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said he voted for the 1991 Civil Rights Act. But Lewis said Dornan has 
not shown a commitment to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem strange to me, for someone who participated in the Mississippi 
Summer Project in 1964 and the march on Washington in 1963 and then all these 
years later . . . take some unbelievable stands against civil liberties," Lewis 
said. ". . . For me, it's hard for people to change that much."

KIDNEY TEST MISHAP SHOCKS RADIOLOGIST; MEDICINE: DOCTOR HAS PERFORMED 20,000 
SUCH PREOPERATIVE PROCEDURES WITHOUT INCIDENT. COUPLE'S TRANSPLANT IS IN 
JEOPARDY. 
</P>

<P>
 After performing more than 20,000 arteriograms in a distinguished 21-year 
career, Dr. Harold Coons finally saw one of the delicate procedures go awry -- 
during the most highly publicized case he had ever handled. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationally prominent invasive radiologist said at a news conference 
Thursday that he was shocked when he tore one of three arteries leading to the 
left kidney of a Mission Viejo newlywed whom he was preparing for kidney 
transplant surgery at Sharp Memorial Hospital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Victoria Ingram-Curlee's nationally publicized organ donation to 
diabetic husband Randall Curlee, whom she had married in a hospital ceremony 24 
hours earlier, has been postponed three to four weeks and could be canceled if 
her kidney fails to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said Thursday that there is as much as a 35% chance that Randall 
Curlee, 46, will have to find a new kidney donor -- a difficult task. In the 
meantime, he may undergo dialysis treatment for his failing kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The arterial tear, which occurred during a routine preoperative procedure 
common in kidney transplantation, came on a day the senior radiologist 
performed five similar procedures, including one on an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was theoretically a much more difficult procedure those five other times," 
he said in an interview, "but with her, we had a problem. At the end of the 
day, my colleagues kidded me, saying, 'We're real glad it was you -- and not 
us.' I guess it was one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Coons, director of angiography and intervention radiology at Sharp Memorial, 
said the 45-year-old Ingram-Curlee was found to have had multiple arteries 
leading to her left kidney, which is common in 25% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the procedure, we were catheterizing two arteries leading to her left 
kidney," he said. "She has a very small artery leading to the lower pole of the 
kidney. And there was a dissection . . . a little linear tear in the delicate 
lining of the artery. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a potential risk in any procedure like this," he said. "But it's 
extremely rare. This had never happened to me even once." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ingram-Curlee nor her husband could be reached for comment Thursday. 
They are expected to speak at a news conference today. Kidney Complication 
During a standard diagnostic test on Victoria Ingram-Curlee's kidneys, a renal 
artery was torn. The renal artery supplies blood to the kidney from the aorta, 
the body's main blood vessel. What happened: 1. Catheter tears artery lining 2. 
Blood flows between artery lining and outer wall, creating bulge 3. Blood flow 
to lower kidney diminished Kidney Profile The kidneys regulae the body's fluid 
balance. Some facts: Size: About 4 to 5 inches long, weighs about 6 ounces. 
Functions: Filters blood and excretes waste and excess water. Efficiency 
diminishes with age. Sources: The American Medical Assn. Encyclopedia of 
Medicine; Dr. Harold Coons, director of angiography and intervention radiology

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SCHOOL TRUSTEES CLASH ON 'EXTREMIST' 
CANDIDATE LABEL

<P>
 Emotions flared this week on the Saddleback Valley Unified School District 
board as Trustee Frank L. Ury pressed colleague Dore J. Gilbert to identify 
conservative candidates whom Gilbert has described as "extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 Ury, who does not face reelection, said Gilbert had made several references in 
news stories to candidates who were "intolerant" and harbored a religious-right 
agenda.Ury has been accused of holding the same views but shuns the label, 
saying he is a conservative seeking to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it's imperative that we all know exactly who these extremists 
are that are taking over our schools," Ury said at the close of the board's 
meeting on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert said the session was not the appropriate place to discuss campaign 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to have a debate about the election, then you resign from the 
board and run against me or you resign and run again, OK?" Gilbert said. "But 
this is not where I'm going to debate you on issues that really have nothing to 
do with the agenda of this meeting. And I think that you have really 
overstepped your bounds." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nov. 8 election, Ury and Trustee Debbie Hughes have endorsed a pair of 
candidates among six who are challenging incumbents Gilbert and Bobbee Cline. 
</P>
<P>
 While campaigning, Gilbert and Cline have warned of a threat from "extremists" 
who if elected would shift the power balance of the board and make drastic 
changes to curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Ury said such characterizations were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's getting me is that we have this vague innuendo being thrown out there, 
it's a bunch of hogwash," Ury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could care less what you think," Gilbert responded. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SETTLEMENT CLEARS WAY FOR REVAMP OF BRISTOL 
ST.

<P>
 A Superior Court judge has approved a settlement that allows Santa Ana 
officials to begin an ambitious $335-million redevelopment project along 
Bristol Street, a city spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert A. Knox approved the settlement Wednesday.The case 
had been mired in the courts for almost five years after two local residents 
sued to stop the project, said Assistant City Atty. Robert J. Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that the parties were able to finally resolve the matter. The 
city is looking forward to inaugurating this project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year redevelopment project includes expanding Bristol Street and 
revamping more than a dozen commercial areas along its length. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs, Robert T. Gonzales, an optometrist with offices in the project 
area, and Evangelina Avalos, a single mother who lives in the area, challenged 
the project, arguing that the city failed to do enough to find replacement 
housing for hundreds of families who might be displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement calls for the city to set aside 30% of the revenue generated by 
the project for low- and moderate-income housing. State law requires that 20% 
be set aside for that purpose. Also under the agreement, the city will pay 
$149,000 in attorneys' fees for the plaintiffs, Wheeler said. JON NALICK

 For the first and perhaps last time, a life-size, two-story-tall, 
42-foot-long, moving and roaring tyrannosaurus will appear this weekend in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,000-pound steel-and-foam creature, designed by Irvine-based Dinamation 
International, will be the star attraction of the Kids Stuff Festival at Lion 
Country Center in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids see dinosaur bones, they can't picture the whole animal," said 
Dinamation spokeswoman Wendy Keiper. "It's hard for children to think in 
three-dimensional space. But we've assembled the dinosaurs for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The robotic blue and black giant, carefully delivered Thursday via a cramped 
40-foot moving van, can move its head, tail and short forelimbs, blink its 
fiery orange eyes and emit a frightening roar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to take the old, stodgy side of science into the MTV, video-game 
(generation)," Keiper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is expected to draw 30,000 people. Other attractions include 
puppets, a POG tournament, sports clinics, a petting zoo, arts and crafts, 
in-line skating and laser tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $6 for adults and $4 for children age 3 to 16. Children 2 and 
younger are free. The event will run from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The towering tyrannosaurus cost Dinamation about $100,000 to build.LYNN FRANEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified School District trustees have approved preliminary 
plans for a new elementary school in the Rancho Trabuco neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials estimate that the school could be completed and opened by 
January, 1997.Board approval to award construction bids will be contingent upon 
the sale of Mello-Roos bonds in early or mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees reviewed design drawings for the school during a board meeting this 
week before giving approval to proceed. The district has spent $4 million for 
the school's land at Rancho Trabuco and Melinda Road. Nearly $425,000 has been 
spent for design work. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost for the school has been put at $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mello-Roos districts for the bonds were formed in the late 1980s. Bonds 
sold in 1991 from the area have gone toward the purchase of the school site, 
plus construction projects, such as Rancho Margarita Intermediate School and 
Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The architectural firm chosen for the new school has designed five other 
elementary schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for a Spanish motif, including a bell tower, tiled roofs and 
courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is expected to accommodate 827 students. JEFF BEAN

<P>
 A ceremony today will recognize Pleshe's 27 years of service to students and 
the community, said district spokeswoman Diane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleshe, who died in March at age 66 after battling lung cancer, served the 
district in numerous jobs for 19 years. She was active in PTAs, served as room 
mother and volunteered at Santiago Elementary School, Willard Intermediate 
School and Santa Ana High School while her children attended those campuses.

 Enough is Enough, a national organization that tries to curb the amount of 
pornographic material on the marketplace, has made some inroads in Orange 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the 20 female members here succeeded in winning passage of a few 
ordinances that have helped tone down the presence of pornographic magazines in 
different cities.In Costa Mesa, for example, the owners of newspaper racks that 
distribute adult magazines are required to paint the windows black so children 
can't see them. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the ordinance was passed six years ago, Wendy Leece, 46, an active 
member and mother, says there is less and less paint on the newspaper racks 
with each passing year. "We don't want to walk by with our children in our 
strollers and see this trash," Leece said. "So we end up being the watchdogs 
for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, liquor stores and convenience shops are required to put 
covers over adult magazines on sales racks, another of the group's 
accomplishments. The ordinance was passed seven months ago, but Sarah 
Sansevieri, another member of Enough is Enough, said a recent check revealed 
most stores aren't complying. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the magazines right next to the candy and the pretzels," she 
said. "Many of the store owners just don't care, and it gets to the point where 
you can't send your child out for a loaf of bread." 
</P>
<P>
 Leece and Sansevieri say the problem of pornography is getting worse in Orange 
County, despite the organization's presence. They say they understand that it's 
legal to sell the material. They're just asking that the pornography be covered 
up properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest pieces of contraband being confiscated at our high schools aren't 
weapons and drugs, they're these adult magazines," Sansevieri said. 
"Something's got to be done -- soon." TOM RAGAN

 The city, in its push to become more "film friendly," is playing host to the 
filming of a television miniseries this week on board a World War II troop 
carrier moored off the Seal Beach coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, it's "Baywatch" on the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July 1, the city has earned $21,000 in revenue from film productions. In 
a new push to lure film companies to local shores, the city has produced a 
brochure touting city cooperation and promising a filming location with only 72 
hours' notice. Permission for certain kinds of special effects requires a bit 
more advance notice.

 "It occurred to me that this is something that we should be pursuing, 
especially in a time of fiscal chaos," said Andy Seymour, city director of 
parks and recreations who joined the city about 18 months ago. Filming in the 
city has been sparse in past years, according to Seymour, who also serves as 
the city's liaison for film production. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, NBC crews and cast members have been filming "Op Center," a 
miniseries created by novelist Tom Clancy and starring former "L.A. Law" actor 
Harry Hamlin. It is planned for broadcast in the spring. The restored troop 
carrier, Lane Victory, was brought from San Pedro to the Seal Beach coast for 
filming. Beachfront residents were advised that nighttime scenes would be 
filmed with helicopters and simulated tracer fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Seal Beach has been the site of a Dr. Pepper commercial, 
which aired for the first time on Monday Night Football, the movie "Apollo 13" 
starring Tom Hanks and the MGM movie, "Species." 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, actors from the "Baywatch" television series will film a chase 
scene on the Seal Beach Pier. Seymour said the scene calls for somebody to fall 
off the pier.

 "I assume it will be a stuntman," he said. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DISNEY, CITY BREAK GROUND ON JOINT ICE-SKATING 
RINK PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
 Disney and city officials held a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday at the site 
of their new joint project -- a 90,000-square-foot community ice rink to be 
built in downtown Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink will serve as both a practice site for the Mighty Ducks and a 
community youth center.It is expected to open by fall 1995 and will be built on 
a 3.2-acre site bordered by Clementine Street, Lincoln Avenue and West Harbor 
Place. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, which officials say they hope will lead to a revitalization of 
the city's downtown area, will have two side-by-side rinks, one National Hockey 
League-size rink and an Olympic-size rink. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also feature a restaurant, locker rooms, a pro shop, seating for 1,300 
spectators and a training area for the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink also will be home to Disney's new nonprofit program called GOALS -- 
Growth Opportunities Through Athletics, Learning and Service. It is modeled 
after a highly touted hockey program in Harlem. The charitable organization's 
aim is to offer organized athletic, education and community service to 
underprivileged youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has initially targeted three neighborhoods around the center for 
participation: Jeffrey-Lynne, Ponderosa Park and Guinida Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to building life skills with the children, not just hockey 
skills," said David Wilk, who heads Disney GOALS. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly was among those present at the groundbreaking. He said: "The 
ice rink is an outstanding example of the type of collaborative effort between 
city government and private enterprise that is critically important to the 
future of our city." GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LIBRARY PROJECT WINS AWARD FOR 
EXCELLENCE 
</P>

<P>
 City officials tout Huntington Beach Central Library as one of the finest in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Others think so too. 
</P>
<P>
 The California League of Cities Institute for Local Self-Government has 
selected the library's recent expansion as the 1994 winner of the Helen Putnam 
Award for Excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very prestigious," said library services director Ron Hayden. "There was 
fierce competition, and to be singled out as a project that exemplified public 
participation. . . . I think the city should be proud, especially at a time 
when other libraries are reducing hours and closing doors." 
</P>
<P>
 The library expansion project, completed in January, added 43,000 square feet 
to the existing 72,000-square-foot library. Improvements included a new 
16,000-square-foot children's wing -- the largest in the state -- a 
state-of-the-art media technology center, five meeting rooms and a 319-seat 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the library's entrance was redesigned, staff work space was 
created, a computerized and automated book return system was installed and the 
Friends Gift Shop was relocated to the front of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The award recognizes the result of eight years of hard work by library support 
groups to complete the expansion project, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept the dream alive with a wide range of participation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Library support groups raised about $1 million toward the $8.5-million cost of 
the expansion project, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal announcement of the award is set for Oct. 23 at the California League 
of Cities annual conference in Long Beach. Presentation of the award will be 
made in Sacramento by Gov. Pete Wilson at the Award for Excellence ceremony, 
with the date to be announced after the League of Cities conference. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; NEWSPAPER REVIVED AT EL DORADO HIGH 
</P>

<P>
 With a mix of stories covering pep rallies and a play about AIDS, El Dorado 
High School's student newspaper published its first edition in three years this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 El Gavilan was revived by the school's new principal, Joe Quartucci, who was 
reassigned from Valencia High School over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's detrimental to the school not to have" a student newspaper, 
Quartucci said. "It's important for students to have an outlet to express 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The student publication ceased production at the end of the 1991-92 school 
year for a variety of reasons, including declining enrollment in the journalism 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 The current editorial staff writes and edits stories during their free 
periods, lunch and before and after school, because the school still does not 
offer a class specifically for production of the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too late to add the class to the schedule when I got here," Quartucci 
said. "My intention is to add it next year." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, a group of about 15 students is getting a crash course in 
reporting, editing and layout from adviser Al Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us don't have any experience, because we were freshmen the last time 
there was a school paper," said co-editor Sharon Lee, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing has been enforcing deadlines," said Lee's co-editor, Mike 
Steinberger. "Everybody on the paper is involved in a lot of other things." 
</P>
<P>
 The next issue of El Gavilan (Spanish for sparrow hawk) is scheduled to come 
out Oct. 21. The paper will be published monthly until next semester, when it 
will come out twice a month. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Students in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District could be facing 
tougher classes and higher standards in a few years as part of a districtwide 
plan to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus on Students-Leaders of Tomorrow is a long-range plan to determine the 
district's strengths and weaknesses and to identify what teachers, students and 
the community think schools should be doing for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process is basically . . . raising the bar," Supt. James O. Fleming told 
the Board of Trustees on Tuesday. "It's an extremely important undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is being initiated districtwide, but each of the 28 schools will 
decide what steps it needs to take to prepare students for life after high 
school. For instance, one high school is considering increasing the math 
requirement so that all students take algebra before graduating. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Sharon McHolland said the district is in the fact-finding 
phase, including tabulating responses to a survey that was sent last spring to 
every family in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using lots of measures to get a lot of data about who our students are 
and how they are doing," McHolland said. "We will then look at all those 
indicators to find out what we need to be doing." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA, NEWPORT BEACH; BOARD CREATES AGENCY TO ISSUE 
SCHOOL BONDS

<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District board has created a separate public 
agency to issue more than $5 million in bonds to pay for installing a new 
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system at Corona del Mar High School 
and to build a new district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District Public Financing Authority will issue 
and oversee certificates of participation, a type of bond that may be issued 
without voter approval or public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other types of bonds would take nine to 14 months to issue because of public 
hearing requirements or the need for a ballot question. Director of Finance 
Michael Fine said. He denied the district is "trying to circumvent the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The authority will issue the certificates for $5.2 million to $5.5 million -- 
depending on prevailing interest rates -- between now and Thanksgiving, Fine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be paid back over 10 to 15 years, depending on the deal the 
district is able to get. The money to repay the certificates will come from 
lease income from district properties, he said. The headquarters, which will be 
called the Education Center, will be built at Baker and Bear streets in Costa 
Mesa at a cost of $3.8 million. The administration is currently housed in 
aging, temporary Army bungalows at a corner of Newport Harbor High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the meeting Tuesday, the board authorized completion and payment of 
$1.26 million for the Corona del Mar High School air-conditioning system, which 
was overhauled in the summer. That portion of the bonds will be paid back 
entirely from developer fees, Fine said. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 An anonymous foundation has granted the fondest wish of Ensign Intermediate 
School educators: a $200,000 grant to bring technology into all classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I sound calm and composed, it's a facade," Principal Scott Paulson said in 
making the announcement at Tuesday's board meeting of the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was chosen because of its grant proposal and its cultural tolerance 
program. The donor specified that expanding the tolerance program be a primary 
function of the new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, "To Know Us Is to Love Us," includes a parent group and two 
student groups that work to ease cultural tensions and present cultural 
appreciation and conflict resolution programs to students. The grant will make 
it possible to pipe the student meetings into classrooms via a new 
closed-circuit television system. Schoolroom computers will give students 
computer access to the Library of Congress and other key resources, Paulson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will network the entire school," installing a framework to put computers, 
televisions and VCRs in each classroom along with a security system to protect 
them, Paulson said. HOLLY J. WAGNER

FIRE PUTS HOMELESS ADVOCATE IN CLIENTS' SHOES; AID: BARBARA JOHNSON, DIRECTOR 
OF FULLERTON INTERFAITH EMERGENCY SERVICES, NOW KNOWS FIRSTHAND WHAT THE PEOPLE 
SHE'S HELPED FOR 20 YEARS HAVE BEEN THROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past 20 years, Barbara Johnson has worked full time on behalf of 
homeless people and needy families in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 62-year-old widow is homeless herself. A fire destroyed her 
four-bedroom house in Fullerton two weeks ago. And while Johnson is living in a 
hotel room paid for by her insurance company, her tragedy has allowed her to 
experience some of the rootlessness of the displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand better now the stress that the loss of a home puts on you," she 
said. "My daughter and I are homeless, but we're lucky because we have 
insurance and a support system in place. I work with people who don't have any 
kind of support system." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing the only dress that survived the Sept. 30 fire, Johnson reluctantly 
discussed her plight Wednesday in her office at Fullerton Interfaith Emergency 
Service, a church-based organization that provides food and shelter on an 
emergency basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came home from the movies and found my house burned down," Johnson 
recalled. "I'm in a fog. Dazed and numb." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, two days after the blaze destroyed her home of 30 years, Johnson 
was back answering phones at the organization's headquarters. She started 
working for the group as a volunteer 20 years ago, and took a salaried job with 
them in 1982. Today, as executive director, she is responsible for coordinating 
a large pool of volunteers. Since the fire, she hasn't missed a single meeting 
of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, an advocacy group of which she 
is on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's totally dedicated and willing to do whatever needs to be done and 
that's not always easy in her line of work," said Natalie Kennedy, a Fullerton 
resident who has been Johnson's friend for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she has always had compassion for the people she helps, but noted 
her own recent experience has given her added perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "You become so focused on your own survival," she said. "I didn't know what 
was going on in Haiti or Iraq. There are so many day-to-day things to take care 
of that used to be so easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cause of the fire remains under investigation, it occurred as 
some cabinets were being refinished in her kitchen. A pilot light might have 
ignited fumes from paint cans or varnish, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnson returned to the charred home the day after the fire, she found 
virtually nothing left. 
</P>
<P>
 The family dog and cat had died in the blaze and precious photo albums, 
shelves of books, artwork, china, and almost all of Johnson's clothes and 
personal belongings were burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look through the rubble, I find little treasures that mean so much 
now," she said. "I found a stack of photographs that were in a box that 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had raised five children in the home, which she still shared with her 
26-year-old daughter, Christine, a student at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
Johnson's husband, Harold Bruce Johnson, died in 1990. The couple had been 
married for 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she does not know how long it will take to rebuild her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "After work, I still get in my car and start to drive home," she said. "Then, 
I have to stop and think, 'Where am I going?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since she is so used to helping others, Johnson finds it awkward to need help 
herself. A benefit jazz concert is planned for later this month, with proceeds 
going to help her recover from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm want to share whatever we make," she said. "You just wouldn't believe the 
outpouring of support from having roots in this community. If our whole society 
could be that way, we wouldn't have any of these problems."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON JABS AT FEINSTEIN RECORD, 
SIDESTEPS PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington preached more family values, 
less government and repeatedly assailed opponent Dianne Feinstein's record 
during a luncheon address Thursday at Le Meridien Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a mostly partisan crowd of about 500 people, Huffington said he sees 
his campaign as "an opportunity to send shock waves not only through California 
but across America." 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to a question from the audience, he vowed to announce his position 
on Proposition 187 -- immigrant initiative, before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by his wife, Arianna, and two daughters, the congressman from Santa 
Barbara also said that the breakdown in the family is the root of many of the 
country's ills, from crime to teen-age pregnancy to low (college-entrance test) 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to turn this country around, we can't depend on the U.S. 
government," he said. "It comes back to us, to our children and teaching them 
the virtues and values that we grew up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington called for the abolishment of the current welfare system, saying 
money for the poor should be allocated by local government using funds made 
available from Washington through Community Block Grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the old system doesn't work," said Huffington, who also said he 
supports giving a bigger tax break for charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of Huffington's speech focused on Feinstein, however, who is 
battling in a close contest for the U.S. Senate. Feinstein was elected to the 
Senate in 1992, to complete the unexpired term of Pete Wilson, who resigned to 
become governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington accused his Democratic opponent of "flip-flopping" on several 
issues, including the death penalty and health care reform, and criticized 
Feinstein for voting against The North American Free Trade Agreement, saying 
she was swayed by contributions from labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had $3 million worth of reasons for voting against it," he said, noting 
Feinstein had received campaign contributions from organized labor, which 
opposed the treaty. "That's why I don't take political action committee money." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign spokesman Bill Chandler said the senator was opposed to the 
treaty because she is concerned that it might take jobs away from Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also blasted Feinstein for supporting cuts in the nation's defense 
budget, which he said has resulted in the loss of 179,000 jobs in California 
and have caused "low morale" in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first priority of the United States government should be the defense of 
the United States," he said, "We have a President and two senators who don't 
agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he would support cuts of up to $60 billion in the defense 
budget and said Feinstein favored $135 billion in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler accused the congressman of "sour grapes" and said the senator is a 
"staunch supporter" of the state's defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He simply hasn't told the truth about his own record or Sen. Feinstein's 
record," Chandler said. "It will be interesting when he puts aside the cue 
cards and speaks from the heart. It will be interesting to see if he has 
anything to say. Right now, all he is doing is trying to trash his opponent and 
her record without providing a vision for California." 
</P>
<P>
 During the question-and-answer session, an attorney questioned Huffington 
about Proposition 187, which would deny social services, public education and 
all but emergency health care to illegal immigrants. Huffington acknowledged 
not having taken a stand on the hotly contested measure, and made his pledge to 
announce his position before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for immigration, but legal immigration," he said. "My wife had to wait 
five years to become legal. People should go through the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington grew testy when asked about his own legislative record. He blamed 
his inability to get legislation passed on the Democrat-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me give a short course in Government 101," Huffington said to an audience 
member who asked if he had ever had any successful legislation enacted. "The 
Democrats control the House (of Representatives), the Senate and the White 
House. The deck is totally stacked against us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington was also asked about funding for Orange County's first federal 
courthouse. Part of the funding for the $128-million courthouse project in 
Santa Ana appeared to be in jeopardy last month when a congressional conference 
committee slashed the massive Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, which 
included $25 million for the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein blamed Huffington and others for supporting a House decision to send 
the funding bill to a conference committee with instructions to cut $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said Thursday that he supported full funding of the courthouse in 
concept, but the bill contained funding for other projects that are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the stuff that goes on in Washington," he said. "Of course (the 
courthouse) needs the funding."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / MISSION VIEJO CITY COUNCIL; CANDIDATES SEE SPENDING AS TOP 
ISSUE; CHALLENGERS WORRY THAT PRESENT $21-MILLION RESERVE MAY FAST DISAPPEAR. 
INCUMBENTS DEFEND FISCAL POLICIES AND SEE PLENTY OF REASON FOR OPTIMISM.

<P>
 Campaigning on a platform of financial responsibility in government, 
candidates predicting fiscal doom for South County's largest city have one big 
question to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mission Viejo is on shaky economic ground, why is $21 million sitting in 
city reserve accounts? 
</P>
<P>
 Their answer: Financial prosperity in Mission Viejo is a mirage that will 
vanish in a few years, when bonus tax revenues given to newly incorporated 
cities by the state expire in 1997, say candidates Karen Irvine, Larry Smith, 
Neil Lonzinger and Larry Gilbert.  
</P>
<P>
 In their eyes, the past four years have been riddled with examples of wasteful 
government spending: millions of dollars allegedly blown on projects like the 
city animal shelter, World Cup soccer facility and four recreation centers. And 
beginning in 1997, state tax revenues will be slashed by 5% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decisions made today affect financial well-being in the future," said Smith, 
a real estate loan executive. "The money in the city reserves will be down to 
nothing if we continue this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven candidates are running for three seats in the coming November election. 
With one critic of city spending already on the council -- Councilman William 
S. Craycraft -- the balance of power in Mission Viejo could shift to fiscal 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing them are incumbent Mayor Susan Withrow and Planning Commissioner 
Sherri Butterfield, who shake their head at accusations of government waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these are scare tactics," said Butterfield, a technical writer. "Our 
reserves have gone up recently, not down. There's plenty of reason for optimism 
about Mission Viejo, not doom and gloom." 
</P>
<P>
 According to city officials, reserves had dropped from $21 million in 1992 to 
$15 million last year before unanticipated sales tax revenue and some deferred 
maintenance boosted city coffers back up again to $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow, whose background is in municipal land planning, points at the gains 
made by the City Council in the past four years, especially the opening of 
eight major retail stores whose estimated sales-tax revenue will be about $1.6 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truthfully, I'm proud of my record," Withrow said. "We've attracted several 
major businesses to the city. While my wonderful opponents are accusing me of 
reckless spending, I think we've made good, strong investments that will 
strengthen the community." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those investments was a $2.1-million animal shelter that costs about 
$200,000 in city subsidies to run each year -- about $80,000 more than what 
Mission Viejo paid the county for animal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Irvine, a political consultant, said she wouldn't have paid millions for 
the shelter and, if elected, will "eliminate the dog pound and return to having 
the county run it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Withrow said that "thousands of people in Mission Viejo have animals, and 
the animal shelter is a very useful part of their lives. In the near future, 
the shelter will be regionalized as other cities use it and share the costs" of 
running the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council critics say that on average, city employee salaries have been 
allowed to almost double in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd take a long look at employee perks," said Larry Gilbert, a businessman, 
"What I've uncovered shows salaries have gone (on average) from $32,000 to 
$62,000 over last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin Bornstein, city finance director, said the city looked at salaries about 
18 months ago and found that Mission Viejo is no more than 5% higher than the 
average for Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the financial austerity candidates have not offered specific 
proposals for what they would cut from the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd evaluate every major expenditure and work down to see what can be 
reduced," said Neil Lonzinger, a former air freight executive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Butterfield and Withrow say their opponents would make major cuts in 
necessary city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is what they're really saying is that they're going to make major 
cuts," Butterfield said. "Most of the people who came to Mission Viejo came 
precisely because there are activities and facilities here that are way above 
average." 
</P>
<P>
 Lonzinger denied that he and other candidates would start flailing away at 
needed city programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not conservatives who are only going to come in and start cutting," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining candidate, Tom Potocki, a board member on the El Toro Water 
District, has taken pains to separate himself from the political infighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been too much negativity, as there is in all campaigns," he said. 
"Those city dollars, spent rightfully or wrongfully, are gone. We need to take 
care of dollars being spent in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Potocki said the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station reuse plans and a proposed 
city library should be Mission Viejo's top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the county needs an international airport, especially at El 
Toro," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow said the impending base conversion is one of the main reasons she's 
running for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next 18 to 24 months will be critical for the reuse issue," she said. "If 
developed properly, the base could be a huge benefit. Conversely, if developed 
haphazardly it could be our worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed city library is backed by all candidates. However, Gilbert said 
he would downsize building plans from 25,000 square feet to 18,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fully fund it from city reserves, "I'd continue pushing for grants 
and contributions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield, who is chairwoman of the Mission Viejo Library Foundation, said 
25,000 square feet is minimum for a city with a population of 86,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the smallest we could go and still have a city library make sense," 
she said. "As planned, this would still be one of the smallest city-run 
libraries in the county."

RECKLESS DRIVING CHARGE AGAINST STUDENT WEIGHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators said Thursday they will recommend that reckless-driving charges 
be filed against the driver of a car that careened out of control at high speed 
in Mission Viejo on Tuesday morning, injuring all six Capistrano Valley High 
School students aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities concluded that the Toyota, driven by senior Kenneth Wong, 18, of 
Mission Viejo, was traveling at least 64 m.p.h. in a 45-mile-an-hour zone on 
Marguerite Parkway and weaving in and out of rush-hour traffic, said Sheriff's 
Sgt. Fred Lisanti. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 10 people were hurt when the Toyota, driven by Wong, broadsided a car 
and hurtled out of control through an intersection, striking two other vehicles 
and then tumbling onto its roof. Three students were hospitalized after being 
pried out of the crumpled Toyota with the help of a large metal-cutting tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisanti said sheriff's investigators will recommend next week that county 
prosecutors file reckless-driving charges against Wong, who remained 
hospitalized in serious condition Thursday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center in Mission Viejo.  
</P>
<P>
 Lisanti said a reconstruction of the crash confirmed witness accounts that the 
car was speeding and weaving between cars at close distance before the vehicle 
went out of control at Estanciero Drive at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Chang, 15, had her medical condition upgraded and was moved out of the 
pediatric intensive-care unit at Children's Hospital at Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center, a separate facility at the complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Sroothi Jaikumar 14, remained in serious condition in the pediatrics 
intensive-care unit after emergency surgery Tuesday for broken ribs.  
</P>
<P>
 Three other students in the car -- and four motorists and their passengers -- 
also were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries but released within hours 
of the crash.

LAKE FOREST VIOLATED LAW, SUIT SAYS; EL TORO: CITY ACTED AS A POLITICAL 
COMMITTEE IN SUIT CHALLENGING MEASURE A, SO IT MUST REPORT MONEY SPENT AS 
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, AIRPORT PROPONENTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Lake Forest city officials violated campaign disclosure laws by failing to 
report the money they spent on attorneys when they sued to keep the El Toro 
airport initiative off the ballot, airport proponents charged in a lawsuit 
filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court on behalf of the Yes on Measure A 
Committee, alleged that Lake Forest was acting as a political committee when 
the city hired attorneys last summer and sued "for the purpose of influencing 
the outcome of the election."  
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 25, a judge rejected the city's lawsuit, which attempted to remove 
Measure A from the November ballot. The initiative, sponsored by a coalition of 
business and political leaders, would require the county to build a commercial 
airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station when the base is closed in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The money paid by the city to the law firm of Burke, Williams and Sorenson 
should have been reported as a campaign contribution, Measure A proponents 
charged in the lawsuit filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest City Atty. Jerry Patterson is a member of the law firm. A city 
employee said that Patterson, City Manager Gaylord Knapp and Mayor Marcia 
Rudolph were at a Planning Commission meeting Thursday and unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit on behalf of the Measure A Committee, which also included 
committee employee and voter Catherine Kirkpatrick as a plaintiff, was filed by 
Brad Hertz, an attorney with a firm led by Dana Reed.  
</P>
<P>
 Measure A spokesman Dave Ellis said Reed is the treasurer for the Yes on 
Measure A Committee and another political committee formed to promote the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Measure A lawsuit contends that municipalities such as Lake Forest "are 
not exempt from the filing requirements of the (state) Political Reform Act." 
The lawsuit asks the court to order the city to file campaign disclosure 
statements to reveal "expenditures made or incurred for campaign activities in 
opposition to Measure A." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Political Practices Commission spokeswoman Lynda Doherty in Sacramento 
declined to comment on law applicable to municipalities. However, Hertz said 
that commission attorneys advised him the Measure A committee's lawsuit had 
merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received advice from (the commission) in letters and phone conversations 
that litigation expenses pertaining to a lawsuit to remove a measure from the 
ballot are political expenditures and thereby reportable," Hertz said.

STATE MAY DOUBLE FUNDS TO FIGHT TUBERCULOSIS IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The growing number of tuberculosis cases in Orange County may cause state 
funding for TB programs here to double this year, health officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services has already offered the Orange County 
Health Care Agency an additional $150,000, and may contribute another $275,000 
within three weeks, state health officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the cash infusions would increase state contributions to the 
county agency's TB programs to about $905,000. Last year, the agency received 
about half that, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, we are looking for all the help we can get to beef up prevention 
and control," said Roberta Maxwell, the health agency's program director. "It's 
a big help." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Orange County reported 431 cases of active TB, a 16.2% jump 
compared to 1992's total of 371 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150,000 will allow the county to hire another nurse and a data entry 
clerk, both to monitor and follow up on active TB cases. It will also help pay 
for meals and transportation for low-income TB patients and for health 
education programs aimed at high-risk populations in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors is expected to accept the $150,000. And 
state officials are now reviewing the county's application for the $275,000, 
which would come from a new $17-million state program to battle TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the health agency today is expected to release results from TB 
testing at Orange Coast College. On Tuesday, 92 students and instructors 
underwent skin-test screening, which involves pricking the forearm. On 
Thursday, medical officials examined the subjects' forearms for a reaction 
indicating exposure to TB. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing follows the discovery that a Los Angeles woman who had attended 
classes at the college this summer has communicable TB. The woman, however, is 
believed to have contracted the disease after leaving the college in August. 
</P>
<P>
 If students or instructors test positive, they will need a chest X-ray to see 
if the disease can be detected in the lungs. A sputum test would then be 
required to determine whether the disease is communicable. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who have positive skin tests never develop active tuberculosis. 
The disease, which usually affects the lungs, is transmitted by air from person 
to person, often through coughing, sneezing, laughing or singing, health 
officials say.

O.C. BRIEFLY: PICK SYSTEMS TO SUPPLY SOFTWARE TO DIGITAL SCIENCES FOR USE IN 
BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pick Systems Inc. said Thursday that it has signed an agreement to supply more 
than $2 million worth of its database and operating system software to Digital 
Sciences Inc. for use in a purchasing network and business management software 
system now under development. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Digital Science's multimedia computer system will 
allow nursing homes, hospitals, doctors' offices, hotels and restaurants to 
order products and supplies electronically from a catalogue on a CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 The open database operating system and a related graphics program developed by 
Irvine-based Pick Systems will be the basis for the system, Pick officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Orange County company was founded by software pioneer Richard 
Pick. It is an open database operating system, which means it can be installed 
in a wide variety of computers -- as opposed to closed systems like IBM's OS2, 
which controls the operation of IBM machines. Pick operating software is widely 
used in business applications.

 Conversion Industries CEO Quits: John P. McGrain, 49, said he will leave 
Conversion because "the adverse publicity I have received as chairman has 
detracted from shareholder value."The change came two days after the American 
Stock Exchange decided to delist the Pasadena-based company's stock over 
disclosure issues. Conversion has operated as a merchant banking firm since 
1991, investing in small companies and facilitating public stock offerings for 
those firms. But shares of many of those companies, and of Conversion itself, 
have plummeted in value this year. Financial ties among McGrain, Conversion, 
its spinoff companies and Colorado brokerage Tamaron Investments have also 
generated controversy.

 Orange County employers who may not be in compliance with safety and health 
regulations can get help from the state -- without fear of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the California Department of Industrial Relations opened a new 
office in Anaheim to help businesses identify workplace hazards and remove 
them.The Cal/OSHA Consultation Service, as it is called, is staffed by about 
half a dozen people who will provide on-site evaluations and make 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point of the consultation service is to give employers a mechanism to get 
in compliance with the law without the risk of getting cited," said Lloyd W. 
Aubry Jr., director of the Department of Industrial Relations, who was in 
Anaheim for the office opening.

 Counterfeit Clothing: Led by Carlsbad-based No Fear, representatives of major 
trademark apparel brands and authorities Thursday swooped down on an Anaheim 
business that last year was cited for selling counterfeit clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 What they found was that a year later, nothing much has changed.In the 
warehouse of the business, T-Shirt Wholesale Co., agents of the state's 
Department of Justice discovered thousands of counterfeit sweat shirts, shorts, 
jackets and other clothes stacked 20 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 And as they did a year ago, authorities and apparel representatives 
confiscated these goods -- with images of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny and logos of 
trademarks like No Fear -- loading them into a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges are pending against the business owner, On K. Sim, who is on probation 
after last year's raid, said Darryl Phillips, a Justice Department special 
agent. Sim did not return telephone calls.

 Lawsuit Settlement: Nearly two years after a big drywall workers' strike in 
Southern California, six carpenters' union groups involved in that labor 
dispute have agreed to make a "substantial payment" to settle a lawsuit filed 
by 11 San Diego contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, one of many traded by the unions and contractors, alleged various 
unfair labor practices against four carpenter locals and two of that union's 
umbrella groups. The five-month drywall strike, centered in Orange County, 
resulted in a victory for the workers, who won a contract with more than 50 
companies in Southern California. But not the 11 San Diego contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was disclosed in a joint release by the union and contractors. 
Details were not released.

HOMELESS CAMP WEIGHED IN L.A. INDUSTRIAL AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Determined to make Downtown Los Angeles friendlier to business, the Riordan 
Administration has launched a plan to shuttle homeless people to an urban 
campground on a fenced lot in the city's core industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's proposal, which has come under heated attack by some homeless 
advocates, calls for turning a vacant city block in the eastern part of 
Downtown into a homeless drop-in center, where up to 800 people could take 
showers and sleep on a lawn.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about clearing the streets of homeless people," said Deputy Mayor 
Rae Franklin James, who is surveying the area to find the best location for the 
center. "It's about giving the homeless people options so they don't have to 
stay on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles homeless advocates say the proposal is a misguided ploy to 
keep the tattered hordes away from Downtown businesses and out of the sight of 
tourists and shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're just looking to get people off the streets so we don't have to look 
at them, then that's what the city's proposing -- an Orwellian poorhouse," said 
Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a Skid Row social service 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building a large fence or a stadium is nothing but a prison." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's proposal, modeled after a similar center in downtown San Diego, is 
scheduled to be considered Monday by the City Council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee. It will then be forwarded to the City Council, as well 
as the County Board of Supervisors, later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is a major component of a joint city and county effort to reduce 
homelessness in Los Angeles. The drop-in center would be funded with about $4 
million of a $20-million U.S. Housing and Urban Development grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a human solution because we don't think anything else really 
works," said Carol Schatz, the senior vice president for the Central City 
Assn., a business group that encouraged Mayor Richard Riordan to find a 
solution to the Downtown homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a perception, and we hear it over and over from employees, of not 
feeling safe when you are approached (for money)," Schatz said. "It's affecting 
business, that's the bottom line. People are reluctant to come Downtown. The 
mark of a civil society is finding a safe place for (the homeless) other than 
on the streets. " 
</P>
<P>
 Don Spivack, director of operations for the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency, said the city is looking for properties of four to six 
acres just east of Downtown, roughly from Main Street to the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to allow people to camp on the streets at will . . . It is 
illegal and improper to camp in front of other people's property. So we feel 
it's very fair to give them another option," Spivack said. Asked if he expected 
a crackdown on such camp-outs once such a shelter opens, he replied: "I expect 
that to be the next step." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office generally has declined to prosecute people who 
sleep on the Downtown streets because there is not enough alternative housing 
in the area, said spokesman Mike Qualls. He said he was unsure whether the 
policy would be changed if the drop-in center is opened. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the mayor's plan, outreach vans staffed by several social service 
workers would patrol the streets and transport homeless people to the drop-in 
facility on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The center would include a 50-bed shelter, along with showers, restrooms and 
lockers. The bulk of the facility, however, would include a large grassy area 
where transients could rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The center would be open around the clock. The homeless people would also be 
allowed to come in even if they are high on drugs or alcohol -- something that 
is not tolerated at many shelters. Job and drug counseling would also be 
available at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, head of the council committee that is to hear 
the proposal on Monday, said: "I think that it is important to recognize that 
the conditions under which homeless persons live on the street is problematic. 
It has to be humanely addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of an alternative, it would seem to me that the plan has some 
merit," he said. "As long as it's decent and it's clean and it's life 
affirming." 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Councilwoman Rita Walters, in whose district the center may be 
located, also voiced support for the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 James, the Administration's expert on matters of housing, transportation and 
planning, was so impressed with San Diego's center during a recent trip that 
she decided to propose the same facility for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to be invented here to work here," James said. Riordan, who 
is on vacation, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, officials are not surprised that their Neil Good Center for the 
homeless is being emulated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer a straight-forward, no-brainer, no b.s. approach," said Bob McElroy, 
the high-energy former Bible student and former cocaine user and panhandler who 
serves as the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just another link in the enabling chain. If you're just looking for 
a handout and free meal, that's not us. If you want to get off the streets and 
get better, we're here." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 homeless people were at the center shortly after lunch Thursday. 
Staff members say about 400 people a day use the facility. Spirited card games 
were under way at two tables inside, while a pair of chess players concentrated 
on their moves nearby. Several people sat reading, while others did their 
laundry or took a shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need this place." Clarence Rankin said firmly, standing at the 
entrance of the center. "It's a place where you can take a shower, get mail, 
make a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place keeps people off the street, gives them a place where they can 
relax, sleep, read," said Rankin, 52, who saw the stability in his life crumble 
when he began using crack cocaine. "I was working, but alcohol and drugs got in 
the way of my job." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the center has not been free of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 One City Council member has complained that the facility has become a magnet 
for drug dealers, prostitutes and other miscreants. Now the city is trying to 
change the center's image from a place to snooze to a place to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it started, it was a disaster," said San Diego Councilman Juan Vargas. 
"You had fights. You had gangs. You had drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought this was going to be the cure to all our ills and it turned 
out to be the biggest ill of all. Now we are trying to transition out into a 
work center approach. We've added more security and we have the place under 
control now." 
</P>
<P>
 James said officials could make adjustments to the center's operations if Los 
Angeles encounters similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we are just working on the concept," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the City Council and County Board of Supervisors, the project 
could be up and running in about two years, James said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has been embraced by Downtown Los Angeles' business leaders, as well 
as Downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a solution to homelessness but it's a place to deal with them 
until the city, county and federal governments find a better answer," said 
Tracey Lovejoy, director of Central City East Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is unless the county and city deal with homelessness in Central 
City East, there is not going to be a business community here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 One worker at the L.A. Mall on Los Angeles Street said Riordan's plan is 
"beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see anything wrong with it if it's voluntary," said James 
Wallace-Sears, manager at Sears Shoe Service. "This is just another avenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Shsche, who was shopping at a bookstore at the mall, said: "They need 
shelter. Maybe that way someone will control their access to drugs and alcohol. 
But I'm not sure the homeless will like it. Some of them like their freedom and 
lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, several homeless people on Skid Row said they would be leery of using 
the proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be able to deal with people as individuals," said George, a 
longtime Skid Row resident who would not give his last name. "And these people 
don't want to be controlled." 
</P>
<P>
 But 39-year-old Henry, who also declined to give his last name, said he would 
use the center to find permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of living on the streets," he said.

 In darkness, two men in orange spacesuits trudge across the Mojave salt flats 
to take their seats in the cockpit of a spectral SR-71. Sitting on the Tarmac, 
the supersonic spy plane is blacker than a moonless midnight.  
</P>
<P>
 A dozen civilian technicians in jeans and T-shirts tinker with the 
temperamental aircraft, as rivulets of jet fuel stream like sweat off its wings 
and angular fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a pre-dawn scene that could be drawn from the secret annals of the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no Air Force blue-suiters in evidence, however, no armed MPs or 
tight-lipped military spooks. Overseeing the operation is a young civilian 
astronomer in faded Guess jeans and a white cowboy shirt, her waist-length 
brown hair held out of her eyes by sunglasses pushed up on her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 The stealthy craft is bound not for forbidden airspace over Russia or North 
Korea, but for the stratosphere above Los Angeles, where UCLA researchers will 
use its unique high-altitude capabilities to calibrate sensors designed to 
monitor the health of Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is one small symbol of a fundamental change transforming the 
conduct of science in the United States after the Cold War.  
</P>
<P>
 A receding tide of defense funding has exposed an unexpected peace dividend: a 
windfall of laboratory facilities, once-secret apparatus, and sophisticated 
technology, like the SR-71, developed to bolster the military in the decades of 
conflict with the Soviet Union.  
</P>
<P>
 As the threat of nuclear annihilation appears to subside, scientists like 
Jacklyn R. Green, the planetary astronomer in charge of the recent 
NASA-sponsored SR-71 flight, are scrambling to salvage such swords of high 
technology and convert them into tools of basic, civilian research. It is a 
daunting task to even locate such technological treasures, and -- in an era of 
shrinking federal research dollars -- harder still to find the money to operate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our inheritance from the Cold War," she said. "We own it. Our parents' 
generation paid dearly for it. It is a national resource."  
</P>
<P>
 Green, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is at the forefront of those who 
are finding useful scientific work for Cold War hardware forced into 
retirement.  
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department retired its SR-71 fleet -- the world's fastest and 
highest-flying production aircraft -- in 1990. Green learned of the surplus 
planes by chance over lunch one day and immediately volunteered to comb the 
scientific community for experiments suitable for the supersonic craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a solution looking for a problem," Green said of the sleek craft 
silhouetted in the desert dawn.  
</P>
<P>
 Green and SR-71 project manager David T. Lux at NASA's Dryden Flight Research 
Center now have the use of three SR-71s along with dozens of spare engines, 
hundreds of special 22-ply tires and other unique spare parts worth about $1 
billion.  
</P>
<P>
 They also collected a cache of Thor ICBM missiles the military can no longer 
store and, most recently, claimed a set of supersonic Mach-3 drones designed 
for especially hazardous surveillance missions over Siberia and China. The Air 
Force had intended to donate the once-secret drones to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists also are claiming their Cold War patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, marine seismologist John Orcutt is 
using a once-top-secret global network of hydrophones -- originally designed to 
track the signature swish of enemy ship propellers -- to eavesdrop on undersea 
earthquakes. In Newport, Ore., geophysicist Christopher G. Fox tunes in to the 
raucous clatter of underwater volcanoes off the coast of Oregon and Northern 
California with the same U.S. Navy network, called the Sound Surveillance 
System (SOSUS).  
</P>
<P>
 At Caltech, Thomas Ahrens employs a mammoth Star Wars laser to investigate the 
chemistry of giant meteor impacts on ancient Earth. At the Livermore National 
Laboratory, research engineer Stephen Azevedo is using ultra-sensitive imaging 
equipment, designed to find flaws in ballistic missile interceptors, to 
"candle" fossilized dinosaur eggs.  
</P>
<P>
 Physicist Thomas M. Georges is tracking Atlantic hurricanes with a 
$1.5-billion early warning radar near Moscow, Me., designed originally to 
detect incoming Soviet bombers and cruise missiles. The Air Force spent 25 
years and almost $2 billion developing the unusual "over-the-horizon" radar 
system, which can monitor 50 million square miles of ocean. Georges relays his 
minute-by-minute radar reports to the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine researchers and geophysicists even are trying to claim a Navy nuclear 
attack submarine for use as a full-time civilian research vessel. The Navy 
plans to decommission its entire fleet of Sturgeon-class attack submarines in 
the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These civilian scientists, however, are uncovering a wealth of military 
research tools at a time when they can least afford them. For the first time in 
50 years, the federal government and the scientific community it nourishes face 
shrinking budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 If surplus military technology is more plentiful, the money to sustain it for 
peacetime purposes is not, experts say.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, earlier this month the Air Force turned off the Maine radar that 
Georges uses. Only the intervention of four U.S. senators persuaded the Defense 
Department to turn it back on several days later.  
</P>
<P>
 Nine federal laboratories and a consortium of about 60 scientists have now 
developed projects to keep the radar system gainfully employed, ranging from 
weather forecasting and studies of ocean waves to investigations of solar 
magnetic storms. So far they cannot find the $4 million a month to operate it, 
though a federal committee now is looking at ways to keep the radar operating 
permanently as a research facility. Its expenses are being paid temporarily 
with money earmarked for drug surveillance operations.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the surplus defense equipment, like the SR-71, is still so novel that 
it has yet to prove its utility to civilian funding agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 While NASA has budgeted $3 million a year to conduct sonic boom tests and 
other aeronautical research with the craft, Green must hustle to find ways for 
scientists like the UCLA physics team to fly their experiments for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have at this point is shoestring research," Green said. "We have to 
do this more and more because the science budget is dwindling." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond budgetary problems, experts say, the conversion of scientific resources 
is further hampered by a lingering Cold War mentality. Researchers who want to 
take advantage of the Pentagon's surplus scientific resources often must rely 
on goodwill and the rumor mill. At best there may be an announcement on a 
property list or a telephone call from a friendly military program manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Some facilities are still so secret that outsiders may never even learn of 
their existence until after they have been junked.  
</P>
<P>
 For many scientists, the most valuable resources are those that are still 
official secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Many potentially useful Defense Department systems come under the umbrella of 
"national technical means" -- the top-secret devices that the United States has 
employed to keep surreptitious tabs on its friends and enemies, according to 
scientists involved in defense projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the equipment is managed by agencies like the National Reconnaissance 
Office, which, at the height of the Cold War, was itself too secret to even 
mention publicly. Defense experts say intelligence agencies face a special 
dilemma in declassifying or discarding surveillance satellites or the 
sophisticated sensors used to spy on foreign countries.  
</P>
<P>
 They must weigh whether the equipment can easily be turned against the United 
States, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the government, a group of 70 scientists is formally 
evaluating the fate of some secret systems. Their deliberations are classified, 
as is the panel's formal report, which was completed six months ago. It is not 
certain whether the Defense Department and intelligence agencies will follow 
any of its recommendations. Nor is there any guarantee civilian funding will be 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very systematic effort that has been under way for two years, 
looking at everything that national security agencies manage," said Gordon J. 
MacDonald, an international affairs expert at UC San Diego who is chairman of 
the group.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to determine what data and what systems, developed for other 
purposes, can be used to study the Earth and environmental issues," he said. 
MacDonald, a geophysicist who studies climate change, has straddled the line 
between open scientific research and secret projects for most of his career.  
</P>
<P>
 One small example of a once-secret system that could find new utility as a 
civilian research tool is a jet bomber outfitted with an array of electronic 
sensors for surveillance work, he said. Scientists now have shown it can be 
used to gather data about "greenhouse" gases, such as water vapor, in the upper 
atmosphere. On Thursday, the Air Force donated the aircraft to the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the scale of the resources up for grabs, however, such official efforts 
are rare, experts said. Salvage operations most often coalesce around a 
scientist's outrage at seeing the opportunity of a lifetime slip away.  
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Robert Smart has spent the past year handling all military technology 
conversion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is 
pursuing Pentagon castoffs like the Air Force radar system more aggressively 
than any other federal agency. "As far as any organized clearinghouse or 
anything, there is none," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most effective thing he can do is "talk to people and keep my ear to the 
ground." So far, he has been approached independently by 20 different military 
laboratories anxious to preserve research capabilities that are about to be 
abandoned.  
</P>
<P>
 John Orcutt also has had his ear to the ground. Now director of the Institute 
of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Scripps, Orcutt had coveted the Navy's 
extensive SOSUS undersea surveillance system for decades before the Defense 
Department declassified it. He learned of it as an operations officer aboard a 
Navy ballistic missile submarine during the Vietnam War, where he used it to 
play underwater cat-and-mouse with Soviet opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew about it at a time when you couldn't say the word," he said. "The idea 
of using it for scientific purposes was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1989, the $16-billion network was one of the country's most closely 
guarded secrets. The skein of 1,000 sensitive underwater microphones, 
encompassing the Atlantic and the Pacific, is linked by about 30,000 miles of 
cables. A map of the listening arrays is still an official secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Orcutt built his own undersea earthquake sensors for years, knowing full well 
that locked behind a wall of secrecy was a worldwide system that dwarfed any 
research apparatus he could construct on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our telescope on the oceans," Orcutt said. "It is potentially a 
revolutionary tool. The payoff from having access to that kind of data for 
scientific uses is potentially enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 10 scientists have regular access to the SOSUS system today for 
civilian research projects, in part because a security clearance is still 
needed to use the data. They acquired the proper clearances in the course of 
other military projects. There are about a thousand scientists, however, who 
might benefit from the system, if only the Navy would relax its secrecy rules 
enough to allow anyone to publish a detailed description of what the system can 
do, a committee of scientists complained.  
</P>
<P>
 When a military system does find new life in civilian hands, the Defense 
Department gets more than gratitude in return. A discreet Pentagon agenda can 
still be served.  
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the civilian SR-71 flies, project officials note, the Air Force Space 
Command uses the elusive high-speed aircraft to calibrate its infrared 
surveillance satellites and missile detection capabilities. The civilian 
program, they add, also preserves the skilled personnel and irreplaceable 
expertise required to operate a craft that is more rocket than conventional 
fighter jet against a day when it again might be pressed into military service. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Congress in August set aside $100 million to reactivate the SR-71 as 
an operational spy plane because it can make surprise inspection flights over 
any given site. The plane could take off from Edwards, gather photographs and 
radar imagery of all North Korea's nuclear sites, and be back on the ground 
five hours later, defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, whenever civilian marine biologists use the Navy undersea 
sonar system to track California blue whales or monitor undersea earthquakes, 
they are helping to preserve a unique national security network the Defense 
Department no longer has the money to maintain. The Navy's annual budget to run 
the system has dropped from $335 million in 1991 to an expected $60 million 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The SOSUS system, experts said, can serve not only as an invaluable research 
aid, but its unique ability to monitor subtle undersea seismic tremors makes it 
an irreplaceable tool for detecting clandestine nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the efforts of a few scientists kept key listening posts in Bermuda and 
Iceland from being shut down summarily earlier this year. Other segments of the 
extensive sea-floor monitoring system had already been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy doesn't just turn it off," said Fox at the Pacific Marine 
Environmental Laboratory. "They blow it up. There are arrays that have already 
been abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials and scientists are now studying ways to use the system for 
non-military research such as undersea geology and marine mammal studies, as 
well as for nuclear test ban verification. They also are looking at whether it 
can be useful in the war on drugs, by tracking drug runners, and in the effort 
to police commercial fishing, by locating illegal drift-net fishing.

<P>
 In some cases, the Pentagon has no hope of retaining its high-tech resources 
and is simply going out of business as gracefully as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Star Wars program was canceled, for example, the largest and most 
powerful experimental laser in the United States has been begging for 
customers.  
</P>
<P>
 The million-watt near-infrared laser, known as MIRACL, was designed originally 
as a prototype of directed energy weapons that might one day be used to defend 
ships from incoming cruise missiles or to shoot down enemy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Barred from testing it against any objects in space, the U.S. Army Space and 
Strategic Defense Command is shutting down the $800-million laser test facility 
-- but not before conducting an unusual fire sale.  
</P>
<P>
 For a limited time, any suitable civilian experimenter can use the raw 
sustained power of the laser to heat samples to more than 36,000 degrees 
Centigrade for just $1,440 per blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists, however, cannot afford the discounts or even the occasional 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Michael E. Field, chief of the U.S. Geological Survey's Pacific 
marine geology branch, could barely contain his glee when the Pentagon donated 
a surplus $40-million vessel for his ocean research program.  
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000-ton ship, originally designed to tow mile-long cables studded with 
sensitive hydrophones able to pick up the whispers of Soviet submarines sliding 
through the water, was twice as large as the largest ocean-going research 
laboratory in the Survey's service. It was one of several ships, all built 
since 1989, that the Navy turned over to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make it one of the most versatile oceanographic vessels in the 
country," Field said when the craft docked in Redwood City last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Worthy, as the converted craft was to be christened, is headed for 
mothballs.  
</P>
<P>
 Field could not find the $2.5 million for the winches, computers and other 
sampling gear needed to turn the Worthy into a laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was was going to be one of the swords turned into plowshares," Field 
said recently. "Now we are making plans to deactivate the ship."  
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon's largess, he said, had been undercut by rising operating costs 
and fixed budgets in his own agency, and years of inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 In a lament his military counterparts know now by heart, Field added: "Funding 
in all government circles is restricted. Budgets are tight. People have to make 
choices about every dollar spent. What would have been easily doable three 
years ago is no longer feasible." New Uses for Old Weapons 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. scientists are turning warships, "Star Wars" lasers, and once-secret 
surveillance systems into tools of civilian research as fast as the Pentagon 
can throw the equipment on the Cold War scrapheap. But few civilian research 
programs can afford them. Here are two of the military systems that scientists 
are working to salvage. Air Force Over-the-Horizon Defense Radar

THE TIMES POLL; FEINSTEIN KEEPING SLIM LEAD OVER HUFFINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California voters are increasingly sour about both of their choices for U.S. 
Senate, but for the first time since early spring the Los Angeles Times Poll 
found that incumbent Dianne Feinstein's lead over Republican challenger Mike 
Huffington has stopped shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's seven-point edge -- 49% to 42% -- among those voters who said they 
were most likely to cast a ballot on Election Day is about the same as it was 
in a Times poll completed about a month ago. Among all registered voters, 
Feinstein is favored 49% to 40% over Huffington, a freshman congressman from 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Each previous poll conducted this year by The Times has found Feinstein's lead 
cut about in half. It dropped from 30 points to 14 points between March and 
May, then to 6 points by September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still a close race that could go either way," said Susan Pinkus, who 
supervised The Times' statewide survey completed last Tuesday. "Opinions are 
very volatile." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the head-to-head matchup did not change from September, the latest 
poll found opinions of both candidates were still plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the state's voters now have an unfavorable impression of the 
incumbent Democrat and, for the first time since her statewide support was 
measured by The Times in March, 1990, Feinstein's rating was more negative than 
positive. Just 39% of the respondents had a favorable opinion of her. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dramatic turnabout for Feinstein, driven largely by a barrage of 
attack television commercials from Huffington that have aired with little 
interruption for the last seven months. Feinstein has also waged a largely 
negative television campaign since June, but she has had far less to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last March, Feinstein was ranked the most popular politician in 
California with nearly two-thirds of the state's voters reporting a favorable 
opinion of the freshman senator. Now, she is given lower marks than Republican 
Gov. Pete Wilson, whose ratings have rebounded modestly since the beginning of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's performance on the job was also graded lower than both Wilson's 
and President Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 For Huffington, the poll indicates that voters are beginning to form opinions 
about the Republican nominee, who was virtually unknown in California when he 
began his bid for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a month remaining until the Nov. 8 election, a quarter of the 
respondents still say they do not know enough about the GOP candidate to 
express an opinion. But that's down sharply from last month, when more than 
half said they knew little about Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who have made up their minds, however, appear to have developed 
a negative impression of Huffington. Since last month, those reporting an 
unfavorable opinion of Huffington almost doubled to 45% while those with a 
favorable impression increased by about 8 points to 31%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll questioned 1,232 registered voters, of whom 821 are considered 
likely to cast a ballot. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is 
3 percentage points in either direction; for likely voters it is 4 points in 
either direction. Margins of error for smaller subgroups of voters may be 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
 California's U.S. Senate race is headed for a national record as the most 
expensive congressional contest in history, due largely to the expectation that 
Huffington will spend more than $20 million of his personal fortune on the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money has gone for television commercials and both candidates have 
spent most of their money on attacks, the most cost-effective political tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 One result is that the credibility of both candidates has suffered. Feinstein 
retains a small edge on the issue, with about a third of the respondents saying 
she is more honest than her opponent, compared to about a quarter who sided 
with Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Another effect of the negative emphasis is that about half of the state's 
voters consider their choice of candidates to be "the lesser of two evils," not 
a politician they like. That feeling was significant for both candidates, but 
it was more common among Huffington's supporters (58%) than Feinstein's (45%). 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, voters got their first good look at the two candidates when 
Feinstein and Huffington debated on CNN's "Larry King Live" program. But while 
debates can sometimes be a turning point in close political races, the poll 
indicates that this exchange has not been a significant factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 19% of voters said they saw the debate and many of those said it had no 
effect on their decision. Huffington did slightly better than Feinstein among 
voters who said the debate shaped their opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 In another recent development, Huffington's wife has been the subject of 
numerous media stories examining her role in the campaign and her past 
connection to a controversial religious sect. But the survey indicated that 
most voters consider a candidate's spouse to be out of bounds for political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds of the respondents -- including Republicans and Democrats 
-- said a candidate's spouse should "never be made an issue in a political 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the snapshot provided by the poll shows a race that is still up for 
grabs. Both campaigns could find good and bad news in the results. Both 
campaigns also appear to have found fertile ground in their attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has portrayed Feinstein as a career politician under the influence 
of Washington's powerful special interests. He has also broadcast commercials 
criticizing Feinstein's connection to President Clinton and her support for his 
1993 economic package. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the voters agreed that Feinstein is a "tax and spend Democrat" while 
just a quarter said that description does not fit. The tax-and-spend label was 
applied by more than a third of the Democratic voters and about half of the 
independent voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was also hurt by taking political contributions from special 
interests, an attack Huffington has used frequently. More than half of the 
voters said the contributions made no difference, but just over a third said it 
made them less likely to support the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's criticism of Huffington has focused on his background as a former 
Texan who moved to California in 1991 with a fortune made from his family's oil 
and gas company. Feinstein has also demanded that Huffington release his 
personal income taxes, as she has, because he has financed his campaign out of 
his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations seem to have scored points for Feinstein, the poll suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the voters said they were less likely to support Huffington 
because he moved recently to California. Almost the same percentage said the 
Republican's refusal to release his income taxes will diminish their opinion of 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Huffington's decision to finance his own campaign did not 
appear to have a significant effect on his candidacy. In all, 60% said it made 
no difference to them and almost as many said it was good as said it was bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein found a similar mild effect on her race from President Clinton, 
whose sagging image improved slightly among California voters in the latest 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half of those surveyed said it made no difference whether a candidate 
for Senate supported Clinton most of the time. More said they would be less 
likely to support such a candidate (30%), compared to those who would be more 
likely to (21%). 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, the two candidates have shown a strikingly different 
interpretation of what their job should be as a U.S. Senator. 
</P>
<P>
 In his freshman term as a House member, Huffington has not introduced many 
bills and he has voted against most major appropriations because he believes 
government should be scaled back. In contrast, Feinstein has fought for every 
possible benefit for California -- including funding from the crime bill and 
disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 In the poll, almost half of the respondents said they would favor "an 
experienced politician who knows how to get things from Washington for 
Californians" rather than a "political outsider who thinks Washington should 
play a smaller role in Californians' lives." About a third said they would 
prefer an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference was largely partisan, with Democrats widely favoring experience 
(58% to 23%) and Republicans preferring an outsider (45% to 37%). 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein says her biggest accomplishment during her first term as a Senator 
was the passage of a ban on the sale and manufacture of assault-style weapons, 
which was signed by President Clinton last month as part of the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll indicated that twice as many voters were more likely to support 
Feinstein because of the assault weapons ban (42%) as were less likely (20%). 
About a third said it would have no effect on their decision. Small Feinstein 
Lead Holding 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a month to go before the Nov. 8 election, Democratic U.S. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein's favorability ratings have become more negative than 
positive. Yet, among likely voters she maintains a seven-point lead over 
Republican Mike Huffington. If the election were held today for U.S. senator

 Source: LA Times polls of California voters How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,641 adults statewide, by telephone, Oct. 8-11. 
Included in the sample are 1,232 registered voters and 821 likely voters. 
Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. 
Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers 
could be contacted. The sample was weighted slightly to conform more closely 
with census figures for sex, race, age and education. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. The margin of sampling error for the total 
sample and the sample of all registered voters is plus or minus 3 percentage 
points; for likely voters it is 4 points. For certain subgroups the error 
margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other 
factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented.

A VOICE OF POSTWAR JAPAN WINS NOBEL FOR LITERATURE; ASIA: KENZABURO OE'S PROSE 
MARKS A DEPARTURE FROM TRADITIONAL AESTHETICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenzaburo Oe, a Japanese enfant terrible who gave voice to a generation set 
adrift by the destruction of their values and dreams after World War II, won 
the Nobel Prize for literature, the Swedish Academy announced Thursday in 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe, 59, whose fiction is staunchly modern in both style and substance, marks a 
clear break from Japan's traditional aesthetics, represented by such celebrated 
writers as Yasunari Kawabata. The nation's only other Nobel laureate in 
literature, Kawabata won the award in 1968 for such masterpieces as "Snow 
Country" and "The Izu Dancer" and has defined Japanese literature to the rest 
of the world for the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe, however, infuses his prose with such Western techniques as long sentences 
dense with adjectives, shunning the delicate simplicity favored by Kawabata and 
others. He also rejects the elements of Zen mysticism and other trappings of 
ancient culture found in their works, instead tackling such contemporary topics 
as nuclear destruction and the cultural dislocation of postwar Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 He has described his writing as a way of exorcising Japan's past. He is 
outspoken in his criticism against racism, Japan's military buildup and a 
national lack of responsibility in the world, especially toward Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kawabata represented what came to be packaged as Japanese tradition as exotic 
differences for a Western reading audience," said Norma Field, a University of 
Chicago professor of East Asian studies and author of the highly acclaimed "In 
the Realm of the Dying Emperor." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have rice fields in Oe. You are able to begin thinking of Japan and 
postwar society without the immediate baggage of Japanese aesthetics, the 
special relationship to nature and ancient traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Hideo Levy, the first Westerner to write a novel in Japanese, who won the 
prestigious Noma Prize for New Writers last year, said Thursday's award marks a 
milestone in Western literary understanding of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Kawabata is great, it always struck me as a crime against Japan that 
the writer who was grappling with modern society was not recognized," he said. 
"In a sense, this award signifies Western recognition of Japan as a modern 
culture for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the prize, which carries a cash award of $930,000, the Nobel 
committee hailed Oe's works for "creating an imagined world where life and myth 
condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament." 
</P>
<P>
 The novelist, who has often said he writes not for the world but for his 
fellow Japanese, thanked his literary colleagues in brief remarks outside his 
home in Tokyo's upscale Seijo section. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Nobel Prize committee appreciated the achievements of (all) 
Japanese writers," Oe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe was born Jan. 31, 1935, in a village on the southern island of Shikoku as 
the third of seven children from a distinguished family. He received a degree 
in French literature at the University of Tokyo in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 He burst onto Japan's literary scene in the late 1950s with a series of short 
stories. Oe was the first Japanese writer to draw heavily on American literary 
traditions, in contrast to the European bias of most of his contemporaries, 
Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite American authors were those whose heroes search for "personal 
freedom beyond the borders of safety and acceptance," according to his 
translator, John Nathan. His greatest inspiration has been Mark Twain's 
"Huckleberry Finn." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Oe was awarded the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for his novella "The 
Catch," about the experiences of a Japanese boy with a black American pilot 
shot down and captured by villagers. The prize catapulted the then-23-year-old 
into fame as Japan's most important young writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two events in life most dramatically shaped him and his literature. The first 
was on Aug. 15, 1945, when then-Emperor Hirohito -- whom Oe and his 
contemporaries regarded as divine -- announced over the radio that Japan had 
surrendered to the Allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could we believe that an august presence of such awful power had become 
an ordinary human being on a designated summer day?" Oe wrote plaintively in 
his "Portrait of a Postwar Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 The obliteration of his nation's values virtually overnight, as the Allied 
occupation firmly demystified and secularized the nation's supreme spiritual 
symbol, was to become a major theme of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe also became known as a staunch leftist, actively demonstrating against the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 His second transforming event was the birth in 1964 of a brain-damaged son, 
Hikari (Light). The tragedy inspired him to write one of his best-known novels, 
the dark and poetic "A Personal Matter," about a man faced with the 
existentialist choice of killing his deformed child to win his freedom. The 
book's protagonist gets fired from his job for drunkenness, takes a mistress 
and plots his child's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important work, "The Silent Cry," in 1967, described the spiritual 
pilgrimage of two brothers back to their birthplace and the awareness they gain 
about their nation's wrenching social changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe's career changed drastically after Hikari's birth. "He began expressing 
what his brain-damaged son could not and began delving into the very private 
and primitive realm," Levy said. The works never regained his earlier 
originality and raw power, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 But his son turned out to have musical talent as a composer; he won a prize 
for it last year. Last month, Oe shocked the literary world by announcing he 
would give up writing, since his son had found his own expression. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nobel laureate still plans to complete his final project, a 
three-volume novel titled "A Green Tree in Flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid Japan's current climate of "impoverished" social debate, as people 
steadily lose interest in literature, Field said she hopes the prize will 
inspire a new generation to rediscover Oe's works. "I hope they will recover 
the sense of urgency Oe brought to society with so much three-dimensional 
vividness," she said. Selections From Oe

<P>
 * From the 1964 novel "A Personal Matter," translated by John Nathan. 
</P>
<P>
 They were watching the midnight news, Bird in bed on his stomach, lifting only 
his head like a baby sea urchin, Himiko hugging her knees on the floor. The 
heat of day had departed and like primeval cave-dwellers they were enjoying the 
cool air in nakedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they had turned the volume way down with the telephone bell in mind, the 
only sound in the room was a voice as faint as the buzzing of a bee's wings. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Bird heard was not a human voice endowed with meaning and mood, nor 
was he distinguishing meaningful shapes in the flickering shadows on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 From the external world he was letting in nothing to project its image on the 
screen of his consciousness. He was simply waiting, like a radio set equipped 
with a receiver only, for a signal from the distance, which he wasn't even 
certain would be transmitted. 
</P>

<P>
 * From the 1967 novel "The Silent Cry," translated by John Bester:

<P>
 Even before the eye injury I was already showing more and more clearly a 
quality of ugliness that often reminded me how mother had prophesied that, when 
we grew up, my brother would be handsome and I would not. The lost eye merely 
emphasized the ugliness each day, throwing it into constant relief. My born 
ugliness would have liked to hang back, silent, in the shadows; it was the 
missing eye that continually dragged it out into the limelight. Not that I 
neglected to assign a role to this eye: I saw it, its function lost, as being 
forever trained on the darkness within my skull, a darkness full of blood and 
somewhat above body heat.

IRAQI RETREAT HALTED; U.S. WON'T CUT FORCE 
</P>

<P>
 Iraqi forces abruptly halted their retreat back to Baghdad on Thursday, and 
U.S. officials responded immediately by suspending a plan to scale back 
American military deployments to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi move startled U.S. defense officials, who hours earlier had 
announced that the United States was slowing its flow of forces to the region 
and were even talking about returning troops from Kuwait to the United States 
"within weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 As night fell, it was unclear whether the pause in the Iraqi withdrawal was 
merely a logistic foul-up or the beginning of a serious military challenge to 
the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Baghdad, in Washington and at the United Nations on Thursday there were 
rapid-fire diplomatic developments that promised some progress toward an easing 
of the Persian Gulf crisis, while raising the likelihood of a substantial 
long-term American military presence in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrei V. Kozyrev, announced on state television that he would recognize 
Kuwait's sovereignty and its borders. Such recognition is one of the key 
requirements Baghdad must meet before the United Nations will consider lifting 
harsh economic sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. officials all but dismissed Hussein's announcement as a 
propaganda ploy. "We are skeptical because of all the broken promises in the 
past," a U.S. diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a senior official said the Clinton Administration is seeking 
U.N. Security Council approval of a resolution to bar threatening Iraqi troop 
movements in the southern part of the country. The Administration will station 
air and possibly ground forces in the region indefinitely to enforce the 
prohibition, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is prepared to use force "unilaterally" to prevent or punish 
any Iraqi moves that Washington considers hostile to Baghdad's neighbors or a 
threat to international peace, the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright excoriated the 
French defense minister for accusing the United States of exaggerating the 
Iraqi threat for domestic political reasons, even as she sought the approval of 
France and other Security Council members for the Iraq resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic news of the day was the disclosure by officials in 
Washington and in Saudi Arabia traveling with Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry that the withdrawal of the Al Nida division of Iraq's elite Republican 
Guard had come to a halt. An estimated 10,000 troops of the armored division 
took up defensive positions near the city of Nasiriyah, about 120 miles 
northwest of the Kuwaiti border and well south of the line that U.S. officials 
consider the minimum safe distance from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with Perry's delegation said that while Hussein may be testing 
U.S. intentions in deploying troops to the Middle East, the action will 
actually bolster American aims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks as if this may be another test of our resolve by Saddam, which I am 
sure we will pass with flying colors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Pentagon officials, clearly concerned about the development, 
immediately suspended the plan to scale back U.S. deployments, saying that they 
want to watch the situation for at least another 24 hours before deciding how 
to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I can tell you is (that) we don't like what we're seeing," said a key 
Pentagon official involved in the operation, who briefed reporters Thursday 
evening. "They are clearly south of where we would like them to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials who described the Iraqi turnabout on Thursday said that the 
move came as a surprise to U.S. intelligence officers, who had previously 
believed that the Republican Guard division in question was proceeding all the 
way back to its home base of Mosul in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, an official said, the unit abruptly halted near Nasiriyah and 
proceeded to dig in, at least partly, in an apparently defensive position. Some 
units that should have gone to other locations have not and others remain 
"unlocated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the day, the Pentagon announced that, in view of Iraq's rapid 
withdrawal from the Kuwaiti border so far, it was delaying the deployment of 
thousands of U.S. troops and aircraft, including the 18,000-member 1st Marine 
Expeditionary Force from Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased to say that Iraq heard our message. Its forces have begun a broad 
retreat from the border area," President Clinton told a group of radio and 
television news directors in Los Angeles in a speech beamed via satellite from 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake informed Clinton that 
the Iraqi retreat apparently had halted, and the President made no further 
comment on developments in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise move by the Iraqi unit raised fears by some analysts that their 
worst nightmare may be coming true -- that Hussein might play cat-and-mouse 
with U.S. troops, forcing Washington to react continually and keep troops in 
the area for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a senior Administration official late Thursday said that Washington is 
prepared to maintain a large contingent of warplanes and possibly ground troops 
in the Persian Gulf indefinitely to keep Iraqi forces in check. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi turnabout also cast doubt on an earlier statement by Perry, who told 
reporters in Jidda that Washington will probably limit the number of troops it 
sends to the region to 30,000, rather than the 40,000 cited last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry met for 90 minutes with King Fahd at the Royal Palace here, and they 
discussed joint commitments in turning back the Iraqi threat. The senior 
defense official said that the king endorsed the expansion of the "no-fly" zone 
in southern Iraq to include a "no-drive" zone for Iraqi tanks as well, a plan 
that has been rejected by Russia and France. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington and New York, U.S. officials were outlining a plan to force 
the full withdrawal of the Republican Guard and limit future Iraqi troop 
movements in the southern part of the country.  
</P>
<P>
 A White House official, who briefed reporters on condition that he not be 
named, said the Administration believes that it has sufficient authority under 
existing U.N. resolutions to respond on its own to Iraqi military moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the authority now to act as we see fit," the official said. "In the 
future, we will act unilaterally if we have to." 
</P>
<P>
 The means of enforcing the resolution do not appear in the draft of the 
resolution, but officials made clear that the primary tool to be used to 
contain Hussein is American air power. Even after the current crisis eases, the 
United States will station more than 100 attack and fighter aircraft at bases 
in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and elsewhere in the region, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the official added, the Administration hopes that new international 
restraints on Hussein's behavior will lead to a permanent end to his 
adventurism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not our intention to tie down unnecessary ground forces or 
even air power there," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said that the American proposal goes beyond requiring Hussein to 
remove his Republican Guard units from the Kuwait border area. 
</P>
<P>
 While the current American plan would allow Hussein to maintain the 50,000 
regular army troops now stationed in southern Iraq, they would not be allowed 
to carry out any maneuvers that appeared to threaten Kuwait, Saudi Arabia or 
any other nation in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed resolution would also prohibit any Iraqi actions that interfered 
with the functioning of a U.N. team monitoring the dismantling of Iraq's 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, Albright delivered a decidedly undiplomatic 
tongue-lashing to French Defense Minister Francois Leotard. Clearly annoyed by 
Leotard's charge in Paris on Wednesday that domestic politics powered Clinton's 
policies on Iraq, Albright derided his remarks as "ludicrous," "uncalled-for" 
and "counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 "While we're talking about politics," she said, "there are countries that have 
commercial interests with Iraq, and I think that one ought to look into that 
and consider reactions in that guise." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this squabble, Albright insisted that the five countries with a 
Security Council veto -- the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China 
-- are close to agreement on a proposed resolution designed to pressure Hussein 
into not moving his forces in a provocative manner toward Kuwait again.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SIMPSON CASE LEAKS MAY BE A SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT; COURTS: 
POLICE, PROSECUTORS, MEDIA FACE SCRUTINY TODAY AS ITO HEARS DEFENSE BID TO 
DISCOVER WHO RELEASED INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Aggressive legal maneuvers by O.J. Simpson's defense team to probe "the source 
and purpose" of leaks in the double murder case may not get to the bottom of 
how controversial stories were generated, but it could prove embarrassing to 
the police, the district attorney's office, some members of the media and 
perhaps even the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito has scheduled a hearing for this afternoon 
on a defense request that he move to identify media sources and take action to 
repair harm allegedly done to its client. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ito's options are launching an investigation, requiring police officers 
or attorneys to testify under oath or sign affidavits about their dealings with 
the press, granting the defense special courtroom privileges -- such as more 
challenges of potential jurors -- or taking the highly unlikely steps of 
excluding evidence or dismissing charges because of prejudicial publicity. He 
also could issue a gag order. 
</P>
<P>
 Or he could do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very aggressive attack by the defense," said Loyola Law School 
professor Laurie Levenson. "This could open up lives and destroy careers 
without having any legal significance to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theme of the defense from the beginning has been to keep the attention 
away from O.J. Simpson and put the other side on trial so that by the time the 
jury hears the case, they'll tend not to believe anything the police say," 
Levenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be . . . embarrassing to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the defense subpoenaed Cmdr. David J. Gascon, who is the Police 
Department's chief spokesman, and also summoned to court KNBC reporter Tracie 
Savage and KNBC general manager Carole Black. Defense sources also disclosed 
that they plan to subpoena two high ranking members of the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, an LAPD spokeswoman said Police Chief Willie L. Williams, 
whom the defense also said it would subpoena, would not testify. Sources said 
Williams has submitted a sworn declaration, obviating the need for him to 
appear in court. The Police Department also announced that Gascon's promotion 
to deputy chief is still on track. 
</P>
<P>
 In a motion filed under seal last week, Simpson's attorneys said they wanted 
to determine "whether employees of the LAPD crime lab or any other members or 
agents of the LAPD . . . have been responsible for the deliberate disclosure to 
the media of confidential information or evidence, particularly false 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who deliberately leak false and highly prejudicial information on the 
eve of trial are capable of manufacturing false evidence against the 
defendant," the motion contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys filed the motion not long after Ito denounced media leaks, 
particularly a KNBC story that he branded as inaccurate and irresponsible. 
After that report aired, the judge threatened to pull the plug on live 
television coverage -- a matter that is to be heard Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's hearing, prompted by the defense motion on leaks, drew mixed reactions 
from legal experts. Los Angeles defense lawyer Barry Tarlow said he was not 
surprised by the defense move, contending that Simpson had been the victim of 
"a drumbeat of leaked prejudicial information." Tarlow and several other 
attorneys said they were unaware of any leak inquiry during a trial that had 
yielded successful results, but that lack of success has not stopped some 
exasperated judges and litigants from trying. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, after a series of leaks last year in one of the cases stemming 
from the bombing of New York's World Trade Center, U.S. District Judge Michael 
B. Mukasey ordered a number of law enforcement personnel from the FBI and other 
agencies to prepare sworn statements about any contacts they had with 
representatives of ABC, the New York Times or New York Newsday. The judge also 
required the law enforcement officials to describe any contacts they knew of 
between their colleagues and the news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the case, the judge ordered defense lawyers to file similar sworn 
statements after information damaging to the prosecution was leaked to the 
media immediately after it had been turned over to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In both instances, no one admitted to being the source of the leaks and the 
judge was unable to discover the source, said New York defense lawyer Ronald L. 
Kuby, one of those who signed a declaration. "Notwithstanding the judicial 
terror tactics in our case, all the information was leaked and no one was 
punished," Kuby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the most noteworthy probe of a leak in a Los Angeles trial was 
precipitated in October, 1970, when Bill Farr, then a reporter for the Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner, published a story containing information obtained from 
a transcript of testimony of a potential prosecution witness in the Charles 
Manson murder trial. Farr said he obtained the transcript from one or more of 
the attorneys in the case, all of whom were subject to a gag order, but he 
declined to say which one. Because of that, Farr was held in contempt and spent 
46 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, the ability of a reporter in California to refuse to disclose 
confidential sources has been strengthened considerably, said Kelli L. Sager, a 
Los Angeles attorney who represents The Times and several other media 
organizations. "The California Constitution provides a privilege for reporters 
which prevents the court from holding them in contempt if they refuse to reveal 
unpublished information or the names of confidential sources," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no law barring a reporter from publishing or broadcasting leaked 
information during a trial. And because no gag order has been imposed in this 
case, there is no basis for Ito to hold in contempt any individual involved in 
a leak -- journalist or source -- said Douglas E. Mirell, a Los Angeles 
attorney and constitutional law specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC officials acknowledged Thursday that Savage and Black had been 
subpoenaed. Station sources said KNBC lawyers would move to have the subpoenas 
quashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said he has not been subpoenaed and was unaware of 
anyone else in his office who had been. Garcetti said he opposes a request, 
made earlier by Simpson defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro, to have an 
investigation of leaks by the California attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident in the ability of the LAPD to conduct their own 
investigation," Garcetti said, referring to an inquiry by the Police 
Department's Internal Affairs Division. According to sources, the police unit 
has interviewed officers and collected material in an effort to determine the 
source of a KNBC story that said DNA tests showed that blood drops found on 
socks seized from O.J. Simpson's house showed a genetic match to Nicole Brown 
Simpson's blood. The department also has been seeking to determine the source 
of a CNN story that echoed the KNBC report. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito denounced the KNBC story in open court, during a hearing televised live, 
and elicited comments from lead prosecutor Marcia Clark that the story was 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern University law professor Myrna Raeder said the judge has the 
inherent authority to take action on matters that affect cases before him. 
"However, I would think it's unlikely the judge is going to want to take on an 
investigatory procedure at the same point he is trying to pick a jury, get 
through the Kelly-Frye hearing (on the admissibility of scientific evidence) 
and start the trial." 
</P>
<P>
 New York University law professor Stephen Gillers agreed, saying that an 
extended probe of leaks could turn into a major diversion that is unlikely to 
turn up the source of leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillers and others also said there were risks in the motion for the defense. 
"The leaks haven't only been from the state," he said, noting in particular a 
July article in the New Yorker that attributed to defense attorneys the theory 
that a Los Angeles police detective may have planted a bloody glove at 
Simpson's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for a discretionary remedy, based on prosecution leaks, 
then certainly one factor in the judge's decision will be whether the defense 
has clean hands. A judge won't be inclined to hear only about the sins of one 
side," Gillers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers of the case's media coverage said they have discerned stories 
that appeared to have been generated by defense leaks. And Los Angeles defense 
lawyer Gerald L. Chaleff said he found it "real interesting that a motion about 
leaks gets leaked," referring to the fact that several stories have been done 
about the defense motion up for a hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
 The document was filed under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 A court spokeswoman said Ito is considering holding today's hearing in 
chambers, outside the presence of journalists.

PLO UNITS SWEEP GAZA IN HUNT FOR ISRAELI SOLDIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinian police swept through the Gaza Strip on Wednesday night and 
Thursday morning, arresting at least 150 suspected activists from the militant 
Islamic organization Hamas in a desperate attempt to locate a kidnaped Israeli 
soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, 50,000 people responded to a plea from Cpl. Nachshon Waxman's 
parents to show solidarity with their abducted son and offered prayers in 
Jerusalem's Old City at the Western Wall, a site holy to Jews as the last 
remnant of the Temple of Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
 As Israelis waited and prayed, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman 
Yasser Arafat resorted to the most extensive roundup of suspects he has ordered 
since taking over responsibility for the daily lives of Palestinians in Gaza in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Waxman's abduction, Arafat had carefully courted Hamas, an organization 
with a large following in Gaza. The sweep he ordered Wednesday night brought 
cries of outrage from Hamas leaders, who warned that they now feel free to use 
violence against the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to defend ourselves by whatever means necessary," said Mahmoud 
Zahar, a Hamas political leader, in an interview at his home Thursday. Zahar 
said Palestinian police kicked in his doors at 1:30 Thursday morning and 
searched his house for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not even the Israelis did this when they were here," Zahar said, pointing 
with disgust at the broken glass blanketing his front step. "The Palestinian 
Authority has decided to side with the Israeli side and to stand against the 
Islamic side." 
</P>
<P>
 Zahar disputed the PLO's statement that it had arrested 150 activists. He said 
the number was between 200 and 300. Speaking in Gaza on Thursday, Arafat warned 
that he would "not allow any defiance" of his government's authority. His aides 
said he is determined to do whatever he can to locate the 19-year-old Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
 American Consul General Edward Abington visited the home of Esther and Yehuda 
Waxman to express concern for their son's fate. Esther Waxman immigrated to 
Israel from New York City in the 1970s, and Nachshon Waxman has dual 
Israeli-American citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Abington said he was visiting on behalf of Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and had conveyed Christopher's assurances that "we are doing 
everything we can to try to see their son released unharmed and to convey to 
them what we have been doing to show our deep concern about this terrible 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The Iziddin al-Qassam military unit of Hamas issued a leaflet Thursday 
repeating its threat to kill Waxman by 9 p.m. today (11 a.m. PDT) unless Israel 
agrees to release Hamas leaders held in Israeli jails and dozens of other 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soldier will be immediately executed a short while after the deadline," 
the leaflet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheik Ahmed Yassin, a founder of Hamas and its spiritual leader, has been in 
Israeli prison for more than five years. He is said to suffer several medical 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on Israel Television on Wednesday night, Yassin asked that Waxman's 
abductors not harm him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I advise in a situation like this not to harm the soldier and to treat him 
well, since killing has no point," Yassin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin welcomed Arafat's crackdown as a "start," 
but he said that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process will be gravely harmed 
if Arafat does not make a real effort to win Waxman's release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as a fundamental test with far-reaching implications for the 
future," Rabin told Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials indicated that they too see the kidnaping as a test of 
their authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Arafat, made a 
decision last night that it is necessary to save the peace process," Suffian 
abu Zaida, a PLO official in charge of Israeli affairs, told Israel Army Radio.

GENETIC DISCOVERY MAY AID EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF DYSLEXIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a finding that could soon have a major impact on the diagnosis and 
treatment of dyslexia, scientists have identified genetic markers that should 
allow early identification of the reading disorder in high-risk children or 
even in fetuses, experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego and Colorado researchers report today in the journal Science that 
they have linked the reading disorder, which arises in people with an otherwise 
normal intelligence, to a small region of chromosome 6, one of the 23 pairs of 
chromosomes that compose the human genetic blueprint. While they are racing to 
identify the gene in this region that causes dyslexia, they are also developing 
a genetic test that could identify the disorder long before a child attempts to 
begin reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Using recently developed interventions and new techniques for diagnosing 
dyslexia at ages 5 to 6, clinicians now can make significant improvements in 
the reading ability of perhaps half the children treated. But the diagnostic 
techniques are not widely available yet, and dyslexia, which affects 5% to 10% 
of the population, is not normally diagnosed until around age 8. By that age, 
even the best interventions can help no more than 25% of dyslexics. 
</P>
<P>
 Most researchers believe that the interventions would be even more effective 
if they could be applied at an earlier age, but there has previously been no 
way to determine the presence of dyslexia in younger children. 
</P>
<P>
 With dyslexia, a person's ability to perceive and process words, numbers and 
other symbols is impaired. Often, letters or numbers may appear reversed, for 
example, making it unusually difficult for a person to absorb the information 
on a page. 
</P>
<P>
 A new genetic test for the disorder based on today's findings would be 
invaluable, said neuropsychologist Reid Lyon of the National Institute of Child 
Health and Human Development. "There is no doubt that we can make much greater 
improvements if it (dyslexia) is discovered earlier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one could identify these children well before they start school, for 
example, they could begin intensive training in time to avoid the potential for 
psychological trauma that reading deficits can cause in the classroom," said 
geneticist John DeFries of the University of Colorado, one of the study's 
co-authors. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding could be "extremely significant," said Will Baker, executive 
director of the National Dyslexia Research Foundation. "The issue we always 
deal with is the low self-esteem that the kids develop from failures in the 
classroom when their dyslexia isn't recognized. This discovery could change 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have previously localized the cause of dyslexia to changes in "the 
back end of the left side of the brain, (in) the temporal lobe area," Lyon 
said. In August, furthermore, a New Jersey team reported that this region of 
the brain in dyslexics contains a deficiency in cells that specialize in 
comprehending rapid sounds. This lack of comprehension, suggested Paula Tallal 
of Rutgers University, may be a major factor in the later difficulty in 
learning to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about the source of these differences between dyslexic and normal 
brains has included exposure to viruses, chemicals or hormones during pregnancy 
and trauma in the womb. While those factors may play a role, DeFries and his 
colleagues have shown by twin studies that genetics is very important.  
</P>
<P>
 In the new study, DeFries and his colleagues at the University of Colorado, 
Sequana Therapeutics in San Diego and Boys Town National Hospital in Omaha 
studied two different groups of dyslexics. One group comprised 50 sets of 
fraternal twins in which at least one twin was dyslexic. The second group 
consisted of 358 individuals from 19 extended families with a history of 
dyslexia. 
</P>
<P>
 By using recently developed genetic engineering techniques to identify genetic 
markers in DNA from the blood of the subjects, the researchers were able to 
show that the suspected gene was in a region of chromosome 6 that could contain 
a few genes or as many as 200. They are now trying to identify the specific 
gene involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it could take several years to identify the gene, the new study 
promises to have an impact much sooner. "We could, in principle at least, make 
informed guesses right now as to whether particular children are at risk or 
not," University of Colorado geneticist Dale Fulker said. But practically 
speaking, he added, it will take Sequana Therapeutics six to 18 months to 
develop a genetic test that could make such determinations widely available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neuroscientist Gordon Sherman of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston cautioned, 
however, that the new study still must be replicated, noting that an earlier 
study linking dyslexia to chromosome 15 could not be replicated. Today's study, 
however, "appears to be much more robust," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new results, he said, brought him "great excitement. . . . If you can 
diagnose this early and start to treat it, you can bypass some of the emotional 
problems that come with being in school and failing and not knowing why -- and 
being treated in a very poor way."

BORDER HAS TIGHTENED, OFFICIAL SAYS; IMMIGRATION: DESPITE UPBEAT ASSESSMENT, 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ATTORNEY SAYS WILSON HAS 'HINDERED' SOLUTIONS. GOVERNOR'S 
AIDE SAYS PRESSURE FROM STATE SPURRED THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Justice Department's No. 2 official said Thursday that the Border Patrol, 
with the aid of the Defense Department, has sharply reduced the number of 
illegal immigrants coming across a heavily traversed section of the 
California-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Jamie Gorelick, returning from a two-day visit to the border 
south of San Diego, coupled her upbeat assessment with a prediction that the 
government will be able to "secure the entire Southwest border." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Gorelick stepped up the Administration's attack on 
California Gov. Pete Wilson, who has been highly critical of federal efforts to 
halt illegal entries. She rejected the suggestion that Wilson has put the 
immigration issue on the front burner and maintained that he has "hindered" 
solutions and "has not been constructive at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, Wilson's press secretary, countered that it was California's three 
lawsuits against the federal government that led to "substantial action" by the 
Clinton Administration. Walsh dismissed as "ludicrous" Gorelick's statement 
that Wilson had strongly supported allowing California employers to hire 
illegal immigrants and had opposed sanctions against employers in certain 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick, whose responsibilities include overseeing the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, described looking at sites where "people had been 
running across the border utterly unimpeded for years" and finding them 
"quiet." She provided no specific figures on the decrease, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fencing, the lighting, the sensors, the night scopes, the positioning of 
the Border Patrol strategically with the assistance of friends in the 
Department of Defense who advised on the best deployment . . . and the new 
resources that we've brought to bear at the border have really worked," 
Gorelick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon's Center for Low Intensity Conflict examined the topography and 
terrain for the Border Patrol and helped site sensors, scopes and personnel "to 
the maximum advantage," she said. "There is not enough in the way of resources 
for us to link arms across the border from California to Texas. . . . It really 
made an enormous improvement by bringing to bear the learning from other 
situations," said Gorelick, who was the Pentagon's general counsel before 
moving to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to say that we have the entire Southwest border secured, but it 
is to say that a seemingly intractable problem is in fact addressable by 
equipment and manpower."  
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick said she expects smugglers of immigrants to "test our resources" east 
of the 15 miles or so of the border that has already been secured, an area with 
"less welcoming" topography for attempted crossings. "We have a very good 
planned deployment to address any effort on their part to move east," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol now is extending its border-tightening effort east to meet 
up with improvements already in place in El Paso and is targeting Arizona for 
its next big effort.  
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, who is in the San Diego area to attend a U.S. 
attorneys' meeting there and to take another look at the border situation, will 
announce additional border steps today . 
</P>
<P>
 In her comments to reporters at the Justice Department on Thursday, Gorelick 
was ambiguous on when she expects the Southwest border to be secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect that we will indeed be able to secure the entire Southwest border 
over the course of this program," she said.

FIGHTING AIDS WITH LOVE; VOLUNTEERS: WOMAN TAKES TO STREETS TO EDUCATE 
PROSTITUTES, COUNSEL YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT DANGERS OF LIFESTYLE.

 Just before midnight, Mercedes Ballon is ready to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing walking shoes and comfortable clothes, her red hair teased and her 
long nails painted crimson, she grabs her black purse and straw basket bulging 
with her most important accessories: packs of condoms and brochures about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, she is in a dark Anaheim park or a Santa Ana alley doing what has become 
a life mission: trying to get young prostitutes off the streets and warning 
them about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Ballon, 41, an immigrant from Peru, has gone on this search 
in predominantly Latino neighborhoods almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Those she seeks out -- male and female -- have come to know Ballon as a mother 
figure. They occasionally gather at her apartment in Anaheim for a charla 
(talk), where they often express fear of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night, Ballon passed out sheets of typing paper and asked five 
young prostitutes to write or draw what they know about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio, 22, wrote in Spanish: "Having AIDS is like being dead in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yerika, 17, drew a picture of a girl crying, and another picture of a family 
with a slash through it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the participants, 17-year-old Miguel, shared his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stepfather used to beat me and abuse me in Mexico until I couldn't take it 
anymore," he said. "So I came here when I was 15 and have been on the streets 
trying to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel later said Ballon persuaded him to quit the streets, get a job as a 
dishwasher and enroll in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody cares what happens to you, you start to care about yourself," 
he said, describing Ballon as a "very good woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Ballon formed Que Tan Grande Es Tu Amor Por Un Nino? (How Big is 
Your Love for a Child?) a group of about 60 volunteers, including doctors, 
nurses, teachers, students, business people and artists. The group's members 
counsel the young prostitutes about disease, listen to their troubles, and try 
to console and cheer those with AIDS. Some provide free services such as hair 
cuts, manicures, art lessons and physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 They also offer their services to the sick or needy children Ballon finds on 
the streets or hears about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to offer emotional refuge and let these kids know that they 
are not alone, that people love them and care for them," said Ballon, a 
divorcee with four grown children. "Some of them feel like there is no hope, 
and I cry with rage every day because they have dreams. . . . They have 
feelings and I want those sentiments to be happy while they're alive." 
</P>
<P>
 When she lived in Peru, Ballon volunteered for the Red Cross and helped an 
aunt, who is a nun, open a home for orphans. The aunt, she said, inspired her 
to help young people in her new homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballon, a former nurse, teacher and social worker, was prompted to start How 
Big is Your Love for a Child? after failing to find an organization or hospital 
in Orange County where she could volunteer her services, she said. Some groups 
told her she needed to speak English to become a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People told me I was crazy and that my program would be impossible to launch, 
especially because I don't speak English," Ballon said. "OK, I don't speak 
English but I do speak the language that all mothers speak: love. . . . As I 
see it, there is a gigantic need for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Her group, she said, "is growing faster than I ever imagined."  
</P>
<P>
 To lend credibility to her work, Ballon recently completed a program sponsored 
by a private, nonprofit agency in Santa Ana that teaches Latinas about AIDS and 
safe sex and encourages them to teach others. She also completed a special Red 
Cross training course and an American Cancer Society course in supporting the 
terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 And she is taking English classes in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballon's mission takes on "a tremendous load," said Irene Martinez, director 
of the program for Latinas. "There's a lot of suffering out there and not 
enough people like (Ballon) who want to help and heal these people who are 
hurting." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Hoskins, a director of the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange 
County, called Ballon "a dynamo." 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very dedicated to her cause," Hoskins said. "She strikes me as really 
very serious about her mission." 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Ballon, who makes wedding decorations for a living, said she is 
trying to raise money to be able to rent a building where she can provide free 
shelter and activities including dance classes, music lessons and sports 
clinics for children.  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, she will begin giving free classes on AIDS awareness at the George 
Washington Community Center in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers of Ballon's organization praise her commitment and dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone with common sense can appreciate what she is doing," said Emma 
Maligon, a volunteer and real estate agent from San Juan Capistrano. 
"Everything she does, she does with her heart. She could use a lot more support 
financially, but even if she doesn't get it, she's not one to stop helping the 
kids."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; ATTORNEY GENERAL; LUNGREN AND UMBERG TRADE JABS IN DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a lively debate before the Capitol press corps, Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and 
Democratic challenger Tom Umberg traded barbs Thursday over immigration, 
on-the-job experience and a key crime information program. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg charged that the attorney general is more of a politician than a 
prosecutor and has failed to properly prioritize spending by his office to help 
cut into California's crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren painted Umberg, an Orange County assemblyman and former assistant U.S. 
attorney, as a law-and-order greenhorn who would have to get "on-the-job 
training" if he became the state's top cop. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general, who was holding a 15-point lead among likely voters in a 
Times poll this week, kicked off the 45-minute debate before the Sacramento 
Press Club by challenging Umberg to run a campaign free of mudslinging. Lungren 
then blasted his rival for failing to help lobby the federal government to make 
it easier to use the death penalty. Lungren called himself "a national leader" 
in the death penalty reform effort, but said "not one peep was heard from my 
opponent" during the fight in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a death penalty supporter, counterattacked by suggesting that Lungren 
has failed to fund "nuts and bolts" programs that are vital to fighting crime 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the attorney general's office is up to nine months behind in updating 
rap sheets and more than two months behind in processing fingerprints. 
Lungren's program designed to keep track of sex offenders has managed to keep 
tabs on only 24% of all paroled molesters and rapists, the challenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg also criticized Lungren for hiking his office communications budget in 
1992-93 at the same time the attorney general cut funding to the Violent Crime 
Information System. Umberg contends that the system's computer database could 
have proved a vital tool in capturing Richard Allen Davis, the repeat felon 
accused of the Northern California kidnaping and murder of young Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the priorities of a politician," Umberg said. "Those aren't the 
priorities of someone who has experience in the field, someone who understands 
the importance of things like rap sheets." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren blamed those problems on more than $34 million in general fund budget 
cuts the Legislature passed down to the Department of Justice, which the 
attorney general oversees. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease some of the pain, Lungren said he cut management positions yet was 
still forced to dip into some programs. He said the computer database that 
might have helped in the Klaas case was in the process of being funded at the 
time of the girl's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also said Umberg has been consistently unwilling to buck powerful 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and questioned whether he would prove any 
different if elected attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt that suddenly you're going to be struck by lightening and be tough 
with Willie Brown," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair also clashed over Proposition 187, the initiative that would sharply 
curtail health and education benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren once again refused to take a position on the proposal, saying he has 
not read the initiative nor finished a report compiled by Department of Justice 
attorneys. Umberg noted that Lungren's office was responsible for summarizing 
the measure for the ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 The challenger said he is staunchly opposed to the measure, which he believes 
will put between 200,000 and 500,000 children "on the streets," posing problems 
for society.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR; DAVIS, WRIGHT BATTLE FOR THE 
SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor Gray Davis is pouring more than 
$2 million into a drive to defeat state Sen. Cathie Wright, his little-known 
and underfinanced Republican opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But the liberal-leaning Davis, the state controller, is not merely trying to 
bury the conservative Simi Valley lawmaker in their Nov. 8 matchup for the 
state's No. 2 office. Davis' parallel goal is to rehabilitate his own image, 
tarnished by his unsuccessful 1992 campaign for the U.S. Senate against Dianne 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In that losing effort, a negative Davis TV ad sparked a furor by comparing 
Feinstein to convicted hotelier Leona Helmsley. Feinstein's backers described 
the 30-second spot as "sleazy" and offensive to women and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-term controller has sought to reduce any lingering anger over the spot 
among Democrats by strongly endorsing Feinstein's Senate reelection bid, 
raising funds for other statewide Democratic candidates and staying in close 
touch with his gubernatorial running mate, Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, underdog Wright is now focusing on the Feinstein ad to show that Davis 
has never "learned how to effectively campaign against women because I don't 
believe he has ever respected women." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on the campaign trail, Davis shrugged off the criticism and 
blasted Wright, with whom he served in the Assembly, as "a far-right extremist" 
who opposes abortion rights and other issues important to women. Davis favors 
abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Not withstanding the heated rhetoric, the campaign to succeed retiring 
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy has been a low-key affair that has 
generated little attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the election nears, that could change. Davis has prepaid about $1 
million for campaign spots and expects to shell out another $1 million this 
week for more air time. While Davis has raised $1.7 million this year, Wright 
has brought in only $450,000, though she hopes to raise considerably more to 
launch a competitive TV attack on the better-known Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll this week showed Davis with a commanding 2-to-1 lead 
over Wright among likely voters, making the controller the closest thing the 
Democrats have to a sure winner among statewide races. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Davis succeed and Brown fail in her race against Gov. Pete Wilson, the 
controller will be catapulted into the ranks of the top contenders for the 1998 
campaign for the state's top job, according to Democratic insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last time a lieutenant governor moved into the governor's office was 
in 1953 when Goodwin Knight succeeded Earl Warren. Indeed, one joke around the 
Capitol is that the lieutenant governor's most important job is to check to see 
if the chief executive's heart is still ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the duties of the post are limited to filling in for the governor, 
serving as the largely ceremonial presiding officer of the state Senate and 
sitting on about half a dozen boards, including the University of California 
Board of Regents and the Economic Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wright and Davis boast that they will transform the chairmanship of the 
latter commission into a bully pulpit to revitalize the state's economy. But, 
as noted by McCarthy's office, there's a big catch: The Legislature has cut the 
panel's funds effective January. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, where others see a road to oblivion, Davis sees a golden opportunity to 
become "Al Gore West," comparing himself to the activist Democratic vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a friendly Democratic women's club last month at a Fresno bowling 
alley, Davis talked about his willingness to roll up his sleeves to court 
business, citing his successful role in keeping Taco Bell from relocating its 
headquarters from Irvine to Texas and moving 1,000 jobs out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to make it my life's work to be an advocate for jobs in 
California," Davis told his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades after he first ran for statewide office, Davis, 51, is now a 
battle-scarred campaigner who is beginning to ease into the part of party elder 
statesman. His neatly coiffed brown hair is turning white, and though he was 
once known for his hot temper, an outwardly mellower Davis even mocks himself 
as "a boring white guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Joseph Graham Davis III, Davis moved to California at age 11. After 
graduating from Stanford University where he was a varsity golfer, Davis got a 
law degree from Columbia University. He served two years with the Army in 
Vietnam, leaving with the rank of captain and a Bronze Star. He is married to a 
flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis later worked for then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, lost a treasurer's 
race to Jesse M. Unruh and served for six years as former Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr.'s highly visible chief of staff. Elected to the Assembly in 
1982 from a silk-stocking West Los Angeles district that provided a good base 
for his aggressive fund-raising, Davis was well positioned four years later to 
step up to controller. 
</P>
<P>
 As the state's chief financial officer, Davis pays the state's bills and 
conducts audits of government expenditures. As a fiscal watchdog, Davis this 
year publicized a $2.7-billion accounting error that threatened to undermine 
the governor's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But his career has been dogged by controversy, which the Wright campaign seeks 
to exploit in a pamphlet distributed to reporters entitled "Gray's Anatomy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright cites how the attorney general's office determined that aides in Davis' 
Assembly office had improperly helped raise money for his first controller 
campaign in 1986. The dispute was settled when Davis agreed to reimburse the 
state $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's campaign also brands as "old-fashioned cronyism" Davis' naming of 
friends, relatives of campaign contributors and politicians to lucrative posts 
as probate referees. After publicity last year about the appointments, Davis 
took steps to root out so-called phantom referees and ensure that the officials 
fulfill their duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Navigating the Los Angeles freeways one recent morning, Wright said her goal 
is to block Davis from getting into office on a cakewalk. Wright lashed out at 
her rival as "always doing something strictly for his own glorification" and 
contending that his agenda "is not to be lieutenant governor but to be 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 65, a native of Old Forge, Pa., gleefully tells audiences that she did 
not leave home until she was 32. A former Democrat and onetime insurance 
underwriter, she ran for the Simi Valley City Council three times before 
winning on her fourth shot. Two years later in 1980, she won an Assembly seat. 
During her first reelection campaign, her husband died. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago she stepped up to the Senate and in June easily won the right to 
be the GOP standard-bearer for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who touts her legislation on behalf of mental health programs, is 
known as a predictable conservative vote in the Legislature. But whereas Davis 
has honed an image as a pragmatic insider familiar with the nitty-gritty of 
politics, Wright is regarded by her colleagues as something of an outsider even 
within the Legislature's Republican minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Until she jumped into the lieutenant governor's race, Wright was best known 
for interceding with authorities when her daughter ran up a string of 27 
traffic tickets. Wright vigorously denied any wrongdoing, but an investigation 
by the Ventura County district attorney's office determined that as an Assembly 
member she tried to fix her 24-year-old daughter's tickets on several occasions 
and solicited help on the matter from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 In her view, the Statehouse would operate more smoothly if the governor and 
lieutenant governor were of the same party. Left unsaid was the view that 
Wilson, should he win reelection, would be more likely to run for President or 
vice president if he could turn the keys to his Statehouse office over to 
Republican Wright instead of Democrat Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot are American Independent Party hopeful Robert W. Lewis, a 
director of the Rowland Water District of Rowland Heights; Libertarian Bob New, 
73, a Glendale businessman; Peace and Freedom's J. Luis Gomez, a Los Angeles 
accountant and educator, and the Green Party's Daniel Moses, a Half Moon Bay 
editor.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR; WILSON, BROWN FACE OFF TONIGHT IN TV DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democrat Kathleen Brown meet for one hour on 
statewide television tonight in an appearance that could be pivotal to Brown's 
prospects for unseating Wilson from California's governorship Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate, in which the candidates will field questions from a panel of three 
political reporters, will originate in Sacramento and be aired live statewide 
over public television stations from 6:30 until 7:30 p.m. The network includes 
station KCET, Channel 28, in Los Angeles. KCBS-TV, Channel 2, in Los Angeles, 
also will carry the encounter live. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions are expected to focus on a handful of issues the candidates have 
discussed at a distance throughout the campaign: crime, the death penalty, 
illegal immigration, education, Wilson's fiscal management, and jobs and the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts said Brown needs a breakthrough of some sort -- or a major 
mistake by Wilson -- to boost her campaign. A Los Angeles Times poll released 
this week found Wilson leading Brown 54% to 41% among those likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 This is likely to be the only face-to-face encounter during the five months of 
the general election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 While the importance of debates as turning points is often overstated, UC 
Berkeley political science professor Bruce Cain said the meeting "represents an 
important moment when people get to actually discuss whether there really are 
important differences. And we can really see how the two of them stand up 
against each other." 
</P>
<P>
 University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said the impact could 
be particularly influential on undecided voters "because for the first time 
they get to measure the candidates next to one another." 
</P>
<P>
 "Having said that," Sabato added, "most of the research in the field suggests 
that debates move very few voters. They tend to reconfirm people in their 
leanings, candidates or party." 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, only 4% of those likely to vote describe themselves as 
undecided. And those who had picked a candidate to support indicated 
overwhelmingly that it was not likely that they would change their minds 
between now and Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Cain, affiliated with the Institute of Governmental Studies at Berkeley, said 
the ideal situation for Brown was for her to "be brilliant" and for Wilson to 
flub. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown handled herself well during her primary election debates, most experts 
agreed. But universally, they also described Wilson as a seasoned -- if not 
spectacular -- debater who is not prone to making mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cain said Brown might rekindle her campaign if she can show "some substance, 
some bite, some spunk." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Wilson primarily has hammered Brown via 30-second spots on television, 
he added. But tonight, he will have several minutes to respond to questions and 
then respond to Brown's rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may refocus things back onto Pete Wilson as governor, as opposed to the 
weaknesses of Kathleen Brown," Cain said. "On the other hand, Kathleen Brown 
has to show that she has something to say that is an alternative to Pete Wilson 
as governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates spent time preparing for the debate this week, and spokesmen 
for each campaign started debate spin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aide Dan Schnur said, "This is a tremendous opportunity for Pete Wilson 
to very clearly delineate the differences between himself and Kathleen Brown on 
issues that matter to the people of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown spokesman Steve Glazer said, "Our goal is to contrast Kathleen Brown's 
written economic plan to rebuild California with Wilson's failed record of 
deteriorating schools, the fiscal mess in the Statehouse and economic 
stagnation." 
</P>
<P>
 However, debate rules presumably would prevent Brown from bringing her 62-page 
economic plan booklet -- which her campaign is distributing throughout the 
state -- into the debate studio at public television station KVIE just north of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters on the panel will be Ken Chavez of the Sacramento Bee, James Boren 
of the Fresno Bee and Mark Coogan of television station KABC in Los Angeles. 
The moderator will be Margaret Larson, a Seattle broadcast personality formerly 
of KVIE and KCRA in Sacramento and the NBC television network.

HEAVY RAIN, FLOODING PLAGUE SOUTHEASTERN CITIES; WEATHER: DELUGE TURNS STREETS 
INTO LAKES IN SAVANNAH, GA. AND CHARLESTON, S.C. SOME FLEE THEIR HOMES AS 
SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES CLOSE.

<P>
 Flooding from at least 14 inches of rain in two days closed streets and 
schools Thursday and forced the evacuation of about 200 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In downtown Savannah, children played in streets where floodwaters began to 
recede after rising to five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Children rode their bicycles into the water, and a group of about eight played 
on a fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having fun for once," said 12-year-old Kelly Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults had a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in two months that the coastal city has been flooded, 
and some residents blamed clogged storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel robbed," Danny Hendrix said as he and his wife moved their nine 
children out of their home. "Nothing has been done by the city after the first 
two times. . . . It's gone beyond anger." 
</P>
<P>
 The deluge, which had ended by late Thursday morning, closed scores of streets 
and roads in area counties. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 homes were evacuated and 216 patients had to be moved from Georgia 
Regional Hospital. Four area shelters held about 340 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Zell Miller flew over the area Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, Ginny Millner, wife of Republican gubernatorial candidate 
Guy Millner, and two campaign workers were rescued when their truck made a 
wrong turn and became trapped in five feet of water in Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
 They escaped unharmed through the sunroof and were picked up by a rescue crew 
in a 14-foot rubber raft. 
</P>
<P>
 So many streets were flooded in Savannah that police ran out of barricades to 
block them off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen nothing like this in my life," said Viveca Walker, 39, who 
went to a shelter with her parents and daughter after the National Guard 
rescued them from their flooded home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have no clothes or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy rain also wreaked havoc on Charleston, S.C., where streets and homes 
were flooded and schools and businesses were forced to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of students in coastal school districts were dismissed early because 
of street flooding from the storm, which dumped 4.07 inches of rain on downtown 
Charleston from midnight to noon. By afternoon, the sun was out along parts of 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 As low-lying streets became lakes, officials opened four emergency shelters in 
Charleston County. In Jasper County, about 50 homes near Hardeeville were 
damaged by flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homes on Hilton Head Island were temporarily without power and scattered 
homes on the island were flooded. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, D.C., meanwhile, President Clinton on Thursday ordered the 
federal government to pay 90% of the cost of repairing public property damaged 
by flooding in Georgia last summer. Generally, the federal government covers 
only 75% of such costs when it declares a disaster, with the state and local 
communities making up the rest.

SCIENTISTS FIND EVIDENCE OF 2 NEW DINOSAURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bones from two previously unknown species of dinosaurs -- a fleet-footed 
hunter and a long-necked grazer -- have been found in Africa. They lived 130 
million years ago in a lush, tropical paradise that is now the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hunter dinosaur, about 27 feet long, was named Afrovenator abakensis, 
or "African hunter from In Abaka," referring to the area of Niger where the 
bones were found. 
</P>
<P>
 The second discovery was a 60-foot-long plant-eater that is still unnamed. It 
was a sauropod -- akin to the brontosaurus -- with a long neck and tail and a 
massive body. It was so big that its thigh bone was six feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul C. Sereno, leader of a University of Chicago team, said the dinosaur 
species were the first found in Africa that date from the Cretaceous, the 
second half of the age of dinosaurs. The newly found species are similar to 
animals that lived during an earlier time in North America and Asia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these types of dinosaurs went extinct in the north, but they survived 
in Africa" much longer, Sereno said. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by Sereno and his colleagues on studies of the newly discovered 
dinosaurs is to be published today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
 Sereno said afrovenator was smaller than tyrannosaurus Rex, the killer king 
that lived during a later era in the American West, but was bigger than the 
velociraptor. 
</P>
<P>
 The much smaller afrovenator was apparently such a fearsome hunter that it 
preyed on the far bigger sauropod. 
</P>
<P>
 "At every place we found the sauropod we did find traces, such as teeth, of 
the theropod," said Sereno. "It is very likely that they were prey and 
predator." 
</P>
<P>
 But it apparently was not an easy task for the afrovenator. The size 
difference would be comparable to a collie attacking an elephant.

CULTURE; IN INDIA AD WORLD, HITLER CAN MEAN FUN; WHAT'S BAD TASTE IN THE WEST 
HAS BEEN DEEMED A WAY TO SELL FAST FOOD IN COUNTRY'S UNIQUE AND LIVELY STYLE OF 
SELLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's the problem: You've got a fast-food item that you're hoping will be the 
next Big Mac. To promote it, you want splashy advertising that will make people 
take notice. You're looking for endorsements by the biggest names possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not Adolf Hitler? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the approach hit upon by Option Trikaya Grey in a media campaign that 
the Bombay-based agency took three months to formulate for Dosa King Snack 'n' 
Rolls, a machine-made version of a south Indian delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yo! Dosa King," a snarling cartoon Fuhrer exclaims in colorful ads prepared 
for Indian magazines and slick newspaper supplements, in which he shares space 
with Abraham Lincoln, Count Dracula and other famous figures gripping rolled 
dosas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, this product is being positioned as a fun product," said account 
supervisor Nitin Tandon of Option Trikaya Grey. "These are people you wouldn't 
normally imagine having a dosa. They add funk to the product." 
</P>
<P>
 Questionable taste is more like it, a Western consumer might say. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Dosa King campaign shows, the enormous Indian market has its own 
rules when it comes to advertising. And though the opening up of the country to 
foreign multinationals may alter some practices, the basic game should stay the 
same, advertising pros predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian marketing campaigns are loaded with hyperbole, with a typical example 
being a homemaker who says she loves her husband because he is as reliable as 
her washing machine. There's also a humongous dose of induced envy and snob 
appeal -- one jocular ad by the bogus "Average TV Makers Union of India" urges 
consumers to destroy the obviously superior Onida 21-inch set. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, Indian advertisers lay a hand on the emotions of the Indian 
consumers," said Anita Nayyer, who runs accounts, including that of American 
Express, worth more than $8 million for Ogilvy & Mather Ltd. "Because Indian 
consumers are very emotionally led." 
</P>
<P>
 Western-induced change is apparent, especially in television spots. An ad for 
Kingfisher beer shows a handsome man giving a pretty woman a kiss on the cheek 
during a yachting regatta. That would be fine, if the couple were from Indiana. 
But in India, there is still a strong taboo against such public displays of 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
 In a spot now running for Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolate bars, a girl leaps 
from the stands after her boyfriend scores 100 runs in cricket, shoves aside 
the security guard and, with her skirt billowing above the knees, dances onto 
the field. "Indians just don't behave that way," one viewer commented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Advertising is changing, as it is definitely cued to the West," Nayyer said. 
"One has to change with the times. But definitely not so much as to believe 
that anything that works in the West will work here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the context of Indian advertising, she observed, there's nothing wrong with 
using an odious figure like Hitler to sell a product -- provided it works. 
"Advertising is like war and love," the New Delhi-based executive said. "I 
guess everything is fair." 
</P>
<P>
 With its campaign, Indian Foods Fermentation Ltd., Dosa King's creator, hopes 
to sign up franchisees throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the simple masterpieces of Indian cuisine, a dosa is akin to a taco or 
burrito, with a vegetable filling in a shell made of rice flour fried to a 
crispy gold. Dosa King is a take-out version, which a customer can get with any 
of four sauces. It will sell for five rupees, or 16 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much a snack for the masses," Tandon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The franchiser, who already has more than two dozen outlets in Bombay, sells 
the machinery used to make Dosa Kings, as well as the ingredients. The goal is 
a product that will taste the same in Calcutta or in Cuddalore. 
</P>
<P>
 The media campaign featuring Hitler and the other celebrity dosa eaters is 
still being fine-tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will need six months to get on a firmer footing," Tandon said. 
"After that, we'll be ready to market in a major way."

POLITICS; BERLUSCONI FINDS FEW ALLIES, MANY TROUBLES AS ITALY LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's easy to explain how Silvio Berlusconi went from being the tycoon who has 
everything to the man who seems to have nothing but trouble: He became prime 
minister of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, he presided in growing alarm over his Fininvest media-'n'-things 
empire that employs about 40,000 people and has annual receipts of about $7 
billion. As he watched, corrupt political parties that ran Italy for nearly 
half a century toppled in disgrace, one after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most likely successor was the former Italian Communist Party, now social 
democratic but still millionaire-chary and red-faced against Berlusconi 
holdings that include the three main private television channels. 
</P>
<P>
 So he founded a political party named Forza Italia and based it on the system 
of fan clubs boosting his European-best AC Milan soccer team. He led it to 
resounding electoral victory in just three months. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been few government goals and a lot of beleaguered defense 
since Berlusconi, 58, took office in May. He grouses that he's working harder 
than ever for less than $1,000 a week -- and, worse, gets no respect. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, millions of Italians are to walk off their jobs in a nationwide 
strike to protest a government austerity budget that endangers hallowed social 
benefits, particularly pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's protest is just one twist in a skein of troubles entangling a 
self-made political rookie thoroughly buffeted by political enemies. And 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 One ambitious ally in Berlusconi's right-wing coalition is rebellious; the 
other is positioning himself as a potential successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberto Bossi, the loose-cannon populist leader of the Northern League, for 
one, demurs loudly against government initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Slick neo-fascist chief Gianfranco Fini, for another, is pressing to dissolve 
the party forged by fans of former dictator Benito Mussolini. Fini, 42, wants 
to replace the Italian Social Movement, his springboard to prominence, with the 
broader, less extreme, more electable National Alliance, a rightist movement he 
formed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini gets higher poll ratings than Berlusconi, who's fighting angrily with 
anti-corruption judges and with Parliament over ways to guard against 
conflicts-of-interest between his business empire and his government post. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi initially profited from judicial investigations documenting 
corruption between businesses and political parties in previous governments. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, he has joined critics who argue that the judges have become 
politically motivated and are abusing their authority in the ever-widening 
corruption inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 One particular issue is the use of preventive detention as a means of making 
suspects talk: Senior industrialists have routinely been imprisoned at a 
judge's pleasure without charge or recourse to bail, sometimes without even 
having been interrogated. The tactic has loosened many tongues. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, chief Milan Judge Francesco Saverio Borrelli hinted that Berlusconi 
himself might become a target in investigations of a pay TV station partially 
owned by Fininvest.  
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at a raucous Senate session Wednesday, Berlusconi said Borrelli, 
whom the government is formally accusing of malfeasance, is guilty of 
"political intimidation." Parliamentary opponents say the government is 
undermining magistrates' work, and the judges say they are doing their job, 
which has made them some of the most popular people in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi is richer and has greater power to influence public opinion than 
any American President. Now, after prolonged study, a panel has recommended a 
law that would separate him from Fininvest without forcing him to sell. The 
empire has been run by an aide since Berlusconi took office, but the prime 
minister has held strategy sessions with leading managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi promises quick legislation to establish an Italian version of a 
blind trust. But opponents say there is no assurance of independent monitoring. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Ominously for Berlusconi, one bill demanding the sale of his TV interests is 
being advanced by Bossi, his erstwhile coalition partner.

LOYALIST MILITIAS DECLARE N. IRISH CEASE-FIRE; ULSTER: THE MOVE BY MOSTLY 
PROTESTANT GROUPS COMES SIX WEEKS AFTER IRA PUT DOWN ARMS. LONDON AND DUBLIN 
WELCOME NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 British loyalists in Northern Ireland announced a cease-fire Thursday, 
heralding a possible end to the politically inspired violence that has racked 
the province for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, by largely Protestant paramilitary groups that want to keep British 
control in Northern Ireland, came six weeks after the outlawed Irish Republican 
Army announced its own cease-fire, which seemed to provide a serious platform 
for the peace process initiated by Britain and Ireland last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest cease-fire began at midnight Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major declared the announcement "unalloyed good 
news." Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said it marked "the dawn of a new 
era" and called on the British government to speed up the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration was made in Belfast late Thursday by the Combined Loyalist 
Military Command and read by Gusty Spence, a former leader of the outlawed 
Ulster Volunteer Force who served a sentence for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The permanence of our cease-fire will be completely dependent upon the 
continued cessation of all nationalist-republican violence," the statement 
said. "The sole responsibility for a return to war lies with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the genuine hope that this peace will be permanent, we take the 
opportunity to pay homage to all our fighters, commandos and volunteers who 
have paid the supreme sacrifice. They did not die in vain. The union is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement added: "In all sincerity, we offer to the loved ones of all 
innocent victims over the past 25 years abject and true remorse. No words of 
ours will compensate for the intolerable suffering they have undergone during 
the conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the cease-fire statement insisted that loyalists had "guarantees" of 
Northern Ireland's constitutional position in Britain, which the IRA and its 
political arm, Sinn Fein, have sought through violence to dislodge. 
</P>
<P>
 The British government has insisted that the fate of Northern Ireland be 
determined by a majority of the people in the province -- rather than in the 
entire island of Ireland, which is what Sinn Fein and others seek. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the largely Roman Catholic IRA, the unionist paramilitaries -- the Ulster 
Freedom Fighters and Ulster Volunteer Force -- made no mention Thursday of 
turning in weapons, ammunition or explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 The unionist militias are responsible for about one-third of the more than 
3,100 deaths attributed to sectarian violence in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 The unionists had been under increasing pressure by moderate Protestant 
politicians to match the IRA's cease-fire and also from many militants -- if 
only for the sake of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, British authorities permitted representatives of the unionist 
paramilitaries to visit paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland's Maze 
prison for terrorism offenses -- to seek their approval to embark on the 
declared cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 On his recent U.S. tour, Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political 
arm of the IRA, had noted that the IRA was observing a cease-fire while the 
unionist paramilitaries continued to shoot and bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 And Adams, in Canada on Thursday at the end of his tour, called on Major to 
"stop fumbling with this peace process" and to accelerate London's response. He 
said the British should "begin to demilitarize immediately" in Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Major, attending the annual Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth, said 
of the cease-fire: "It is extremely good news. A few months ago very few people 
would have imagined we would have been talking in a situation in which there is 
an IRA cease-fire and a loyalist paramilitary cease-fire with a genuine hope we 
may be able to move forward."

FEARS ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF ARISTIDE TROUBLE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS and ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recurring nightmare haunts Clinton Administration officials laboring to make 
Haiti a functioning democracy -- that exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
will return to the Caribbean nation Saturday and be cut down by an assassin's 
bullet, plunging the country into a bloody civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we have to do is to get Aristide back and keep him alive," a 
senior official said. "That's the test of this weekend, whether Aristide gets 
back and things stay under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's principal American adviser agrees. "I'm fearful of the situation in 
Haiti," former Maryland Rep. Michael D. Barnes said. "There are a large number 
of heavily armed men who are opposed to the restoration of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide has already survived several assassination attempts, two of them in 
the first eight months of his presidency, before he was thrown out by a 
military coup. If his opponents succeed in killing him now, one official said, 
"the reaction in the streets could be an explosion of terrible violence." 
</P>
<P>
 One senior official said the Administration is particularly worried about the 
first days after Aristide's return, in part because the Haitian leader does not 
have a government in place yet. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the United States is mounting an extraordinary effort to keep 
Haiti's president safe in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aristide arrives in Port-au-Prince on Saturday, a U.S. Army helicopter 
will whisk him from the airport to his re-inauguration ceremony. U.S. military 
forces will ring the Presidential Palace where the president lives and works. 
</P>
<P>
 "No parade," a U.S. official said, saying it would be too dangerous to expose 
Aristide to crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies have launched a crash program to 
detect possible plots against Aristide. One official said that several sabotage 
attempts by remnants of the military regime already have been foiled. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, the State Department signed a million-dollar contract with a 
private Virginia security firm, MVM Inc., to provide a personal bodyguard 
detail for Aristide until his Haitian security team can complete its training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people are already in country," said Karen Marquez, co-owner of the firm. 
"They will be in President Aristide's security detail, along with his Haitian 
detail, until the State Department decides that the Haitians are ready to take 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contract, the United States will pay the salaries and expenses of 21 
security experts, including former Secret Service and State Department 
bodyguards, for three to nine months. The total cost, depending on the amount 
of time the bodyguards remain in Haiti, could approach $2 million, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took this route because we wanted to get the U.S. government out of the 
business of protecting Aristide as soon as possible," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his three years in exile in Washington, Aristide has been protected by the 
Secret Service 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's daily briefings by American officials have included several long 
meetings to negotiate the details of his security arrangements, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 And during his last week in exile, amid frenzied preparations for his return 
to Haiti, Aristide took time out to thank the Americans who helped move the 
Administration toward the assertive policy that finally pushed the military 
regime out of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide plans to return to Port-au-Prince in a caravan of at least two 
passenger jets, carrying not only his aides but members of the U.S. Congress, 
other supporters and anchors from four major American television networks. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will go as head of the official U.S. 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The tangible prospect of death for anyone seeking democracy in Haiti was the 
theme of one of Aristide's farewell appearances here Wednesday, a memorial for 
Guy Malary, his justice minister who was assassinated last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, sponsored by the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center, also 
revealed how close Aristide has become with members of the Kennedy clan who 
took him under their wing in a Washington that was sometimes hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Aristide said he has come to address Ethel Kennedy, Robert F. 
Kennedy's widow, as "Mom," and referred to her daughter Kerry Kennedy Cuomo as 
"our dear Kerry." 
</P>
<P>
 In a poignant, spiritual gesture, Aristide spoke for several minutes directly 
to Malary: "On Saturday, I will be in Haiti, but we will not be alone. We will 
be with you," he said, gazing straight ahead. "We will build a state of law 
with you. We will build a new Haiti with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide also attended a gala reception at the Organization of American States 
headquarters celebrating his restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's time during his last few days in America has been spent on 
substantive matters, Barnes said. "He's in constant, round-the-clock meetings 
on the logistics of his return and the plans for his new government," Barnes 
said.

SWISS POLICE IDENTIFY CULT LEADER'S BODY; CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
 Swiss police confirmed Thursday that cult leader Luc Jouret was among the dead 
found in the Order of the Solar Temple's fire-gutted chalet in the alpine 
village of Granges-sur-Salvan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret apparently perished along with 52 of his followers in last week's 
grisly round of blazes, slayings, bludgeonings and unexplained deaths among 
members of the apocalyptic order based in Switzerland and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss authorities did not say how Jouret, 46, a Belgian doctor, had died. 
Chief pathologist Thomas Krompecher said his body bore no trace of bullet 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one top temple official, Jean-Pierre Vinet, remains unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 Early theories of a mass suicide have given way, under revelations from Quebec 
and Swiss police, to evidence of well-orchestrated execution-style slayings on 
both sides of the Atlantic on Oct. 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 bodies still have to be identified as they are burned beyond 
recognition. Jouret was identified by his dental records. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the victims were alive, possibly comatose, at the time of the 
electronically triggered fires. Others had been shot, some repeatedly, or 
beaten to death, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the known leaders of the decade-old Order of the Solar Temple, only 
Vinet, often described as the cult's financier, remains at large or as yet 
unidentified. The body of Joseph di Mambro, described as the behind-the-scenes 
"dictator" of the order, has been identified among the dead in Switzerland, 
along with his wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Australia have joined those in Europe and North America looking 
into reports of money-laundering and arms trafficking. A Swiss newspaper, 
L'Hebdo, on Thursday quoted Australian banking sources describing a Jouret 
associate opening an account last year with a $93-million deposit.

DETAINEES IN HAITI A FOCUS OF CONCERN; OCCUPATION: THE U.S. REFUSES TO RELEASE 
THE NAMES OR CRIMES OF THOSE HELD. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF 
THEIR CONFINEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scores of Haitians have been arrested by American troops since the occupation 
of Haiti last month, and questions are being raised about the legal grounds on 
which the detainees continue to be held. 
</P>
<P>
 With no functioning government in place yet, no charges have been filed 
against the people arrested. The U.S. government refuses to release the 
detainees' names or other details about who they are and of what they stand 
accused. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, 64 people were being held in a complex of warehouses on the 
outskirts of Port-au-Prince, said U.S. Army Col. Barry Willey, spokesman for 
the military mission here. The number has fluctuated considerably, however, as 
some people are released and additional suspects are detained. The American 
military has not provided a total number of arrests and releases. Some human 
rights groups have expressed concerns about whether the rights of the detainees 
are being respected and whether the arrests would stand up in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are skating on thin ice legally," acknowledged a senior U.S. official. The 
official said the United Nations' resolution that authorized the use of all 
means necessary to restore democratic rule to Haiti is considered justification 
for the detentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the questionable practices do little to further the cause of 
establishing a rule of law in Haiti and will end up alienating the falsely 
accused. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one U.S. citizen is among the people in custody, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the people arrested have been clearly identified as backers of the 
outgoing military regime. But in some instances, arrests have been made based 
almost exclusively on denunciations by neighbors or townspeople and with little 
corroborating evidence, according to sources familiar with the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rural port of Fort Liberte, for example, the wealthiest man in town, 
Nyll Calixte, was arrested along with his French-born wife by U.S. Special 
Forces within hours of their occupation on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Calixte, a former Haitian ambassador and head of a law school, was fingered by 
townspeople as the principal local representative of the military regime's 
armed civilian force. With the townspeople cheering, he was handcuffed, loaded 
in the back of a U.S. Army truck and held for hours in a dirt-floor prison 
until being transported to Port-au-Prince for interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 One day later, Calixte was released with an apology. The U.S. military came up 
with a form letter for this and similar occasions; it says the bearer of the 
letter was arrested by mistake and "is innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Willey said arrests are based on "multiple intelligence" and that the American 
military is respecting Haitian, U.S. and international law. He said each person 
arrested is questioned in the presence of U.S. military lawyers and that the 
chief lawyer, or judge advocate, determines whether the person should be 
released or continue in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Military lawyers are present," he said. "All sides are heard. They (the 
military lawyers) are doing their thing in there to see that everyone gets a 
fair shake." 
</P>
<P>
 Families and private lawyers have been given access to the detainees only in 
recent days, according to human rights officials. Some of the families are 
still not certain of the reasons their relative is in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 After considerable delay, the International Committee of the Red Cross was 
given access this week to inspect the detention facilities, a spokeswoman for 
the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willey said all detainees will be turned over to the government of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, which will resume office with the exiled president's 
return to Haiti on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials refuse to identify the detainees, another source gave 
the name of one man, Anthony Saieh, described as a prosperous farmer from a 
well-established entrepreneurial family. His 75-year-old mother, Jeanne Marie, 
said her son was arrested Saturday after being reported for possessing guns. 
She said he has licenses for the guns he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot say if this is injustice or not," she said. "We do not know what 
happened. We are not in politics. We do not interfere in the affairs of 
anybody. A family like ours cannot be involved in anything like this. So this 
is the way things are going in Haiti."

U.S. TRIES TO KEEP KIDNAPING FROM DERAILING PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a long day of meetings with top 
leaders of Israel and Syria, tried Thursday to prevent the kidnaping of an 
Israeli soldier from demolishing the fragile Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 In late-night comments to reporters after meetings in Damascus with Syrian 
President Hafez Assad and in Tel Aviv with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin, Christopher said the talks are "probably the most substantive and 
serious discussions I've had with both of them since the process began." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the militant Islamic group Hamas threatened to roll back more than a 
year of progress toward Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip by seizing and threatening to kill Nachshon Waxman, a 19-year-old Israeli 
soldier. The capture of Waxman, who holds both Israeli and U.S. citizenship, 
dominated Christopher's meeting with Rabin, forcing them to truncate other 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin broke off talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization over 
Palestinian self-rule after the kidnaping. But he said Israel will continue its 
negotiations with Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to reporters after the meeting, Christopher endorsed Israel's claim 
that the PLO and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, "bear a heavy responsibility" for 
obtaining Waxman's release, even though he is being held by Hamas, a rival for 
the allegiance of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Christopher 
also noted that only Rabin can decide if the crime will be allowed to wreck the 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher accused Hamas of waging "a desperate rear guard action" to stop 
Palestinian self-government, which would bolster the PLO's claim to represent 
the Palestinian population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamas is recognizing the progress that's being made, recognizing the 
transformation of the landscape, and is taking these actions out of 
desperation," he said. "Hamas will not be permitted . . . to kill the prospects 
for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 But when a reporter asked if Hamas had not already succeeded in disrupting the 
peace, Christopher replied: "That will really be up to the (Israeli) prime 
minister." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Rabin can resume the peace talks at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in Damascus, Christopher said he urged Assad to use his influence to 
obtain Waxman's release. He said terrorism should accelerate, rather than slow, 
the peace process because "only the enemies of peace benefit from delay." 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping overshadowed a week of shuttle diplomacy by Christopher focusing 
on Israel-Syria negotiations. He was uncharacteristically optimistic after a 
stop in Damascus on Tuesday. But he seemed more reserved after visiting both 
countries Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States, 
told Israeli reporters before Thursday's Christopher-Rabin meeting that "there 
is a new creative Syrian thinking that is designed to advance the 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin was far more restrained, saying Syria has made some new proposals but 
most failed to touch on the dispute's core issues. "There are things which may 
sound more accommodating, but the gaps remain large and it would take a great 
amount of time and effort on the part of the secretary of state to have those 
gaps bridged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the most promising track of the complex peace process, Rabin said he hopes 
to be able to sign a formal peace treaty with Jordan this year. Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres made an unannounced trip to Amman on Wednesday to 
meet King Hussein and other Jordanian officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli news reports said the treaty will be signed in mid-November in the 
United States.

RUSSIANS SUSPECT PLOT AFTER RUBLE'S GYRATIONS; MONEY: THE CURRENCY SURGES AFTER 
ITS RECENT TAILSPIN. BUT STORE PRICES DON'T COME BACK DOWN. 
</P>

 Natalia Berseneva, a Moscow street sweeper, got paid Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent three-quarters of her monthly salary on two bags of groceries for 
her children. 
</P>
<P>
 As she lugged the sacks home at dusk in a cold drizzle, a defeated slump to 
her shoulders, Berseneva said that she reckoned that Russia's "high people" had 
probably made money this week as the ruble yo-yoed against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was more worried about how to survive another month of even higher 
prices with just $7 left in the pocket of her tattered raincoat. 
</P>
<P>
 Better-off Russians watched with similar bewilderment as the value of their 
rubles shot up a record 24.8% Thursday -- and prices on imported goods did not 
budge downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeepers had marked up their wares Tuesday when the ruble nose-dived from 
3,081 to 3,926 to the dollar, sparking a panic. Prices did not move on 
Wednesday, though the ruble stabilized at 3,736 after President Boris N. 
Yeltsin sacked his finance minister, called for an investigation and promised 
to save his countrymen from hard-currency penury. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Russian Central Bank obediently poured between $140 million 
and $155 million into the currency market, pushing the ruble back up to 2,994 
to the dollar. But jittery merchants still kept prices at up to 50% higher than 
what they were last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial whiplash created new resentment about who had profited from the 
turmoil in the second superpower's currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever fertile ground for conspiracy theories, Moscow roiled with rumors 
Thursday about who might have masterminded the ruble roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief suspect was Central Bank Chairman Viktor V. Gerashchenko, who 
announced Thursday that he will not resign, although Parliament plans to vote 
next Friday on whether to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Andrei Illarionov, director of the Institute of Economic Analysis, 
accused Gerashchenko of deliberately triggering this week's panic, as well as 
the similar currency crises of January, 1991, and July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The events that occurred on Oct. 11 were organized entirely by the Central 
Bank of Russia," Illarionov charged in a news conference. Foreign Minister 
Andrei V. Kozyrev also called for Gerashchenko's head. Others suggested a cabal 
of powerful banks, importers or oil companies could have paid off government 
officials to let the ruble slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was all a big game," said Volodya, 32, one of Russia's new bankers. "I 
don't know if the Central Bank was directly involved in it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Volodya, who did not give his last name, calculated that anyone with $300 
million worth of rubles to invest and advance knowledge of the Central Bank's 
intentions could have earned $90 million profit in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much would you offer as a bribe if you knew you would be $90 million 
richer tomorrow?" Volodya asked. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he said, "it may have all been caused by Russian stupidity 
and carelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 Dark conjectures were heard at the highest levels. Yeltsin's press secretary, 
Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, called the panic "an attempted financial coup" against 
the president. He suggested that the perpetrators could be former Communist 
Party officials, who are believed to control millions of dollars of party money 
that vanished along with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot exclude the possibility that a secret Communist Party weapon worked 
-- money stolen from the country and the people," Kostikov told the Interfax 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the man accused of causing Russia's first major securities crash 
was released from prison on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Mavrody, head of the MMM investment company, had been jailed on tax 
evasion charges after the spectacular collapse of MMM share prices in July. He 
stepped out of the Sailor's Rest prison and into a blue Volvo, which whisked 
him away without his having said how he had won his release.

NEWS ANALYSIS; U.S. BACK TO SQUARE ONE IN THE GULF; MIDEAST: DESPITE HUGE SHOW 
OF AMERICAN FORCE, HUSSEIN IS STILL IN POWER, AND THE AREA IS STILL VULNERABLE, 
EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In its second confrontation with Saddam Hussein, the United States may have 
lost a critical opportunity to accelerate the political demise of the Iraqi 
dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has used a massive show of force in the Persian 
Gulf in hopes of warding off any threatening Iraqi troop movements at the 
Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts said that the Administration's tepid diplomatic move -- a proposed 
new United Nations resolution restricting the movement of Iraq's elite 
Republican Guard -- leaves the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq pretty much 
where it was: with Hussein's power unchecked and the strategic, oil-rich Gulf 
still vulnerable to his whims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a short-term posture that is viable, but no longer-term strategy to 
deal with the danger of Saddam next time," said William Quandt, who was a 
Middle East strategist in the Jimmy Carter Administration and now is at the 
University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no policy to get us beyond the next year. So this doesn't look like a 
great success." 
</P>
<P>
 The political gains made during the decisive initial deployment of U.S. troops 
now could be diluted by lack of definitive follow-through as the United States 
appears to bow to its allies' individual priorities, notably potential profits 
to be made in deals negotiated with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration has created a situation where U.S. foreign policy is 
reduced to the lowest common denominator among the (U.N.) Security Council," 
said Laurie Mylroie, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 And the President's image is suffering. A poll taken for NBC-TV's "Dateline" 
and reported on that program Wednesday night showed that 51% of Americans think 
Hussein will remain in office longer than Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have advocated a variety of political and military alternatives as 
responses to Iraq's massing of troops near Kuwait's border, but virtually all 
expressed concern Thursday that the Clinton Administration's reaction falls far 
short of even minimal punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many compared it to the George Bush Administration's decision to back away 
from any role in the simultaneous 1991 uprisings by northern Kurds and southern 
Shiite Muslims immediately after the war, a policy subsequently criticized by a 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee report as a missed opportunity to weaken and 
potentially topple Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fundamentally, current U.S. strategy makes the long-sought end game ever 
more illusive. The U.S.-led coalition would effectively be conceding that it is 
prepared to deal only with the immediate issue of Kuwait's borders rather than 
the core problem of Hussein's rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an Administration proposal Thursday to indefinitely deploy thousands more 
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf is a reaction to the current crisis and not a 
strategy for dealing with Hussein's rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The repercussions of the U.S.-orchestrated response also play out at other 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * First, and most ominously, because the U.S. response has had negligible 
impact on his army, Hussein could move south and threaten Kuwait or Saudi 
borders again -- potentially even with the elite Republican Guard units, who 
supposedly are to be banned from border areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does limiting the Republican Guards do? All Hussein has to do is put 
them in regular army uniforms or rename the units," Mylroie said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Saddam will see this as a victory. We sent tens of thousands of troops and 
hundreds of warplanes halfway around the world at a cost of hundreds of 
millions of dollars, and then did almost nothing. He (Hussein) hasn't paid a 
price, and he may think he's gained by drawing attention to the suffering in 
Iraq from sanctions," Mylroie added. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second, the limited coalition response will not encourage the Iraqi 
opposition. Indeed, it may even discourage anti-Hussein activity in critical 
power centers such as the Iraqi military, the only body deemed capable of 
overthrowing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impression in Baghdad is that the United States wants Saddam there, 
because we didn't support the 1991 rebellions. They believe that if we wanted 
him out, he'd be out," said Phebe Marr of Washington's National Defense 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third, the U.S.-led coalition of European and Arab countries comes away 
weakened, with the potential for further splintering. The United States is now 
widely seen as having succumbed to pressure by European allies, notably France 
and Russia, not to take stronger action, including a possible exclusion or 
demilitarized zone in southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Paris and Moscow have been negotiating billion-dollar deals with Baghdad, 
to go into effect when sanctions are lifted. Both have also endorsed expediting 
the process required to lift sanctions.

U.S. TROOP STRENGTH IS QUESTIONED; MILITARY: CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT CAN 
HANDLE TWO CRISES AT ONCE. OTHERS WONDER IF THERE ARE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DO 
SO.

 More urgently than ever before, the new American troop commitments in the 
Persian Gulf raise the question of whether U.S. military forces are stretched 
too thin around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 What if, for example, North Korea's insecure political heir, Kim Jong Il, 
decides to prove his mettle by launching an attack this week on South Korean 
and American forces? With 63,500 American troops committed to the Persian Gulf 
and 19,000 in Haiti, would the United States be able to handle another major 
crisis? 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, of course, the answer is "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have the capability to do so, and so I would not want North 
Korea for a moment to think otherwise, or for that matter anyone else," Gen. 
John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a news 
conference this week. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others noted that, despite recent defense cutbacks, the Clinton 
Administration has explicitly designed its defense strategy to enable the 
United States to fight two regional wars "almost simultaneously." Indeed, a 
review of defense policy by the Pentagon last year was carried out with two 
regional wars in mind: one in the Persian Gulf, the other on the Korean 
peninsula. (Haiti is considered too small to qualify as a major conflict.) 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch also said the U.S. military 
buildup in the Gulf shows that American forces could fight two major wars at 
nearly the same time despite severe defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure it's tight, you wouldn't want to have it any other way," Deutch told 
reporters. Nevertheless, experts said, it is becoming increasingly uncertain 
whether the Pentagon will have the resources to do what its strategy envisions. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, we would be breathing hard, real hard, if we had to keep building 
up in the Gulf and we faced a major contingency in Korea," said Arnold Kanter, 
a former senior State Department official in the George Bush Administration who 
is now with the Forum for International Policy. "We're buying no new tanks and 
very few fighter aircraft. Shipbuilding is way down. We're running out of 
things to cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some scholars worry about the cumulative impact of deployments in 
Haiti and the Persian Gulf on the United States' future war-fighting 
capability.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're picking up long-term commitments in various places," said Elliot Cohen, 
professor of strategic studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of 
Advanced International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "That causes a real strain. The basic rule of thumb is that, for every soldier 
deployed somewhere, you've got two others either going or coming back and 
another one or two who have to support the people deployed." 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts worry that the deployments in Haiti and the Persian Gulf weaken 
the Clinton Administration's hand in diplomacy elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have difficulty now in carrying out large-scale supply operations to 
Korea. It makes you more careful in dealing with (the North Koreans)," said 
William Clark Jr., former assistant secretary of state for East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Bush Administration publicly warned 
North Korea that it should not view the war as an opportunity to attack. And 
over the last three years, while the Bush and Clinton administrations have 
reduced American troop deployments in Europe rapidly, they have maintained the 
general levels of deployment in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The "bottom-up review" carried out in 1993 under former Secretary of Defense 
Les Aspin originally was designed to meet a strategy called "win-hold-win" -- 
that is, to win one major war, hold off the enemy in a second conflict and 
then, finally, to defeat the second enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the win-hold-win phrase scared South Korean officials, who feared that 
their nation could easily be the country labeled "hold" -- that is, asked to 
wait for days or weeks in a military stalemate while the United States fought 
another war.  
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, South Korean President Kim Young Sam dispatched his national 
security adviser to Washington to voice alarm about the Pentagon strategy. Soon 
afterward, the Administration dropped the win-hold-win phrase and said instead 
that the U.S. strategy would be to maintain a force large enough to fight two 
major regional wars "nearly" simultaneously -- roughly within 30 days of each 
other.  
</P>
<P>
 Although current force levels may be enough to handle two crises that fall 
short of war, Secretary of Defense William J. Perry acknowledged this year that 
the Pentagon's current budget and resources are not now sufficient for two 
active, full-scale military conflicts at the same time. In an interview with 
the Navy Times, Perry said the U.S. military will not be able to meet the goal 
of fighting two major regional wars at once for several more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bush Administration made all the easy cuts and some of the hard cuts" in 
the defense budget, Kanter said. "Then the Clinton Administration made hard 
cuts and now the really hard cuts. There's only so much you can get out of this 
turnip. . . . Today, I think we could exercise the (two-war) strategy. A year, 
three years from now, the gap between rhetoric and reality will grow." Drop in 
U.S. Forces

HOMICIDES AMONG YOUNG MEN SOAR; DRUG GANGS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The homicide rate among young men ages 15 to 19 more than doubled between 1985 
and 1991, and researchers attribute the rise to drug gangs' recruiting of 
younger members and increased use of guns instead of fists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to violence, in the past what may have led to fistfights now 
leads to gunfire," Dr. David Satcher, director of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The homicide rate for males 15 to 19 jumped from 13 per 100,000 in 1985 to 33 
per 100,000 in 1991, a 154% increase, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get guns out of the hands of these kids -- it's an epidemic," 
said Alfred Blumstein of the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management at 
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa. He contributed to the CDC study. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumstein said drug gangs are recruiting teen-agers because the youngsters 
have little sense of the risks and consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns claimed the lives of 88% of the 15- to 19-year-olds killed in 1991. From 
1985 to 1991, 97% of the increase was attributed to guns.

PROSECUTOR'S ILLNESS DELAYS SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jury selection in the O.J. Simpson case was unexpectedly halted Thursday 
because one of the lead prosecutors, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, was 
ill with stomach flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Lance A. Ito granted a request from Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark to 
postpone the selection process until today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also ordered prosecutors to turn over to the defense numerous 
investigative reports and other items, including socks taken from Simpson's 
home that are now undergoing scientific testing at a laboratory in Berkeley. As 
soon as that testing is done, Ito told Clark, the socks must be turned over to 
defense forensic experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro told Ito that he had been trying to 
get the items from the prosecution for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the potential jurors were excused for the day Thursday, Ito apologized 
to them for any inconvenience the postponement may have caused them. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 people had shown up for the second day of voir dire, or oral 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro had strongly objected to the postponement and at one point jokingly 
offered to send home Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., another of Simpson's attorneys, 
"to even the playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more serious note, Shapiro noted that the selection process was getting 
backed up, an observation with which Ito agreed. On Wednesday, the first day of 
voir dire, only four potential jurors were questioned instead of the 20 Ito had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the judge released a general profile of the first batch of 
potential jurors under consideration. Of the 94 people, whites and blacks were 
represented in nearly equal proportions -- 40.4% and 39.4% respectively -- 
trailed next by Latinos with 12%. Asian Americans and Native Americans were 
represented in equal proportions with 3%. Women outnumbered men 54 to 40.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; MAKING A STATEMENT BY NOT SAYING A WORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, KNBC's Tracie Savage is supposed to appear in court in answer to a 
subpoena aimed at forcing her to disclose the source of one of her O.J. Simpson 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember the story. It's been one of the big media controversies of the 
Simpson trial. Savage reported last month that DNA tests at a Maryland 
laboratory indicated that Nicole Brown Simpson's blood was on a pair of socks 
found in Simpson's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fact that some of Simpson's socks were seized as evidence. And 
sources told The Times that the socks had been tested. But the tests were of a 
kind less discriminatory than the DNA variety, although they still can provide 
information about the possible source of a blood sample. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito blasted the report as erroneous, and when KNBC ran the report again, he 
threatened to limit television coverage of the trial. Savage later went on the 
air to say her sources provided her with some inaccurate information. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mistake, however, isn't why Savage is in court. Savage was subpoenaed 
because Simpson's lawyers want her to disclose the source on her story. They 
say that the Los Angeles Police Department leaked it to hurt Simpson. They've 
also subpoenaed Cmdr. David Gascon, the police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Savage is caught up in a struggle bigger than her story -- a battle not 
over her accuracy, but about a reporter's right to keep sources confidential, a 
right guaranteed since 1980 by the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a long time to win this constitutional guarantee. I thought of the 
effort when I heard of Savage's subpoena, and of a colleague who was deeply 
involved in it, the late Bill Farr. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Farr, who died in 1987, was a Times reporter who served 46 days in jail for 
contempt of court in 1972 rather than disclose the name of a confidential 
source in the biggest trial of that era, the Manson family trial. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an old-fashioned newspaperman who prowled the city in a baggy sport 
coat and slacks, pockets stuffed with notebooks, notes and newspaper clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 On his rounds in 1970, while he was actually still a reporter for the Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner, Farr obtained a scoop. He got his hands on a 
prospective witness's account of alleged plans by the Manson family to murder 
such show business personalities as Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Charles H. Older had imposed a gag order on attorneys, witnesses and 
court personnel, and felt someone had violated it by giving Farr the story. He 
demanded to know the name of the leaker. Farr refused, and the judge cited him 
for contempt and threw him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember visiting him in the Los Angeles County Jail. Dressed in prison 
blue, he was not happy about his confinement, even though the guards had 
promised him a television set for that particular weekend's big football games. 
He had no idea when he would be released by a judge who had vowed to keep him 
imprisoned until he talked.  
</P>
<P>
 Farr told me he wouldn't back down. An appellate court decision eventually 
prompted his release from jail, and the Manson case faded into history. But 
Farr continued to protect his source, never revealing the name. Years later, I 
tried to get him to do it. I thought the information was important to a 
political race I was covering -- more important to the election than Farr 
keeping an old secret. Absolutely not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch in jail changed Bill Farr's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he did time, Farr was like most of the reporters of his day, doing his 
work in a detached way, an observer, not a participant. After his release from 
jail, he became a crusader, starting from the moment he stepped into the 
afternoon sun and was greeted by several dozen reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave countless speeches on behalf of reporters' rights, and particularly 
fought for a strengthening of something called the shield law, which was 
designed to protect news reporters from contempt of court citations if they 
reveal their sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters get information from all sorts of people. Some risk their lives to 
speak to the press. Others, such as corporate and government whistleblowers, 
risk their jobs. To get the information, reporters must be able to promise such 
people anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The shield law had been on the books since 1935 and Farr invoked it when he 
was cited for contempt by Judge Older for his Manson story. But the judge 
disagreed. An appellate court upheld the judge. The court ruled that the shield 
law was an unconstitutional interference by the legislative branch "upon an 
inherent and vital power of the court to control its own proceedings and 
officers." Both the state and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Farr's 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Farr became active in organizations such as the Reporters Committee for 
Freedom of the Press, the Society of Professional Journalists and Investigative 
Reporters and Editors. With his colleagues, he fought for a stronger shield 
law. In 1980, they succeeded with the passage of a ballot measure that made the 
shield law part of the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, no reporter, executive or other employee of a newspaper, magazine or 
other periodical publication, a press association or wire service or a radio or 
television station can be held in contempt for refusing to disclose the source 
of information for a story. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the stronger shield, when Tracie Savage appears in court -- even if 
her story contained mistakes -- she can tell the defense attorneys she will 
remain silent about her sources, thanks to Bill Farr and others who fought 
alongside him.

SYMBOL OF MISUNDERSTANDING; RELIGION: THE HWA YEN BUDDHIST COMMUNITY HAS BEEN 
VANDALIZED, LARGELY FOR ITS REVERSE-SWASTIKA EMBLEM, AND SOME OF ITS CUSTOMS 
HAVE LED TO FRICTION WITH NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Vietnamese Buddhist temple that was hit by vandalism early this year because 
of confusion over swastika-like symbols on its entrance gate -- emblems that 
signify goodness in that faith -- also had its mailbox blown apart by a bomb, 
it was learned this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Buddhist group covered with plywood six reverse-swastika emblems 
in its gate -- apparently mistaken for Nazi symbols -- the group says its 
problems have continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Epitomizing the cultural clashes that occur as the San Fernando Valley grows 
more diverse, some neighbors complained last week that the temple's 
saffron-colored gates are garish and a bell used in prayers is too loud.  
</P>
<P>
 The troubles began over the swastikas that decorated the gate to the Hwa Yen 
Buddhist Studies Assn. on De Soto Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The swastika is an ancient symbol of auspiciousness and good fortune in Hindu 
culture, in use for centuries before it became associated with Hitler's 
Germany. It has similar meanings for Far Eastern Buddhist groups, who use a 
version with arms drawn in the reverse direction of the one made infamous by 
the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals sawed off two of the six symbols in the wrought-iron gate sometime 
last spring and complaints that they resembled Nazi swastikas were made to the 
B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, apparently in May, an explosive device blew up the temple's roadside 
mailbox, the monks and neighbors say. The monks said Thursday they could no 
longer remember the date. Although they said they had reported it to 
law-enforcement authorities, they could not identify the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives at the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire station nearby 
had no record of a complaint this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a neighbor of the temple, who declined to be identified, said she 
remembers that the explosion occurred sometime before June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was someone's water heater that had blown up," she said. "Then 
the next morning, I saw pieces of the mailbox all over the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The temple's 87-year-old head monk, who left two temples in Vietnam as he 
evacuated Saigon with American troops in 1975, said through an interpreter that 
he has forgiven the unknown bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've forgotten already about the explosion," said the Venerable Sik Tai Fong 
in a brief interview before leaving on an extended visit to the Buddhist sect's 
New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not scared or mad. People don't understand Buddhists," said a female 
monk who is second in leadership, the Venerable Wai Fong Tran. The two monks' 
remarks were translated by a volunteer, realtor Mona Trouing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wai Fong Tran also said that one night last week, two women and a man in the 
neighborhood came by to complain that the large entrance gate and buildings 
painted bright yellow detract from the area's housing values and that a bell 
the monks ring occasionally is too loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor -- the one who heard the mailbox explode -- said she has no 
objections to the Buddhists' presence. "The bell was quite loud before, but I 
think they're toning it down now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard it as early as 6 a.m. and in the evening about 6:30 p.m.," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The monks said that the group moved into the property in October of last year 
and has applied for city permits to hold religious events. A garage containing 
four Buddha figures is being renovated to serve as a small temple, they said. 
Meanwhile, a handful of followers use rooms in the two-story house for 
meditation and study. 
</P>
<P>
 The language problem and their leaders' frequent absence has left the group 
lacking potential supporters, although in the spring, a Valley rabbi circulated 
a letter to synagogues explaining the Buddhist meaning of the swastika in an 
effort to defuse tension over the symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth-based San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council, which includes 
members of Eastern and Western religious groups, has not been contacted by the 
Vietnamese Buddhist group, said Executive Director Barry Smedberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has a call for help gone to the ethnically diverse Buddhist Sangha Council 
of Southern California, based in Los Angeles. The Venerable Havanpola 
Ratanasara, executive director of the council, said he hadn't heard of the 
Chatsworth group or its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial troubles at the Hwa Yen property stemmed from a sad irony, 
Ratanasara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The swastika symbol means a blessing, expecting something good to happen -- 
not the way the Nazis used it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither swastika form is used by Buddhists in his native Sri Lanka or other 
Theravadan Buddhist countries of south Asia, Ratanasara said. "It is used in 
Mahayana Buddhism in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because a reverse swastika is often mistaken for the Nazi version, 
Japanese-heritage Jodo Shinshu temples in this country "have purposely avoided 
the use of this emblem," said the Rev. Kakuyei Tada of the San Fernando Valley 
Hongwanji Buddhist Temple in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't mean that we simply ignore and refuse to get involved in this 
controversy," Tada said. "Buddhists are neither anti-Semites nor Nazis. We, as 
Buddhists, cannot tolerate the Holocaust carried out by the Nazis."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; STUDENTS PLAN WALKATHON TO FIGHT PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino students at Van Nuys High School are organizing a walkathon to raise 
funds to pay for cable television ads against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Students Defending Students," the march and advertisement project is 
the brainchild of the high school's MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
Aztlan) club, an organization for Latino and Chicano youth. 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA members are asking their fellow students to band together against 
Proposition 187 by getting people to sponsor them in the 10-K march slated for 
11 a.m. Oct. 23. If approved by voters in November, the measure would deny 
public education, heath care and other services to undocumented residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Latino youngsters are taping and editing commercials 
that feature students discussing how they feel about Proposition 187. Airing 
the commercials on cable television will be paid for with the money collected 
from the walkathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to realize that it's not just adults (who will be affected). It's 
starting with the kids and students," said Jose Alberto Cardenas, 17, a MECha 
member who is active in Ballet Folklorico, a Latino folk dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the commercials, he said, "This will make it more personal." 
</P>
<P>
 On Club Day last week at Van Nuys High School, where the student population is 
about 65% Latino, about 300 students representing all races signed up for the 
march and to join MEChA. All the while, Veronica Gonzalez, 16, taped student 
reactions to the proposition with a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica said that once she has compiled a series of interviews, she will edit 
them into advertisements in her television production class, part of the 
Performing Arts magnet program at Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA sponsor and teacher Charles Wilken said the commercials will be aired 
through a cable company that reaches the East Valley area.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our main message to students is to not be afraid of what you're all about," 
said MEChA President Dennise Perez, 16. "I think it's trying to isolate and 
classify them (illegal immigrants) like back in WWII. Then, it was Jews and 
non-Jews. Now, it's legal and illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he has met with MEChA representatives from other schools through a 
San Fernando Valley-wide group called the Youth Committee, and has gained 
support for the Oct. 23 walk from schools such as San Fernando and Polytechnic 
high schools and Pacoima Middle School. MAKI BECKER

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; POLL SHOWS HARDENING OF

<P>
 A nationwide survey released by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the 
Press involving a telephone poll of 3,800 adults -- 18 years of age or older -- 
revealed that white Americans' views toward black Americans have hardened so 
much that 51% of thewhites surveyed agree with a statement that equal rights 
have been pushed too far in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure represents the first time in the seven-year history of the 
center's polling that a majority of white Americans have held this opinion. In 
1992, 42% agreed that equal rights had gone too far, and in 1987 only 16% felt 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll conducted earlier this year by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa., 
for the Associated Press found that six out of 10 whites believe that blacks 
and other minorities now have the same opportunities as whites, but that seven 
out of 10 blacks disagree.

 "Is the gap between blacks and whites widening?" 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden: 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, no. The perception is that it might be, but in fact it is not, 
because there is a much more integrated community today . . . there is a better 
understanding and relationship between people. I don't see blacks going around 
with a lot of hatred. If they did, this country would not survive. I know 
because I was born in the South and now live in this community. I can see the 
difference and things are not getting worse between blacks and whites. They're 
getting better. Blacks and whites may be different in terms of ethnicity, but 
they have the same philosophy in terms of life." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden: 
</P>
<P>
 "The gap certainly has not narrowed. Los Angeles is deeply segregated. The old 
electoral coalition of Jews and African Americans is no longer decisive. A new 
coalition must be built along new lines. We must recognize the fault line that 
continues to fester between haves and have-nots. Investments are drying up in 
the inner city, bus service is deteriorating, schools are dying, and college 
has become more expensive. Reversing these trends is in the interest of the 
middle class as well as the poor. All the communities of Los Angeles will 
benefit from more decentralization of government functions. Community-based 
policing is a start. So is site management in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Verne Bryant, professor of Pan African Studies, Cal State Northridge: 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, yes. . . . The fall in incomes that Europeans (whites) are 
experiencing is being blamed on African Americans. That perception seems to 
mostly be among European Americans, especially men. They base their views on 
the fact that they are losing privileges to African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Browder, assistant vice president, civic and community affairs, USC: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. But it's based more on the state of the economy than simply based on 
race. The relationships between whites and blacks has become worse . . . these 
feelings seem apparent among the African American community, and their not 
having access to a quality life and being denied opportunities based on race." 
</P>
<P>
 David Hilliard, former chief of staff, Black Panther Party: 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the gap is widening. I believe that there are two separate 
societies: one white and one black. There has been no coming together. We are 
still separate and still unequal. Racism is a permanent structure in America . 
. . in our schools, jobs, housing . . . the youth of America is the only hope 
we have."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; PARKING LOT TO STAY CLOSED FOR HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public parking lot that community leaders say is crucial for local 
businesses during the holiday season will remain closed until mid-January, a 
consultant for a developer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Katz, housing consultant for Sherman Oaks Community Housing Corp., 
developer of a senior housing project over the parking lot at Dickens Street 
and Cedros Avenue, said the project is behind schedule because of delays in 
getting city funding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer had initially committed to completing the parking-garage portion 
of the project by Sept. 30. But Wednesday, Katz said that hasn't occurred, and 
predicted the garage -- the only public lot in Sherman Oaks -- will be 
completed by mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said it will then be up to the city to decide whether the public will be 
allowed to park in the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is funded largely by a grant from the federal Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. Initially, the developer had been required to 
close escrow on the loan by Sept. 30 or risk losing about $900,000 in 
supplemental funds needed to complete the project. According to the consultant, 
the department has agreed to give the developer a four-month extension of the 
escrow closure deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brain, co-chairman of the Sherman Oaks Town Council, accused the 
corporation of breaking its promise to finish the parking structure by Nov. 23. 
When the lot closed in July, the nearby La Reina Fashion Plaza agreed to allow 
the public to use its lot, but only until that date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I don't think they ever thought they could do it," he said. "We were 
just snowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brain contended the developer has done little to find replacement parking that 
would be available after Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz denied he had ever promised that the parking lot would be finished by 
Nov. 23. He said he has contacted three property owners to inquire about the 
possibility of their providing alternative parking, but that nothing definite 
has come out of those talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders said they are concerned that the delay will jeopardize the 
ability of nearby businesses to provide parking for their patrons during the 
critical holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That does present a problem because there is a problem with inadequate 
parking," said Barry Wegman, executive vice president of the Sherman Oaks 
Chamber of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know they made plans to put parking in the La Reina center and I would hope 
that Mr. Katz and his group would talk to the owner of the La Reina center so 
that parking can continue to be available during the holiday season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were afraid this would happen," said Richard Close, president of the 
Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. "It's going to hurt the local businesses and the 
people who live in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Close said he is counting on Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky to 
fulfill what Close said was a commitment to find parking for the holiday 
season.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY TO ADDRESS LA RINDA PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando officials have scheduled a hearing Monday on La Rinda Plaza, a 
shopping center that has been the focus of complaints from neighbors about 
cruising and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was built on a site that is partly in the city of Los Angeles, 
which in July imposed a series of conditions on the plaza to deter teen-age 
cruisers from using the shopping plaza parking lot as a meeting place.Plaza 
operators installed gates to block off entrances, improved lighting and gave 
police space to open a substation at the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plaza management appealed other conditions that would have forced 
stores to close before 9:30 p.m. and required removal of the public phones at 
the center. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals lifted 
these restrictions, allowing stores to stay open until 10 p.m., and the public 
telephones to stay.  
</P>
<P>
 The zoning board also ruled that plaza management did not have to hire armed 
guards to deter the cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando officials have pledged to work with Los Angeles and impose a 
similar set of conditions on the plaza. But the local officials had been 
waiting for the results of the Los Angeles zoning appeal before acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, San Fernando City Council members must decide what restrictions they will 
place on businesses in their portion of the plaza. Businesses in the San 
Fernando portion of the mall, including restaurants, a discount food store and 
a liquor store, are open later than those in the Los Angeles portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have said the cruising problem, in which hundreds of teen-agers 
gathered in the parking lot and surrounding area on Fridays, Saturdays and 
especially Sunday nights, has been largely eliminated since gates were 
installed to block off the parking lot at night. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; DWP OPPOSES DUAL FILTRATION PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to build a water-filtration plant that would serve both the Encino 
Reservoir and Stone Canyon Reservoir in Beverly Glen is inadvisable because of 
high costs and anticipated difficulties in acquiring a site, according to a 
report recently released by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft environmental study that investigated the best site for a filtration 
plant for Stone Canyon Reservoir recommends, instead, that a filtration plant 
serving only Stone Canyon be built next to the reservoir.The draft study was 
completed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is required by the state to filter water in its open-air reservoirs 
because the water is exposed to the elements and poses risks of waterborne 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino residents expressed differing views of how the report affects their 
struggle to find a location for an Encino Reservoir filtration plant. Some 
residents say it should be put as close to the reservoir as possible, while 
many people who live near the reservoir want it farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, said the study appears to 
support the desirability of on-site filtration plants. "It makes sense to 
filter the water right at the site," said Silver, who acknowledged that the 
study could be seen as a setback for lake neighbors who hope the city will 
build a filtration plant away from the Encino reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sharon Garapedian, president of the Encino Lake Homeowners Assn., said the 
study has little import for Encino's search for a filtration solution. She 
agrees with the study's rejection of the proposed site for the joint filtration 
plant, at the corner of Oxnard Street and Sepulveda Boulevard. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; NATURE WALK TO AID AGRICULTURE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College will hold a nature walk Oct. 29 on the campus to raise money 
for the school's agriculture program and to give the public an opportunity to 
tour the facility.  
</P>
<P>
 "Pierce College has such a unique asset in the farm that we believe we ought 
to share it with the community," said Pierce President Mary Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said she hopes the walk will be as successful as a similar walk held July 
4, which raised about $11,000, not counting expenses. "The people who came 
loved it," Lee said. "Many people who were out of town July 4 said, 'When are 
you going to do the next one?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The walks, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., will be casual affairs, said Pierce 
spokeswoman Ina Geller. They will take place along several pathways winding 
through fields and the nature center and a canyon in the southwest portion of 
the school property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walkers will get to see horses and sheep and pigs and cattle; it will be 
like a day at the farm," Geller said. "It's real slow, and you just meander 
around at your own leisure." 
</P>
<P>
 Walkers are asked to give a dollar, and individuals can sponsor the walk by 
making a $50, tax-deductible donation, Geller said. For the $1, walkers also 
can visit a haunted house. 
</P>
<P>
 For $250, businesses looking for publicity can have their company names 
painted on large wooden animal signs inserted in the ground at various points 
along the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised will go to repair fences and barns and to reseed pasture 
grasses depleted by migrating Canada geese, Geller said. The reseeding is 
expected to cost $5,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk is being sponsored by the college, the Foundation for Pierce College 
and the Associated Students Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Another walk will be held in December or January, when the Canada geese pass 
through, Lee said. For information on the walks call (818) 719-6408. FRANK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; BUILDER THREATENS TO SUE OVER PROJECT SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer of a proposed large-scale office and retail center in Calabasas 
is threatening to sue the city over a disagreement about the size of the 
project, an official for the development company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between the city and Kilroy Industries to reduce the size of the project 
have broken down, said Mark Ossola, the company's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negotiations have stalled, and unfortunately, litigation is probable," 
Ossola said. "We're hoping to work out a compromise, but that's unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has offered to reduce the project's size and allow the community 
to help draw up a master plan for it, Ossola said. In exchange, the company 
wants approval to build a 200,000-square-foot retail center, in addition to the 
larger project. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer has received approval for a 1.5-million-square-foot office and 
retail center, known as Calabasas Park Centre, at the corner of Calabasas Road 
and Parkway Calabasas. The project includes a 50,000-square-foot retail center, 
which would serve the employees of the office center. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer now wants to increase the retail center to 200,000 square feet, 
but this cannot be done without the city's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community has a choice: Would you like us to build a 
1.5-million-square-foot project right now," Ossola said, "or a 
200,000-square-foot retail center, with a smaller version of the 1.5-million 
(plan)." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, he said, would be willing to reduce the project's overall size to 
1.2 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Lopata, a member of a city committee working with the 
developer to reach a compromise, suggested that Ossola may have overreacted, 
because Kilroy Industries' proposal to reduce the project's size in exchange 
for a larger retail center has yet to go to the City Council for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopata's committee was formed after a City Council meeting in August at which 
all five council members told the developer they would reject the project 
unless it was scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossola declined to say by how much his company has offered to reduce the size 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kilroy Industries made its most recent offer, Lopata said, the company's 
officials "went to individual council members, and the consensus is they cannot 
get three votes and I think that's where they are coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sorry that that's where it's at, because in a lawsuit, I don't think 
anybody wins," Lopata added. "It's very expensive and there's always hard 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Ossola also said the two sides have failed to reach an agreement on the number 
of seats for a proposed movie theater that is part of the project. FRANK

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; STEAM-PUMPER FIRE ENGINE STILL RARING TO GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you do with an 88-year-old firefighter named Christy whose 
fire-fighting days are over? Put her on display. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what members of the Burbank Fire Department did Thursday with Christy, 
a one-of-a-kind antique horse-drawn steam engine featured at the Burbank Media 
Center Mall through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The display is part of the department's celebration of National Fire 
Prevention Week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is it a museum piece, we take it out and operate it," said Capt. 
Richard Fischer. "There are only six of them left in the country, and ours is 
the only one that drives and pumps." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer and his fellow firefighters drove the fire engine, which was converted 
to a gasoline-powered front wheel drive in 1915, five blocks to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy is being displayed with other firefighting equipment, uniforms and 
videos highlighting fire prevention techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The display will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. each day, with free smoke 
detectors and fire extinguishers given away during drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire prevention videotapes also will be given away to children who participate 
in an art contest and win a drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank firefighters hope that the display not only makes more people aware of 
ways they can prevent fires in their homes, but gives them a greater 
appreciation for the machinery used to save those homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after her motorized drive, Christy originally served the Los Angeles 
Fire Department, whose firefighters stoked her steam pumps with coal and 
kindling to gush out water at 500 gallons a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1928, Christy joined Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, where she began a 
career as a movie star alongside such notable comedians as the Three Stooges 
and Charlie Chaplin, Fischer said. For most steam-powered fire engines, 
however, the careers ended in World War II, when they were melted down for 
bronze and other metal scrap for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank firefighters eventually rescued Christy and another antique engine, a 
1913 chain-driven Morlan, from the Warner lot several years ago, where they had 
been sent out to pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have been restored to their original finish so that they can be 
displayed and occasionally compete in statewide firemen's games. But only 
Christy is in working order right now, so the Morlan is not on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean that we might someday see Christy barreling down the road 
toward some mini-mall? Not likely, Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was some real kind of catastrophe, we could take it out as long as 
we had coal or wood to fuel the steam pump," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But daily runs to flaming mini-malls would provide too much wear-and-tear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with these things is if you break something, you don't go to Pep 
Boys and buy the part," Fischer said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HOOVER HIGH JUNIOR TO SERVE ON BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suzi Ajalat, a junior at Hoover High School, will become the second student 
representative to the Board of Education in the history of the Glendale Unified 
School District next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajalat, who will be sworn in by school board President Sharon Beauchamp at a 
meeting Tuesday, was selected this week by the district's Student Advisory 
Council, a group of 10 student leaders from Crescenta Valley, Daily, Glendale 
and Hoover high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 She will succeed Armen Panossian, a former Glendale High student and now a 
freshman at Stanford University, who was the district's first student 
representative during the past two school years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to do my job well. I will do my best to bring the opinions, concerns 
and needs of the students to the attention of the board," Ajalat said, adding 
that she is "very excited" about her new position. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, student representatives sit on the board in a non-voting 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajalat can participate in all public meetings of the board, however, and her 
role will be to communicate the students' perspective on issues to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High officials said Ajalat is the school's student vice president. In 
that capacity, she presides over the meetings of the Hoover Legislature, a 
student council with 138 members. 
</P>
<P>
 She was president of the sophomore class last year and has a near-perfect 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Her academic schedule includes several advanced placement courses, which can 
qualify students for college credits. She is a member of the French club and

VAN NUYS MAN CONVICTED OF MURDERING 2 OLDER BROTHERS IN 1990 
</P>

 As they huddled together at the trial for the murder of their two sons, Mariam 
Samarneh pressed a handkerchief to her lips and wept, while her husband, Awwad, 
stifled sporadic sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to weep for three of their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, 30-year-old Mawan Awwad Samarneh, was convicted Thursday by 
Superior Court Judge Sandy R. Kriegler of second degree murder in the shooting 
deaths of his brothers more than four years ago in a sparely furnished Van Nuys 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, the distraught mother has repeatedly asked LAPD Detective Pat Anguiano, 
won't authorities let her son go? Why can't his family take him home and take 
care of him? They've already lost two sons, why must they lose a third? 
</P>
<P>
 Next week another trial will begin before Kriegler to determine whether Mawan 
Awwad Samarneh, who has been diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic, was legally 
sane at the time he shot his brothers to death during an argument over his new 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 A thin, pale man with matted hair and beard, Samarneh sat manacled at the 
defense table during the trial, apparently taking no notice of his parents' 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested more than four years ago, Samarneh, then 25, told police 
the shooting was an accident. When he took the witness stand Thursday, he said 
he wasn't present when his brothers were shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Samarneh, who was unemployed, bought a .45 caliber Colt semiautomatic pistol 
in January, 1990 for about $500, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Leonard J. Shaffer. 
Later Samarneh's family would say he'd spoken about being followed by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the prosecution, he was lying on a mattress on the living room 
floor and reading an instruction manual for the gun about midnight on Feb. 16, 
1990. An argument broke out when his brothers objected to his having the gun, 
Shaffer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven shots ended the argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a pastor found the bodies of the Samarneh brothers. Mazan, 31, had been 
shot four times, including twice in the chest. His body was lying amid shell 
casings on the living room floor. Maher, 32, was found on the bathroom floor, 
with two bullet wounds in his arms and one in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrest two days after the shooting, Samarneh's mental condition has 
been a key issue in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Karen King had argued for an acquittal, saying Samarneh 
lacked the mental capacity to intentionally or maliciously kill his brothers. 
Now, she will seek to prove that he was legally insane at the time of the 
shootings and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.  
</P>
<P>
 The next phase of the trial is likely to be a more in-depth version of the 
testimony offered by mental health experts during the guilt phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Several experts have testified that Samarneh was a paranoid schizophrenic 
prone to hallucinations and delusions. Family members spoke of incidents when 
he attempted to commune with a dead uncle and demanded that air conditioning 
vents be closed to keep spirits out. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first preliminary hearing, he was found mentally incompetent for 
trial and sent to Patton State Hospital. Later, doctors there contended he was 
faking to avoid responsibility for his crimes and ordered him returned to 
county jail.

LANDFILL PLANS UNCLEAR AS STUDY FLAWS SURFACE; LAKE VIEW TERRACE: OFFICIALS 
THROW OUT A DRAFT REPORT RECOMMENDING AN EXTENSION OF THE FACILITY'S OPERATION 
THAT WAS BASED ON FAULTY SAVINGS ESTIMATES.

 The future of the Lopez Canyon Landfill near Lake View Terrace was uncertain 
Thursday after sanitation officials acknowledged that previous estimates of the 
money that would be saved by extending the life of the dump were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a tongue-lashing by Councilman Richard Alarcon, sanitation officials 
agreed to throw out a draft study that recommends extending operation of the 
landfill beyond its 1996 closing date. The recommendation was based on 
calculations that the extension would be $72 million cheaper than any 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, a vocal opponent of the landfill, which is located in his district, 
pointed out several flaws in the study's cost estimates and demanded that 
sanitation officials re-examine the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the document's figures are wrong and misleading but have 
continued to be the basis for the city pursuing an extension of Lopez Canyon is 
outrageous," he told sanitation officials Wednesday at a meeting of the 
council's Public Works Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Sones, assistant director of the city's Bureau of Sanitation, agreed to 
re-examine the calculations, telling Alarcon he could throw away the 
department's study. "You can recycle it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Sones said the decision to throw out previous 
assumptions about the dump means that any past recommendations by his 
department to extend its life must also be reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our position is we are going to redo the numbers so we can all agree 
what the (accurate) numbers are and then bring those numbers back" to the panel 
for a final decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was a small victory for Alarcon and other dump opponents but is 
not likely to close the book on this long-running controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows that they didn't do (the study) right and they need to do it 
right," said Phyllis Hines, a landfill opponent and member of the Lake View 
Terrace Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Alarcon both criticized the Lopez Canyon study, saying it fails to 
investigate recycling as an alternative to keeping the dump open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be called a landfill plan, not a waste management plan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began in March when sanitation officials released a draft 
study on waste disposal strategies that recommended extending the landfill's 
operating permit until 2000, based on calculations that said the city could 
save $72 million if it did not have to haul trash elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation prompted an outcry from landfill opponents, including 
Alarcon, who accused sanitation officials of going back on a promise that no 
further extensions would be sought beyond 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Alarcon has pointed out several inconsistencies in the study and 
pressured sanitation officials to re-examine their calculations. For example, 
the cost of hauling trash by rail to a remote landfill, he said, was 
overestimated by about 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the flaws are corrected, Alarcon said, the difference between extending 
the landfill and other alternatives is only $3 million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sones said his department will complete a new study of the costs of extending 
the landfill's operation by the end of October. Meanwhile, he said, the city 
has begun to seek cost estimates from firms interested in providing an 
alternative to the landfill, such as trucking trash to other local landfills or 
hauling it by rail to remote dumps. Those proposals should be completed by 
February, Sones said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the evaluation of the alternatives, he said the city will give 
extra consideration to those firms that put a strong emphasis on recycling.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: SYBERT, BACKED BY PAC MONEY, SAYS HE'S BUSINESS'S BOTTOM 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 PAC-MAN: GOP congressional candidate Richard Sybert, who is now challenging 
U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson(D-Woodland Hills), is trying to spin a new logic 
for voters: that political action committee (PAC) money is good, not bad. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated $60,000 he has received from PACs should be seen as a vote of 
confidence by the business community in his campaign pledge to lift roadblocks 
to commerce and jobs growth by working to lower taxes and cut government 
regulations, Sybert said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who supply the jobs in this district and the workers who depend on 
them are supporting me because they know that I understand the issues 
confronting a business and the hoops they must jump through just to stay in 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This logic is partly defensive as Sybert braces for a Beilenson broadside. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 Beilenson badly banged up his opponent, former GOP Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock, for accepting PAC contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 PAC contributions, the Democrat has said, represent unwholesome efforts by 
powerful special interests to influence lawmakers. Beilenson has pledged for 
years that he will not take such money. (Under federal law, PACs may contribute 
$5,000 to a candidate, while individuals may give a maximum of $1,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has raised the ante by calling Beilenson's anti-PAC rhetoric "typical 
incumbent politician doublespeak." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing federal election records, Sybert accused Beilenson of indirectly taking 
PAC money. Beilenson, Sybert noted, accepts contributions from the state and 
national Democratic congressional campaign fund -- which directly takes PAC 
money itself -- and has benefited from the independent expenditures made in his 
behalf by half a dozen PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's nonsense," said Craig Miller, a Beilenson political consultant. "We do 
not encourage independent expenditures by PACs, and to our knowledge such 
expenditures are not being made in our behalf." As for the PAC money that comes 
indirectly through state and national party contributions, it's not the same as 
taking the money directly, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Miller rejects the notion that a PAC can be painted as a good thing. 
"I'll bet the people of our district won't think so," he said. PACs are only 
contributing to Sybert because they believe "they will be able to control his 
vote," Miller said. "They oppose Congressman Beilenson because they know he is 
a pro-consumer, pro-environment vote."

 BRAIN MAN: Sherman Oaks activist and realtor Jeff Brain, 35, is hoping to 
build some excitement about his City Council campaign with Brain-Man, a cartoon 
figure that will be the mascot for his bid to represent Los Angeles' 5th 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain-Man -- a kind of stick figure in a cape with large prefrontal lobes -- 
will appear in cable TV ads and literature produced by the candidate, according 
to Brain's press relations manager, Roy Silver. And, yes, there's already a 
Brain-Man campaign button. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5th District seat is now held by Zev Yaroslavsky, who will be stepping 
down in December to take his place with the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain and Brain-Man have their work cut out for them. Also running for the 
seat are Barbara Yaroslavsky, the councilman's wife; Michael Feuer, the former 
head of Bet-Tzedek, a legal services agency; Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin 
D'Agostino and Roberta Weintraub, a former Los Angeles school board member.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF WEINTRAUB: Roberta Weintraub kicked off her political career 15 
years ago in a stunning recall of Howard Miller, then a member of the Board of 
Education. She did it through old-style grass-roots campaigning -- 
door-to-door, outside shopping centers, shaking hands and kissing babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are not all that different now. Weintraub can be found outside 
supermarkets these days, handing out her campaign literature. While she's 
running for Yaroslavsky's City Council seat, she says campaigning hasn't 
changed much. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever she gets "a few minutes," she said, she's headed for a market to meet 
and greet prospective voters. Outside a Hughes market in Studio City this week, 
Weintraub stood in front of the grocery carts, shaking hands and handing out 
pamphlets with her campaign slogan: "A public servant . . . not a politician." 
</P>

 CASH AND CHRISTIANS: Democratic candidate Adam Schiff picked up fresh ammo 
this week in his effort to paint state Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) as 
a creature of the radical right. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports released this week showed that Rogan, who has 
declared his support for teaching creation theory in the public schools, got 
$25,000 from Galpin Ford (whose owner, Bert Boeckmann, has been allied with TV 
evangelist Pat Robertson) and $25,000 from Allied Business PAC. This PAC is 
controlled by four conservative Christian millionaire businessmen who have 
emerged as the chief financiers of fundamentalist-inclined GOP politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney, attacked Rogan for his right-wing 
financial ties during a debate this week on KIEV radio hosted by veteran 
commentator George Putnam. Rogan's financial angels are "committed, in my view, 
to imposing certain religious views on the community through education and 
state government," Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Rogan complained: "I keep wanting to talk about the issues, and all 
he wants to talk about is religion." 
</P>

 TALE OF THE TAPE: Probably the biggest complaint among the Los Angeles 
business community is the red tape and delays associated with getting City Hall 
to approve a permit to build or expand a businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is ironic that the latest effort to streamline the bureaucracy that 
controls development has been bogged down in the slow-turning wheels of 
government for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 No substantial changes have been put into place almost a year after Mayor 
Richard Riordan gave a panel of developers, architects and others three months 
to draft a streamlining plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the committee is not expected to release its recommendations until 
next month, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, backers of the streamlining process praise the effort, saying it 
will eventually help retain and attract more businesses by making it easier to 
start new ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, supporters grumble at the delays in getting the streamlining 
effort off the ground, noting that such bottlenecks are the precise reason that 
businesses are flocking to cities such as Seattle and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Garcia, an airport commissioner and former planning commissioner who leads 
the panel, attributed the delays partly to the Jan. 17 earthquake and the need 
for additional study of the city's fee structure. But he also said it takes 
time to gather input from city departments and homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to get some level of feedback," he said. "With anything this 
complicated, you can't come back with some simple, half-baked ideas."

VARYING COST ESTIMATES FOR RAIL LINE TROUBLE OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County transit officials Thursday asked planners to reconcile incompatible 
cost figures for the east-west San Fernando Valley rail line, saying the matter 
should be resolved before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority decides 
between a subway or monorail-type system. 
</P>
<P>
 A study released last month found that a subway system paralleling Burbank 
Boulevard would cost $19 million more than an elevated line straddling the 
Ventura Freeway, far less than the $400 million previously estimated. Officials 
who favor an elevated railway dispute the lower amount, saying that differences 
in pricing resulted in higher estimates for the monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, MTA board member Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke asked planners to be 
prepared to address those disparities when the board meets Oct. 26 to select a 
route for the rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other MTA officials also requested more information about the option 
of building a ground-level rail line along the Ventura Freeway median that 
initial projections show could be cheaper than an aerial system. Such an 
"at-grade" railway would be similar to the Green Line trolley under 
construction in the center of the Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of saving as much as $550 million, according to preliminary 
projections, "would be a big added bonus," board member Raul Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA chief Franklin E. White said his staff would further analyze the merits of 
an at-grade system. But he stressed that the MTA board should decide on a route 
this month so that the agency can begin work on environmental studies that must 
be completed if the MTA hopes to win federal funding for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Valley residents also urged the MTA to settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley should not be held hostage any longer," said Polly Ward, who lives 
in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision at the MTA meeting later this month would cap years of bickering 
over a Valley rail line. Supporters of a monorail say such a system would be a 
more cost-effective option for the cash-strapped transit agency, while 
opponents contend that an underground railway would provide a better connection 
to the Metro Rail Red Line subway through Downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE MAN FACES CHARGES IN HERMOSA BEACH 
SHOOTING 
</P>

<P>
 A Palmdale man was charged with attempted murder this week in the shooting of 
a Hermosa Beach woman who survived for four days in her apartment with three 
bullet wounds in her head, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 When police found Linda M. Dillon, 57, on Oct. 3, semi-conscious in her 
apartment, she said she had tried to commit suicide. She now says she was shot 
by Jeffrey Ray Locke, 41, a former co-worker at Hughes Aircraft, said Detective 
Raul Saldana of the Hermosa Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has never articulated a reason for the contradictory statement," said Los 
Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Wilson, who is handling the case. "But she 
is saying he shot her now." 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon is in fair condition at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke pleaded not guilty Tuesday at his arraignment in Torrance Municipal 
Court. He is being held in lieu of $500,000 at Men's Central Jail, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were skeptical of the suicide explanation because multiple 
shots were fired and no gun or casings were found in the apartment. A neighbor 
had also told police Dillon named Locke as her attacker when the neighbor found 
her moaning in her apartment before police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship between them is still unclear," Saldana said. "Both said it 
was friendly," he said adding that the two may have been involved in a romantic 
relationship at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Saldana said Dillon insists that her relationship with Locke was platonic, but 
said that in the earlier accounts she gave, "it sounded like she was trying to 
protect him." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Locke may have used a pillow to muffle the shots he is charged 
with firing into Dillon. A bloodied pillow was found in his car a block away 
from her apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No gun has been recovered, but a search of Locke's home revealed two 
.22-caliber rifles, one AK-47 assault weapon and a 30-30 Winchester rifle, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke's preliminary hearing is scheduled for Oct. 26.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE APPROVES FIRST PHASE OF RITTER RANCH 
DEVELOPMENT; HOUSING: THE CITY OKS 713 HOUSES AFTER GETTING DEVELOPER'S 
ASSURANCES THAT NATIVE AMERICAN ARTIFACTS WILL BE PROTECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palmdale City Council has cleared the way for construction of the first 
phase of houses in the massive Ritter Ranch community after receiving 
last-minute assurances from the developer that Native American artifacts will 
be protected and neighborhood designs will be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy debate, a majority of the council overruled two members who 
wanted the project sent back to the city's Planning Commission for more review. 
The west Palmdale development was approved in a 4-1 vote after Peter Wenner, 
general manager of Ritter Ranch, promised to meet with Native American 
representatives on the artifacts issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Native Americans told the council that they want to inspect what they 
believe are "sacred sites" on the land. Archeological surveys conducted on the 
land indicated it may have been the site of a Native American settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for the Ritter Ranch development group to act civilly to its 
landlords," said a woman who identified herself as D. Garcia and a Shoshone 
Native American. She believes the Ritter Ranch property was inhabited by her 
ancestors. "Ritter Ranch forgets whose land this was originally." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to inspection rights, Garcia sought assurances that the developer 
would abide by state laws that call for the preservation of any artifacts that 
are unearthed on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time Native Americans have come forward to express concern 
about the development, despite years of exhaustive environmental reviews, city 
officials said 
</P>
<P>
 Wenner said he would cooperate with the Native Americans after they provide a 
written request and verification that they are qualified representatives of 
their tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was also worried that the first Ritter Ranch neighborhood would 
resemble an unsightly sea of three-car garages. Their concerns stemmed from the 
relatively small lot sizes, which Wenner said were needed to reduce the housing 
prices. He said many of the houses will offer three-car garages because 
Palmdale homebuyers prefer this amenity. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said large garage doors will dominate the front of the 
small houses and could result in an ugly streetscape. "I would dislike very 
much going down a corridor, a canyon of garage doors," Councilman Joe Davies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenner said the developers would enhance the appearance of the neighborhood by 
using curved streets and by varying the designs of houses and the distance they 
are set back from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first phase of our development," Wenner told the council. "The 
last thing we want to do is make a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase will consist of 713 single-family detached houses, plus five 
recreation areas. It will be situated south of Elizabeth Lake Road, near the 
future site of 40th Street West. Over the next 15 years, the developers plan to 
build about 7,200 residences on the sprawling 10,625-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 To proceed with the first phase, the developers needed a conditional use 
permit because they wanted to put single-family detached houses on lots 
measuring 5,000 and 6,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale normally requires at least 7,000-square-foot lots for single-family 
detached houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditional use permit was the last major hurdle prior to construction. 
The developer still must file tentative tract maps and undergo final reviews of 
the grading and street design plans, but these are not expected to delay the 
project. A groundbreaking date has not been announced.

ANNUAL VIGIL TO REMEMBER AIDS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AIDS activists in the Antelope Valley will conduct their second annual AIDS 
Memorial Candlelight Vigil tonight, offering residents an open microphone to 
pay tribute to loved ones and friends they have lost to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd really like to get people who have been personally affected (to attend) 
because it gives them a chance to grieve and do it in a public way," said 
physician Susan E. Lawrence, founder and president of the Lancaster-based 
Catalyst Foundation for AIDS Awareness and Care, the event's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "One of the best ways to deal with grief is to tell the story over 
and over, sometimes in public, sometimes in private with a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, whose husband died of AIDS, said her own public speaking appearances 
at local schools have helped her cope. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's event will be held at the Lutheran Church of the Master, 725 E. Ave. 
J, in Lancaster. It begins at 6 p.m. with a hot chocolate mixer, followed by a 
one-mile candlelight walk along Avenue J from 6:30 to 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, a band assembled by musician Larry Pratt will perform in the church 
parking lot, including a song Pratt composed for someone living with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be able to view a section of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial 
Quilt, which carries the names of people who have died of the disease. In 
addition, participants will be able to share memories and pay tribute to 
friends and relatives who have died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We carry so much baggage when people die of AIDS," said Brian Maxey, vice 
president of Catalyst Foundation and organizer of the event. "This is a good 
way to let some of that go." 
</P>
<P>
 He said grief counselors will be available at the event.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITIZEN ACTION CREDITED FOR DECREASE IN 
GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities report one piece of good news has emerged in the 
city's battle against increasing juvenile crime: Graffiti incidents, one of the 
area's biggest concerns, are down 36% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher laws and more community participation in graffiti eradication programs 
are in large part credited for the dramatic decrease in reported incidents, 
according to city and police officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Many graffiti vandals, for example, were scared off by residents who 
videotaped or photographed them defacing property, said Sgt. Lee White, head of 
the Career Offenders Burglary Robbery Apprehension (COBRA) team, which 
investigated gang crimes in the jurisdiction of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti markings are often linked with gang activity, as vandals mar walls 
with gang monikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has pretty much disappeared," he said, noting there were only 35 incidents 
of graffiti reported in September, compared to an average of more than 100 
reports per month in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of graffiti increased from 155 in 1992 to 1,228 in 1993, although 
sheriff's officials said the larger figure is misleading because of a change in 
the way incidents were tallied. There were 357 reports of graffiti during the 
first six months of 1994, compared to 557 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More people are volunteering for the city's PRIDE committee, which removes 
graffiti and reports incidents to law enforcement officials, said Kevin 
Tonoian, the city's graffiti abatement coordinator. He said the committee now 
has about 45 members, an increase of 25 percent in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonoian said the city has worked to make sure markings are removed within a 
day or two after being spotted, so they won't attract more. In addition, he 
said PRIDE volunteers try to return the color and texture of the defaced area 
to its original state.  
</P>
<P>
 "Patches on a wall do nothing more than let someone know graffiti was there 
before and provides a spot for them to do graffiti again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has made it illegal for minors to possess items such as spray paint 
and marking pens. Officials have also ordered the Sheriff's Department to get 
tough on enforcing a night curfew for youths who are not at work or at 
legitimate entertainment facilities, such as movie theaters, Tonoian said.

FIRST PENSION LAND FUND ROLE DENIED BY O.C. BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of dollars invested in land deals controlled by Orange County 
developer Buck Johns and the owner of scandal-plagued First Pension Corp. were 
improperly diverted through the pension management firm, a court-appointed 
receiver has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Donald W. Henry said he will present his findings in federal court in 
the next few months after he completes his investigation of investments run by 
First Pension founder William E. Cooper, who for more than 10 years operated an 
elaborate pyramid scheme with his clients' retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns, one of Orange County's most influential citizens and a Republican power 
broker, vehemently rejects Henry's allegations, and neither the receiver nor 
any government authority has accused Johns of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our opinion that no funds were commingled," Johns said. "Those funds, 
if they were commingled, were then replaced back into the partnership 
accounts." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns, 52, described his business relationship with Cooper as 
"straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cooper had the checkbook," Johns said in an interview Thursday. "We had no 
access to any of those funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Clients of Orange-based First Pension lost $121.5 million by investing in 
mortgages that never existed. Cooper agreed in August to plead guilty to two 
counts of federal mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, a Woodland Hills attorney appointed by government securities regulators 
in July to examine investments controlled by Cooper, estimated that more than 
$2 million was diverted from partnerships jointly controlled by Johns and 
Cooper, though some of the money was subsequently returned. The receiver would 
not say where the money was transferred or who moved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Buck Johns partnerships may have liabilities to other investors in the 
First Pension case," said Henry, who has 20 years' experience as a specialist 
in real estate-related bankruptcies. "Some of the investor monies put into his 
partnerships were misdirected and taken by other Cooper entities." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 investors, Henry said, put about $7 million into land deals 
controlled by the two men and sold from 1987 to 1990. The properties involved 
cover nearly 100 acres, mostly in Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the cash raised from investors for the partnerships was used to 
buy land, other money originally set aside to pay bills and conduct other 
operations was diverted, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found commingling rampant everywhere. This money traveled more than you 
and I ever will in our lives," Henry said. "We are going to ask the court how 
to proceed when you have pervasive fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 An independent accountant hired by Henry is auditing the land partnerships, 
which were created with the help of an in-house accountant at Cooper's company, 
Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and Johns, who met in the late 1970s, were both members of the 
exclusive Lincoln Club, an influential group of Republican campaign 
contributors. Johns -- still an active member of the group -- is one of the 
leading advocates of a November ballot measure to convert El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a tight Orange County political circle, Johns has hosted two 
campaign fund-raisers for former Vice President Dan Quayle, hobnobbed with 
former President George Bush and had private meetings with Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, though not as politically active as Johns, made nearly $20,000 in 
contributions to Republican candidates from 1989 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said he was taken by surprise when he heard last spring about the 
10-year fraud run by Cooper at First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just as shocked as anyone when I saw the thing start to unravel," he 
said. "Our business was very straightforward. I had no reason to suspect that 
anything else was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 2, the day after Cooper entered his guilty pleas, Johns sent a letter 
to investors in the land partnerships asking them to oust Cooper as managing 
general partner and appoint him to the position. He said this week that more 
than 80% of investors have voted to do that, but such a shift cannot occur 
until Henry's investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns, an Arkansas native, began investing in real estate in the late 1970s 
while heading the California operations of an air-conditioning company. He is 
owner of Inland Group Inc., an 8-year-old Newport Beach company that mainly 
develops land in the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 For its real estate projects, all of which are in Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties, Inland Group typically teams with investors such as Cooper to finance 
the development. The Inland Group then handles the paperwork involved in 
launching the construction of the project. Johns is known for his skill at 
cutting through red tape at city halls and county courthouses to keep projects 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 A broker familiar with those transactions said that Cooper, as managing 
general partner, kept track of the finances while Johns, as co-general partner, 
was responsible for permits and government approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck used to come in . . . and do updates for us on the old partnerships and 
present details on the new ones," said John Hiers, who was a broker at Vestcorp 
Securities, another Cooper-owned company, from 1989 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's and Johns' friendship soured in the early 1990s, Hiers said, when 
Cooper stopped paying bills, including taxes and consultants' fees, for some of 
the partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck has a lot of relationships in the Inland Empire, and he demanded that 
Bill write the checks," Hiers said. "Bill just did his usual song and dance. 
After that, they didn't do any more deals." 
</P>
<P>
 Through First Pension, many investors put money into the Cooper-Johns land 
deals. One of those is Mark O'Connell, a Newport Beach lawyer who says he lost 
$68,000 in First Pension. It is hard to comprehend that a businessman as savvy 
as Johns could have been a partner of Cooper and not have suspected that 
something was amiss at First Pension, O'Connell said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 After the SEC alleged massive fraud at First Pension, a federal judge in May 
froze the assets of Cooper and two of his long-term associates, Valerie Jensen 
and Robert E. Lindley. Jensen and Lindley, along with Cooper, agreed in August 
to plead guilty of federal mail fraud. Each faces a prison term of up to 10 
years and a $500,000 fine. The three are to be sentenced by a federal judge on 
Nov. 10.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Cooper's continued cooperation with investigators was part of the 
August plea bargain, Henry said, Cooper is not cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel he has not been candid or cooperative," Henry said. "In 20 years, I 
have never seen such a convoluted conduit of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Bonner, a former federal judge who is now Cooper's lawyer, said his 
client is "actively cooperating" with Henry and all the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Libby, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who led the Cooper 
investigation, said, "We are aware of his cooperation or lack thereof, and we 
will be taking that into account in forming our sentencing recommendation to 
the court." Johns-Cooper Land Deals

 Orange County developer William Buck Johns and William E. Cooper, owner of 
now-defunct First Pension Corp., were partners in 10 partnerships that raised 
money to invest in undeveloped land, according to a lawyer appointed by the 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to investigate First Pension. The

COLLEAGUES IN TRIP LOSE FAITH IN O.C. MEDICAL MISSIONARY; AID: HE SAYS TROUBLED 
CHINA OPERATION WAS 'SABOTAGED' BY MUTINOUS GROUP OF DOCTORS WHO OUSTED HIM AS 
LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mel Alexander sees himself as a globe-trotting medical missionary whose 
adventures in healing have taken him to Africa, Honduras, Mexico, Thailand and 
Nepal during the past three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 As president of the Christian Medical Assn., whose mailing address is listed 
in Seal Beach, Alexander says there isn't anywhere his organization wouldn't go 
to help the sick and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 32 years, I can't tell you how many people we have helped," he said in an 
interview Thursday. "By no means are we new to this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But a team of 89 physicians, nurses and support staff who accompanied 
Alexander on a 10-day mission to the Republic of China last month said 
Alexander's leadership -- or lack of it -- placed the group in a precarious 
position with government officials and sparked sensational headlines in the 
Hong Kong press. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an international incident, but I didn't create it," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembled from throughout the United States, Canada and New Zealand, the 
medical team was recruited by Alexander with the goal of treating an estimated 
5,000 sick and poor residents of the south China city of Yibin. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander told the team that he had secured $3.5 million in medical supplies 
and equipment that would be donated to Yibin. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when the health-care team arrived at its destination Sept. 12, physicians 
were confronted by angry Chinese authorities who had inspected the supplies 
that were shipped before the delegation's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 What the physicians found were crates of outdated medication, damaged or 
broken equipment and mildewed clothing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Ng of Irvine, one of several dentists on the mission, said one 
packing crate contained "nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were three boxes of old (eyeglasses), like from the 1970s," Ng said. 
"Another box was filled with stuff like old batteries, pencils -- stuff that 
you might dig out of the cushions of your couch. I was appalled." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Chinese were expecting millions of dollars in supplies, the 
physicians said the shipment's value was more like $50,000 and only part of 
that could be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said various drug companies and charitable organizations donated the 
supplies and provided the estimated value of $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the physicians, however, Yibin officials were so irate over the 
condition of the supplies that they eventually called in army troops who loaded 
the shipment onto two military trucks for transport to a grave dug on the banks 
of the Yangtze River. 
</P>
<P>
 "They poured kerosene over it and lighted it," said Dr. Ralph Francis, a 
Nampa, Ida., dentist who later was chosen by his colleagues to help lead the 
group. "It was very embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 With the delegation's relationship with Chinese officials growing more tense 
by the day, physicians said, they met privately to remove themselves from 
Alexander's leadership so they could try to salvage a mission that ultimately 
resulted in success in spite of initial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So estranged had Alexander become to the group that Francis said $500 was paid 
to remove Alexander's name from a granite monument that Chinese officials had 
erected on a hillside outside of town to commemorate the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a very dire situation," said Calvin Howe of Heber Springs, Ark., a 
member of the mission's support staff. "But we managed to turn around what 
could have been a tragedy. From a spiritual standpoint, it could only have been 
God that brought us out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, however, charged that the mission was "sabotaged" from the start by 
a mutinous group of physicians "hungry for power." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the group's arrival in Yibin, Alexander said, the doctors grew 
increasingly unhappy and engaged in an unwarranted "coup d'etat." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander acknowledged that Chinese officials were "not satisfied" with the 
number of physicians who had arrived nor were they happy with the quality of 
drugs and supplies shipped from the United States. Alexander said he had 
initially hoped to bring as many as 250 physicians and support staff, but that 
recruitment goal could not be accomplished. He said some who had expressed an 
interest in going on the trip had to cancel for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles, while unfortunate, were not unlike those encountered on the 
first days of other missions, said Alexander, adding that he is a retired 
physician with credentials from the University of Guadalajara in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day is always traumatic," said Marie Warner, Alexander's assistant, 
referring to past mission experiences. "You have to work through it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Francis, Howe and others said the disorganization, embarrassing supply 
situation and growing tension with the Chinese authorities warranted the 
group's formal separation from Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local government officials there felt drastically betrayed from the 
moment we arrived," Francis said. "Things got fairly tense. As a group, we 
realized we were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Yibin officials could not be reached for comment, but the mission has been the 
focus of much attention in Hong Kong newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a meeting of the physicians and others in the delegation, the group 
voted to reorganize leadership under Francis, Howe and Thomas Wu, a 
Seattle-based travel agent who helped Alexander plan the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu said he met Alexander in August, 1993. At that meeting, Wu talked of his 
interest in trying to involve himself in medical missionary work in China. 
Alexander, according to Wu, spoke of his experience leading such medical 
missions and his interest in making a venture into China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to get involved," Wu said. 
"He told me he had wanted to put together a mission to China for 30 years but 
had no contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the two arranged a trip to China, where they met with government 
officials and agreed that Yibin would be the site of their mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met with the proper authorities and we were very well received," Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu said Alexander agreed to arrange recruitment of physicians, donations of 
medical supplies and equipment, while he would handle the travel arrangements 
and some communications with Chinese officials. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wu, shortly after their arrival in Yibin, the mission "began to 
unravel." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was too naive," Wu said. "We should have looked in those boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander blames most of the trouble on Wu. From the start, Alexander said, Wu 
wanted to take control of the mission and helped engineer the leadership 
takeover once the group arrived in Yibin. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no argument that Alexander was voted out as the group's leader, 
there is a dispute between the two sides over the immediate reaction of Chinese 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Alexander, Chinese officials attempted to persuade him to stay on 
with the mission. Wu, Howe and others, however, claim that Chinese authorities 
suggested that Alexander leave the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said he left Yibin on his own terms and was treated with respect by 
Chinese authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Consulate's office in nearby Chengdu was notified by the physician 
group of the mission's troubles and later sent a summary of the delegation's 
activities in a report to the State Department in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official Thursday confirmed receipt of that report in which 
American officials in Chengdu acknowledged that the mission was fraught with 
troubles. The State Department official said the Chinese authorities were 
particularly "disappointed" that the "quality of the medicines did not meet 
Chinese specifications." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told a lot had to be burned," said the official, who spoke on 
condition that she not be named. According to the report filed with the State 
Department, when the change in leadership took place, the mission eventually 
became a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe said that following Alexander's departure, the group worked "overtime" to 
turn the mission around. He said physicians shuttled among 10 local hospitals 
and eventually met the goal of treating 5,000 patients, performing nearly 100 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a problem, but we wanted to prove that this could be turned into a 
success," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said the group felt a need to uphold a reputation "that as Americans 
we could not leave without doing the job right." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said that he was one of more than 100 medical missionaries who 
accompanied Alexander on a trip to Nepal last October. The mission was 
sponsored by the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel in Los Angeles, 
which had arranged for Alexander to organize the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble came almost immediately, Francis said, when half of the medical team 
was routed through Calcutta. Without proper visas, Francis said the group was 
placed in an airport compound until the group could arrange transportation to 
Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said Francis' story is a "complete fabrication." But a Foursquare 
Church official familiar with the mission confirmed Francis' account. Although 
the Nepal mission "eventually was a success," the church official, who did not 
want to be identified, said the trip was plagued by management problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not organized as good as we thought it would be," the official said. 
"We will not be using (Christian Medical Assn.) again." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said he agreed to go along on the China trip when Alexander contacted 
him and assured him that the trip would be tightly organized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also really wanted to see China," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the troubles, Howe, Francis and Wu said the group eventually bonded 
with Yibin residents. When the mission was over, the city marked the occasion 
with a party and the unveiling of a monument in honor of the group's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was hugging and tears," Howe said. "It was very emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the group learned that Alexander's name was also inscribed on the 
monument, Francis said, the physicians declined to participate in the ceremony 
until Alexander's name was removed.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; TRANSFERS ON HOLD FOR SOME L.A. 
TEACHERS

 Nearly half of the Los Angeles teachers facing transfers because of low 
enrollments won a temporary reprieve Thursday, but about 70 others will be sent 
to other campuses, leaving schools to reorganize classes and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson agreed to leave in place for at least four months about 68 
Los Angeles Unified School District elementary teachers -- including 23 in the 
San Fernando Valley -- at schools where enrollments fell short by eight or 
fewer students. The four months would give the affected schools time to see if 
enrollment increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher transfers have become an annual rite in the massive school 
district, but the January earthquake left campuses with even 
lower-than-expected enrollments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At those campuses, dozens -- even hundreds -- of students failed to enroll 
when classes began a month ago; teachers at those schools will be transferred 
after the district takes its official enrollment tally today. They will be sent 
to campuses with higher enrollments and not enough teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 The news was met with anger at some campuses, which did not meet the 
enrollment requirements, and with joy at others. Over the past several weeks, 
parents worked feverishly to try to persuade the district to keep the teachers 
at all the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Valley parents, teachers and students have held rallies to protest the 
transfers, saying that more disruption -- on top of the trauma suffered by 
students from the earthquake -- would be too much for the children. In an 
effort to demonstrate that point to the district, school employees and parents 
have surveyed neighborhoods and talked to contractors and apartment managers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Calahan Street School in Northridge, parents, teachers and students held a 
farewell event for Melinda Prudian, a teacher who will be transferred. "It's 
yet another reminder for these kids that the teacher's gone and that she's gone 
because of the earthquake," said Cheryl Crooks, a parent who organized a 
protest at the school two weeks ago. "But we have mixed feelings. We did not 
get everything we wanted but I feel like we stood up and were counted." 
</P>
<P>
 Prudian said she was sad to be leaving the campus where she has taught for 
nearly five years. "I wish something could have been done," Prudian said. "We 
tried everything." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein, who tried to persuade the district to 
keep the teachers at the schools in the hardest-hit areas, said she was 
delighted by Thompson's decision. "I am very pleased that we are able to help 
many of these schools," she said. "We're all sighing with relief -- especially 
in the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful -- absolutely wonderful," said Lorie Norwalt, the principal at 
Calabash Street School in Woodland Hills, where one first-grade teacher would 
have been transferred because the school was one student short. "It's a relief, 
really. We're elated." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Dupuis, the Calabash teacher, said students were cheering when they 
learned that she would remain at the school. "I love my class, I love my kids," 
Dupuis said. "I'm really happy they gave special consideration to the teachers 
and the students for this semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Chatsworth Park Elementary, parents called neighbors begging 
them to leave private schools and send their children to the local public 
campus. "I'm angry, I'm furious, I'm upset," said parent Janie Walker, who said 
her son's first-grade teacher is leaving because the school is two students 
short of meeting the requirement. "I think it's wrong to disrupt 27 students' 
lives because we're short two students. It was like a day of mourning over 
there -- the students were crying, the parents were crying." 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Mark Slavkin said parents and school employees should 
understand that keeping teachers in schools with low enrollments will cost the 
district money. "People say, 'What a bureaucratic, typical L. A. school 
district thing to do,' " Slavkin said. "People think because we're large, we 
can do whatever we want with people and resources. That's simply not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to leave the teachers at the 64 schools, including 20 in the 
Valley, will cost the district about $800,000. If Thompson had kept all the 
teachers at the campuses with low enrollments, it could have cost the system 
$2.3 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some principals said they remained hopeful that they will receive more 
students by February, when the district takes its next official enrollment 
count. Others think it could happen sooner. "We all think that over the 
weekend, the superintendent is going to find gold in his pot and we'll all keep 
our teachers," said Linda Pacheco, principal at Germain Street School in 
Chatsworth.

STATE COURT LETS STAND RULING ON WARRANTLESS ENTRY IN O.C. CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even when a person denies that domestic violence has occurred in his or her 
home, police can enter and investigate if they reasonably suspect a problem, 
according to a ruling left intact by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newport Beach woman whose drug conviction resulted from a police search in 
response to a report of a man shoving a woman around was denied review of an 
appeal in a unanimous court decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeals court had ruled in her case that an apparent domestic violence 
emergency authorized police to enter without a search warrant, despite the 
woman's assurances that everything was all right. The high court's action makes 
the appellate ruling binding on trial courts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stems from an incident in November, 1992, when Newport Beach police 
got an anonymous tip about a domestic disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arriving at the home, one officer saw a man inside and heard a shout, 
said the 4th District Court of Appeal. Police knocked on the door, and a woman, 
Melissa Ayotte, came to the door breathing heavily and looking frightened, the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a red mark under one eye and slight darkness under both eyes, leading 
Officer Bradley Green to believe she had been struck in the face. But Ayotte 
told Green that the red mark was a birthmark and that she had fallen down the 
stairs. She also said she was alone in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who had investigated other domestic violence cases, knew that battered 
women commonly deny being abused and believed that Ayotte and possibly others 
in the home were in danger, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers entered the home, saw marijuana and cocaine in plain view and 
arrested Ayotte and her boyfriend, John Anthony Higgins, on drug charges. No 
battery charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 After Superior Court Commissioner Richard M. Aronson upheld the search, Ayotte 
and Higgins pleaded guilty and were given short sentences. Their challenge to 
the search was rejected by the appeals court in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Past rulings in California and other states recognize that "probable cause of 
ongoing spousal abuse at a residence warrants immediate police intervention," 
said Justice Sheila Sonenshine in the 3-0 appellate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the normal requirement of a search warrant to enter a home does not 
apply in emergencies where immediate harm is a possibility. Sonenshine 
indicated that police who have reason to believe violence is likely can 
intervene without waiting for a search warrant, though she stopped short of 
saying that every domestic violence report justifies a warrantless entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers' actions were objectively reasonable and motivated by their 
concern for Ayotte's well-being," Sonenshine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins did not appeal the ruling. His lawyer, Douglas G. Benedon, said he 
disagreed with the court's refusal to require a search warrant but thought the 
decision was relatively narrow because it did not give police an automatic 
right of entry in every domestic violence case. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ayotte's lawyer, Brian P. Trela, said that the ruling comes close to 
creating a "domestic violence exception to the Fourth Amendment," the 
constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone says they're not in danger, and they're in no apparent position of 
danger, but the cops want to go in and check things out, this (ruling) just 
about gives them permission, if they can find some articulable facts to 
conclude that the person might be in danger or wasn't telling them the truth," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is People vs. Higgins and Ayotte, S041424.

RULING REAFFIRMS SURROGATE MOTHER'S RIGHTS IN O.C. CASE; COURTS: BIOLOGICAL 
FATHER FAILS TO GAIN SOLE CUSTODY OF GIRL. JUSTICES URGE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT 
ON SUCH CONTRACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court Thursday reaffirmed a surrogate mother's parental 
rights by rejecting an appeal by a biological father seeking sole custody of a 
now 4-year-old girl named Marissa. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrogate mother Elvira Jordan and biological father Robert P. Moschetta have 
shared parental responsibilities since an Orange County Superior Court judge in 
September, 1991, granted joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moschetta appealed, saying his contract with Jordan gave custody to him 
and his now ex-wife. An appellate court disagreed, and on Thursday so did the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The court differentiated this case from another last year, in which the woman 
is implanted with another couple's fertilized egg. Because either of the two 
women could be considered the child's natural mother, the court said then, the 
surrogacy contract can determine legal parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Orange County case, the court held Thursday, only one woman has a 
biological connection to the child, making Moschetta's contract invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate justices urged state legislators to regulate surrogacy 
contracts, a plea that has been made by other courts. But for now, the ruling 
is binding on all trial courts statewide, making the most common type of 
surrogacy agreement unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples who cannot afford in-vitro fertilization and embryo implantation, or 
who resort to traditional surrogacy because the female does not have eggs 
suitable for in-vitro fertilization, have no assurance their intentions will be 
honored in a court of law. . . . Once again the need for legislative guidance 
regarding the difficult problems arising from surrogacy arrangements is 
apparent," said Presiding Justice David Sills in the 3-0 appellate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard C. Gilbert, who represented Jordan in the Moschetta case and surrogate 
mother Anna Johnson in last year's case, was indignant at the appeals court's 
suggestion that the Legislature regulate surrogacy contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California our appellate courts believe that money can buy anything," he 
said. "They openly call upon the state Legislature to write new laws so that 
children can be sold pursuant to contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said he would have appealed the unfavorable portion of the ruling, 
which required reconsideration of Jordan's joint-custody status, "if I believed 
that we had a (state) Supreme Court that knew right from wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Moschetta and his then-wife, Cynthia, contacted Jordan through a surrogacy 
broker in 1989 and agreed to pay her $10,000 to bear a child from Moschetta's 
sperm and Jordan's egg through artificial insemination. She promised to let 
Robert Moschetta obtain sole custody and to help Cynthia Moschetta adopt the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 A day before giving birth to a girl in May, 1990, Jordan learned that Robert 
Moschetta had asked his wife for a divorce. Jordan let the couple take the 
child home after they said they would stay together, but Robert Moschetta left 
the family home seven months later, taking the girl with him, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three sought custody rights. Cynthia Moschetta later dropped her claim, 
but it was taken up by her ex-husband, who asserted that she was the child's 
legal mother and that Jordan had no parental status. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock found that Robert 
Moschetta and Jordan were the child's legal parents, and awarded them joint 
custody, with Jordan caring for the child on weekdays and Robert Moschetta 
evenings and weekends. That arrangement has been followed during appeal of the 
case, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled June 10 that Jordan was the mother and 
that her promise to relinquish the child for adoption was not binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Supreme Court ruling used the surrogacy contract to determine 
legal parenthood only because the child had two "natural" mothers, the woman 
who bore her and the woman who contributed her egg and her genes, said Sills. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, only Jordan, the child's birth and genetic mother, would 
be recognized as her legal mother under California law. He also said the 
surrogacy contract could not serve as an adoption agreement because state law 
requires consent by both parents in a social worker's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is disquieting," Sills said, noting that the child never would 
have been born if the Moschettas had known Jordan would change her mind.

CELEBRITY STATUS; JIM GLEED IS REMEMBERED FOR RECORD-SETTING GAME IN 1979 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Gleed leads a rather normal, oatmeal-kind-of-a-life. 
</P>
<P>
 At work, he's a nose-to-the-grindstone type. A hard worker, a real hustler. At 
play, he surfs, he runs, he has a good time. He also spends quality time with 
his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one face among a thousand, maybe a million. A poster boy for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there is one glitch in that ordinary Joe bio. One moment that surfaces 
from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a month ago, I was at the gym and some guy I didn't even know stops and 
says, "Hey, do you still hold the record?' " Gleed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the record. The one night that makes Jim Gleed different from every other 
high school running back who has ever played in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 18, 1979, Gleed went out to play football for a winless Dana Hills 
team. He came back a local legend. 
</P>
<P>
 He gained 418 yards against Laguna Hills, still a county record. He scored six 
touchdowns and ran for a two-point conversion, giving him 38 points. He had a 
game like no one has had in the county, before or since. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes him different; it makes him special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that game altered my life," Gleed said. "It was a religious 
experience. Doors opened up for me. I was a superstar overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a star at least. He rode that for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 His football career continued, from Dana Hills to Saddleback College. He 
finished at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where his career began with a tryout and 
finished with all-conference honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time to get on with life, time to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only thing I regret," Gleed said. "I didn't see myself playing in 
the pros. I didn't look past college. I was into school, partying and being the 
big man on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't take myself as serious as I should have. I'm into that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed is serious about cars, or rather servicing them. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a car salesman, a job he has had on and off since leaving San Luis 
Obispo in 1987. It was a hand-to-mouth existence sometimes, living on 
commission alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes some stability. He was promoted to service adviser two weeks ago. A 
steady job and a regular paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of many positive markers that have popped up recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some problems in my life and I've worked them out," said Gleed, who 
lives in Mission Viejo. "Everything has been going great. Customers started 
tipping me. I get this promotion. I found this a great place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 And, strangest of all . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, people are coming up to me and saying, "Aren't you Jim 
Gleed, the guy who ran for 400 yards?' " he said. "A kid walking by on the 
street said that the other day. It's been getting weird. But I have a feeling 
of euphoria." 
</P>
<P>
 He had it once before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been just like that night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don DeGroote, former Dana Hills football coach, checks the Southern Section 
record book every year to see where Gleed stands. He was still sixth in section 
history for yards in a single game when the 1994 season began. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing about Gleed to suggest anything special. He was a good 
player with good speed. Football was important to him, but his life did not 
revolve around the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a surfing class at 7:30 a.m.," said DeGroote, who resigned as coach in 
1981. "I kept telling him, 'Hey, don't go surfing.' But he would anyway. 
Finally, we agreed he wouldn't surf on game days." 
</P>
<P>
 There also was nothing about that Dana Hills team to cause concern. The 
Dolphins had not won a game. The closest they had come was a 7-7 tie with 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laguna Hills tried an onside kick to start the game," DeGroote said. "I don't 
think they respected our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks did in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed, then a 5-foot-10, 165-pound junior, scored on a 25-yard run on the 
game's third play. He also scored on runs of 1, 2, 85 and 19 yards before being 
pulled out of the game in the fourth quarter. By then, he had 324 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the bench and this little voice kept saying, 'One more play, one 
more play, " Gleed said. "It drove me into a frenzy. I ran over to coach and 
begged him to put me back in." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dolphins got the ball back, Gleed returned. He went 94 yards on the 
first play. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one guy right in front of me and he had the angle," Gleed said. "I 
just turned it on. I felt his hands slide all the way down my back. I kneeled 
in the end zone and prayed. It was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins won, 54-13. The last run pushed Gleed past La Quinta's Rick 
Curry, who gained 326 yards in a 1971 game. Gleed's six touchdowns are also a 
county single-game record that he now shares with five others. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed was named high school player of the week by a Los Angeles television 
station and was awarded the trophy live on TV. He met O.J. Simpson, through his 
girlfriend, who was Nicole Brown's sister. He even spent a weekend at Simpson's 
home in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Heady stuff for a kid who had gained only 465 yards in the eight previous 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never let it go to my head," Gleed said. "I was never into that macho stuff 
anyway. But now colleges were sending me letters, wanting to take a look at me. 
People knew who I was. I had the best-looking girlfriends. Everything came in a 
rush." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't ebb, not right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed gained 1,113 yards as a senior. Dana Hills won its first four games, 
then collapsed, finishing 4-6. Still, Gleed had the offers, but he didn't have 
the grades. 
</P>
<P>
 He played two seasons at Saddleback. In 1982, he led the Gauchos in rushing 
with 576 yards while sharing the tailback spot with Robert Currie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a saying, 'Robert Currie runs in a hurry and Jim Gleed runs with 
speed,' " Gaucho assistant coach Don Butcher said. "He was fast." 
</P>
<P>
 But he wasn't wanted, not anymore. Gleed had to persuade a school to take him. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked on at San Luis Obispo. Gleed said he told Coach Jim Sanderson that 
he would try out. If Sanderson liked him, he would give him a scholarship. If 
he didn't, Gleed wouldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I told him I was going to be his starting tailback," Gleed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed played at San Luis Obispo in 1985-86. As junior, he gained 234 yards in 
a 34-28 victory over North Dakota State, which won the Division II championship 
that year. Gleed finished the season with 814 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, Gleed gained 591 yards and scored three touchdowns. He was 
first-team All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. for the second consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a few pro teams come in and time me," Gleed said. "I was invited to 
some tryouts, but I couldn't do it. I had to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gleed, his father, lost a bundle in the 1987 stock market crash. Gleed 
had to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 He started selling cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed stays up on Orange County high school football. One category in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Droughns kid nearly got me last year," Gleed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben Droughns, Anaheim's junior running back, gained 361 yards against El 
Monte Arroyo last season. He was the latest to get within eyesight of Gleed's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen players have run for better than 300 yards since Gleed set the record, 
but like that night, no one can catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed's life has meandered since he stopped playing football. He was a social 
science and business organization major at San Luis Obispo. But Gleed said he 
could not afford to do the research to complete the 50-page thesis needed to 
receive his degree. 
</P>
<P>
 His only income was from car sales from a small dealership. He would get 
between $50 to $500 per sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was moving six or seven cars a month, which is nothing in the business," 
Gleed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleed went into mortgage banking with his brother in Rhode Island, but the 
bottom fell out of the market after two years. He returned to California in 
1990 and went back to selling cars. 
</P>
<P>
 He married three years ago. He is separated from his wife but hopes for a 
reconciliation. They have a 2-year-old daughter, Jordan, whom Gleed beams 
about.  
</P>
<P>
 Gleed runs each day, often to the Saddleback College football field, which is 
near his residence. He'll stop at the football field, watch practice and 
remember. Then he heads home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't complain," Gleed said. "I got to play college football. How many 
people can say that? I thank God for giving me the chance. But if I had to do 
it all over again, I'd take it more serious. I'd kill to be able to put the 
pads on and play one more game." Grinding It Out 
</P>
<P>
 The top one-game high school rushing performances in Orange County history: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Jim Gleed (Dana Hills), 1979, 418 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Reuben Droughns (Anaheim), 1993, 361 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Mike Miscione (Esperanza), 1986, 348 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Dana Riddle (Rancho Alamitos), 1989, 344 yards.

MEDIATOR USERY TO ENTER BASEBALL NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>

 Baseball's owners and players have agreed to a request by Secretary of Labor 
Robert Reich that they return to the bargaining table next week with William J. 
Usery, a former labor secretary under Gerald Ford and former director of the 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, acting as special mediator. Reich 
is expected to introduce Usery at a White House news conference this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner, refused to comment Thursday, and 
Donald Fehr, executive director of the striking players' union, could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said, "It has been clear 
for a while that the Administration, as well it should, has a keen and ongoing 
interest in seeing that this disagreement is resolved, but that's all I can say 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration source said that Reich has been in contact with both sides 
for several weeks and believed this was an appropriate time for the highly 
regarded Usery to enter the stalemate. There have been only three negotiating 
sessions since the strike began Aug. 12 and none since Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Usery, 70, who operates a Washington consulting firm that specializes in 
mediating labor disputes, had no comment when reached at his home in Arlington, 
Va. He has been one of the country's foremost mediators for a generation, 
working to resolve major labor disputes that range from a threatened rail 
shutdown in 1969 to the bitter coal strike of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He is particularly known for helping to work out arrangements that allow 
management and labor to cooperate in industries, from railroads and airlines to 
coal mines and auto factories, with a history of bitter relationships, such as 
those in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, for example, Usery helped arrange the contract between Toyota, 
General Motors and the United Auto Workers that allowed the peaceful opening of 
the new United Motors plant in Fremont, Calif. The deal evolved amid union 
fears that the Japanese company would try to open the plant as a non-union 
operation and has served as a model for cooperative efforts between management 
and labor elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Usery began his career with the Machinists Union in the 1940s and eventually 
became that union's pick to coordinate operations at NASA's Cape Canaveral, 
Fla., launch site. His work there brought him to the attention of President 
Kennedy, who appointed him to work on labor relations at government missile 
facilities, which ultimately led to his appointment as the chief labor 
trouble-shooter under Presidents Nixon and Ford. He was labor secretary in the 
last year of the Ford Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The current work stoppage is baseball's eighth since 1972 and has already 
foiled representatives of the mediation and conciliation service. Owners have 
not deviated from a salary-cap proposal that the union believes they intend to 
implement unilaterally in an attempt to break the union, destroy free agency 
and put an artificial ceiling on salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been back-channel talks between some owners and the union regarding 
various tax concepts but no indication of progress, and the sides seem headed 
for another dispute regarding the issue of service time during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has advised 14 players who need varying amounts of time lost during 
the strike to qualify for free agency -- including Jack McDowell, Jim Abbott 
and the Dodgers' Chris Gwynn, who needs only one day -- to go ahead and file. 
The union insists that service time continued to build because the clubs 
maintained active rosters. A management lawyer disputed that interpretation and 
said the owners would file grievances if the 14 players tried to file.

COMMENTARY; TRACK STILL WEARING BLINKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On opening day of the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita, a regular customer was 
complaining to a waiter in the upper reaches of the track's new Baldwin Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this it?" he said. "You've enclosed it with glass, and given me an 
air-conditioner with a constant hum that's giving me a headache." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do," the waiter said, "is turn down my hearing aid." 
</P>
<P>
 Some still-irate fans have been saying they were also given deaf ears the same 
day, after complaining about a horse that was erroneously excluded from the 
betting eight minutes before post time, then reinstated 2 1/2 minutes later and 
won the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Horse Racing Board, acting with uncommon swiftness, has 
reviewed the situation and exonerated everyone but the poor guy who hit the 
wrong key in the control room. Oak Tree officials have sympathized with the 
victimized bettors, but say they can do nothing, because it's impossible to 
determine which ones didn't bet the winner because of the mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita is hoping that the controversy will go away. It will, right along 
with a few more fans from racing's already badly eroded fan base. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were Santa Anita, I would do something -- anything to show the 
disgruntled fans that I was paying attention. Offer free admission to the 
grandstand on another Wednesday, in honor of the scratch that wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's too costly, ask Autotote to spring for a T-shirt giveaway. Make the 
message on the shirts light. All the world loves somebody who can laugh at 
himself. This wording isn't that good or original, but it's a start: "I 
Survived the Fifth Race on Oct. 5, 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an Autotote employee who hit the wrong tote-board button last week. 
These are the same people who gave Santa Anita that opening day from hell on 
the day after Christmas in 1992, when tote problems cost the track an estimated 
$5 million in betting. But the buck stops at the track's door, and Santa 
Anita's mea culpa that time, a limited free-admission offer for a future racing 
day, was hollow and short of the mark. It irritated more fans than it 
mollified. 
</P>
<P>
 This offhand regard for customers has become more and more the case for a 
track that once was a pillar of American racing. Maybe Cliff Goodrich, Santa 
Anita's president, didn't really want to say, "If they don't like what they 
see, they don't have to come," in an interview with the Daily Racing Form a 
couple of years ago, but Santa Anita needs to work overtime to dispel the 
quotation that won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that long ago that Santa Anita was dragged kicking and screaming 
into offering the $2 exacta after inexplicably saying for years that the $5 
exacta was better for its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita has belatedly beefed up the number of television monitors in the 
plant, but other big things and a number of little things still need tending. 
The big things include the absence of an expanded daily program that many major 
tracks, including Hollywood Park, offer fans. The program includes past 
performances and, although not as complete, is less intimidating for newcomers 
than the complicated Racing Form. All those people, content with the expanded 
program and not buying the Form at the other tracks, can't be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tote board, Santa Anita continues to time races by hundredths instead 
of fifths. Students of time -- and they know who they are -- are enamored of 
hundredths, but again new fans who have advanced to reading the Racing Form see 
the times in fifths there. Can't the tote board, like Belmont Park's, satisfy 
both factions? 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, a track regular who had left his cigars at home couldn't buy 
any at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, you can still smoke them, but now you can't buy them," he said. "I was 
told that the front office finds them smelly, and didn't want them on sale 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 My pet peeve is iced tea in the dining room. There are no free refills. Is 
there a dining room in town that charges for tea refills, especially one that 
wants your betting money every half-hour? When I complained, I was told to buy 
the carafe instead of the glass. One day my tea bill was almost more than my 
meal. And don't get me started about the one-time policy of charging for small 
packages of soda crackers at the concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the Santa Anita way is the racing way in too many places, and even 
England can be difficult. At the quaint Chester track in Northwest England this 
year, a woman at the owners' will-call window insisted that an 8-year-old girl 
would need a paid ticket because no pass had been left. The same woman wasn't 
going to give me my tickets because the first name on my passport didn't jibe 
with the first name on the envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Thursday, I took a call from a colleague in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think it's time for a column about Keeneland not having a track 
announcer?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I told her. And the time for Keeneland hiring an announcer was at least 
50 years ago.

CHRISTIE GOES TO KNICKS; PRO BASKETBALL: LAKERS GET TWO SECOND-ROUND PICKS FOR 
FORMER PEPPERDINE STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Doug Christie the point guard, Doug Christie the small forward, Doug Christie 
the shooting guard became Doug Christie the New York Knick here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers got second-round draft picks in 1997 and '98 for the versatile, 
athletic swingman, who changes coasts and conferences but isn't able to dodge 
problems. He still will be recovering from August ankle surgery when he reports 
to New York early next week and will probably start the season on the injured 
list and will be fighting for minutes, either with all-star John Starks at 
shooting guard or Charles Smith and Anthony Mason at small forward. 
</P>
<P>
 So ends a Laker career that never really got started. The former Pepperdine 
star came from Seattle along with Benoit Benjamin in a trade for Sam Perkins on 
Feb. 22, 1993, in the midst of a nasty rookie contract holdout. He signed and 
then played 23 games between March 12 and the end of the season. That summer he 
was moved from point guard to small forward, only to sit out most of camp a 
year ago because of a badly sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to action early in the season and went into the starting lineup, 
then was sidelined because of another sprained ankle in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie George Lynch took advantage of that opportunity and played so well that 
Christie was soon playing shooting guard. He finished last season there, 
getting 65 appearances in all. Then came the surgery to remove calcium deposits 
and a third consecutive year with little or no training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think frustration is the word I would use," Christie said. "It would 
have been a nice situation for me, being that I went to school in L.A. Now I'm 
with a team that has a real legitimate shot to win a championship, and 
basketball is about winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when I was healthy, I was playing fantastic basketball. Then I got 
hurt (in January) and lost some confidence, and it was tough really." 
</P>
<P>
 That lost confidence -- and lost time -- meant he was trying to play catch-up 
in a very competitive situation with Anthony Peeler, Eddie Jones, Tony Smith 
and Sedale Threatt at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a situation where we had too many guards and it came down to a numbers 
game," said Christie, who agreed to alter his 1994-95 salary by about $100,000 
to get the deal done. That money will be returned in later years of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't in camp to be able to defend myself, if you want to look at it in 
those terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jerry West, the Lakers' executive vice president: "At the time we traded 
for him, we had a much greater need than we do today." 
</P>
<P>
 Christie has potential, but he became the odd man out because he proved too 
erratic on offense, frustrating the Lakers by trying to make the highlight-reel 
move instead of the high-percentage play. The arrival of Cedric Ceballos and 
the continued solid contributions from Lynch meant he couldn't go back to small 
forward, and the play of Peeler and Jones quickly turned that into a two-man 
race for the starting job. So, barring significant improvement after last 
season, Christie would have been third string at best at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Several teams, among them Utah and Atlanta, talked with the Lakers about 
getting Christie, 24, but interest was tough to turn into reality because 
suitors had to be able to take his 1994-95 contract of about $1.35 million and 
send only a $190,000 player in return because of a salary-cap technicality. 
That meant the exchange would have to involve draft picks.

FOR KINGS AND DUCKS, NO LOCKOUT ON BONUSES, 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN and ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Even if the NHL season is canceled, the Kings and the Mighty Ducks will still 
be responsible for paying more than $6.5 million in player signing bonuses this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that will be paid to superstar Wayne Gretzky of the Kings and rookie 
Paul Kariya of the Ducks. Gretzky is down for a signing bonus of $4.531 million 
this season, according to NHLPA compensation documents. But those knowledgeable 
about Gretzky's contract say the Kings are obligated to pay only about $2 
million, the balance payable at the end of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, who has yet to play in a regular-season NHL game, has already been 
paid $1 million and will receive the final $1.25-million payment for this 
season in July. At risk for Kariya during the lockout is his $575,000 annual 
base salary, which is not even the highest on the Ducks. Gretzky's base 
compensation is $2 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya's Winnipeg-based agent, Don Baizley, negotiated a deal that guaranteed 
$2.25 million of the $2.8 million he expected to make this season, even if the 
whole schedule is wiped out. Kariya signed a three-year, $6.5-million deal on 
Aug. 31 that included a $4.775-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Baizley's clients, King forward Jari Kurri, has a signing bonus of 
$750,000, but it is deferred with interest and does not figure into the 
approximate figure of $3.1 million the Kings will pay out in signing bonuses 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kariya, Baizley said one reason for the large signing bonus was that it 
allowed the base salary to "fit" with other entry-level salaries -- a major 
concern for the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "By (late August), we knew there was a possibility (of a lockout), but that 
was not the intent of the signing bonuses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira said Baizley "argued that we were paying a 
price for his amateur rights, and that's what the signing bonus is. Now, when 
we negotiate the next contract, we can start at the base ($575,000) -- but when 
we get to that point he'll probably argue we should consider total 
compensation." 
</P>
<P>
 Another prominent agent, however, said the possibility of a lockout definitely 
influenced negotiating tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL addressed the subject of paying signing bonuses in a supposedly 
confidential memo, which was widely circulated among the media, saying that 
teams should continue to pay bonus installments after Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other Ducks receiving significant signing bonuses is rookie Oleg 
Tverdovsky, who was picked second overall at the NHL draft in June. He signed a 
three-year, $4.2-million deal that includes a $2.5-million signing bonus. He 
has received an installment of $500,000 and is due another $500,000 in early 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's other high-profile rookie, Valeri Karpov, received $225,000 to sign 
in July -- but like Kariya and Tverdovsky, he has yet to play an NHL game. In 
all, the Ducks will pay about $3.5 million in signing bonuses to their three 
young prospects -- a sizable chunk of their roughly $12.5-million payroll -- no 
matter how many NHL games are played this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other Kings receiving six-figure signing bonuses this season are 
defenseman Marty McSorley, $500,000; rookie goaltender Jamie Storr, $200,000; 
rookie forward Matt Johnson, $100,000 and rookie forward Kevin Brown, $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley is listed as receiving a base salary of $800,000 and a $1-million 
signing bonus, according to compensation documents. But $500,000 of the signing 
bonus is deferred with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Storr's signing bonus this season of $200,000 is payable in two installments, 
one that was made at the scheduled start of the season and the other to be paid 
in January.

MILLS' MIRACLE; WHEN HE WON THE 10,000 AT TOKYO 30 YEARS AGO TODAY, IT MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST UPSET OF ALL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years ago today at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, arguably the best of 
all American sports stories sprang from the gallant heart of a Camp Pendleton 
Marine lieutenant named Billy Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, it's not arguable.  
</P>
<P>
 You need to understand where I'm coming from on this. I've been writing 
newspaper sports stories for 32 years, back then at the Oceanside 
Blade-Tribune, the home paper for Camp Pendleton events. But nothing in all 
those years shocked me the way this one did. When reports of Mills' victory 
went around the world that day, an old city editor told me the news. I thought, 
"It's got to be some kind of typo. Or maybe it's a Billy Mills from England or 
someplace." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1964, I had covered several Pendleton dual meets. Not once 
had I had reason to interview Mills. He never won a race. He wasn't close to 
being the best performer on the Camp Pendleton track team, much less the best 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as I said, 30 years later, it's still the best of all sports stories.  
</P>
<P>
 Some contenders: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bob Mathias' decathlon victory at the 1948 Olympics, when he was 17. Two 
months before those London Olympics, Mathias had not only never competed in a 
decathlon, he had never competed in six of the 10 events. Four months before 
London, he had never seen a javelin.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1990 Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas fight. Only two days before, when 
Douglas, a 48-1 shot, said at a Tokyo news conference that the heavyweight 
championship was about to change hands, U.S. reporters in the back row smirked 
and giggled. I know. I was a smirker.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1969 New York Mets. They were a joke, too, until they won the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 But for me, it's still Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in Mills' year, 1964, the Associated Press polled sports editors on the 
year's top upset. Mills won, beating out USC's 20-17 victory over No. 1 Notre 
Dame and Muhammad Ali's upset of Sonny Liston.  
</P>
<P>
 The story of Mills, a seven-sixteenths Sioux, now as well as then, seems not 
improbable but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before he won the gold medal, Mills had run five 10,000-meter races. He had 
won none, and in two failed to break half an hour.  
</P>
<P>
 -- In the entire pre-Olympic track season in 1964, he didn't win a race of any 
kind. In Camp Pendleton dual meets, Mills was a Saturday also-ran in mile and 
two-mile races. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before the Tokyo Olympics, Track & Field News had a panel of six experts 
handicap each event. Not one picked Mills to finish in the top six in the 
10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Immediately after the race, favored Ron Clarke of Australia, who finished 
third, was asked if he had worried about Mills beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Worried about him?" he snapped. "I never heard of him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- After the race, a confused Japanese race official ran up to Mills and said, 
"Excuse me, but what is your name?" 
</P>
<P>
 The more Americans learned about Billy Mills, the more they liked his story. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, he lived in a world of alcoholism and despair on a Sioux 
reservation in Pine Ridge, S.D. Orphaned at 13, Mills was shipped off to a 
Kansas Indian school, Haskell Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a long distance runner, won some high school races, and was awarded 
a track scholarship to the University of Kansas. His collegiate career was 
largely undistinguished, but he did win the Big Eight mile and two-mile 
championships one year.  
</P>
<P>
 He married a KU student, Pat Harris, and quit running. But she talked him into 
resuming his track career in 1963. He enlisted in the Marines, eventually 
becoming a motor pool officer at Camp Pendleton.  
</P>
<P>
 There, under 70-year-old Coach Earl Thomson, Mills joined a talented Pendleton 
track team, one that competed in dual meets against the likes of USC and 
Arizona State.  
</P>
<P>
 "What a lot of people didn't know then was that in early '64, I was doing a 
lot of marathon work in the hills on the base, with a marathoner, Alex 
Breckenridge," Mills said. "We'd do 20- and 25-mile runs, up and down hills. I 
was really building up my body for the '64 Olympic trials." 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew, of course, because no one had reason to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew all along that I had enough speed to win a gold medal at an Olympic 
distance race," he said. "I felt all along if I could just stay with the 
leaders in a race, I could beat anybody on the last lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been saying this for 30 years and no one's believed me yet, but I went 
to Tokyo that year fully confident I could win, if I was close to the leaders 
at the finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Many were surprised at the 1964 Olympic trials that the virtually unknown 
Mills made the team in the 10,000, as well as the marathon. Yet even at the 
trials, he was overshadowed.  
</P>
<P>
 The track hero that summer was a 5-foot-5 teen-ager, Gerry Lindgren, who had 
upset two veteran Soviet Union runners earlier at a USA-USSR meet at the 
Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 Mills was a distant second to Lindgren at the trials 10,000, and quietly made 
the Olympic team. For that, he got his first headline in the Oceanside 
Blade-Tribune. Then he packed his bag for Tokyo. He also borrowed money from 
friends for a ticket for Pat, so confident was he that he would win.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, Clarke was the greatest long distance runner in the world. A 
contender was Tunisian Mohamed Gammoudi. Lindgren's stock slipped -- he would 
finish ninth -- when he turned an ankle in training in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Until two laps remained in the 25-lap race, the leaders were Clarke, Mamo 
Wolde of Ethiopia and Murray Halberg of New Zealand, with Mills in the hunt. 
Then Wolde and Japan's Kokichi Tsuburaya lost contact.  
</P>
<P>
 Clarke looked like a cinch. When they rang a bell to start the last lap, 
Clarke and Mills were together, Gammoudi right behind.  
</P>
<P>
 Then came one of the most amazing final laps in Olympic history. Clarke, 
trying to wend his way through lapped stragglers in gathering darkness, 
literally shoved Mills off the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills ran back into contention, but by then Gammoudi had a 10-yard lead. At 
the head of the stretch, Clarke finally caught Gammoudi, and the 75,000 in 
Olympic Stadium rose, expecting to see Clarke and Gammoudi run for the tape.  
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Mills, just behind the leaders, was no worse than a bronze 
medalist. Even at that, they probably would have had a parade for him at Camp 
Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mills wanted to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
 He burst out of another group of stragglers with a devastating sprint and blew 
past Clarke and Gammoudi, beating the Tunisian by three yards. He crossed the 
tape with arms raised, an expression of rapture on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the first and last time an American has won the Olympic 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That Wednesday morning in Oceanside, Oct. 14, 1964, the city editor tore copy 
off an old AP news printer, and said, "Your guy Mills won the race." 
</P>
<P>
 To which I replied, "Yeah, right." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it possible? The same Billy Mills who five months before was battling for 
third place in Camp Pendleton dual meets? 
</P>
<P>
 The same. Not only that, his Olympic-record time, 28 minutes 24.4 seconds, 
topped his previous best by 46 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, he speaks frequently to Native American youth groups, imparting themes 
of confidence and goal-setting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in a no-philosophy world," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one I knew had goals, or a reason to live. Life was day to day. Kids in an 
environment like that, they don't know an opportunity when they see one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often talk about Ron Clarke as an example of goal-setting. Clarke wanted 
that gold medal as bad as I did. He ran 120 miles a week for years too. He 
failed. But he didn't lose the goal. I assumed he would retire after Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I asked him after our race what his goals were, he said: 'I'm going 
to start all over again and the next time we race, Billy, you'd better be 
ready.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we raced five more times and he beat me every time. He went to Europe 
after the Olympics that summer and broke 12 world records in six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 If all this sounds like a movie, it was. "Running Brave," with Robbie Benson 
as Mills, came out in 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Pat and Billy Mills live in Fair Oaks, near Sacramento. They have three 
grown daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, who owns an insurance agency, says that when reporters come around on 
the 50th anniversary of his gold-medal race, he still won't be conceding it was 
the upset everyone else makes it out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's never been an upset," he said. "I got myself in great shape, I 
went over there to win the race, and I did it."

MIKE DOWNEY: CARDMANIA WON'T FOLD YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The very small man hoses off the very tall horse, then squeegees away the 
excess water with a stiff brush. In almost blinding midmorning brightness, the 
horse's coat glistens. He is young and frisky. He is fit as a filly and ready 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, let's go see Card now," Derek Meredith says, and steers a visitor 
toward the hay-strewn stalls that he and his wife must muck themselves, not 
having much help. Their stable is small. Helen handles the exercise riding. 
Derek does the training. And one of their horses will be running Saturday at 
Santa Anita for the first time in nine months, but he is not so young, not so 
fit. He is quite old, in fact, and held together by nuts and bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perking up at the sight of company, Cardmania raises his head and the two men 
duck underneath, stepping inside the cramped stall. "Here," Derek says, 
kneeling in the straw, gingerly rubbing the horse's fetlocks. "See right here, 
this side of his foot? 
</P>
<P>
 "Titanium screws." 
</P>
<P>
 Later on, he even produces the X-rays. Like an athlete whose luck ran out, 
Cardmania has been on the disabled list. He broke a hind cannon bone during a 
workout, only a couple of months after winning the Breeders' Cup Sprint race in 
a thrilling photo finish last November. That could have been the end of him, 
would have been the end of many a horse. Not old Card, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Here he stands, a gelding of 8, entitled to a nice life in some pasture. Helen 
Meredith volunteers for an organization called the Pegasus Foundation, which 
finds homes for aging thoroughbreds who might otherwise be put to sleep. She 
keeps some in her own backyard in El Monte. For a while, during his recovery 
period, old Cardmania himself was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Breeders' Cup champion. An Eclipse Award winner," Derek marvels, shaking 
his head at the memory. "Out back with a bunch of cripples." 
</P>
<P>
 His best runner. His bread-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Claim to fame," Meredith agrees, laughing. "Pays the mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
 But right around his 44th birthday, which was Valentine's Day, Derek nearly 
got his heart broken. As it was, his stable was fairly unoccupied. He laid off 
grooms, keeping only one to reduce costs. Cardmania, having just been voted 
racing's best sprinter for 1993, was not attracting the kind of interest an 
Eclipse winner should draw. Paying clients weren't dropping by. And then his 
meal ticket, old Card, came back limping one February morning at Hollywood 
Park, where the Meredith stable is based. This was the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardmania had caught Meafara at the wire in the Cup run. Then he went out in 
January and won the San Carlos Handicap. Finally, Meredith had himself a 
superhorse. Old or not, Cardmania was in peak racing form. Derek circled a date 
on his calendar -- March 5 and the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap. The horse's 
owner, Jean Couvercelle, a Frenchman, would be so pleased if Card could bring 
home that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Helen Meredith, who speaks French, had to telephone overseas to give 
the owner the bad news. Cardmania was injured, perhaps finished. He would be 
taken to Alamo Pintado in Santa Ynez to have twin screws inserted, then need 
months of total rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek picks a pack of smokes from a desktop, lights one and says, "You know, 
you learn in racing to take the good with the bad. But this, this was truly 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 His frustration grew. Even his Eclipse Award never came in the mail. For five 
years in his native England, Meredith had been a jockey as well as an amateur 
boxer, fighting more than 300 bouts. Then he moved to the United States in 
1980, became reacquainted with a Scotswoman whom he had met 17 years before, 
married her, set up shop and waited for that one wonderful horse to come along. 
It did. 
</P>
<P>
 So many spectators at California tracks had taken a shine to the old gelding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Card's such a character," Meredith says. "When you want him to work, he 
won't. If you give him a day off, he wants to run. He makes his own schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Derek consults his schedule to see when Cardmania actually began running 
again. In late June, they went for a walk together. On the morning of Aug. 3, 
the screws got their first good test at a gallop. Little by little, the horse 
has improved. He knocked off five-eighths of mile last week in a minute, maybe 
even a fraction under. Derek thought his old horse looked happy. 
</P>
<P>
 But practice is practice. To see how Cardmania responds in a real race, 
Meredith will enter him in something called the Ancient Title Breeders' Cup 
Handicap for 3-year-olds and up at Santa Anita on Saturday. Card is rusty and 
probably won't win. But if he shows flashes of old form, Meredith will ship him 
to Kentucky for the next Breeders' Cup come November, crossing his fingers for 
a rerun of the 1993 race. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-olds don't win many big races. Eight-year-olds rarely run in big 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, see, there's the difference right there," Meredith says. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference? 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't know he's 8," Derek says, scratching behind Card's ears 
affectionately. "Shhh. Don't tell him."

U.S., MEXICO AGREE TO PLAY IN SOCCER'S COPA AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The national soccer teams of the United States and Mexico have agreed to 
compete in the Copa America, or South American Championship, next June in 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Warner, president of CONCACAF, told South American Football Confederation 
leaders on Thursday in Asuncion, Paraguay, that the countries had accepted 
their invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams played in the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador, where the U.S. team was 
eliminated in the first round. Mexico advanced to the championship game but 
lost to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament will also feature Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, 
Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 The draw to divide the teams for first-round play will be held Dec. 9 in Punta 
del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a patchwork U.S. team leaves Saturday for Saudi Arabia, where it 
will play the host nation in Dhahran on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to get the release of most of his Europe-based stars, U.S. Coach Bora 
Milutinovic has called on some pre-World Cup veterans and also has included two 
surprise newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Named to the U.S. roster for the first time Thursday were defender Gregg 
Berhalter, 21, of Tenafly, N.J., and 17-year-old Maurice Ligeon of Chesapeake, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Berhalter was captain of the U.S. under-20 team that competed in the 1993 
World Youth Championship in Australia. He left the University of North Carolina 
this year to sign with FC Zwolle in the Dutch second division. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-born Ligeon is a defender on the youth team of Club Brugge in the 
Belgian first division. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the veterans recalled to the U.S. national team for the one-game trip 
are defender John Doyle and midfielders Janus Michallick and Chad Deering. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report on "Futbol de Primera," a national Spanish-language 
radio soccer show, Milutinovic has signed a new 3 1/2-year contract to remain 
as U.S. national coach through the 1998 World Cup in France. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg Thursday said the 
report was "premature." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not quite accurate," Rothenberg said. "Bora and I have had a couple of 
very, very good meetings and, as I've said, I want him back, I expect him to be 
back, I'm optimistic he'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negotiations are moving very positively but they're not done yet."

ST. LOUIS' OFFER MIGHT NOT BE RICH ENOUGH; FOOTBALL: OFFICIALS SPEARHEADING 
CAMPAIGN TO ATTRACT FRANCHISE SAY THERE ARE STILL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CITY'S 
PROPOSALS AND TEAM'S DESIRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 St. Louis is offering the Rams virtually all revenue from a new $258-million, 
70,000-seat domed stadium, plus a new practice facility and millions of dollars 
in other incentives to move to Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it enough for the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 That question arose Thursday when Thomas Eagleton, a former U.S. Senator who 
is leading the city's bid to land an NFL team, said at a St. Louis news 
conference that "many, many differences" between the city's proposal and the 
Rams' wish list surfaced during Wednesday's 4 1/2-hour meeting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did by no means agree to their entire wish list," Eagleton said. "Quite 
the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 The major items on the Rams' list are payments of $30 million the team still 
owes for Anaheim Stadium improvements, $15 million to cover anticipated NFL 
relocation fees and a practice facility with an estimated cost of $15 million. 
The team is also considering offers from Baltimore and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton outlined for the Rams plans to institute a permanent seat-licensing 
program, in which fans pay a one-time fee for the right to purchase season 
tickets, as a way to generate $60 million or more to cover such costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw declined comment on the negotiations, and St. Louis 
officials would not discuss specific details, but it's apparent there is some 
distance between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are differences, and the major difference can be summarized in one word 
-- money," St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. said. "Negotiations will go on, 
but we all have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton, however, said the differences are "surmountable." But he also said 
Shaw was concerned about fan support in St. Louis, where dwindling attendance 
and lack of a modern, football-only stadium induced owner Bill Bidwill to move 
the Cardinals from St. Louis to Phoenix after the 1987 season. The city began 
construction of its new downtown stadium last year without an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was one facet that worried me more than anything else was that Shaw 
more than once questioned whether St. Louis is an intense football town," 
Eagleton said. "He said he thought Baltimore had a greater zealousness among 
fans. That was the one macro issue that worried us." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Kerth, who works for the Fleishman-Hillard public relations firm in St. 
Louis and took part in Wednesday's meeting with the Rams, said city officials 
are confident that a credible football team will receive strong support in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that around the country, St. Louis is burdened by the question, 
'Are we a football town?' " Kerth said in a phone interview. "Everyone knows 
we're a great baseball town, a great hockey town, and we understand that. But 
we don't have a great concern about it because we know our market here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton said he expects to make another trip to Los Angeles as negotiations 
continue in the next few weeks, but he and political officials at the news 
conference, including House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), said 
remaining negotiations will be done behind closed doors, and not in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams don't want it public," St. Louis County Executive George (Buzz) 
Westfall said. "And if we show our poker hand to other players at the table, 
they'll know exactly what to bid."

FINALLY A RAIDER, HE JUST WANTS THE BALL; PRO FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK HARVEY 
WILLIAMS SAYS HE IS EAGER TO DISPLAY HIS TALENT AND SHED PERPETUAL POTENTIAL 
LABEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams has it. That's what people have said all his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams will fulfill it. That's what people promised when he arrived 
in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams will never realize it. That's what they said when he left. 
</P>
<P>
 He will fulfill it. That's what people promised when he arrived here in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He will never realize it. That's what they said when the Raider running game 
disappeared at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 And what does Harvey Williams say? You want to see potential? Give me the 
ball!  
</P>
<P>
 Williams had the ball at Hempstead High in Texas, where he rushed for 5,883 
yards and scored 70 touchdowns, eclipsing marks set by Eric Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had the ball at Louisiana State, where he ran for 953 yards and seven 
touchdowns as a senior and had 213 yards rushing in a game against Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, his potential was a blessing. It enabled him to become an NFL 
first-round draft choice of the Kansas City Chiefs in 1991, the 21st pick 
overall. But Williams had to wait his turn. Ahead of him were Barry Word and 
Christian Okoye. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wasn't worried. He had plenty of time. And all that potential. 
</P>
<P>
 He played enough in his rookie season to gain 447 yards in 97 carries and 
average 4.6 yards a carry. He rushed for 103 yards against the Buffalo Bills, 
the only 100-yard effort of his professional career. But, in what would prove 
to be the pattern in his years in Kansas City, Williams was even overshadowed 
that day. Okoye ran for 122 yards in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' totals dropped his second year, down to 78 carries for 262 yards and 
a 3.4 average. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993, however, Word and Okoye were gone. Finally, Williams would get the 
chance to realize that potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 In the off-season, the Chiefs signed Marcus Allen, who, free of his troubles 
with the Raiders, had a brilliant season, scoring 15 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 And Williams? Not activated for eight of Kansas City's last nine games, he 
finished with his poorest season statistically, gaining only 149 yards in 42 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the options facing Coach Marty Schottenheimer, his choices 
concerning his running backs appear understandable, but not to Williams, who 
sees it purely in political terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had proven myself and it was just something personal," he said. 
"I don't know what it was. I'm just glad I'm out of that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer has always denied politics were involved, but Williams didn't 
see much value in discussing it with the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the use of talking if you're not going to do anything about it?" he 
said. "I feel like I'm a talented running back. I was taken in the first round. 
I could see (not playing) if I was given the ball 20 to 25 times a game, or 
even 15 times a game, and wasn't putting up the numbers. But every time I was 
out there, I was making big plays and winning games. That's all I could do. But 
now Marty Schottenheimer is a thing of the past. I don't dwell on it like I 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the record, Kansas City people complained about the lack of consistency 
from Williams. Because the Chiefs went to other backs in goal-line situations, 
Williams wound up running for only two touchdowns in his three years with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of last season, with a year still remaining on his contract, he was 
released. The day before the draft, he agreed to a one-year, $250,000 deal with 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Owner) Al Davis and (Coach) Art Shell didn't promise me anything," Williams 
said. "I just wanted to come here and work. I'd have come here and played for 
free, just to put that silver and black on. God has blessed me and put me on a 
team I've wanted to play for from Day 1. It's a dream come true for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dream he has had since he was 6 and playing youth football for a team 
called the Raiders. He still has a picture of himself as a kid in silver and 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 He figured he would immediately fit into the Raider picture this year because 
they had struggled on the ground last season after Greg Robinson went to the 
sidelines in December with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders stuck to their philosophy of making newcomers earn their 
places. Ty Montgomery, the starting tailback at the end of last season, remains 
in that spot even though Williams has moved into the team lead with 155 yards 
rushing in 50 carries. He ran for 65 yards Sunday against the New England 
Patriots, the highest individual total of the season for the Raiders. But he's 
still averaging only 10 carries a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for any running back to get a rhythm when you're not getting the 
ball that much," Williams said. "Some games we got behind and we couldn't run 
the ball. Things like that happen. Like I told Tyrone, 'When you get out there, 
try to make something happen.' That's all you can ask for and pray for. It 
doesn't bother me that I'm not starting. It doesn't bother me that I'm not 
getting as many carries as I would like. That's the game. When you do get out 
there, try to get the attention of the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people say I'm a bust, it really upsets me. When I've been given a true 
opportunity, then you can judge me. How can you judge a horse if you haven't 
ridden it? The more I get the ball, the stronger I get. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give me the ball 20, 25 times a game, you can't hold me down. I 
believe so much in my ability that no football team can keep me from making big 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, that remains under the heading of potential , a word with 
which Williams is all too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give Harvey Williams a chance," he insists, "and you can tap into that 
potential."

UNLV AND MASSIMINO GET CLOSER TO DEAL; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
EAGER TO SETTLE COACHING SITUATION BEFORE PRACTICE BEGINS SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Although Nevada Las Vegas officials say that a deal has not yet been cut to 
oust beleaguered basketball Coach Rollie Massimino, they indicated Thursday 
that progress has been made and that an agreement could be completed as early 
as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Jim Weaver acknowledged having met with Massimino briefly 
Thursday afternoon, but said they had not discussed the possible buyout of 
Massimino's lucrative and controversial contract. Weaver also said, however, 
that there had been movement on the issue since Wednesday's talks ended 
abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful, and I know Coach Massimino and (interim President Kenny Guinn) 
are hopeful that we can come to some kind of an agreement in the very near 
future," he said. "We all came to the conclusion on Monday that it was in the 
best interest of Coach Massimino, his family, the team and the university for 
him not to be the coach at UNLV this year, and that's what we're working on." 
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the deal by today would prevent Massimino's coaching the team 
during its opening practice Saturday, something Weaver would rather avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, that's one of my concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Grgurich, former Coach Jerry Tarkanian's top aide for 12 years at UNLV, is 
believed to be the leading coaching candidate. University officials said they 
have not been in touch with Grgurich, who is an assistant with the Seattle 
Supersonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinn and Weaver spent much of the day trying to quell rumors that the 
university and Massimino had agreed on a price to terminate the coach's 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually nothing has changed, other than the fact that we're not not 
talking," Guinn said. "We're still trying to work it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Guinn and Weaver seemed more upbeat about resolving the situation than they 
had after the meeting Wednesday in Weaver's office, which ended within a 
minute. Massimino quickly turned down what a source said was an offer of about 
$300,000 for five years for a total package of about $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino, though, appeared strained. When asked if he was still the coach he 
said, "Quite frankly, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 One stumbling block in the negotiations appears to be agreement on how much 
money is owed to Massimino. The longtime coach contends that a secret, 
supplemental contract he signed -- which adds $375,000 a year to his $511,000 
annual salary -- is valid. Guinn says it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyout offer is based only on the $511,000 figure. Guinn said he has made 
fund-raising attempts in the Las Vegas community to help with the proposed 
buyout, but has found no interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an outraged Nevada Board of Regents continued to criticize 
Massimino for turning down UNLV's offer. Lonnie Hammargren said he would 
support Guinn's firing of Massimino if an agreement can't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I would give him one year's salary and that's it," Hammargren 
said. "I think (the offer) is way too much. We're going to run him out of this 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 Many apparently share Hammargren's feelings. Weaver said that since 
speculation began Monday that Massimino was out, the university has been 
deluged with phone calls from boosters and fans requesting basketball season 
seats at the Thomas and Mack Center. The requests total almost $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had approximately 35 to 50 calls on Tuesday and 250 calls on Wednesday," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver said the possible financial windfall would not affect any decision 
regarding Massimino.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE; FULL SPEED AHEAD FOR LOS AMIGOS' TUATO; FOOTBALL: SENIOR 
QUARTERBACK AND SAFETY, WHO HAS BEEN SLOWED BY RIB INJURY, IS EAGER TO TEST HIS 
SKILLS TONIGHT AGAINST RANCHO ALAMITOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Amigos quarterback Ape Tuato isn't hard to miss, unless you're a defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato is a 6-foot 205-pound senior with a physique that belies his youth, but 
he is also fast and elusive. He can run or pass with equal effectiveness and he 
earned All-Southern Section Division VII honors at safety last season. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Ape (pronounced Ah-pay) Tuato is a big reason the Lobos (5-0, 1-0 
in league), ranked fifth in Orange County, are off to a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
 In tonight's showdown against Rancho Alamitos, with the Garden Grove League 
championship potentially at stake, Tuato will receive a lot of attention from 
the Vaqueros (3-2, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an outstanding quarterback," Rancho Alamitos Coach Doug Case said. "When 
you put the ball in his hands, you know he can either get it to someone or take 
care of business himself. Obviously, we're going to keep an eye on him." 
</P>
<P>
 But college recruiters haven't followed Tuato as closely. And that has Tuato's 
coach baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised there hasn't been greater interest," Los Amigos Coach Roger 
Takahashi said. "I've seen Ape mature, physically and mentally, over the past 
three years. He is very strong and athletic, and he's a strong-safety type who 
can play Division I." 
</P>
<P>
 But the lack of collegiate attention doesn't bother Tuato. In fact, it is one 
of the furthest things from his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great if you get all of the attention," Tuato said. "But right now, our 
goal is to win league and then do well in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato has performed well in limited action this season despite an injured rib 
cage. He has completed 33 of 63 passes (52%) for 647 yards and five touchdowns 
with two interceptions and averages six yards per rush (19 carries, 114 yards). 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi has been able to nurse Tuato's injury because the Lobos have beaten 
opponents by an average of 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rancho game will be the first time Ape will be able to go full bore both 
ways," Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tuato has been waiting for a big game since last fall. Although the Lobos 
finished 9-2 last season, Tuato was left with a bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost the two big games last season, and one loss cost us the league 
title," Tuato said. "But hopefully, we've learned from those mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos lost to league-champion Kennedy, 13-9, in Week 5, then were ousted 
in the first round of the Southern Section Division VII playoffs by Arroyo 
Grande, 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bittersweet season," said Takahashi, who was an assistant at Los 
Amigos last season. "The kids know we can build on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been proud of the team because they've been really focused all season. 
Now, the big game is finally here, so let's decide it. Let's play. The school's 
spirit is definitely up for this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi knows a lot about big games and top talent in this league. He was 
head coach at La Quinta when the Aztecs reached the Division VI final in 1989 
and he watched Bolsa Grande march to the Central Conference championship in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 That season, Takahashi had one of his finest quarterbacks, Derek Debbs, a 
second-team all-county selection by the Times. Debbs, 6-1, 180, passed for more 
than 2,000 yards and was the fifth-highest rated quarterback in the county 
after the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two of the quarterbacks rated higher than Debbs -- El Toro's Bret 
Johnson (UCLA, Michigan State) and Todd Marinovich (USC) -- earned scholarships 
to major universities, Debbs continued his playing career at Pacific 
University. Pacific, an NAIA school in Forest Grove, Ore., discontinued 
football in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Debbs didn't make it to the Division I level, Takahashi says Tuato 
can make it because of his defensive skills. Tuato's ability to play both sides 
of the ball makes the Lobos that much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team this year is comparable to the La Quinta team in '89," Takahashi 
said. "We have some good size up front and a good running back who is a 
breakaway threat in Greg Fausto. We just need to develop our offensive balance 
a little better to get to that next level." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Tuato reaching the next level, that may fall into place in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Case: "Ape is a great athlete. He's got the size, the speed, and he will 
lay the hit on you. I don't know what else universities are looking for other 
than that. But it's still early and I'm sure someone will be looking at him."

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Alamitos football player who was involved in an altercation with 
an assistant football coach this season has been expelled from school, 
according to David Hatton, assistant superintendent for the Los Alamitos School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Alamitos Unified School District board decided on the expulsion during 
a hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The player was arrested for assault with intent to do bodily harm, according 
to Bruce Klemme, a juvenile section detective with the Long Beach Police 
Department. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 22 in the Long Beach juvenile 
court, at which time the youth will be charged and enter a plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos assistant coach Steve Scully, who suffered numerous minor 
injuries after being punched in the face by the player during the Sept. 22 game 
against Carson, has returned to duty. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

BUCKEY IS DOING THE IMPRESSING NOW; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: AFTER BEING WOOED BY BILL 
WALSH'S AURA, STANFORD OFFENSIVE TACKLE BECOMES COMPLETE PACKAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Jan. 16, 1992, the day Bill Walsh was hired for the second time as 
Stanford's football coach, he took his predecessor, Dennis Green, aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the first thing I've got to do?" Walsh asked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to go to Bakersfield, and recruit Jeff Buckey," Green told him.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Buckey, a 6-foot-5, 285-pound Stanford offensive tackle considered by 
NFL scouts to be one of the best at his position in college football, recently 
recalled Walsh's first act as Stanford's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He could scarcely believe it, he said, when Walsh arrived at the front door of 
his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up as a 49ers' fan, I was a kid with a 49er cap on all the time," he 
said, referring to Walsh's 10-year, three-Super Bowl NFL coaching stint in San 
Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 "To see him actually in the living room of my house -- it was spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked a lot about a Stanford education, about his 49er teams, about how 
excited he was about being back at Stanford. I was really impressed with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh's visit went so well that Buckey soon committed to Stanford, which had 
to come as a blow to the man who had visited Buckey the previous weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Lou Holtz.  
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Holtz was the most motivating person I'd ever met," Buckey said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He started talking about the legends of Notre Dame football, about how great 
Notre Dame football was -- he had me so pumped up I was almost bouncing off the 
walls. If he'd pulled out a letter of intent that night, I'd have signed it. 
I'd be at Notre Dame right now." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Holtz got a dinner out of it, Buckey recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Holtz came alone that night, and my mom fixed a steak-and-potatoes 
dinner. When Coach Walsh came with two assistant coaches, they'd already eaten 
at a hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckey, whose team plays USC Saturday at Stanford, was almost as big a 
celebrity in Bakersfield as Walsh and Holtz.  
</P>
<P>
 At Bakersfield High, he was considered one of the nation's premier offensive 
line recruits. And with near straight-A report cards, everyone was in on this 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I considered a lot of places, but in the end I got it down to Stanford, UCLA 
and Notre Dame," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like Stanford was the best fit for me because at the time I was 
considering medicine as a career, and I liked the med school program. But after 
I got here, medicine began to fade -- 12 years of school started looking like a 
long time, and I began to think about playing in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 His Bakersfield coach, Pat Preston, said Buckey had the right stuff from Day 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school football, most kids Jeff's size are slow," he said. "But Jeff 
was running five-flat 40s the whole time he was here. And he was over 300 
pounds here too. Walsh had him trim down to 280.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very well-rounded kid. He didn't need football to get a scholarship 
-- he had great grades and SAT scores. And yet a lot of people agreed his 
senior year that he was the best high school offensive lineman in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 For 1991-92, Buckey was the winner of the Dial Award as the nation's top 
student-athlete. In fact, the night he returned from Washington, D.C., after 
receiving the award was the night of Walsh's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1992, he was runner-up to basketball star Jason Kidd in a 
state prep-athlete-of-the-year poll. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the son of a Bakersfield architect-contractor. His grandfather, Sheldon 
Harden, was the coach at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 In his NFL future, Buckey hopes to find time to try out for a U.S. Olympic 
team. He had the nation's best high school discus mark in his junior year, 210 
feet 1 inch. And he put the high school shot 64-8 3/4.  
</P>
<P>
 "I competed a little with the college discus last year and got it out to 177 
feet, but that's not close to where I'd need to be," Buckey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Buckey has developed steadily as a big-time college football standout. His 
offensive line coach, Monte Clark, says Buckey possesses a trait often found 
lacking in talented athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about Jeff is that he matches his great talent with great 
effort," Clark said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've coached a lot of talented linemen who never could do that. I've even 
coached players who thought they were playing their hardest, but who weren't. 
Jeff has very high performance standards for himself and he makes that extra 
effort to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be a very, very high draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved him from guard to tackle last spring, because the best thing he does 
is pass-block and we felt we'd need him most there." 
</P>
<P>
 And how. Because Stanford's running game is punchless through five games, 
Steve Stenstrom has thrown almost 200 passes. He has completed 67% of them, 
eight for touchdowns. But he's paying a price. Defensive units are teeing off 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh concedes that his quarterback is taking too much punishment, saying this 
week, "You look at the tapes, and you wonder how he gets through it." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is blaming No. 77, Stanford's right tackle.  
</P>
<P>
 And he won't blame anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Stenstrom has) taken more punishment than he should, and we're all guilty of 
that," Buckey said. "The problem is, we haven't established our run game yet 
and we're having to pass too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckey is one of two Pac-10 offensive linemen rated at the top by NFL scouts. 
The other is USC senior Tony Boselli. 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern lexicon of sports, the term complete package is often applied to 
athletes such as Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, asked about Buckey's future, seemed to grope for a moment, trying to 
find something that would retard Buckey's development, then gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no limitations," he said. "I just don't see anything he hasn't got."

FOUR SCHOOLS TO JOIN BIG WEST CONFERENCE; COLLEGES: BOISE STATE, IDAHO, CAL 
POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO AND NORTH TEXAS WOULD BE MEMBERS BY 1996-97 SCHOOL YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After enjoying nearly a decade of stability, the Big West Conference will 
undergo its fifth major change in four years with Thursday's announcement that 
Boise State, Idaho, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and North Texas will be added to 
the league for the 1996-97 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State, Idaho and San Luis Obispo officially accepted the invitation 
Thursday. North Texas will announce its intentions Monday, but the school 
issued a statement saying it was "extremely excited" about the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State will leave the Big West to join the 
Western Athletic Conference in 1996, the expansion will boost the Big West to 
12 members for men's basketball, which will necessitate a split into two, 
six-team divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Division will consist of Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine, Long 
Beach State, UC Santa Barbara, University of the Pacific and San Luis Obispo. 
The Eastern Division will consist of Idaho, Boise State, Nevada, Utah State, 
New Mexico State and North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Because San Luis Obispo plays football in Division I-AA's restricted 
scholarship American West Conference, it will not join the Big West in that 
sport, but Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell said he is looking at Central 
Florida or Northwestern Louisiana as a prospective football-only member, in 
hopes of creating a two-division conference with 12 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Louisiana, Louisiana Tech, Northern Illinois and Arkansas State 
are football-only members of the Big West, and will be joined in the conference 
by Nevada, New Mexico State, Pacific, Utah State, North Texas, Boise State and 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 That means there will be only one California school, Pacific, left playing 
football in the Big West, which as late as 1977 was made up exclusively of 
California schools. Fresno State jumped to the WAC in 1992, and San Jose will 
follow suit in 1996. Long Beach (1991) and Fullerton (1992) have dropped 
football.

NHL LABOR SITUATION; EUROPEANS STEER CLEAR OF PLAYER SIGNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 European clubs won't be allowed to sign locked-out NHL players and ignite a 
potential legal battle, said Rene Fasel, president of the International Ice 
Hockey Federation, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lockout lengthens -- 69 games have been wiped out in 13 days -- growing 
numbers of players have sought to play in Europe. Among them are Swedish-born 
Patrik Carnback of the Mighty Ducks, Peter Forsberg of the Quebec Nordiques and 
Mats Sundin of the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are looking at the International Hockey League, although that minor 
league has urged its clubs not to inflate its payrolls by signing NHL players. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fasel, players who say they have been denied employment in North 
America won't find it in Europe. "We will not let them play," Fasel told the 
Canadian Press. "We have a contract with the NHL (governing player transfers) 
and will abide by that contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McAllister, a spokesman for the NHL Players Assn., said his group hasn't 
fully examined the legal hurdles players would face in venturing to Europe or 
the IHL. He said the union would make its position clear next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL issued a memo prohibiting clubs from making trades, calling up players 
or sending players down after Saturday. It also said it will inform clubs of a 
ticket refund policy by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and NHLPA head Bob Goodenow had no contact 
Thursday and no negotiations are scheduled. However, Brian Burke, the NHL's 
vice president and director of operations, said the league will ask for a 
resumption of talks next week. They last spoke Tuesday, when Bettman rejected a 
proposal by Goodenow and refused to allow the season to start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke also said a full season could be played if a collective bargaining 
agreement is in place by Nov. 1, but the slow pace and antagonistic tone of 
recent talks make it unlikely. The league has yet to officially cancel games, 
and spokesman Arthur Pincus said no cancellation announcement is scheduled.

LAKERS' REPORT; FORGET THE SIGHTS, HARRIS LIKES WHAT HE SEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Harris has seen some of what he wanted to in his visit to the vacation 
paradise of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii is obviously a bus, a gym and a hotel," the Laker coach said. "I 
thought it was palm trees and huge waves and girls in grass skirts. I haven't 
seen any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 What he has seen is a successful running game. He had been noncommittal about 
the Lakers' signature offense before coming to Honolulu, but after a week of 
training camp, he has seen enough speed, with the addition of newcomers Cedric 
Ceballos and Eddie Jones, enough smart play at point guard by an improved Nick 
Van Exel and enough defense to agree to go full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here looking to see if it would work," Harris said. "We wanted to run, 
but there has to be a willingness among players and a reaction when the ball 
changes. The guys have shown a willingness to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to run every chance we get, I'll say that. Certainly at home. On 
the road, I may like to slow it down a bit to take the crowds out of the game. 
You don't want to get in an up-and-down style in some places." 
</P>
<P>
 The next stage, and perhaps the most important, is exhibition play, so the 
Lakers can get a gauge on their rebounding, another key to a running game. That 
starts in Honolulu tonight, with the first of consecutive meetings with the 
Sacramento Kings at Blaisdell Center. 
</P>

 Things are suddenly looking uncluttered at shooting guard, where Doug Christie 
is gone after being traded to the New York Knicks and Sedale Threatt is 
practically gone after spending most of his time the past week at point guard, 
where he is now projected as a backup to Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an ideal third guard," Harris said of Threatt. "At this point, I see the 
move to point guard because he can do that and he has experience there and we 
have so many off guards that we need him more to play point guard." 
</P>
<P>
 That creates competition at shooting guard among Anthony Peeler, Eddie Jones 
and Tony Smith, with Peeler and Jones the probable finalists for the starting 
job. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

 Former Taft High catcher Kevin Kennedy, fired Wednesday as manager of the 
Texas Rangers, interviewed Thursday for the manager's job of the Boston Red 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin has excellent baseball credentials and he received extraordinary 
training," Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox, who fired manager Butch Hobson on Sept. 20, said they will 
continue to interview managerial candidates, although no other names were 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, 40, was dismissed after finishing the abbreviated season with a 52-62 
record, first in the AL West.  
</P>
<P>
 He was 138-138 in two seasons with Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, he held various coaching jobs in the Los Angeles Dodger and 
Montreal Expo organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, who played three seasons at San Diego State and eight years in the 
minor leagues, was the fourth manager to be fired since the players went on 
strike Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers had lost six in a row before the strike, and their lead over 
Oakland had been cut to one game.

FIVE OF A KIND; MCKEON BROTHERS AND THEIR OFFSPRING ARE REGION'S FIRST FAMILY 
OF FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fresh air and open spaces awaited the five sons of Howard and Phyllis McKeon 
when the family left Tujunga 31 years ago to open a small Western wear retail 
store in the greener pastures of Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than roam, the McKeon Five rooted and multiplied. Today, the 
numbers would stagger a steer. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and Phil's Western Wear boasts 55 stores, enough to support Buck, Joe, 
John, Tim, Monte and their sizable families in grand fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The McKeon Five have 36 children among them, enough to support the football 
programs at Canyon and Hart highs in grand fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The ties that bind this clan are as clear as an autumn afternoon in Santa 
Clarita: business, the Church of Latter-day Saints and football. The McKeons 
play, pray and make a bundle together. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McKeon, a junior quarterback, will lead Hart against Canyon tonight in a 
Foothill League opener. Steve's four older brothers also played at Hart, a 
tradition that might not end until sometime in the next century: Steve has 
brothers ages 3 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve's father, Joe, 54, has nine children, the only McKeons who have or will 
attend Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 The six children of Buck, 56, the eight children of John, 48, the four 
children of Tim, 46, and the nine children of Monte, 44, have been or 
presumably will be Canyon Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeons, however, root for McKeons first and foremost. So expect Steve to get 
some boot-stomping cheers tonight from a select group of former Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us will pull for Steve in the sense that this is a family deal," said 
Tim, whose youngest son, Monte, is the tailback on the Canyon sophomore team. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim's other three sons were starting players at Canyon and he was president of 
the team's booster club for five years. His wife, Jan, and Joe's first wife, 
Connie, are sisters, making Steve and his older brothers double cousins of 
Tim's children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tease me a lot," Steve said of his cousins. "They say, 'Oh yeah, that 
kid on the other side of the valley,' like I'm an outcast. It's all in fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most memorable Canyon-Hart game for the McKeons came in 1990 when 
Joey, Tim's second son, intercepted a Hart pass late in the fourth quarter to 
preserve Canyon's 14-7 victory. Dan, Joe's fourth son, was Hart's middle 
linebacker. Dan and Joe also played in Hart's 30-12 victory in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other time McKeon cousins faced off in a varsity game was in 1982. 
Hart, with Buck's oldest son Howard at linebacker, defeated Canyon, with Joe's 
second son Tim at linebacker, 22-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The McKeons meet often enough off the field. All live on or near Ravenhill 
Road in Canyon Country, an exclusive enclave of ranch-style homes near the 
junction of Sand Canyon and Placerita Canyon roads, a half-mile from the Mormon 
church they attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can go into my back yard and hit anybody's house but Joe's with a rock. I'd 
have to have a better arm to hit his," Tim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and Phyllis, both deceased, bought 12 acres 20 years ago and subdivided 
it into six parcels, one for themselves and one for each of their sons. Joe 
sold his and built a home in Valencia, but after his divorce from Connie in 
1980, he remarried and moved back to within a block of Ravenhill Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The McKeon Five also make the same drive to work, arriving each morning at the 
corporate offices in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful thing," Joe said. "At home or at the office, I walk next 
door and there is my brother. Next to him is another brother and next to him is 
another brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe's office is a shrine to Hart football. He has served as an assistant coach 
at the school since 1983, and his walls are lined with photographs of his sons 
wearing the Red and Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim's office is similarly adorned with the Green and Gold of Canyon. Every 
team photo since his oldest son Rick was an all-league tackle in 1987 hangs 
neatly on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides football memorabilia, Buck's involvement in politics -- he was Santa 
Clarita's first mayor and is a Republican congressman -- is evident in his 
office decor. John's passion for raising Arabian horses is evident in his. 
Monte's children competed in baseball and tennis as well as football at Canyon, 
and the photos on his office walls reflect all three sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the board room is there no sign of football. Instead, portraits of 
each son who has completed his two-year mission for the Mormon Church are 
displayed. The steps toward manhood are unmistakable for a McKeon: The Eagle 
Scouts, high school sports and a mission must precede a place in the family 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the third generation has anything locked up, although they all will 
have an opportunity," Tim said of being added to the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the family's girls, only John's daughter Heather, 21, has been on a 
church mission; she is currently serving it in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been, if you don't get married you ought to think about a 
mission," said John, who has two daughters older and two younger than Heather 
in addition to three sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather's portrait eventually will make the board-room wall. But one of her 
cousins, Joey, 21, will get there first. The former all-league defensive back 
at Canyon returned Thursday from his mission in Florida. About 50 family 
members and close friends greeted him at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this is a big deal," said Jan McKeon, Joey's mother. "And 
he'll be here just in time for the Hart-Canyon game." 
</P>
<P>
 The commitment to church missions has kept all McKeons but one from playing 
college football. And his career was cut short. 
</P>
<P>
 Following an All-Southern Section career as a Hart linebacker and offensive 
tackle, Tim, 27, played one season at Utah State and another at Cal State 
Fullerton. He then embarked on a mission in Paraguay before returning to Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of his generation of McKeons, Tim lives near his parents with his wife 
and two children and works as a sales representative for a boot and hat 
manufacturer. He sells exclusively to Howard and Phil's, the state's largest 
Western wear retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 A hint of the business's success: Buck's financial disclosure statements 
reveal that he was paid $329,000 in 1993, yet he has taken little active role 
in the western wear's operations since being elected to Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 His brothers run the show now. Joe is president, John is in charge of 
corporate development and management training, Tim is the controller and Monte 
is responsible for merchandise and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 About once a month Buck returns to join his brothers in the board room for 
what they call a family council. Anything is open for discussion, and these 
meetings are central to their remarkably harmonious relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all heard horror stories about how family businesses don't work, but 
all I can relate to is ours," said Tim, who pointed out that his father was in 
business with his own four brothers before opening his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all strong-minded people, but we handle differences of opinion by 
communicating," he said. "Everything is done pretty much on a consensus basis. 
If one brother feels really strongly about something, he has to sell 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Football has been an easy sell since Buck's oldest son, Howard, suited up for 
Canyon in the early 1980s. His brothers and cousins followed him into the 
huddle, his uncle Joe began coaching, and the sport became a steadfast 
tradition in a tradition-bound family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what we all talk about when we get together," said Jack McKeon, Joe's 
25-year-old son who was an all-league linebacker and tackle at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they been taller -- no one in the family is over 6-feet -- the McKeon Five 
might have formed a basketball team growing up in Tujunga. Howard, the 
patriarch, played basketball at Garfield High in the 1930s, and Buck, whose 
given name is Howard, played basketball at Verdugo Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe was the first to put on the pads, playing defensive back for Verdugo 
Hills, but John played only one year of football because of asthma problems. 
Tim played fullback and defensive end, but Monte, who also suffered from severe 
asthma, chose baseball and golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody played sports but there was no special leaning toward football," 
Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sons are downright bent on football, although tennis is also a family 
favorite. All three of Monte's teen-age sons and his daughter Katie, 20, played 
or play tennis at Canyon as did John's daughter Heather, 21, and son Scott, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have played baseball and golf or run track. Two of Buck's daughters and 
two of John's daughters were Canyon cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 When the family gathers for holidays, however, it is footballs that fly around 
the back yard. The days of the McKeon Five taking on all of their sons may be 
flickering memories, but the games continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the married McKeons of the next generation take on their younger brothers 
and cousins, such as Steve, the Hart quarterback; Monte, the Canyon tailback; 
John's son Jason, 13, and Monte's son, Johnny, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all competitive and physical," said Tim, Joe's 27-year-old son. "We 
love being together, and when we get together, football is the first thing that 
comes to mind." McKeon Family Tree

REFERENDUM TO RAISE STUDENT FEES COULD DECIDE FATE OF CSUN ATHLETICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Rowell, who has experience in this sort of thing, sends his regards to Cal 
State Northridge. Maybe he should send a rabbit's foot instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowell, an assistant athletic director at rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
recently weathered a campus election in which funding was the political 
football. Students approved a substantial fee increase to support athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge on Tuesday and Wednesday is conducting a similar election that 
could chart the school's athletic course well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it passes," Rowell said. "It sure helped us." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge students will be asked to vote on a referendum that, if passed, 
would increase fees from $4 to $49 per semester or $98 annually. If the 
proposition fails, Northridge, after five seasons in NCAA Division I, might be 
forced to eliminates several men's programs and revert to Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge athletic department anticipates the loss in 1995-96 of roughly 
$700,000 from a budget that this year stands at $3.6 million. The football team 
faces elimination and scholarships will be lost in many sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum would leave Northridge students with an annual registration fee 
of roughly $2,014, which would rank third on the 1994-95 list of the 20 schools 
in the Cal State University system. Cal State San Marcos, the newest school in 
the chain, is the least expensive at $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet comparing athletic budgets and sources of revenue can be a tricky 
proposition. Dollars and cents at one campus are apples and oranges at another. 
Schools might share CSU membership, but each has a different way of paying for 
sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that you don't have a measure of is that Northridge is one of the 
newer institutions (in Division I)," said Bob Hiegert, Northridge's athletic 
director. "San Diego State, Fresno and others have played at that level for 
some time and have facilities and support groups in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing catch-up." 
</P>
<P>
 The catch for students, of course, is the price tag. CSU students subsidize 
athletics through membership fees paid to the Associated Students or a program 
called Instructionally Related Activities, which funds dozens of 
extracurricular programs from student registration fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar totals can vary significantly in each category. Students at three CSU 
schools pay $10 annually to IRA; the fee at another is $200. Athletic programs 
often receive a percentage of the pie from each account. 
</P>
<P>
 CSU schools augment their athletic budgets through a variety of formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * CS Northridge ($3.6 million budget): Northridge has the sixth-highest 
registration total in the system at $1,916 annually, which includes $96 in 
combined IRA ($30) and Associated Students ($66) fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The average charged to CSU students in 1994-95 is $42 in IRA and $49 from 
Associated Students, or $91 combined. 
</P>
<P>
 If the referendum passes, combined AS and IRA fees at Northridge will increase 
from $96 to $194 per student. Admission to athletics events would remain free 
to students. 
</P>
<P>
 The current annual cut for Northridge athletics is $8 per student from AS and 
$17 from IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal Poly SLO ($4 million budget): The Mustangs are in the third of a 
four-year plan in which IRA fees are being raised incrementally to fund sports. 
This year the IRA fee has been raised to $135, the second-highest total in the 
CSU. The total Associated Students charge annually is $50 per student for a 
total of $185, also the second-highest in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Each quarter, the AS chips in $4 and IRA adds $43 per student to athletics. 
There is no admission charge at athletic events for students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresno State ($10.8 million budget): Perhaps the most-successful program in 
the CSU, Bulldog athletics have received no money this year from the Associated 
Students or IRA coffers. Students pay $52 in combined IRA and AS fees annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Students stopped funding athletics in 1981. Students 
nonetheless pay for athletics through other means. At Fresno, though, it's more 
of a user-fee process. 
</P>
<P>
 Students must purchase a $90 season pass for the 1994-95 men's basketball 
season. Student tickets to individual games in basketball are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Student tickets for this week's home football game against Wyoming are $9. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego State ($9.75 million): The second-most prominent athletic program 
in the CSU receives no money from the Associated Students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztec athletic department gets $17 annually per student in IRA fees. 
Students pay $60 in combined IRA and AS fees and are admitted free to athletic 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long Beach State ($4.2 million): Last spring, Long Beach students passed a 
referendum increasing IRA charges from $25 annually to $50. It takes effect in 
1995-96 and will raise combined IRA and AS fees to $84 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics received $15 per student in IRA fees this year and nothing from AS 
fees. Admission for students to athletic events is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sonoma State ($1.1 million): Last spring, students at the non-scholarship 
Division II school passed a referendum in which yearly IRA fees were hiked to 
$200 per student, well above the CSU average of $42. Athletics receives $150 
per student. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the largest IRA increase in CSU history. However, Sonoma State does not 
receive funding from the Associated Students. Admission for students is free. 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise here: As a result of the IRA charge, Sonoma State's registration 
fee of $2,070 -- which includes $274 in combined IRA and AS fees -- for 1994-95 
is the highest in the CSU. 
</P>
<P>
 * CS Sacramento ($2.5 million): Sacramento, which plays in the same conference 
with Northridge in many sports, receives $5.50 per student annually from IRA 
and $5 from Associated Students. 
</P>
<P>
 Students pay $96 in combined IRA and AS fees, and student admission to 
athletic events is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * CS Dominguez Hills ($750,000): The Dominguez Hills athletics department, 
which competes in Division II and does not field a football team, receives $9 
annually per student from the Associated Students and $5.50 in IRA fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined IRA and AS fees are $45 per student. Students are not charged for 
athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographics and geography play an indisputable role in the referendum 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1991, Cal Poly asked students to help bankroll a move from 
Division II to Division I. Turnout was the largest for any election in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a popular topic," Rowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 17,000 students enrolled at the time, 10,000 cast votes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passed by 400 votes," Rowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, with an enrollment of 24,000 that includes thousands of older 
students who commute to the school and do not attend games, doesn't anticipate 
the same response at the polls. A similar Northridge referendum in the spring 
lost by a 993-906 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge and Cal Poly are in the CSU and both play in the American West 
Conference. Beyond that, the schools are located on different planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that Northridge is in the same kind of situation," Rowell said. 
"They're a commuter school and our students generally live here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just a hunch, but Rowell figures the Northridge referendum has a good 
chance of passing. Maybe CSU schools aren't so different after all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletics is an important part of what we do (as schools)," Rowell said. "I 
think people there will realize that too." California State University Selected

 The madness is growing at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive year, the men's basketball team will begin its 
first practice of the season at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate Coach Philip Mathews started "Midnight Madness" at Ventura in 1991, 
drawing on his experience as an assistant coach at Cal State Fullerton. Only 50 
fans showed up, but attendance has increased each year since, including 300 in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,000 showed up last season on the heels of an appearance in the junior 
college state championship game. His team is coming off a second appearance in 
the state finals, and Mathews is hoping for 1,500 fans this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really for the community to come out to celebrate the opening of the 
season and for the kids to have some fun," Mathews said. "They're going to be 
ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates will stage a three-point and slam-dunk contest followed by an 
intrasquad scrimmage. Admission is free, and local businesses and restaurants 
have donated door prizes.  
</P>
<P>
 Mathews said practice will begin next week. Ventura opens the season Nov. 12 
at Imperial Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has played in the state championship game the last two seasons, 
finishing second both times.

CSUN, OTHERS BREAKING FAST; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MATADORS AND THEIR FANS GEAR 
FOR "MIDNIGHT MADNESS," A SPIRITED PRELUDE TO THE SEASON. 
</P>

 Midnight tonight. Inside the Cal State Northridge gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 One hour. Come one, come all. Be ready to cheer and clap. 
</P>
<P>
 These instructions brought to you by Northridge basketball Coach Pete Cassidy, 
who says, quite frankly, he can think of better things to do at midnight than 
run a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll do it anyway -- with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something the players want to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge, and dozens of other universities around the nation, the college 
basketball season will be ushered in tonight with a time-honored tradition 
appropriately named "Midnight Madness." 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA teams this year are not allowed to practice until Oct. 15. The idea, 
therefore, is not to waste any time getting started. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge, the band and cheerleaders will join the players in an attempt 
to drum up school spirit. Last year, about 400 fans showed. 
</P>
<P>
 What will they see? 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, for one, has only a sketchy idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not going to be much coaching going on," he said. "The guys are 
designing their own warm-ups since (coaches), by rules, haven't been able to 
meet or work with them. We can't even watch them." 
</P>
<P>
 Expect some sort of a slam-dunk show, followed by two 15-minute scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for show," Cassidy said of his team's first workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three o'clock Saturday -- that's for go." 
</P>
<P>
 At The Master's College, an NAIA Division II school, practice already is under 
way. Cal Lutheran, which competes as a member of the NCAA Division III Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Assn., is prohibited from organized 
practice until Oct. 24. The Kingsmen will hold their "Midnight Madness" on Oct. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, NCAA Division I teams such as Northridge could not practice until 
Nov. 1 -- a restriction Cassidy labeled "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 "The two (extra) weeks makes a considerable difference," said Cassidy, who is 
in his 24th season as Northridge's head coach. "It's time. You can't learn 
physical skills by cramming. It takes repetition." 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA rules stipulate weekly limitations of eight hours in the off-season and 
20 hours in-season for practice. The off-season hours are only for conditioning 
such as weightlifting and running -- without use of a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy sees the need for time restrictions but believes it is in the best 
interests of athletes and coaches to train year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often coaches aren't thought of as teachers," Cassidy said. "Kids come to 
school to learn -- so we, as educators, can teach them something." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, any extra training Cassidy had to offer would have come in 
handy. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Peter Micelli is the only full-time starter back for Northridge, which 
was 8-18 last season. Guards Ryan Martin and Robert Hill, swingman Shawn Stone, 
forward Tom Samson and center Shane O'Doherty are other players who were given 
substantial playing time last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Trenton Cross, a freshman from Reseda High, is expected to challenge 
Hill at point guard. Forwards Eric Gray and Mike Dorsey, both junior college 
transfers, and swingman Ruben Oronoz, who redshirted last season, are other top 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will play exhibition games at home Nov. 19 and Nov. 22 before 
opening against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion on Nov. 26.

HART QUARTERBACK'S PREPARATION FOR BIG GAME BEGAN YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is the McKeon of the moment, the youngest of five brothers who starred on 
the Hart High football team. Eight older cousins played at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet family tradition goes only so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to have a different experience than my brothers," Steve McKeon said 
matter-of-factly of facing archrival Canyon tonight. "They all lost to Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 He is the Hart quarterback of the moment, having studied Tom and Jim Bonds, 
Darren Renfro, Ryan Connors, Mike Kocicka et al. from the time he was the 
school's ball boy at the age of 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a sponge," he said. "Being around the program helped out a lot. Hart 
has a winning tradition, a frame of mind that we win more than we lose." 
</P>
<P>
 For a 5-foot-8, 150-pound junior, he has a lot to live up to. But McKeon, if 
not born ready, became well-prepared shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Joe, was an assistant coach at Hart for 12 years, and was Steve's 
freshman coach. Just add up the hours spent with his brothers and cousins. 
McKeon learned football on the field, at large family gatherings, during quiet 
dinners at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad and brothers talk, and basically I just listen, just take it in," he 
said. "When they get a fact wrong, I correct them. That's about the only time I 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
 And when he speaks, McKeon, 16, tells it like it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stevie's got his head on straight," said Tim McKeon, his uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve's father and four uncles, who own and operate a chain of Western wear 
stores, point to a single peculiarity about the family's only quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of his brothers and cousins, he doesn't seem the least bit 
interested in joining the family business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of funny about one thing," his father said, "Stevie wants to become 
a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 In Steve's mind, college football isn't even an option. Institutions of higher 
learning are for just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is a phase of life where you have fun, get something out of it at 
the time, then proceed to the next step and go to college," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's current phase has been fun, indeed. Hart has won all five of its 
games and he has completed 51 of 83 passes for 944 yards and nine touchdowns. 
He also has rushed for four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are tempted to underestimate the ability of the diminutive McKeon. 
Before Canyon players make that mistake, they ought to chat with Rick McKeon, 
Steve's cousin and a former Canyon all-league tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 At a church picnic on Memorial Day, Rick was rushing Steve during a pick-up 
football game. Not seeing Rick, Steve whirled and threw a pass that struck his 
cousin square in the face, shattering his eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a while you hear that Steve's arm isn't that great, but Rick will 
vouch for his arm strength," said Tim McKeon, Rick's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who knows Steve will vouch for his inner strength. Leading Hart against 
Canyon has been McKeon's destiny. He is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a choice about whether to play football, but I didn't need a 
choice," he said. "This is what I want."

NOTRE DAME TACKLE STILL HOSPITALIZED; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: FORLANO'S CONDITION 
TWO DAYS AFTER BRAIN SURGERY HAS DOCTORS PUZZLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior lineman Peter Forlano of Notre Dame High, who underwent brain surgery 
Tuesday for a mysterious ailment, remains hospitalized in serious condition as 
doctors continue to struggle to find a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano was admitted to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank on Friday night 
after complaining of dizziness, numbness of the right leg and blurred vision, 
his mother Alice said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, doctors relieved pressure from the left side of Forlano's brain 
and conducted a series of tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors believe Forlano's condition might be the result of a severe sinus 
infection but no diagnosis has been made, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano also has had difficulty speaking and is heavily medicated. He had 
experienced a loss of movement in his right leg but had regained some mobility 
by Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really bizarre," Alice Forlano said. "They thought maybe it was a virus 
at first. They don't know if it was an injury or what. It's affecting the right 
side of his body." 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano, a 6-foot, 205-pound starting right tackle, is in the hospital's 
critical care unit. A hospital spokesman declined comment because Forlano, 17, 
is a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano left school Friday afternoon before practice. He had not complained of 
any football-related injuries, Coach Kevin Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he felt awful and that he hadn't been able to sleep for the past few 
days," Rooney said. "Everyone is worried about it. It's tough because no one 
really knows what's going on. Everybody is concerned and chomping at the bit to 
go and see him and cheer him up. But we can't do that until he is out of 
(critical) care." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Forlano said her son began having memory lapses Thursday night after 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd be on the phone and he couldn't remember who he was talking to," she 
said.

BIG WEST ANNOUNCES ANOTHER EXPANSION; COLLEGE SPORTS: BOISE STATE, IDAHO AND 
CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO ACCEPT INVITATIONS TO JOIN CONFERENCE. NORTH TEXAS TO 
ANNOUNCE ITS DECISION ON MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly a decade of stability, the Big West Conference will undergo its 
fifth major change in four years with Thursday's announcement that Boise State, 
Idaho, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and North Texas will be added to the league for 
the 1996-97 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State, Idaho and San Luis Obispo officially accepted the invitation 
Thursday. North Texas will announce its intentions Monday, but the school 
issued a statement saying it was "extremely excited" about the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State will leave the Big West to join the 
Western Athletic Conference in 1996, the expansion will boost the Big West to 
12 members for men's basketball, which will necessitate a split into two, 
six-team divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Division will consist of Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine, Long 
Beach State, UC Santa Barbara, Pacific and San Luis Obispo. The Eastern 
Division will consist of Idaho, Boise State, Nevada, Utah State, New Mexico 
State and North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven schools will play football -- San Luis Obispo, which plays in the 
Division I-AA, restricted scholarship American West Conference, will not join 
the Big West in that sport -- but Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell said he 
is looking at Central Florida or Northwestern Louisiana as a prospective 
football-only member, in hopes of creating a two-division conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Louisiana, Louisiana Tech, Northern Illinois and Arkansas State 
are football-only members of the Big West, and will be joined in the conference 
by Nevada, New Mexico State, Pacific, Utah State, North Texas, Boise State and 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 That means there will be only one California school -- Pacific -- left playing 
football in the Big West , which as recently as 1977 consisted of only 
California schools. Fresno State jumped to the WAC in 1992, San Jose will 
follow suit in 1996, and Long Beach (1991) and Fullerton (1992) have dropped 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Farrell said the expansion will improve the overall health of the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are four programs on the move upward, and as they advance, we feel 
they'll bring strength to the conference," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State and Idaho will make the jump to Division I-A football from the 
I-AA Big Sky Conference. North Texas will make a similar move from the I-AA 
Southland Conference, and San Luis Obispo will move up from the Division II 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State has averaged more than 19,000 in home attendance for football 
games in 22,600-seat Bronco Stadium over the last four years, and the school's 
12,200-seat basketball arena will be the second largest in the conference, 
behind New Mexico State, in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Boise State also means that former Fullerton men's basketball 
Coach Bobby Dye, who led the Titans to the NCAA tournament quarterfinals in 
1978, and former Irvine men's tennis Coach Greg Patton, will be making regular 
return trips to Orange County. Both are coaching at Boise State.

FORMER UCI PLAYER BEERS FILES SUIT AGAINST SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elizabeth Beers, a former basketball player at UC Irvine, filed suit Wednesday 
in Orange County Superior Court alleging the university medical staff 
misdiagnosed a back injury suffered during a game against Long Beach State on 
Feb. 23, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that trainer Loreen Koshi, who is no longer at the school, 
diagnosed the injury as a sprain -- despite swelling and numbness radiating 
down Beers' legs -- without the aid of a physician's examination.Beers was 
cleared nine days later to play in a game during which the injury was allegedly 
aggravated, eventually leading to spinal fusion surgery last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of ongoing medical treatment, a dollar figure has not been attached to 
the suit, according to attorney J. David Mazurek. Beers also is seeking damages 
because her scholarship was revoked this year, which the suit alleges violated 
a verbal agreement with the school. She received a reduced scholarship for the 
1993-94 academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Athletic Director Dan Guererro said Thursday that he had not seen the 
suit and could not comment on pending litigation. JOHN WEYLER

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: WATSON, NBC PLAY PRESSURE SHOTS THAT GOLF DOESN'T 
NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the golf world turns:  
</P>
<P>
 The very week we learned that a letter from Tom Watson played a role in 
getting CBS' Gary McCord bumped off the Masters comes word from NBC that Dick 
Enberg will replace Jim Lampley in the 18th-hole tower next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was made Thursday in a conference call with reporters, and 
one of the questions directed at Tommy Roy, NBC's executive producer of sports 
and coordinating producer of golf, was whether Watson had approved the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and Enberg laughed, but neither commented. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the deal with Watson? 
</P>
<P>
 The letter he sent to CBS golf producer Frank Chirkinian and Masters chairman 
Jackson Stephens complaining about McCord, circulated among fellow golf pros, 
was printed in the November issue of Golf Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter ends: "(McCord) is the Howard Stern of TV golf and you (Chirkinian) 
should be ashamed, rather than champion his 'irreverent' behavior. Get rid of 
him, now." 
</P>
<P>
 If McCord is the Howard Stern of golf, then Watson has suddenly become the 
Howard Cosell, an infamous back-stabber. 
</P>
<P>
 The really sad part is that Stephens acted on Watson's letter. He got CBS, 
over Chirkinian's protests, to take McCord off next year's Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Golf World magazine had reported that Enberg might replace Lampley, 
Enberg said he is as surprised as anyone about his new assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 A non-golfer, Enberg said his role will be to personalize and humanize the 
game and that he will leave the analysis to partner Johnny Miller and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The others will include Lampley, who will become one of NBC's course 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second major demotion this year for Lampley, who was replaced on 
"NFL Live" by Greg Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease Lampley, NBC gave him a new contract, which, among other things, 
makes him the late-night host for the 1996 Summer Olympics at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy explained the change by saying, "I look at this as if I were a head coach 
and wanted to get both players on the field at the same time. This is not a 
demotion for Jim, it is a change of roles. I wouldn't try to read too much into 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there have been rumors that the U.S. Golf Assn., which recently 
awarded the U.S. Open to NBC, was not happy with Lampley and preferred Enberg. 
</P>
<P>
 So this could be a Gary McCord situation all over again, with the 
rights-holder telling the network what announcers are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Enberg: "My golfing friends say what irritates them the most is an 
announcer who talks too much. I'll certainly try not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lampley isn't exactly known for succinctness. The USGA might prefer a Pat 
Summerall type, but it shouldn't have a say in who announces any of its events, 
if indeed that was the case here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enberg said the new assignment will mean only that he will have to give up his 
role as an NBA play-by-play announcer during the regular season. He will be 
able to keep everything else, and also work NBA playoff games. Gumbel and Tom 
Hammond will fill the void during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he has ever played golf, Enberg said he tried it in his younger 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have the temperament for it," he said. "People who know me would be 
surprised at how I acted on the golf course. I think I still own the record of 
158 feet for longest nine-iron throw at Balboa Golf Course in the San Fernando 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Add golf: Because of football, we're in the middle of a six-week lull of major 
golf. The last major competition was the Presidents Cup on CBS on Sept. 17-18, 
and the next will be the Tour Championship on ABC at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 But NBC this weekend offers a made-for-TV golf event, the Skills Challenge, 
which was taped in Phoenix on Monday. It will be on Saturday after BYU-Notre 
Dame football and on Sunday after the Raiders-Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the field is Chi Chi Rodriguez, who turns out to be the star of 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been quite a week for Rodriguez. On Monday, the Hilton Corp. gave him a 
lifetime achievement award and Wednesday he was named grand marshal of the 
Tournament of Roses parade. TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Because ABC last summer locked in USC-Stanford for the West Coast, scheduling 
it to follow the Penn State-Michigan national telecast, the Prime Network ends 
up with possibly the Pacific 10's game of the year -- Arizona at Washington 
State. The two games will be going almost head to head. Arizona-Washington 
State begins at 3:30 p.m. on Prime Ticket, USC-Stanford at 4 on Channel 7. . . 
There will be eight live college football telecasts on Saturday and, yes, one 
Sunday -- Texas at Rice on ESPN at 5 p.m. Because the baseball playoffs were 
supposed to be taking place this weekend, the NFL did not schedule a Sunday 
night game. That's why the Cleveland Browns and Houston Oilers played Thursday 
night on TNT. ESPN, looking to fill the Sunday void, got Texas and Rice to move 
their game to Sunday. . . . ABC offers some attractive morning games on 
pay-per-view, highlighted by No. 1 Florida playing host to No. 9 Auburn. That 
game will also be carried on radio by XTRA, thanks to Malibu-based syndicator 
Radio Sports Creations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey, anyone? For those suffering without NHL hockey and needing a fix, ESPN 
will televise Game 7 of last season's Stanley Cup finals between the New York 
Rangers and Vancouver Canucks today at 4:30 p.m. . . . Beginning Monday, Prime 
Ticket will televise all but four of the Kings' playoff games from two years 
ago, when they made it to the finals. The four games Prime Ticket won't carry 
are four that were televised by ABC. Prime Ticket will use the games to fill in 
where King or Mighty Duck telecasts had been scheduled. . . . Prime Ticket 
offers a live baseball telecast Wednesday at 7 p.m. -- the Scottsdale 
Scorpions, featuring Michael Jordan, against the Sun Cities Solar Sox in an 
Arizona Fall League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings game: The NFL is enjoying the benefits of no baseball or hockey. After 
six weeks, NBC is up 22%, from 9.5 at this point last year to 11.6, and holds 
an advantage over the NFC for the first time in 15 years. Fox's average rating 
for the NFC package is 11.3, the same as CBS had at this point last year. ABC 
is up from 17.6 to 17.8, its highest rating after six weeks since 1986. TNT's 
average rating is up 16% from 7.6 to 8.8. . . . Fox is beating NBC in the 
battle of the pregame shows. The Fox show is averaging a 4.4, with the second 
half-hour averaging a 5.1. NBC's half-hour show is averaging a 3.7. CBS' "NFL 
Today" had an average rating of 4.6 after six weeks last year. . . . Last 
Sunday, the Raider-New England game on Channel 4 got an L.A. rating of 18.7, 
the Rams-Green Bay on Fox got a 10.8. The early game on NBC, Miami vs. Buffalo, 
got an 8.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Although KMPC has remained ranked 31st among L.A. radio stations despite a
